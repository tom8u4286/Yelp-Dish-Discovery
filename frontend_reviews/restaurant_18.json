            "there's an authentic ramen place in las vegas! i was really impressed with monta noodle house. their menu is very simple and short. i tried the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> and it was delicious! all this pork fatty goodness in the broth and the noodles were perfectly cooked not too soggy not too hard. you can add an egg, pork, corn, more noodles or <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> for a couple more bucks. it's a small place which only fits about 26 people max, but it definitely is the best place for ramen. the broth is not from a package and i think this is what makes it oh so delicious. we added eggs to ours, but i wasn't that huge of a fan. the egg was too \"raw\" for me, but the bf loved it.  the bf also ordered the <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> bowl, which is rice with cod roe. i didn't try it, but he liked it and the eggs are a lil more fishy than masago. definitely coming back for more and be prepared to be a lil sweaty when you eat!", 
            "dropped by today after googling ramen in las vegas and eventually found this new ramen-ya on spring mountain (it is in the same plaza as raku).  read the raving positive reviews posted on google and also by rod m., and i decided that i will resume my thus far unsuccessful search for a decent or better ramen place in las vegas.\n\nafter driving in the still very warm heat to the restaurant, i saw about 6 asians standing or sitting outside the restaurant.  i was thinking, damn word sure got out fast for these vegas yelpers, but it turns out that they weren't waiting for this particular eatery.\n\nanyway, i went in and immediately saw that it is a very cozy and nicely decorated (i would describe it as very modern japanese minimalist) restaurant with seating for 18 at the tables, and another 10 at the bar.  there is a small board hanging on the wall, on the right as you enter the restaurant, listing a few specials items not on their very simple menu (see the photo that i have uploaded).\n\ni decided to order their tonkotsu \"pork bone\" ramen and add a side of nitamago (hard boiled egg seasoned with soyu).  the ramen was prepared in a very clean and small kitchen, which you can clearly see if you are seated at the bar.  the ramen was served in an average size bowl, not small but definitely not large and probably just right for most people.  the broth was piping hot, the noodle cooked just right, and garnished with a small mound of <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> and two thin slices of their melt in your mouth chashu. i first tried the broth, which has a good depth of pork flavor and not too salty or greasy or water down like at some of the other local ramen places that i have tried on the east side of town.  the noodle was the thin variety, which is not my preference, but it was cooked just right.  overall, it was a good bowl of ramen and definitely the best i have had in las vegas. but to jeff and my other ramen connoisseur friends, it is not as good as the really awesome and highly regarded ramen served at santouka ramen (torrance, california) or santa ramen (san mateo, ca), but still worth a try when you guys are in town.\n\ni also ordered a <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> bowl, which was served with a decent amount of rice.  mentaiko rice bowl is nothing special, and not difficult to prepared, but it was delicious because it was made with fresh and quality ingredients.\n\nthe staff were very friendly and the waitress, megumi, was very attentive.  it wasn't busy at the time of my visit (just one other customer who was already there before i arrived), but i can see that this place starts to get more crowded as word spread of their good quality soupy goodness for a reasonable price.\n\n<mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> $6.95\n+ nitamago           $1.50\n<mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> bowl  $2.95\n\nto the owner(s):  i recommend that you consider adding chicken karaage to the menu or as a special.", 
            "the skinny: pretty good hakata styled ramen (2.75), efficient service (3), value - really good... only $6.95 for a good ramen pick-me-up (4).\n\ntried this place because my hubby needed a big bowl of warm japanese love after working all day and because of the yelp reviews. we were super excited to see that this place specializes in hakata-style pork broth ramen.\n\nhmmm... well... so far, it's one of the best bowl of ramen we've had in vegas (but that doesn't necessarily say much). there is certainly a good amount of porky flavour in the broth... but not enough to make it really stand up  on its own (ie, make me want to drink the whole bowl and wonder if i can ask for more).  also, there is a hint of the distinctive earthy shitake mushroom which does take away from the flavour of the pork.\n\nthe noodles are classic <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> noodles but they lacked the nice chew of others we've tried. the chashu was okay - a little on the fatty side, mildly tough but great flavour.\n\noverall, it's not bad, it's closer than la (which has some really great ramen establishments), and pretty good value for your money.", 
            "finally.  a shop in las vegas specializing in japanese ramen and monta does it quite well.  \n\ngreat space, simple and clean with a counter overlooking the kitchen.\n\nthe menu is straightforward.. two types of ramen, <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> and <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>.  then there are a few extra topping options such as a flavored soft boiled egg, and cha-shu.  in addition, they have a few rice dishes like the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>, <mark>Chashu Bowl</mark> and a mentaiko bowl. \n\nthe <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> is really good.  the pork broth/soup has great flavor... dense, rich , almost creamy.  \"umai\" would be the japanese expression to describe this taste.  the \"men\"  (noodles) were thin, typical of this style of ramen.. but i would've liked them to be a bit more hard or al dente as the italians would call it.  the cha-shu was good too.  \n\nhope everyone is excited to welcome this great new ramen shop to this city as much as i am..", 
            "who reins supreme in ramen in vegas?  monta ramen!  i've been dreaming about a fantastic ramen-ya in vegas for years ever since trying greats like daikokuya in la.  finally, the time has come and we can have a legit ramen-ya in las vegas.\n\nthe place is in a small suite that is simply and tastefully decorated, and i think that is reflected in its menu where it is also simple.  they only concentrate on a ramen and a few side dishes.  to me, i think that is a sign of a great restaurant.\n\nbreaking it down =)\n1.  <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> - true to its description, the soup was hearty, full flavored porky fatty goodness!  the chashu was not for the fatty-faint of heart.  these fatty bad boys had a flavorful full fat ring around the slice.  i also think the takenoko (bamboo shoots) and kikurage (black fungus) added a nice contrast of crunch and earthy flavors.  i agree with other yelpers that the noodle is good, but i would prefer a more al dente touch.  regardless, i slurped up the entire bowl of noodles like a professional japanese business man.  the. entire. bowl.  slurp!\n2.  gyoza - nothing too fantastic.  i think half of them lacked the critical yummy juice factor because the skin had popped when frying them.\n\nconclusion:  bomb-tastic hole in the wall ramen-ya in vegas.  just based on ramen alone = 5 stars!", 
            "i'm new to the world of authentic ramen. ever since my cousin suggested i watch a silly little film called ramen girl, i've been wanting to give it a try. i thought i would have to go to nyc or la to get my ramen fix, so i was completely stoked when i heard about this place through a friend.\n\nfrom the existing reviews, it sounded like i needed to try the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>. i'm glad i did because it was absolutely delicious. the broth is amazing and all the ingredients worked together to provide a satisfying ramen experience. of course, i had to add egg because that's just my thing.\n\nmy cousin also ordered a mini <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>. the pieces of meat looked like bacon, but they were soft and tender. it's a delicious side dish that complemented the hot bowl of soup. i will definitely return.", 
            "thank you fellow yelper\"s for helping me find my new favorite ramen restaurant in las vegas monta noodle house. \n\nthe place is a hole in the wall place and has only been in business for a month now, but don't let that hold ya back! the place is clean with awesome service. \n\ni went with the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> that's the bomb! the soup is so tasty and pork is perfectly cooked. \n\nthe ramen is as good if not better then some of the ramen joints in so cal. i'll definitely be returning here in the future.", 
            "i went asap after reading mike c's review!  this is by far the best ramen i've had in vegas but this would maybe only be a 3 star place if it were located in japan. its certainly a 4+ star place in lv.  \n\nwe both got the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> which was pretty good although more miso-y than i expected.  i got the extra chashu which was great and pretty different than other chashu i've had as it had more of a roasted taste.  the gyoza was just ok.  my wife (japanese) was disappointed w/ the quality of the noodles but we'll take what we can get outside of japan.  \n\nthis certainly beats the hell out of the prices of yokohama kaigenro and i am psyched its so close to my place.  \n\ni'm more of a <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> guy which is what i'll get next time.", 
            "still going here every week if not more often.\nthey finally have a sign up so they're a bit easier to spot.\nanyway, i'm glad everyone else is liking this place.  i don't know why the bad reviews on the gyoza, because it's right up my alley.  and yes, they do use different noodles for the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> versus the others.  the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> is hakata style, and is known for the very thin, very delicious noodles.  they cook theirs a little more here than they do in hakata, but it's still great.\nanyway, having tried the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>, i'd say give this one a shot too.  it's their tonkotsu soup with miso added to give it a rich nutty flavor that really sticks to your ribs.\ni also have to recommend the chahan (<mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>), it is super peppery and delicious.  just the way i remember it from my highschool days in japan.\na second note.  anything you don't like on your ramen, let them know.  i keep going with picky eaters (1 vegan, others just picky), and they've made a vegan kimchi chahan, as well as bowls of ramen with extra this, no that, whatever you ask for.\nas always, they're eager to please, and definitely worth seeing, so help monta stay busy, and maybe even expand.  i would love to see more of these guys.", 
            "before everyone gets carried away this started off as a strong 4 star review because i was stoked that we finally had decent ramen in vegas. that other place togoshi that closed down was not even remotely worth mentioning. i apologize but you people are really reaching. i'm not going to name drop, but there are great ramen-ya in california and new york as well as some not so good ones in the mix. \n\nmonta....i was willing to over look a few things. like the fact that it's 103 degrees outside at night and you have no working a/c. also the faint smell of sewage doesn't really get your appetite going as you walk through the door. let's serve a steaming hot bowl of ramen in the middle of the las vegas summer with no adequate ventilation except for some ceiling fans. \n\nlet's pretend i'm part asian even part japanese and i know something about food. yes the food is decent and the ramen, pork belly and boiled egg, noodles are decent. not the greatest but good enough that i would have returned. prices are reasonable until you start getting extras. our bill was $44.00 for the 2 of us. pretty respectable check average for a small establishment. \n\nthis is where i am not understanding how you could overlook simple customer service. i have reasonable expectations of decent food and decent service.... \n\nwhoever the arrogant f**k is that owns monta: \n\n1. this is not japan \n\n2. we live in the year 2010. \n\n3. there are not enough japanese here in las vegas a town dominated by the chinese, koreans, vietnamese and every other nationality that you can afford to lose business. \n\n4. treat your customers better. \n\n5. you might as well save some money and switch to walk-up counter service because that's about how useful your waitress was. \n\nit was not so much a lack of experience or lack of training issue, but more an arrogant i don't care it's not my job mentality and attitude. what? you don't think i saw this in japanese restaurants 20 years ago? even the chinese have changed mr. bakatari and deliver with much more friendly and caring service. is it that hard?? \n\ni ordered the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> with tamago, extra pork and extra noodles. they serve the extra noodles on the side in a bowl and later i find out why. yes yes yes i know broth is costly, labor intensive and time consuming to make. but if you order xtra noodles then the ration of broth to noodles should be proportional. it was not even close. i asked the waitress, miss personality very politely if i could have a little extra broth as i had a ton of extra noodles and no broth left. i'm not complaining, there wasn't that much broth to start with just enough for the regular order of noodles i was served. answer was \"no\". no big deal i will pay for extra broth just a tiny bit, whatever you guys want to charge....fat sumo kitchen lackey is like f'****n way and again \"no\" then a half ass sorry as she is walking away. \n\nhonestly this is such a joke i've been to restaurants in la and again ny that have the name and ability to be arrogant and pretentious yet the service is warm and hospitable. \n\nyou can go to naked fish, owned and operated by japanese, yet the service is outstanding.", 
            "after stumbling through various japanese restaurants that serve decent bowls of ramen, i've finally found a place that specializes at it. in fact, it's pretty much all they serve. their menu reminded me of an in-n-out menu: you either order a <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> or a <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>. if you don't want ramen, there's <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and some basic japanese apps. not much in terms of variety. but, if this is what you're in the mood for, they do it great.\n\ni started off with an order of gyoza for an app. simple stuff and what you'd expect. nothing to write home about. then, came the steamy bowl of <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>. the broth was a real winner here. a lot of places that i have tried never really got the broth quite right. this was one place where the flavor really hit the spot. even though it's a scorching 100+ degrees outside, a routine stop for a bowl of ramen here is worth having. next time i drop by, i will probably give their <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> a shot.\n\nmonta is a tiny, quaint little place, though not very crowded when i went. it started out empty when we walked in, but started filling up as we were slurping up our noodles. i wouldn't expect a wait for a table, but i could see it happening if this place picks up in popularity.", 
            "one saturday afternoon, i finally had a chance to try ramen @monta noodle house. right after i entered the noodle shop, all the employees were shouting loudly in japanese usual expression in turn: irasshaimase, irasshaimase! i felt so welcomed :p \n\nso, i decided to try the 'tonkotsu' with boiled egg since it was one of their special dishes & highly recommended by the server. she brought some of the minced garlic and pickled ginger with it.  without hesitation, i put a little bit of garlic in the soup just because i love garlic so much :)  i could totally taste of very rich and milky pork bone broth in my mouth. the noodle was very thin and straight. one of the toppings that really stands out was the sliced pork, the 'chashu'. it was very tender and soft. \noverall, i was happy with the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> but, i liked the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> with lots of bean sprouts @shuseki little better. if someone wants to try richness of the broth & the amount of oil they want, the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> is the one... \nnext time, i still want to try their kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> & cold(chilled) noodle(hiyashi-chuka). \n\non my way out, i heard, \" arigatoh gozaimashita!\" once again, they were thanking customers and i was pleased with the service @monta!!!", 
            "a quaint japanese noodle house packing big flavors best sums up monta. the place  is reminiscent to the noodle houses we frequent in torrance, ca and litte tokyo, offering a simple menu that doesn't detract patrons from the restaurant's main dish: ramens. we opted to try the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> (bean paste) and <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> (pork bone) with the addition of available toppings such as chasu (roasted pork -- not for the fat conscious eater), <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, and butter (yes, butter!). the third ramen offering, shoyu, is something we'll probably try on the next go. the noodles were chewy-soft and a bit firm which is how it should be, and with a flavor-rich broth that's a cross between creamy melted butter and meaty-savory -- a feat only possible with many hours of high heat infusion of the ingredients. on a hot summer day, the place suffers from the lack of a good a/c, but once you start chowing down your piping hot ramen, the warm ambience fades into obscurity. a definite must-try place that we're glad we stumbled upon!", 
            "allright, i went back for lunch today to monta. it was 3:45 in the afternoon, and it wasen't busy like last sunday. therefore, it wasen't as ungodly hot and stifling inside as it was last time.\n\ni ate the whole bowl of ramen again. i have begun to really grasp just what makes the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> so good. it's savory and not overly salty. in fact, it's un-ramen-like in that regard. (ok, i'll admit to normally eating a shoyu-based one many many times) the broth is actually a bit creamy (very addictive) and the stuff inside the bowl is tops.\n\ncan i tell you how much in love with the marinated boiled/almost soft egg in it, aka nitamago? it's so damn great! if you like hardboiled or softboiled egg, you'll love it i guarantee.\n\ni have to try the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and their gyoza. they smell very very good, but i have to have more people with me to get it all eaten! when the weather cools down, i'm going to be here lots!\n\nbtw, they have a very funky restroom!", 
            "i'm happy to finally see a decent ramen place in las vegas.\n\ni honestly did not miss the closure of togoshi as it seemed to have gone down hill over the years.\n\nit appears that all of the negative reviews have resulted form misguidance and/or ignorance of some reviewers in terms of their experience or knowledge on what a \"ramen-ya\" and thier customs are supposed to be.\n\ni would like to see monta try not to expand their soup varieties as most ramen-yas in japan are supposed to stick with one type of broth, and feel that their <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> is very well done especially with thin noodles.  their miso is good, but not my favorite type and would like to see it evove to thicker/denser/full-bodied miso toward more of a sapporo style. \n\nall in all, a great additon to vegas authentic japanese food scene.  those who can appreciate authentic japanese food with its somewhat peculiar cultures would love it, for the noobies it may be too difficult to appreciate.", 
            "after coming home from a trip to tokyo the first thing i craved was <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>.  i have been searching in las vegas ever since. the only thing that came close was in la, until now... the soup is amazing and fills my craving for something i have been unable to find in vegas!!   a must for everyone even the vibe is cool like tokyo!!!", 
            "i found this place in the vegas weekly magazine and knew i had to try it out after seeing great yelp reviews.\n\nwere my expectations met? yes! as soon as you walk in, you are immediately greeted by a very cute japanese girl worker and are seated right away. the restaurant is small, but very cozy. we ordered the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> with a boiled egg on the side and were very impressed at how delicious the bowl of soup was. although the bowl only comes with two thin slices of pork, the pork itself is very tender and is soaked in that delicious broth making you savor each bite! the broth is cloudy like it should be and wasn't too salty or too bland for my taste. what really impressed me was the poached egg. the article talked about how perfectly poached the eggs were there and boy was he right! the egg was not too runny nor too cooked. the combination of the runny yolk and broth tasted like heaven in my mouth! \n\noverall, the food and service were excellent. it was also a very authentic experience for me since the worker's demeanor reminded me of my time in japan. very perky, always smiling and had a cute high pitched voice! come here to enjoy a delicious bowl of ramen and experience a little taste of japan!", 
            "(update: this place is always jam packed with people now. it has earn the reputation of being the best place in town for ramen).  due to all of your rave reviews i was compelled to give this place a try.  (i can just hear my dad saying, \"if everyone jumped off a cliff would you jump too?  if it were into a yummy ocean of noodle soup, hell yeah!)\n\nthis little gem is hidden a bit back from the road and does not have a huge eye catching front.  it modestly blends in with the rest of the shops.  as you enter you will be greeted by the cooks, servers, and maybe a few customers.  it is a simple small noodle shop fighting the vegas heat with a weak ac system and a multitude of fans.  was it warm?  yes sir, very much so.  but my good friend told me, that regardless of the heat we should endure and it would be worth it.\n\nwe sat at the rotating wooden stools at a lovely solid one piece of wood bar.  service was immediate and friendly.  i found the very short menu to be a relief from the pages and pages of food offerings of other establishments.  i often have trouble deciding what to eat, and then leave with regrets if i did not enjoy my meal.  neither would be the case today.  i have heard a hero of mine speak of restaurants that only make one thing, but they make it better than anyone else around.  i hoped for a similar experience.\n\ni quickly decided on the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> with tamago, chashu, mustard cabbage, and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>.  i noticed from everyone's pictures that many of us decided on the exact same combination.  great minds think alike right?  \n\na few minutes later a large hot bowl of aroma and color found its way to me.  i dug in and didn't stop till the bowl was tilting to my face and the last drops of soup were tickling my tongue.  i love the thinner noodles over udon, so i am a bit biased here.  the noodles where not over cooked for my taste and the broth had great flavor.  the chashu i got was soft and delicious.  everything just seemed to go together perfectly.\n\nif i were judging this restaurant against all noodle places in vegas, 5 stars.  but since i have had some outstanding noodles in california that i set my standards by, i'll give this 4.  don't get me wrong, this place is great, and i will be back, but i am saving the 5 star rating for a place i love in california.  i just need to eat there a few more times and make sure that it wasn't just the one time.", 
            "it's on my monthly must have menu.   <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> is the best out of the 3 ramen selections on the menu imo.   creamy savory broth, perfectly cooked noodle and the tender chashu (pork) make it very addictive.  this is not something you can cook at home.  the pork has the perfect amount of fat makes the ramen rich and flavorful without being greasy.  you can tell it takes a lot of time and effort to prepare the pork.  their other side dishes (<mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, gyoza, pork belly...) are all very delicious as well.  service was ok and bareable as most of the small scale asian restaurants. \n\nthe downside of the restaurant:\n--the broth is a bit saltier than i'd prefer.\n--i'd prefer more chashu (pork) pieces per ramen order for the price they're charging\n--sometimes they run out of extra chashu.\n--it's always hot in there.  they need to invest some money in ac.\n--i felt like i was being ripped off a little when i went there the first time because it seems a little overpriced for the portion and the ingredients.  however, now i'm totally addicted and have no choice cause it's very yummy and they don't have many competitions.", 
            "went there tonight with hubby and friend.  we ordered two <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>, one <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>, a side of chashu, an order of gyoza, and three beers on tap, total came out to $31.14 not bad.  \n\nthe gyoza was very tasty, chashu nice and tender, noodles were great, and the broth was alright nothing spectacular (better with the grated garlic they give you).   i like to put gyoza in my ramen (kinda like wonton mein or mandoo kook soo), there's something about dumplings in broth that makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside (my comfort food).  \n\nit is hot in there and eating hot ramen does not help, my husband couldn't wait to get out of there.   service was fast and friendly.  so far best ramen in vegas.", 
            "yum yum yum! \n\nmy friend's cousin recommended this place to me. she has family in vegas and this is one of her favorite hole in the wall spots.\n\nwhen i first walked in, i wasn't too sure about the place. no air conditioning, just a fan. the place is super tiny. we ordered the <mark>Chashu Bowl</mark>, <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, and <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>. \n\nthe pork in the <mark>Chashu Bowl</mark> and <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> melts in you mouth. it is that delicious. both had very good flavor. the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> also was very good. all the food felt like it was home-made and in a very positive way. it brought back the comforts of home.\n\nwhen i am back in town, i will for sure do my best to visit this place.\n\n i really wish there was a place like this in san diego.", 
            "finally got around to visiting the latest addition to ramen houses in vegas - monta noodle house.  conveniently located on spring mountain, right next to the super busy raku.  (smart business choice i would say.)\n\nthis place is bare bones - as in minimal tables and a bar, so don't come with a large group.  their super simple menu gets you in and out fast!  (a couple who came in around the same time we did had ordered, gotten their food, finished, paid and left by the time we were eating ours.)\n\ni went for their most popular dish - <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> ($6.95).  the main component is the broth, which is made up of boiling pork bones, fat, and collagen for hours.  this results in a cloudy white broth and would usually have the consistency of a thin gravy.  it automatically comes with two slices of char sui, takenoko (bamboo sprouts), kikurage (type of mushroom), and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>.  their char siu (barbecued pork) definitely isn't like the chinese kind, but definitely tasty.\n\nthe husband went for the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> ($7.25), which is ultimately bean paste blended with the pork broth giving it a richer flavor.  this was also good, and quite filling.\n\nwe also shared a regular order of the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> ($5.75).  it sits on a bed of rice, with fresh scallions and pickled red ginger.  i adore pork belly and the next time i come here, i'm going to order a dish of this all to myself.  it's fatty and good.  \n\na side dish we added on was the <mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark> ($1.50).  you can have this on the side or in your broth.  it's pickled mustard greens that may or may not be to your liking.  it's adds a different texture and taste to your ramen.  other toppings you can add on included nitamago (seasoned hard boiled egg), corn, butter, kimchee, and more char siu or <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>.\n\nthere's only one other kind of ramen they offer here - shoyu, which means soy sauce based.  you can also add extra noodles for $2 more if you save your soup and ask for \"kaedama.\"  other dishes available are gyoza, <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, kim chee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, takana <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, cha siu bowl, and <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> (marinated polluck roe).\n\nservice was good.  with two waitresses, they keep the flow of business going great and refilled beverages as needed.  it's not the best place to loiter with the limited seating and all, but definitely a great place to grab a quick bite and go.\n\nupdate!  \ni returned the following month for my own bowl of the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>.  this time the pork belly was sliced thinner, which wasn't to my personal preference.  guess it depends on who is working the kitchen that day.",

            "i was really excited to try this place when my wife said she heard about a new ramen joint that serves hakata <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>.\n\nthe restaurant is minimalist with very little seating and is located next door to raku. we generally don't sweat the decor, or lack thereof, as long as the food is good.\n\nthey offer shoyu, miso, and <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> and several other items on their menu. we ordered the tonkotsu, of course, which was $7 for a small-medium sized bowl. they used the thin white classic <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> noodles which were decent but lacked the elasticity or chewy \"freshness factor\" of other places we've tried. as my wife will attest to, i like my food salty and flavorful, but their broth was a bit too salty, even for me. it had an earthy shiitake mushroom flavor but was lacking in the porky flavor and richness of a good tonkotsu broth. neither of us cared to slurp up any of the broth once we were done with the noodles. i found the two pieces of chashu were mediocre at best. they were somewhat tough and fatty and had this unusual ring of gelatin around the edges.\n\nthis place is arguably the best ramen place in vegas that we have found so far. unfortunately that also isn't saying very much. a mere year ago, both of us would probably have been more than satisfied with monta. damn you ichiran for making ramen snobs out of us and forever raising our ramen bar! the search continues for better ramen in vegas...",

            "did you ever think there would be such a restaurant here in an \"all-nighter city\" that cooks and serves ramen noodles? yes, there is tucked in-between small shops along spring mountain road or otherwise known as \"chinatown\" in vegas.\n\nas you may or may not know it', \"ramen\" noodles is one of japanese noodles invented in 1958 by japan's nissin foods. these are thin, ribbon-like, lightweight, calorie-rich, tasty, and cheap that can be bought in packs of 1 or 10 (you can find them in your asian or oriental grocery near you or in any of your college friend's pantry). it's one of those quick cook-it-up soups.\n\nit's rather an eccentric choice of mine to dine in this place with my mom last night around 6 p.m. on a very rainy night in vegas. soup is the answer to the cold, wet rain! ramen is kind-of over-the-top in this restaurant!\n\nwith a sweet, smiling greeting from the waitress, \"moshi, moshi!\" in japanese, which translates to \"hello\" or rather \"welcome!\" (i have learned a few japanese greetings in high school and  having been to tokyo before, the greeting didn't sound \"foreign\"). it brought a smile to my lips, i knew i would have a good dining experience. \n\nthe restaurant is small and cozy but cheerful with minimalist japanese style decor including the bathroom's interior design was contemporary japanese. there are table seatings and bar-like seating available. menu is simple. three choices of ramen noodle soups in \"<mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>\" (pork bone), \"<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>\" (soy paste), and \"<mark>Miso Ramen</mark>\" (bean paste). nothing else to confuse any soup-hungry soup-lover. a list of toppings for the noodles soup for an extra charge, 8 \"other dishes\", 4 kinds of cold beverages, 2 kinds of beer choices, but no dessert and no hot beverages on the menu.\n\ni ordered the house specialty soup which is the \"tonkatsu ramen\" soup. it's very hearty soup in a thick, cloudy milk-like tasty broth. topped with <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, 3 slices of pork, bamboo shoots, and with kikurage (dried black mushrooms), i drizzled it with sesame seeds and hot spice powder. oh, wow, there was no need for chewing the roast pork that melted in my mouth. surely, the pork melts! another dish i ordered was the \"mimi mentaiko\" which consists of fish cod roe (or fish eggs which are red-orange in color is otherwise, caviar) with strips of nori seaweed and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> topped on a bowl of steamed japanese rice. very appetizing, a sure favorite! the \"<mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>\" is also one dish you ought to try; delicious. as usual <mark>Green Tea</mark> on ice was my beverage pairing for these meals.\n\nfunny thing...the cheerful smiling waitress who served us went to show her colleagues in the kitchen my soup bowl which made her shyly squeal in delight to show them all it was empty!! i caught a glimpse of the cook's smile.\n\nyes, i left nothing in the bowl, not even a drop of soup!\nit must have been that i really love soup, or it was cold and wet outside or just that i needed to fill my belly...how can you go wrong in making such a choice to eat for the night. for a price that's easy on your pocket, aahemm! wallet...an excellent deal! \"arigato gozaimas!\" (english translation is \"thank you!\"), as we left the restaurant in good spirit!", 
            "being a pretty lucky teen, i've had the chance to travel, and try many ramen shops around las vegas area, california, as well as japan and hong kong. though it is not up to what i have tried in japan, it is pretty close. \n\nthis is a small ramen shop at the back of a shopping centre. max occupancy is probably give or take 25-30 people max with option to sit at the bar or table. staff gives a very friendly welcome upon entry. a lot of times, this restaurant is quite busy. the restaurant has a nice warm feeling (not due to the heat from cooking) but it resembles some ramen shops i have tried and seen in tokyo, japan. \n\nupon sight of the menu, the front cover has a little story of origins of ramen. when you see the selection of foods they provide, it is not much. this is one of the few places, that i really like, that don't offer a wide variety of foods. not only do they specialize in what they offer, it is also the only thing they need because of how well made it is. \n\nthey have three broth selections. tonkotsu, which is a pork bone based broth (usually slowly boiled and simmered for many hours to create a white flavor-filled broth), miso, and shoyu (soy-sauce based). being a fan of <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>, that was the first broth i had tried and loved. price range for the different soup is i believe 6.95 - 7.95 with shoyu and tonkotsu being $6.95 and miso at 7.95 [don't quote me on the pricing but i do remember the miso being more expensive than tonkotsu for some reason... you'd think the one with more work (tonkotsu) would be more expensive]\n\nthey offer a variety of toppings ($1 - $2.50 each) you can choose to add to the ramen as well, ranging from extra pork, <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, corn, butter, some green vegetable (forgot the name). hearing great things about their pork, that was what i had ordered as an additional topping. there is also the option of getting extra noodles for a small fee of $2. \n\ntake note, there are two types of noodles they use between the 3 broths. i believe tonkotsu uses one, while miso and shoyu uses another. they also offer sides like gyoza, pork over rice, etc. \n\nupon arrival of food, i was amazed how well the ramen looked. the soup had a deep white color, pipping hot freshly made. the soup was not thin but not thick as well. not sure how to explain, but it was a broth that looked to be filled of flavor. as most people, the first thing to try was the soup. upon tasting of the soup, i was amazed. the flavor of the soup was rich, extremely flavorful, not too salty or sweet. it was like, perfection was reached. the noodles were a little over al dente which was perfect for ramen. the table has spices that you can add on top of your ramen like chili oil and this spicy spice mix. \n\nthe pork they used was a 1/2 fatty 1/2 meat type of cut formed in a circular shape. being of asian origin, it was exactly how i liked it. as said before, the option of extra noodles was available so some of the pork was saved. they amount of noodles you get is quite an amount (usually wont expect too much for \"additional noodles\" but if anything, it may have been a slightly larger serving then that was in the original bowl. the additional noodles is given in a bowl, heated and ready to be thrown into your original soup. \n\nlets just say, every single time, i order a bowl of ramen, additional noodles.. and never have soup left over =] \n\nservice is great. food is great. price is reasonable. recommend to many friends and family. one of the best ramen places i've ever been to", 
            "simply japan and good(^w^) \nwhen i walked in, i was instantly happy because how much it reminded me of small japanese ramen shop in osaka. \n\nthey play japanese music from 70's to present, which adds good touch to the resutrant. \ni ordered <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>, their broth is excellent, rich creamy and yummy =d\ntheir noodle is straight skinny type, which is good match for tonkotsu broth. \n\ni had their gyoza, witch is homemade and delicious. \n\ntheir chashu tastes like real chashu you can get in japan (^w^) mmmmm\ni would definitely go back their when i goto vegas next time =d", 
            "overall, i'm giving this place 4 stars but the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> deserves 5 stars by itself.  i loved the flavor of the soup and how the noodles were cooked just right.  my brother and bf were hesitant to go because they've had not so good ramen before but both of them loved the ramen they ordered (tonkotsu and shoyu).  my brother loved it so much, he went again 2 days later.  i'll definitely be going back again and again for the ramen!  and next time, i'll try the extra toppings..but it says a lot about the flavor of the soup when i loved it plain the way it came.\n\nso why the 4 stars?  we also ordered kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and the dumplings.  the dumplings were ok, nothing special about it.  it came slightly burnt and were all stuck together.  the kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was ok too, but more sour than the normal ones i've had.  \n\nstick to the ramen and you'll love this place!",

            "never really thought to try and even find a ramen house in vegas, considering, one typically is drunk and just walking about the strip all day long, but this place was definitely a good find.  chanced upon this quaint little establishment while visiting friends in vegas and they recommended that we should eat here because i loved noodles so much.  definitely comparable to my favorite ramen places...5 stars as far as vegas is concerned!  :)\n\ni was a little skeptic at first, but walking into this tiny little place, which probably seats no more than 20 - 30 guests, was one of the pleasant little surprises of my trip.  \n\nordered the gyoza and the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> with the hard boiled egg.  the gyoza...typical.  the ramen was actually quite good.  the noodles were nice and soft, and the broth was flavorful and not too much.  the yolk of the egg was pretty salty, even for my taste(and i love salty), but the chasu...man, i don't know exactly how they cooked it, but it was frickin good.  i ate all of my ramen and my fiancee's leftovers and was so full, but would've still eaten some more, just because i liked it so much.  \n\ni can definitely see this place getting quite busy at peak times, considering the size and all, so come outside of the meal rush hours.  \n\nservice - good.  no complaints and nothing especially out of the ordinary either.  \n\nparking is fine, the place shares a large lot with several other establishments...", 
            "finally! a very good ramen joint in vegas. this place is much more the real japanese ramen joint than the (now defunct) togoshi ramen.\n\nmonta is in a small strip mall on sprint mountain rd, just west of decatur. it is very easy to miss as you go by. and the shop is very small, with only four 4 place table, 1 2 place table, and about 10 counter seats. they only accept cash so beware.\n\ni recently learned of this place right here on yelp and had to give it a try. like others on this forum, i grew up eating fantastic ramen all over japan. and have long been searching... i was elated when santouka came to the states and even more ecstatic when local joints like orenchi (cupertino, ca) that are very much like the ramen i used to know in japan... started to pop up.\n\ni'd like to preface this review with the fact that i like tonkotsu, thick chijirimen (wavy noodles) usually, so i am usually biased towards that. monta has 4 basic types of ramen flavors: tonkotsu, shoyu, miso, and new (at least it said new today) tonkotsu shoyu which is a combination of the tonkotsu and shoyu broths.\n\ntonkotsu, of course, is pork based broth. the shoyu uses chicken broth (according to monta), but i also detected some dashi (fish based) in there as well. tonkotsu, and tonkotsu shoyu uses thin straight noodles. shoyu and miso uses the thick wavy noodles. each ramen @  $6.95 comes with 2 slices of char shu, kikurage (woodear mushrooms), memma (seasoned bamboo shoots), and chopped <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>. there are other toppings available as mentioned in other reviews, along with kaedama (literally means \"replacement ball\") extra noodles.\n\nkaedama is usually ordered as you go, not in the beginning. this is because if get it at the same time as your ramen, then the noodles either go cold, or get overcooked. this is one of the reasons why i do not like places that have a \"large\" size. by the time you're half way through, the noodles are too overcooked. i commend monta for doing the kaedama the right way.\n\nanyway, i was @ monta today, thu, at 2 pm, and the place had a waiting list 8 deep! it took us abobut 20 minutes to get seated, and as we got seated, the wait line even got longer. ok... my expectations are way high... but be cautious... this, after all, is the only ramen only joint in vegas....\n\ni ordered the tonkotsu shoyu with nitamago and extra char shu. my wife had the shoyu with nitamago. we also had gyoza. in the kitchen, there are basically 2 guys preparing the dishes. one guy that does the ramen, another that does the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and others. and with the packed house, the service was slow.\n\nbut when the ramen finally came, i was not disappointed. despite my doubts, the tonkotsu shoyu had a wonderful balance and marriage of pork and chicken broth. my wife's shoyu, i believe due to the chicken stock, had a very mellow aspect to it which also gave the tonkotsu a very mellow and non-overpowering flavor. i finished the broth to the last drop, including my wife's shoyu/chicken broth.\n\nthe noodles... my thin noodles were not overcooked, and about just right when my ramen came out. but because of its thinness, by the time i got half way through my ramen (and i'm a relatively quick ramen eater, beating my wife by a good 10 minutes :-)) was way overcooked and mushy soft. next time, i will see if they will cook it less (katame, or as i do at kyushu jyangara in tokyo, bari-kata... crispy as in ironed with starch). my wife's chijirimen was very good with good amount of al dente,a and the chewiness one expects in good ramen.  if i can't get them to cook the thin noodles to super al dente, then my backup plan is to have them use the thick noodles in the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>.\n\nthe boiled egg is soft boiled, but the yolk does not run. i like my soft boiled egg a with a bit more runny yolk. but nevertheless it was still good. the char shu was one the the better ones i had in the states. very tender, melts in your mouth, with good flavor... not too over powering, not too bland. the slices were on the thin side, but i got a total of 8 slices by ordering the extra char shu topping ($2.50). \n\nin summary both the tonkotsu shoyu and <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> were done very well, with a good balance of broth, noodles, and toppings in a dish that came together very very well. too many times, i have been to ramen places in the states where the broth may be good, but noodles lack, or vice versa, or even where all the individual ingredients are good, but the finished product just doesn't cut it.\n\nthe gyoza, unlike one reviewer here, i though were also very good. i would beg to differ that this is not like store bought gyoza as it is stuffed with pork whereas the store bought ones are more heavy on the nappa cabbage and not stuffed. the flavor is also very good, however, i like my gyoza wet...that is with a bit more juice as you bite into them.\n\nin the end though, i give monta 5 stars even with the few deficiencies. monta, in my book, share the top honors with orenchi in cupertino,",

            "as comfort food goes, ramen can be such a go-to meal when it's cold outside (we both sweat way too much to be slurping noodles in mega hot molten lava broth in the summer)! so during the colder months, we make our way as much as possible to monta for ramen\n\nit's tiny noodle shop, the counter seats ten and five table tops that seats twelve total.  it's open until late at night and it cranks out people like no one's business-prety much there's always a waiting list to get into this place!\n\nand it is well worth it,  the ramen is some of the best that we have had, (and that includes japan!  gasp! horror! blasphemy!) but it's true-we went to hide chan ramen in fukuoka and the broth wasn't as good as monta's!\n\nas we always do, there's a couple of things that we order and not much else, (it's hard to venture out when you know a dish is that good).  we start the japanese journey with an order of the gyoza; these pork dumplings are perfectly cooked, a crunchy charred exterior that holds in the moist juices of the pork.  add sujoyu, (a mixture of vinegar and soy sauce) rayu (chili oil) and some raw garlic, dip these little moon shaped suckers in it and pop' em in your pie hole! \n\nafter you've wet your appetite, it's time move onto the main event; the ramen.  as is, we're partial to the tonkotsu (pork bone) ramen- the broth is made from simmered pork bone, fat and collagen which gives it its super rich, almost creamy soup that can easily fill you up and warm your body.  it's most definitely the most satisfying noodle soup on this planet.  and especially since this is a kyushu dish, (fukuoka is on the  island of kyushu) i'm particular to the flavor.  (japan based on its regions have different tastes and styles to the same dish).  \n\nmonta's <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> recipe is from kurume, (not far from fukuoka) so it's really close to my heart.  which is why you won't see me ordering the other ramen, (there's shoyu, miso and tonkotsu-shoyu).  one of these days, we'll get to them......\n\nthere's a couple of add ons and i would definitely go and order an extra chashu, (roasted pork) these tender slices of heaven are as much as a main character as the noodles and broth.  getting to the noodles, have you ever had anything better than ramen noodles? they're just so unique; chewy and monta really cooks them right.  we also get the nitamago, (cooked egg) takana, (<mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark>) and sometimes nori, (seaweed) -the egg for extra protein, the takana for the vegetable and crunch and nori for the contrast in texture.  you can also order an extra helping of ramen noodles (kaedama) if you have extra broth, but there's no way i have ever had enough room for that!!!\n\nin the summertime, they serve hiyashi-chuka (cold chinese noodles). it's refreshing and cold perfect for the summer with bits of ham, cucumber, bean sprouts, takana, nori and sesame seeds over ramen noodles in a light soy; it's the best on a hot day!!!\n\ni forgot to mention the rice bowls that they serve as well; i'm not the biggest fan of these bowls but that just me- a lot of people rave about them!  i know what i like and i'm happy staying on my side of the menu if you know what i mean...the service here is excellent, the waitresses are terribly polite and the the food comes outs really fast!

            "i must say, out of all the ramen places i've tried, monta definitely sticks out. i've had ramen from norcal, socal, and new york. i don't call myself very knowledgeable but i sure as hell know what i like to eat. the best ramen place that i've tried is ippudo, which is located in manhattan ny. however, monta does come close.\n\n\nmonta is quite a small restaurant and it has one of those homely feels to it. one thing i didn't quite like was how stuffy it was. i went during one of the warm days, it wasn't even hot, but all they had was fans and i couldn't even feel them. so the place had pretty poor circulation and stuffy. i'd hate to see what it's like during an actual summer temperature where it hits over 100 degrees. \n\n\ni had their <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> with corn -- definitely recommended. their broth is rich and full of flavor. it is yummy. however, because of how rich and yummy the broth is, i don't suggest adding an egg to it. because once you do, the egg loses its flavor and the broth overpowers it. so no point. \n\n\ni would've given this place five full stars if it were not for the waitress that helped us. oh the service was fine throughout our meal. when we first took our orders down, she offered us, \"would you like everything on one check or split checks?\" we were a party of 8. obviously, some had cash and some didn't so we would prefer the latter. so we answered with, \"split checks would be nice :)\" but then she responds with, \"i could do that but could you please not do 8 separate checks? it's a little bit too much.\"\n\ni'm sorry? really, why did you even bother to offer? \n\ni didn't feel like arguing or bothering so we just went with one check. you don't offer something then take back your offer. or at least lay your own terms down before you finish offering. thank you. \n\n\nbut hey. food's good. :) just that tiny bit irked me.",

            "food here is pretty solid.  i've had ramen in la (which is much better back home, and i'm not trying to sound snobby, rather it's just something i can compare to), and the food here is a decent.  \n\n<mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> $(7) and +$2 for egg- slightly above average-the broth is pretty good.  it comes w/ 2 pieces of meat (which is detailed on the menu).  the pork base is pretty thick, so if you are into thick broths this is the place to go.  \n\nmy gripe is they don't give you complimentary egg w/ the broth, so you gotta pay $2 extra (which is pretty steep if you ask me).  i mean, who eats ramen w/o egg?  it's almost required!!!  i also would've preferred my egg to be a little more runny.  part of the egg yoke should seep into the soup (but still retain it's shape).  the egg i got was slightly hard when i got it.\n\npork belly rice ($5.50 for a large, $3.50 for small) - average.  the pork belly is extremely sweet!  i think they use too much sauce or something. the sauce almost over-powers the taste of the meat.  i'd pass on this next time.\n\ni was able to try my friends takana <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and it's delicious.  10x better than the pork belly.\n\ntips:\n-not good for groups.  restaurant is small, maybe seats 20 people inside.   parties of 4 or larger might have trouble sitting.\n-egg isn't complimentary w/ the ramen, so you gotta spend $2 extra =(\n-no garlic press available",

            "food: 4\nservice: 4\natmosphere: 3. cramped in a strip mall (which is of course typical in lv.). it is located in the same strip mall as another popular japanese place, raku.\n\nfirst impression and ordering\nas we stood waiting for about maybe 15-20 min, we peeked over to the table of 4 who were eating on a table smack right next to the entry door where everyone was standing & waiting. we saw that the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> looked a tad greasy and so did the ramen broth. my dinner companion gave me that look of \"hmmm\" and i said \"i guess we'll just try it since we're already here\". we were curious to compare this to our usual ramen dojo (san mateo, ca).\n\nwe ordered one tonkotsu $6.95 (+egg $1.50  and corn $0.50), one <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> $6.95 with extra chasu (+4 pieces, $2.50) and one kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> $6.95 (hoping this would be less greasy than the regular <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and it was slightly less common in the ramen place).  having not eaten lunch that day, we were huuungry and ready to devour our order as soon as it arrived. first impression: noodles presentation looked neat and mouthwatering; the ingredients were neatly arranged on top and the bowl of ramen looked quite appetizing. especially with 2 hungry stomachs impatiently waiting to devour them. lol. \n\nthe broth didn't appear as greasy as my earlier glance at the previous table.  there was a curious black ring around each of the chasu (more about this later) that's usually not present in the other ramen's place chasu piece.  interesting, we thought.\n\nthe <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> still looked a tad on the greasy side by the shines it showed. but in all fairness, i haven't ordered japanese <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> in a ramen place for some time. maybe they all look like that.\n\nnow on to the fun part.\n\nfood\nthe broth on the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> was delish. slightly on the lighter side compared to ramen dojo, but it was still good. one big difference that made ramen dojo's broth more 'hearty' and tasty was the addition of chicken bits in their broths. if you like a lighter version of tonkotsu broth, you will like monta's version better.\n\nthe shoyu broth was light yet had a lot of flavor. \n\nthe tonkotsu bowl came with thin noodles. we both were very curious how good (smooth) this thin noodle would be. while not as 'smooth' as some of the other thin ramen noodles we've tried in japan, we were pleasantly surprised at how smooth and tasty it was. so, thumbs up here.\n\nthe noodles in the shoyu bowl was also pretty good. it is the yellow, thicker, curly kind; of course heavier than the one in the tonkotsu bowl, yet not super-heavy.\n\nas for the curious black ring around the chasu, as you probably have guessed, it is the pork skin. the skin itself was a real thin strip with a very thin layer of fat underneath it.  including this skin gave the soup broth an extra flavor and aroma that distinguished it from other ramen's place broth. it was probably also why the half-finished ramen bowl we peeked earlier looked slightly greasier. i don't typically see this pork skin included in other ramen shop. this is a plus for the broth. the slightly greasier broth didn't quite happen as much in my bowl. 'cause i like to scrape off the fat under the pork skin. lol. another thumbs up!\n\nthe last dish which was the kimchee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> ($6.95) was yum, though i still think it could be done with slightly less oil.  unlike the rice bowl-sized portion that it often comes in, this <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> came in a rounded square plate of the size that could've been a meal by itself.\n\nservice\nservice was friendly, efficient and brisk without making us feel rushed. but we did devoured our meal super fast and left quickly as a courtesy to the long lines of people waiting.\n\ntwo thumbs up for this place.\n\nanecdotal comments & observations (mostly rhetorical)\nwhy is it that most ramen house has the most 'house rules' posted on their outside window? no outside food. no outside drink. no tacos? (seriously, this place has a picture of tacos with a cross on it and japanese writing).",

            "i figured this place deserved an update after reading my first short and irrelevant review.\n\nyes, this place is still the best ramen house in vegas. y u still no give 5 stars?!?! monta is extremely successful and always busy lately. however, they're still stuck in the same small cramped place. opening a new monta location would really mitigate the wait time. i also feel that service is a hit and miss (not that its ever been bad, just sometimes its not great.) \n\nnow here's the best part about monta: the flavors here are delicious! the four ramen flavors they sell here are tonkotsu, shoyu, tonkotsu-shoyu, and miso. personally, my favorites are tonkotsu and tonkotsu-shoyu. i love the texture of the thin noodles from the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> and sometimes i'm up for the fatty cloudy broth of tonkotsu, but sometimes i want something a little lighter so i order the tonkotsu-shoyu. most my friends enjoy the thick noodles so they order the shoyu or miso. my recommendation is to order tonkotsu with kimchi. i feel like the pickled taste of kimchi cuts through the thick taste of <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> nicely so you get lots of flavor of savory and a little sour from the kimchi. also try some sesame seeds to get a little nutty taste too!\n\nif you've never had a bowl of authentic ramen, i highly recommend coming to monta. if you are a ramen fanatic, i would say this place definitely satisfies the ramen craving. happy eats!",

            "their <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> was really good. the broth was perfect; the pork was melt-in-your-mouth fatty.  it was so good, that before we ended our vegas trip we returned again.  we tried the tonkotsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> and pork belly.  both visits we ordered kimchee on the side and it was good too...not spicy, just refreshing enough to accompany the richness of the pork and broth.",

            "while visiting las vegas i was doing research on ramen restaurants on yelp and kept reading about everyone who had a positive and delicious experience at monta ramen.  today i made the trip with my brother.  we got here about 10 minutes after they opened and found the last remaining table.  the place was already packed.  after looking at the menu i ordered the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> which is a rich pork broth with two slices of melt in your mouth pork with wood-ear mushrooms and scallions.  i added the nitamago which is a seasoned hard-boiled egg.  this meal did not disappoint.  it came to the table within 10 minutes and was a great looking bowl of ramen.  very savory and fresh.  we also had the gyoza  which is a pan-fried pork and vegetable dumpling.  my brother ordered the takana pork-<mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.  this rice was a nice addition to our ramen bowls.  \n\njust a note:  as our ramen bowls were delivered i looked up and noticed that monta ramen must have a lot of fans because the little doorway was filled with people waiting to eat but the line also went out the door.   knowing what i do now about how delicious this ramen is i would have gladly waited outside for my turn to enjoy this bowl.  \n\nmonta ramen will definitely be on my list to visit the next time i come to las vegas.  can't wait to bring my wife here.  very affordable.  i recommend.",

            "visited this small restaurant based on popular review. indeed, this restaurant is so popular that you will have to wait in the line. another reason why you'll have to wait is that the dining room can probably fit about 30 dining guests at each time, half of the guests will need to be on the bar table. me and my wife are lucky to get a table after about 45 minutes of wait with about 6 parties waiting in front of us for dinner (by the way, you will need to check yourself in as there are only 2 very busy waitresses). the menu was very simple - noodle, <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> or some small variety of specialty. there are flyers if 2 today's special pasted on the wall, which we ordered - spicy <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>. we also ordered a <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> bowl (basically some fish eggs with sesame over small bowl of rice). i would not say it is super delicious, but it is really worth the price. the ramen was very flavorful (can be a little salty). you also have the option to add another noodle if you still feel hungry after you finish the bowl - i think most people will do since there was actually not much noodle in it. for us, the bowl of rice does the job. the rice is nothing special and almost had no flavor. i just seasoned the rice with the broth of the ramen i had. overall, not bad, and it is definitely worth the price. but if you don't have much time in vegas, you can safely skip this place as it is not worth that much of wait, unless you really want to save money in your trip.", 
            "i am from south of japan where <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>  originally came from. what surprise me is they didn't change original flavor.  real <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> does taste like this. i appreciate that they provide real japanese food for japanese people.  if you don't like it, you should try americanized ramen noodle place.", 
            "yay for good little ramen shops! monta opens at 11am. my party and i arrived at monta at precisely 11:10am and there was already 7 parties waiting outside the door! there are only about 5 tables and some seats around the ramen bar in the shop. just our luck, by the time we got to the front of the door, all of the tables and seats were filled. we then had to wait 45 minutes to be seated. once we were seated, we ordered and our food and drinks came out quickly. there are two waitresses- both mid-age japanese women. \n\ni had the spicy <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> with kimchi, nitamago (flavored egg), and nori on the side. the broth was really good- not too salty, so that's a plus. the noodles are handmade as well. \n\ni would definitely come back.", 
            "flashback to the first time i wanted to try this place... packed like no other that i couldn't even see through the windows. looked like a major fire hazard so i did a 180 and got my ramen fill elsewhere. \n\nthis time, i came around 4pm, so with such an odd hour, i'm so glad i didn't have to wait! there's really not that many seats available but they do have pretty fast service. i had to try their <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>, adding the corn and the seasoned egg. the best part was definitely the chashu...melt-in-your-mouth delicious! the soup was a little thick/salty but still good. overall, i would come back to maybe try the black garlic oil or add in other toppings and customize to my liking.", 
            "the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> is so yummy and fills you up, normally i don't get full from ramen and i was eyeing the noodle refill but once i was done withy noodles there was no more room. the service is really good too- order was taken promptly and food was brought out quickly. we never ran out of water. prices are also very good. there is usually a line out the door but it's worth the wait. hands down the best ramen in vegas!", 
            "our usual ramen sora was closed, so we decided to give their rival down the street a try.  we were there 5 minutes before opening, joined the throng of people waiting to get in, and happily we were able to get seats at the bar immediately.  i couldn't believe it when friends said that this place makes ramen sora look huge, but boy were they right!!  i think monta ramen seats maybe 35 people total and has a tiny waiting area.\n\ni was very happy with the service!  waitstaff was friendly, efficient, and checked on us regularly, even with a completely full house.  i loved being able to sit at the bar and watch the food being prepared.  this is one area they have a leg up on ramen sora.\n\ni ordered <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> with corn, butter, and soft cooked egg and hubs had <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> with <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>.  at first, i thought my broth was completely lacking in flavor and was so disappointed.  turns out that all the flavor had settled into the bottom of the bowl.  a good stirring fixed the problem.  wish i had realized that earlier!  lol!  hubs and i both felt that the pork was extremely fatty and the texture was just not good.  \n\ni suppose that if i had never had ramen sora, this might have been fine.  but i have had it and i will be going back to our usual from now on.  at least i can say that i've now made an informed decision between the two rivals.  :)", 
            "loved it! checked it out friday around 7:30pm.   small place, very busy but was able to accommodate a part of 7. long wait but totally worth it.\n\n<mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> was delicious. pork broth was <mark>Butter</mark>, thin noodles were fresh and pork was tender. added an egg and corn which made my bowl complete!\n\n<mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> was yummy and great for sharing. \n\nalthough the place was packed and super busy, the 2 waitresses managed to get things done! they took our orders, refill drinks, take empty bowls and plates and clean up for the next party quickly and efficient.\n\nwould love to come back next time we are in town!", 
            "for the longest time i've heard this place was the go to place for some ramen. well finally decided to give it a try instead of ramen sora where i usually went and had one of the best bowls of ramen in my experience. i think ramen in vegas in general is just super cheap compared to northern ca, so i definitely give this place a +1 on that ($8 ramen). one of the thing that surprised me most was having the minced pork over rice at a ramen shop. that i was not expecting. \n\n<mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> was what i ordered. it did come with some good flavors, but personally i think i liked the minced pork over rice more than i liked the ramen. the flavors were pretty good but they seemed like a flavor i'd get at any other ramen shop. broth was <mark>Butter</mark> but felt like it was made me more thirsty than anything. i got this other noodle that i didn't like but my friends had the original type of ramen noodle. i didn't notice that they paired different noodles to different flavors or that you can request to have them changed, so that was a fail on my part. add an egg and some butter corn and that makes anything close to good. add some mouth melting tender pork and you should be good to go. \n\nplace was kinda crowded and we had 9 people so our wait was a little long. there's a nice little boba joint next door, so get some boba and wait in the ac. \n\ntips: \n1) get the minced pork over rice\n2) add the egg and pork \n3) enjoy", 
            "this review is long overdue as i've been coming here since 2012 when a good friend took me with her. my favorite is the shoyu/<mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> with extra pork and i also order the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> to go with it. potstickers aren't bad either and they've got plenty of condiments to keep your food tasting great. service is good, but fair warning; this place is ridiculously small. there's almost always a line outside so it's best to get there right when they open so you can get in and get out. it's got the reputation of being the best ramen in all of las vegas and in my opinion, it lives up to its name. give them a try yelpers!", 
            "this is the original monta restaurant. small, but sooooo good! i had the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>, regular (not spicy) <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and gyoza. everything was great. didn't think there would be a crowd for hot ramen with 110 degree days, but the locals love this place.", 
            "monta ramen serves \"kurume\" style <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> from fukuoka. it's a broth made from selected pork bones and special soy sauce imported from japan. nice!!\nsmall but clean ramen spot, monta always seems like there is a long wait out the door. \nthe kuro ramen was black & impressive, the tokotsu ramen was creamy and deep. both had thick and rich pork based broth with thin, unrisen noodles. the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was well mannered with excellent seasoning & the gyoza was surprisingly crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. \nservice was o-kay ....most likey because it was super busy with only two waitresses on the floor. the whole time, i felt rushed. the glares from the hungry customers waiting for a table to the right of us was piercing & hurting. \nother than that, yes! i'm a fan!!\n\ngood for kids: yes\nhighchair: yes", 
            "so, i was craving some pork belly all day! i was like an addict having withdraw symptoms! so, we decided to go to monta, it was recommended to us! we had the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> and added: corn, <mark>Chashu Pork</mark> and nitamago! plus the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>! the ramen was rich and thick everything was amazing the pork was tender and fall off as soon as you picked it up melt in your mouth! you can never go wrong with a <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> its just amazing!", 
            "went on sunday 9-20-15 around 12:45 pm.  this is located on the <mark>Corn</mark> of spring mountain and decatur in the same shopping center as raku, kung-fu tea, big wong, and curry zen.  \n\nyou go inside and write your name on the list and they'll call you when a table's ready.  we put our name on the list and went over to kung-fu tea to wait.  when we went back over, they had called us and crossed our name off the list so we had to put our name on the list again and wait all over again.  oops.  but when they called my name they had a high chair ready for my boy and i thought that was pretty great.  \n\n$11.78 got me a bowl of <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> and a small order of <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.  the ramen was pretty great but dat <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> tho....dang it was awesome.  i absolutely loved it. when i go back (and i definitely will) i will just ask for a trough full of that <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.  i only got 4-5 bites before my baby stole it and stuffed it all in his face.  it is a strange type of rice and i think it has pork belly in it.  \n\ncheap, delicious, eats.  woohoo! as good as it gets!", 
            "don't let the lines sway you this place is worth the wait!  the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> was an eye opening gastronomic experience. after years of ordering various phos and miso soups this broth blew every other out of the park. it's ruined us forever. with a creamy consistency that rivals milk or melted butter this stock made from pork bones, fat, and collagen is heaven in a bowl. add to that some amazing thin noodles (you can order thicker noodles if you desire) and throw in the basic toppings of <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, two slices of chashu, bamboo shoots and kikurage mushrooms. omg it was to die for!  there are many additional toppings you can order to customize and make it perfect for your tastes. \n\nwe also ordered the gyoza and the regular <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. after reading all the reviews we had to give them a try. the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was good, but not fabulous. perhaps there's a difference if you order the takana <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>?  the gyoza were great. thin pillows stuffed with vegatables and pork. hot and delish!  \n\nlucky for us, we're in town for a couple of weeks so we'll definitely be back!",

            "for those who are familiar with santouka, i always use it as a guide to distinguish the good from the bad.  if a place is better than santouka, then it is worth a second visit.  if the ramen falls below the santouka standard, then i can forget about it.  how did monta ramen place on this scale?  well, monta came out on top.\n\nthere was no wow factor for my black <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>, but everything was done quite nicely.  the yolk was not overcooked.  the noodle had the right amount of chew.  the broth was flavorful.  even though the ramen was good, it was not worth the long wait.  we arrived before opening time, and waited for about 30 minutes with the long line.  this place is definitely worth returning, and hopefully the wait is shorter next time.", 
            "first time going with my parents and ordered <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> along with shoyu and <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> and it was amazing! nice small mom and pop shop and seemed like it's always busy so expect to wait, but it's worth it!",

            "i went here on a recommendation from a work friend.  i am blown away by this place.  it is like the holy grail from tanpopo.  this movie is amazing and it's about foodie ramen culture in japan.  they are as authentic as it comes.  just like the movie, the ramen is cooked al dente, the pork slices are placed carefully, the soup is hot and the broth is flavorful.  all the toppings are there and we were so excited we replicated a part of tanpopo when the zen ramen master mindfully eats his ramen.  \n\ni knew this place was it when i ate everything and drank the broth to the bottom of the bowl.  the soft boiled eggs are a must.\n\nthis place is amazing and the menu is simple and they just added the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> which is by far my favorite.\n\nthe <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> is light broth not overly salty, the tonkatsu is very meaty and flavorful and they use a different noodle.  i prefer the ramen noodles that come with the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> though.  the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> is delicious but, a little to salty (but, authentic for japanese taste)\n\ni wouldn't get their gyoza again.  pretty generic and expensive.\n\nthe ramen is cheap coming in at under $7 for the tonkatsu and $8 for the miso.\n\nthis place is damn good.  i went their for dinner and was so impressed i went back for lunch again the next day driving all the way from henderson.  \n\nmonta is pretty authentic looking and i hope it does well because i love little hole in the wall gems.", 
            "i went asap after reading mike c's review!  this is by far the best ramen i've had in vegas but this would maybe only be a 3 star place if it were located in japan. its certainly a 4+ star place in lv.  \n\nwe both got the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> which was pretty good although more miso-y than i expected.  i got the extra chashu which was great and pretty different than other chashu i've had as it had more of a roasted taste.  the gyoza was just ok.  my wife (japanese) was disappointed w/ the quality of the noodles but we'll take what we can get outside of japan.  \n\nthis certainly beats the hell out of the prices of yokohama kaigenro and i am psyched its so close to my place.  \n\ni'm more of a <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> guy which is what i'll get next time.", 
            "went here last night for dinner and had a tasty, satisfying meal.   the restaurant is small and casual.  we ordered some gyoza, a tonkatsu ramen and a <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with egg and kimchi and some cold <mark>Green Tea</mark>.  i loved that they offered kimchi as a side (i can't have ramen without it!) even though it was 'kimuchi' on the menu.  we tried to get the extra pork but they were out.  the gyoza was too greasy but tasted good.  the tonkatsu ramen was delish!  the broth was white, cloudy, flavorful and less greasy than the shoyu and the noodles were thinner.  \nthe shoyu would be perfect for a  hangover.  the broth was darker, clearer, greasier, and saltier than the tonkatsu.  the ramens come with some <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, and two pieces of tender pork. \nthe one thing that will keep me from going back is the temperature.  it is too hot in there, uncomfortably hot to really enjoy your meal especially if its a bowl of hot noodle soup.",

            "mmmmm, thank you yelp, this place is good, i love ramen and this place reminds me of orochon ramen in los angeles. not necessarily better but for las vegas this might be one of the best. \n\npros: the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> and tonkatsu were so good with extra <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> and chashu. my friend didn't like the chashu (pork) so much because she felt it was a weird texture thing but i loved it, put extra in mine and took hers, so my gain! tonkatsu noodles were good, and the egg was good but you had to let it sit in the hot broth for awhile, otherwise you'd realize that they tossed a cold egg in there. service was good, very friendly and nice.\n\nthe biggest cons were the size and the temperature. i got there early so i was able to secure a spot at the bar but outside of that, there were three small table for maybe four, and a group of eight sitting together and that's all there was room for. i couldn't imagine what this place is like during lunch hour or dinner. when i first arrived i didn't think the temperature was that bad since they have fans everywhere. but after eating hot ramen, having a couple asahis, and being right next to the busy kitchen, the sweat started coming (felt like i was cutting weight for a fight) but it's manageable. all in all, i will definitely be coming back here", 
            "love this ramen joint! had the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> and <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>, both very tasty, not too salty either. definitely better than ichiza's and shuseki. the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is becuz they don't have a freaking ac running and it gets freaking hot, even at nite after just a few mins in the restaurant...but i guess it's worth the sacrifice for some good ramen",

            "the 5 star bump up is courtesy of my mom and grandma in law loving this place. my mom in law doesn't like asian foods, but grandma does since she grew up in indonesia. bf and i are food adventurous- them not so much. it's sometimes a struggle sometimes finding new places to please everyone so when they're happy with something, it makes me very happy. \n\nwe like to bring them out of their comfort zone and let them explore a bit. they shared a tonkatsu ramen and a <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>. they said it was the best soup and best pork they ever had. \n\nbf tried the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>- it is similar in profile that it is still the creamy brother like the tonkatsu but the added miso paste just add some sweetness. it's good but just whatever you're more into will determine the best soup: tonkatsu- savory/saltier, miso- sweeter and cuts the saltiness down a bit. they are very similar though. \n\ni went a different route and got the hiyashi chuka which is listed on a white board (not on the menu) as \"cold noodle salad\". the cold noodles come with julienned cucumbers, tomato, kikurage mushrooms, pork slices, half a egg. it has a ponzu sauce and has a smudge of karachi mustard on the side of the bowl to add as you wish (a little adds a perfect kick to everything). i also got a small chasu bowl too which is topped with some <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> and nori. \n\nthe service is friendly and attentive. i always appreciate places that have very nice servers. i have a habit of talking about the service and i think maybe i should start actually naming good servers so that maybe businesses can pay attention to who in their staff is doing things right. miki ( pulled these off receipts) just happened to be our server each time. :-)\n\nupdate 9/13\nbrought my mom in law and grandma for lunch. they didn't hesitate to say to eat here since they love the tonkatsu ramen and the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>. i got hiyashi chuka again since i love that dish and they do it well here. i also got a <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> bowl. not for everyone, but i like spicy roe and rice.\n\nupdate 10/26\nnothing better than soup on a crappy day. <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> this time. it's good. i think tonkatsu is my favorite, but i'll order this again. sometimes i feel a bit of variety. i always get a <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> though :-) it's noms.\n\nupdate 11/07 \ntried doing half shoyu and half tonkatsu broth. you can now order it as such. keep in mind this has the skinny noodles and not the curly ones incase you prefer one or the other. i think this is my favorite broth. tonkatsu is delicious- but it's rich. shoyu is good- but it's a bit lighter than i want. marry the two together and it's a really nice inbetween flavor and consistency. this is what i'll be ordering from now on. i will try to ask if i can do a shoyu miso as well since i think that would be a good, more delicate balance. \n\nupdate 11/16\ngot a <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>, but also tried their gyoza. it's pan fried, nothing too exciting about them, just what you'd expect a gyoza to be like. i was in the mood for them, but not something i'd get often i think.", 
            "i have been looking for a place in las vegas to grab some good ramen for a very long time, and up until now i have yet to be very satisfied. after hearing so much about monta me and a few friends decided to check the place out rather than go with our usual tuesday night plan of getting wing tuesdays at buffalo wild wings.\n\nwe get to the parking lot and this place is pretty much something that you definitely had to hear about to come find because it was buried inside a small restaurant complex which i have passed a million times but never really noticed. the venue is very small. according to the max capacity sign it could only hold about 26 people but on a tuesday night, it wasn't very busy.\n\nas i was browsing the menu, i wasn't too excited. i was hoping that they would have a larger selection of different ramen because all of the previous places i had been to had at least 7-8 different kinds. monta however had 3 main types of ramen; tonkatsu ramen, <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>, and <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>. to go along with the ramen they had various different toppings you could add including boiled egg, extra slices of pork, more noodles, <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> among other things that i don't recall.\n\ni ended up ordering the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> with a boiled egg and 4 extra slices of pork and upon taking my first bite i was instantly satisfied. this was the ramen place i had been hoping to find all along. the pork was amazing and the egg was cooked just right. the miso broth and the noodles, everything blended in together so nicely. an order for extra noodles were only $2.00 but unfortunately, i had eaten just a little bit before going here so i couldn't get more but i will definitely be coming back much more often especially now that winter is around the <mark>Corn</mark> and a nice bowl of hot <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> will do me some good.\n\noverall the meal cost me $10 which, considering all of the toppings i added, is very, very decently priced. i recommend this place to anyone who like me has been looking for really good japanese ramen.", 
            "did you ever think there would be such a restaurant here in an \"all-nighter city\" that cooks and serves ramen noodles? yes, there is tucked in-between small shops along spring mountain road or otherwise known as \"chinatown\" in vegas.\n\nas you may or may not know it', \"ramen\" noodles is one of japanese noodles invented in 1958 by japan's nissin foods. these are thin, ribbon-like, lightweight, calorie-rich, tasty, and cheap that can be bought in packs of 1 or 10 (you can find them in your asian or oriental grocery near you or in any of your college friend's pantry). it's one of those quick cook-it-up soups.\n\nit's rather an eccentric choice of mine to dine in this place with my mom last night around 6 p.m. on a very rainy night in vegas. soup is the answer to the cold, wet rain! ramen is kind-of over-the-top in this restaurant!\n\nwith a sweet, smiling greeting from the waitress, \"moshi, moshi!\" in japanese, which translates to \"hello\" or rather \"welcome!\" (i have learned a few japanese greetings in high school and  having been to tokyo before, the greeting didn't sound \"foreign\"). it brought a smile to my lips, i knew i would have a good dining experience. \n\nthe restaurant is small and cozy but cheerful with minimalist japanese style decor including the bathroom's interior design was contemporary japanese. there are table seatings and bar-like seating available. menu is simple. three choices of ramen noodle soups in \"<mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>\" (pork bone), \"<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>\" (soy paste), and \"<mark>Miso Ramen</mark>\" (bean paste). nothing else to confuse any soup-hungry soup-lover. a list of toppings for the noodles soup for an extra charge, 8 \"other dishes\", 4 kinds of cold beverages, 2 kinds of beer choices, but no dessert and no hot beverages on the menu.\n\ni ordered the house specialty soup which is the \"tonkatsu ramen\" soup. it's very hearty soup in a thick, cloudy milk-like tasty broth. topped with <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, 3 slices of pork, bamboo shoots, and with kikurage (dried black mushrooms), i drizzled it with sesame seeds and hot spice powder. oh, wow, there was no need for chewing the roast pork that melted in my mouth. surely, the pork melts! another dish i ordered was the \"mimi mentaiko\" which consists of fish cod roe (or fish eggs which are red-orange in color is otherwise, caviar) with strips of nori seaweed and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> topped on a bowl of steamed japanese rice. very appetizing, a sure favorite! the \"<mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>\" is also one dish you ought to try; delicious. as usual <mark>Green Tea</mark> on ice was my beverage pairing for these meals.\n\nfunny thing...the cheerful smiling waitress who served us went to show her colleagues in the kitchen my soup bowl which made her shyly squeal in delight to show them all it was empty!! i caught a glimpse of the cook's smile.\n\nyes, i left nothing in the bowl, not even a drop of soup!\nit must have been that i really love soup, or it was cold and wet outside or just that i needed to fill my belly...how can you go wrong in making such a choice to eat for the night. for a price that's easy on your pocket, aahemm! wallet...an excellent deal! \"arigato gozaimas!\" (english translation is \"thank you!\"), as we left the restaurant in good spirit!",

            "my wife and i finally got to try this restaurant last night.  from all the reviews, we were excited to try this place out.  wow!!  we are fans.  the tonkotsu and <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> were excellent.  the thick noodle was cooked to perfection. the broth, in my opinion even tastes better than some of the restaurants in tokyo.  also the char siu is very flavourful, but a little too thinly sliced.  the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was also very good.  i am so happy that we finally have an authentic ramen noodle house in my backyard.  will definitely be back for more delicious ramen and broth.   i want to give 4.5 stars but i can't.  1/2 star off for those thin sliced char siu.", 
            "first off, i respect any place that has great service & a friendly staff, so as long as they're respectful, they get a ton of points just for that.\n\nmy friend suggested i go to this place when i asked for a place to eat at because my friend#2 and i were pretty hungry. a few of my other friends have also been visiting this place a lot within the past week so i finally got a chance to try it out.\n\nthe place is in a small plaza and the building itself is very small and cozy. when we went there, the place was somewhat busy and there was limited seating. there was just one table left and instead of taking it, i took the bar with my friend because i thought another bigger party might need it later.\n\nbecause of a friend's suggestion, i ordered <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> for my first time, but that was disappointing. i didn't like it, but my friend did. he had his with the boiled egg as well. maybe it's because i'm not a ramen eater or something, but it was somewhat salty to me and i didn't really like the taste. i wonder if it has something to do with it being miso? i don't know.\n\nmy goal is to try all 3 types of ramen they have just to see if there is one i'll really like. i shall update then. they also have extra stuff that you can add to your ramen (ie: egg, extra pork, corn, etc.) that starts at $0.75+. the menu is quite cute and small. the choices are limited, but i think it's just right. beats all those menus that are overwhelming.\n\nmy friends all love this place. give it a try and you might fall in love with it, too.\n\nupdate: i've tried all the ramen and ever since, i always go back for tonkatsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>. updated to 5 stars.", 
            "i've always been on the lookout for good japanese ramen, and i always thought that ichiza's ramen was the closest i'd ever get to authentic. boy was i proven wrong, monta's was the most amazing and flavorful ramen i've ever had in a long time.  i'm not from japan, but i am from hawaii so i do know what good ramen's supposed to taste like.  despite it being a little pricey, i say i'd go back for another bowl.  the people were nice, and the atmosphere is very chill.  i ordered the tonkatsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> and added pork belly, nori, hard boiled egg, corn and butter....and damn! did that intensify the flavor. my best friend ordered the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> with pork, and nori.  his didn't look as amazing as mine, but it was good regardless.", 
            "when we woke up today it was and my wife had a cold. so we figured it would be a good day for soup and headed off to monta for some ramen.\n\nwe both ordered <mark>Green Tea</mark> hoping for a soothing, warm start to the meal. the waiter brought out two cans of cold <mark>Green Tea</mark>. we explained we were expecting hot tea and were told they don't have any hot tea. so we asked for water with lemon but were told they don't have lemon. i ended up ordering a <mark>Diet Coke</mark> and my wife stuck with plain water\n\nthings went smoother from there.\n\ni ordered the tonkatsu ramen with egg, nori, and mustard greens. it was good, salty.\n\nmy wife ordered the tonkatsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with egg and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>. it was also good and less salty than mine.\n\ni highly recommend getting the eggs. it was a great addition to both. beyond that, choose what you like.\n\noverall, i preferred my wife's ramen and she preferred mine. we switched midway through though i was only halfway done and she'd finished two-thirds of hers. i got ripped off.\n\nwe also ordered kimchee and gyoza. the kimchee was good but nothing special. the gyoza never arrived. however, the kimchee and ramen were plenty, so we didn't make a big deal of it. (i did check the receipt and verified we weren't charged for the gyoza.)\n\ngreat place for a rainy day, some of the best ramen i've ever had.", 
            "destined to find yummy ramen where ever my travels takes me...lol. a little removed from the strip for the tourist but not too difficult to find.  definitely a busy place at around 7ish on a weekday night. lucked out for a table as there are only 5/6 depending how they're arranged for size. wood benches, chairs, stools, tables and wainscoting lined the restaurant.   there's also l shaped seating for around 10, bar style, around the kitchen area.  the restaurant later filled up with people waiting outside, so be prepared to wait during the typical eat times.\n\nmenu was simple as there was only 3 types of ramen you could order, miso, shoyu, tonkotsu and a couple of rice dishes.  decided to try the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> ($6.95) with toppings (ranges from $0.50 - $1.50) corn, kimchi, and kaedama (extra noodles).  the broth was tasty and not too salty and the pork was flavourful with the melt in your mouth taste.  the corn was not too <mark>Butter</mark> but the kimchi could of been better. i was expecting more taste from the kimchi, as it was toned down from other ramen places i've tried in the past as well as korean restaurants. the extra noodles was served on the side and was fist sized.  do this if you're extra hungry...i was comatose after finishing this.  the noodle was a little skinnier than expected but had the right consistency and texture. the gyoza was not too my liking (didnt finish) and i can live off dumplings! the exterior was grilled too long aka burnt and the 'insides' was semi cold like another yelper had mentioned....hmmmm...im guessing store bought?  i imagine them being frozen and put on the grill not long enough but on extra high heat!!! (i know this how??? i make them when i'm home...lol)\n\nyes, i'd come here again for a quick bowl of noodles but thats about it.", 
            "my first experience with authentic japanese ramen, and i was not disappointed. prior to monta, the only types of ramen i ate were in packages, cups and bowls, usually korean in descent and instant in nature. so i was surprised, in a good way, when i discovered that japanese ramen is nothing like the ramen i've eaten before. \n\nmy boyfriend was craving ramen for dinner, so i immediately suggested monta noodle house after remembering all the positive reviews on yelp. we entered the restaurant and, thankfully, they had a table for two available. the restaurant itself is small, reminiscent of an authentic ramen house in japan (at least in my mind). service was friendly and quick given the ratio of servers to customers. \n\nafter reading over the menu, he ordered the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> with extra char siu and a <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> while i ordered the tonkotsu/<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> and an order of gyoza. here is the breakdown of the food:\n\ngyoza- hot pan-fried pork and vegetable dumplings with just the right amount of crisp from the charred skin which contrasted well with the soft and juicy meat filling. overall, very good and savory. \n\n<mark>Miso Ramen</mark>- he enjoyed his ramen, saying that it tasted very authentic. i tried some of his ramen, and while i preferred the broth of his ramen, i liked the thinner noodles from my ramen more. \n\n<mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark>- he enjoyed this as well. i think it was the perfect light contrast to the heavy ramen. \n\ntonkotsu/<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>- delicious! the noodles were perfectly cooked, and the vegetables added texture and mildness to the rich broth. my only complaints are that the broth was just a tad too salty for my taste and the char siu lacked the meatiness i wanted. \n\noverall, we enjoyed dinner that night. i enjoyed my experience there so much that two days after my initiation into the japanese ramen world i went again with my mom.", 
            "we ordered the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> and <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.  i did enjoy the soup but i felt the noodles were a bit al dente.  i've had better <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, it just had tons of chunky onions in it.  \n\na quick fix to my ramen craving in vegas.", 
            "finally! a very good ramen joint in vegas. this place is much more the real japanese ramen joint than the (now defunct) togoshi ramen.\n\nmonta is in a small strip mall on sprint mountain rd, just west of decatur. it is very easy to miss as you go by. and the shop is very small, with only four 4 place table, 1 2 place table, and about 10 counter seats. they only accept cash so beware.\n\ni recently learned of this place right here on yelp and had to give it a try. like others on this forum, i grew up eating fantastic ramen all over japan. and have long been searching... i was elated when santouka came to the states and even more ecstatic when local joints like orenchi (cupertino, ca) that are very much like the ramen i used to know in japan... started to pop up.\n\ni'd like to preface this review with the fact that i like tonkotsu, thick chijirimen (wavy noodles) usually, so i am usually biased towards that. monta has 4 basic types of ramen flavors: tonkotsu, shoyu, miso, and new (at least it said new today) tonkotsu shoyu which is a combination of the tonkotsu and shoyu broths.\n\ntonkotsu, of course, is pork based broth. the shoyu uses chicken broth (according to monta), but i also detected some dashi (fish based) in there as well. tonkotsu, and tonkotsu shoyu uses thin straight noodles. shoyu and miso uses the thick wavy noodles. each ramen @  $6.95 comes with 2 slices of char shu, kikurage (woodear mushrooms), memma (seasoned bamboo shoots), and chopped <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>. there are other toppings available as mentioned in other reviews, along with kaedama (literally means \"replacement ball\") extra noodles.\n\nkaedama is usually ordered as you go, not in the beginning. this is because if get it at the same time as your ramen, then the noodles either go cold, or get overcooked. this is one of the reasons why i do not like places that have a \"large\" size. by the time you're half way through, the noodles are too overcooked. i commend monta for doing the kaedama the right way.\n\nanyway, i was @ monta today, thu, at 2 pm, and the place had a waiting list 8 deep! it took us abobut 20 minutes to get seated, and as we got seated, the wait line even got longer. ok... my expectations are way high... but be cautious... this, after all, is the only ramen only joint in vegas....\n\ni ordered the tonkotsu shoyu with nitamago and extra char shu. my wife had the shoyu with nitamago. we also had gyoza. in the kitchen, there are basically 2 guys preparing the dishes. one guy that does the ramen, another that does the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and others. and with the packed house, the service was slow.\n\nbut when the ramen finally came, i was not disappointed. despite my doubts, the tonkotsu shoyu had a wonderful balance and marriage of pork and chicken broth. my wife's shoyu, i believe due to the chicken stock, had a very mellow aspect to it which also gave the tonkotsu a very mellow and non-overpowering flavor. i finished the broth to the last drop, including my wife's shoyu/chicken broth.\n\nthe noodles... my thin noodles were not overcooked, and about just right when my ramen came out. but because of its thinness, by the time i got half way through my ramen (and i'm a relatively quick ramen eater, beating my wife by a good 10 minutes :-)) was way overcooked and mushy soft. next time, i will see if they will cook it less (katame, or as i do at kyushu jyangara in tokyo, bari-kata... crispy as in ironed with starch). my wife's chijirimen was very good with good amount of al dente,a and the chewiness one expects in good ramen.  if i can't get them to cook the thin noodles to super al dente, then my backup plan is to have them use the thick noodles in the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>.\n\nthe boiled egg is soft boiled, but the yolk does not run. i like my soft boiled egg a with a bit more runny yolk. but nevertheless it was still good. the char shu was one the the better ones i had in the states. very tender, melts in your mouth, with good flavor... not too over powering, not too bland. the slices were on the thin side, but i got a total of 8 slices by ordering the extra char shu topping ($2.50). \n\nin summary both the tonkotsu shoyu and <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> were done very well, with a good balance of broth, noodles, and toppings in a dish that came together very very well. too many times, i have been to ramen places in the states where the broth may be good, but noodles lack, or vice versa, or even where all the individual ingredients are good, but the finished product just doesn't cut it.\n\nthe gyoza, unlike one reviewer here, i though were also very good. i would beg to differ that this is not like store bought gyoza as it is stuffed with pork whereas the store bought ones are more heavy on the nappa cabbage and not stuffed. the flavor is also very good, however, i like my gyoza wet...that is with a bit more juice as you bite into them.\n\nin the end though, i give monta 5 stars even with the few deficiencies. monta, in my book, share the top honors with orenchi in cupertino,", 
            "this place opens at 11:30am and we came at around 11:45 with no wait. by the time our food came (around noon), there's a wait already (small place plus the fact it's probably the only good ramen joint in vegas at good prices).  \n\nwhen you come in, look on the right, there's white board with the tonkotsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> on it for 6.95, this is the same as the menu, nothing special about it since everything is on the menu.  \n\nyou can tell the ramen is not store bought cuz it's alot fresher and it's thinner than usual. the broth was good, but on the salty side.  had the pork belly rice bowl too, the meat was real tender but the sauce was on the salty side.  \n\ntip: if u wanna do lunch there, go early or really late since there will almost be a line there.  but overall a pretty good place to have lunch.", 
            "monta is definitely one of the better ramen shops in las vegas. its in the same strip mall as raku on decatur/ spring mtn. \n\nmonta reminds us of japan's ramen shops...its all about order your food, eat your food, and get out, so the next group can eat. it's not a posh restaurant, minimal tables/ seats. the restaurant holds at most 30 people (5 tables of 4 seats and about 10 seats on the counter), so if you go with a large party, just sit wherever you can and when you can or you might be waiting for awhile.\n\nthe menu is simple. miso, tonkatsu, or <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>. my favorite is...all of them. huge stock pots in the back have been boiling bones and veg for hours to create the backbone of their heavenly broth.  i seem to be on a tonkatsu ramen kick lately with its hearty broth... you could add some thickener to the broth and you would have a damn good gravy. they give you a good amount of ramen, a few slices of tender charsiu, bamboo, takenoko, <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, half boiled egg, and kikurage. its a solid meal for a cheap price, $7-8 and you can add other extras for a small price.\n\nanother favorite is their <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>. its cheap and filling...not to mention very tasty. you get the thinly sliced pork served over rice in a small bowl garnished with beni shoga. its tasty, fatty, and better when you get eat a little beni shoga (red pickled ginger) with it.. we always get a small bowl and share it.\n\ntheir gyoza is good as is the kim chee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. we need to try more of the items on their menu but we are creatures of habit and sometimes its hard to stray away from the  dishes that monta is known for.\n\nits easy to over order food at monta. because the ramen bowls are big...resist ordering other dishes unless you have a big party and you want to share. \n\nmonta is great on a hot day and better on a cold day!! \n\narooha!!!!!", 
            "very nice noodle house.  good service, quaint layout, and the price can't be beat.\n\ni'm struggling giving it another star because i noticed somethings in the 20 minutes i was there to make you go hmmmm.  you heard me 20 minutes to get in, order a <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> and asahi and get out.  can't beat that for efficiency.\n\nmenu is straight and to the point, if you are not here for ramen, go somewhere else.  broths are tonkatsu, shoyu, and miso.  shoyu is the base for me (kinda like vanilla ice cream).  soup comes standard with a few thin slices of roast pork, <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, bamboo shoots, and some seaweed.  the noodles were decent but not homemade, very stock machine made ramen.  i like my ramen al dente, these were not.  i did add the pat of butter for $.50 which was a nice addition, but totally over priced.\n\nsat at the bar so had full view of kitchen and how things were prepared.  didn't like how the cooks did not sanitize very well, bare hands on food doesn't bother me, but when you grab an egg and some  pork slices, i'd like to see you wash them hands before moving on to the next order.  also noticed their kim chee was out of a bottle, which they could have done a better job at concealing if they kept it towards the back.\n\nif you are looking for a nice spot to get your ramen on, i would totally suggest going here.  keep your party to 4 or less otherwise it would be a stretch to find seating for everyone.", 
            "unlike the former us marine (ahem tien n.) i give this place four stars. although i haven't had the opportunity to eat authentic japanese food in the land ot the rising sun, the food that is served at monta is nonetheless delicious. if you had food in japan and expect this place to be 100% authentic then you may be dissapointed. but if you eat it for what it is then i can promise you that you will not be dissappointed.\n\nit's like when you have expectations before you watch a movie at the theatre, then you will most likely be let down. but if you watch it for what it is then you will enjoy it, unless the movie completey sucks.\n\ni had the \"<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>\" with extra noodles, and the additions of the egg and pork. the broth was rich with lots of flavor, but the best part was the pork. it was so succulent and flavorful. i recommend adding the chili powder and the sesame seeds to your soup for even more flavor.\n\nservice was great and the food is served quickly. only downside is the price, since all toppings for the ramen are extra charge, so by the time you add on 1-3 toppings you're looking at an average price of about $13 for a bowl. the restaurant is also very small, so prepare to wait for a while if the they're busy, which is most of the time.\n\nif you love ramen, authentic or not, definitely check this place out, it'll be worth your time.\n\nmonta noodle house is so great i vow never to give it up, never let it down, never turn around and desert it. never going to say good bye and never going to tell a lie...", 
            "coming from the venetian, i was blissfully leaving the tourist sin otherwise known as grand lux cafe to stumble into the gritty strip mall that houses monta, just right down the street.  in my love-hate relationship with vegas, things like this definitely belonged to the first category.  \n\ntwo groups of very jovial japanese business men occupied the cozy joint when we walked in.  they seemed right at home, joyfully exchanging conversations from across the restaurants to each other as well as the waitresses.  from the smiling eyes to the careless laughter, i make the speculation that they were tourists happy to have found monta.  i've been there, that rare delight from finding a great vietnamese restaurant somewhere completely unexpected.  \n\nit was a frigid night.  lips cracked from the desert air, my mouth greedily welcomed the steaming broth of the tonkatsu ramen, rich with pork bone flavor and complimented with smooth strings of fresh noodles.  had it been warmer weather, i'd have opted for the tonkatsu-<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>, a bit lighter with the mix-in of chicken-flavored shoyu broth.  \n\ni could do without the pricey upsell of add-ons, but i still highly recommend them, especially the soft-boiled egg, corn, and seaweed.  you may end up spending nearly 10 bucks on ramen, but it's still a better choice than anything at grand lux",

            "i took my friend gerald here when he said he was itching for ramen. at first, i was going to take him to togishi ramen (how come i didn't know this place was closed!?!? i'm sooo sad!) but once i discovered that it was closed, we tried this place on a recommendation from a friend. for me, this was my second attempt at this place because the first time it was packed. there's a little bench in front of the restaurant that had at least four people sitting on it and three more people waiting. \n\nwhen we got there, we were seated immediately. the place was very small and tight, but there was definitely a japanese feel to it. i ordered the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with cha shu pork and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>. gerald had the same thing but instead of the <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, he added a soft boiled egg (after i saw his, i wanted an egg too!!!) the service was quick, pleasant and honestly, was what was expected. i was not disappointed. \nas for my ramen...it was delicious!!! it was the perfect temperature, had just enough flavor and hit the spot!! i only had two disappointments: \n\n1) the limited menu - i enjoyed what i had, but i think i would have liked to see more choices. \n2) feeling rushed - not by the staff, but by the people who were waiting. they just stood by my table and i felt like they were rushing us because their party was seated right next to me. not the restaurant's fault, but perhaps they should come up with a seating system or take reservations for large parties or peak periods. \n\ni will definitely try this place again! i give my ramen 4 stars, but until i try something else on their menu, i'll stick with my 3. yummy ramen if you're craving it!",

            "i went to vegas recently for a mini-getaway, and being the crazy ramen aficionados that we are, my boyfriend and i had to come here and try this place during our trip.\n\nwe both ordered the tonkotsu-<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with extra chashu and hard-boiled (more like deliciously and perfectly soft-boiled!) egg.  the broth was absolutely delicious--just the right amount of flavor and rich pork fatty goodness to make it taste perfect!  even though it was 103 degrees outside, i didn't care.  i ate and drank the entire bowl clean.  gluttony at its finest.  woo!  i was extremely impressed with the quality and texture of their chashu.  it was marinated just right and they really did cook it for hours to get it to really melt in my mouth!  the moment i bit into a piece, i didn't even really have to chew at all...it immediately disintegrated into orgasmic morsels of ecstasy and rocked a party in my mouth!  the egg was perfection...just the way all ramen \"hard-boiled\" (i still think they should call them \"soft-boiled\"...it just suits the texture better!) eggs should be.  the yolk was nice and and gooey and soft.  it complimented the ramen broth so well!  needless to say, i wolfed down the entire bowl in about 10 minutes or less. hehe ^_^  \n\nwe also got an order of the regular <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, and the only thing i can say is that it is the best japanese <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> i have ever had in my life thus far (in the states).  the rice was so extremely flavorful and light (because too much oil is a no-no).  sprinkled with those little slices of heaven known as their chashu and plenty of pickled ginger, it tasted phenomenal.  that was the 2nd party that rocked my mouth in one sitting!  boy, what an awesomely dining experience!\n\nexquisite ramen.  good price.  great service.  will most definitely have to visit again whenever we're in the area.\n\noh, and my brother (who doesn't eat pork) also came with us.  he ordered the kimchi (or spicy?) <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> without the pork and really enjoyed his food.  he was even full off just that one single plate, so their portions are very reasonable, considering the elephant-sized appetite that he has.", 
            "best ramen in town imho... the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> broth is savory and quite rich, but a bit too salty for me. i tend to lean more towards the tonkatsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> where for me the broth is to my liking. all ramens are delicious though and i would recommend trying them all. my favorite adds are extra <mark>Chashu Pork</mark>, egg, shreaded <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>. i alway leave enough broth to order kaedama (extra noodles).", 
            "simple amazing.  the noodles here were fantastic with a nice variety of different sauces to completely customize your meal.  \ni had the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> and it was wonderful.  the noodles and pork were fantastic.  the broth was also incredibly flavorful with a smoother, milder taste.  i tried the tonkatsu broth too which is equally wonderful but in a more milky, slightly heavier way.  the gyoza was also great especially paired with some of the sauces. \nthis was definitely one of the best things i have eaten in a long time.  the fact that i was hungover and had spent the morning in the desert only added to the greatness.\n\nthe place had a very nice, and subtle ambiance.  the place was clean, the decorations were very simple but had personality and the place drew a nice crowd that was more than just the tourists that clog the strip.  the wait staff was also incredibly helpful, efficient, and friendly.  i liked that when my table ordered the gyoza they said it would be ready in seven minutes.  now that's service!  oh, and they have a/c now. so your desert heat fears can be alleviated.\n\nif you're in vegas and want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the strip and also want some great ramen this is the place to go.  i definitely recommend going.  also, great hangover food.", 
            "when you think of ramen you would think cup 'o' noodles but after coming here for the first time i will never think of ramen the same way again. the place is pretty small and seats about about 30 people, but from what i've heard from people that have been to japan the look and feel of the place would be your typical ramen house. the first time i visited monta was with a group of 6 and the wait wasn't that bad considering it was during lunch and the place was pretty packed. i also liked the fact that you can sit at the counter in front of the cooks so you can see all the action going on in the kitchen.\n\nthe food here is awesome, from the ramen to the gyoza to the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> all are simple dishes with outstanding flavor. i've tried both the shoyu and the tonkotsu-<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> the only difference was the broth where the tonkotsu was a pork bone flavored broth. in both they put slices of pork which have been slowly braised to the point it melts in your mouth. so if you're a pork lover this is the place to come check out. the noodles are cooked to perfection and by watching the cooks they use a fresh noodles in which they cook to order. the texture combination of the soft pork and the chewy noodles makes you want more and more.\n\ni guarantee you will never pick up the package ramen ever again after you've visited monta. so if your looking for a quick bite and want quality japanese ramen come check out monta it will make you say \"cup 'o' what???\"", 
            "i'm so glad my gf found this place on yelp for our final lunch at vegas!\n\nwe ordered:\n- tonkatsu ramen: absolutely wonderful smooth & milky pork-based broth. my favorite ramen is at shin sen gumi, and this bowl of ramen was very comparable, if not better. i also added toppings of a hard boiled egg and extra slices of pork - they gave 6 extra slices in addition to the two slices of pork that came with the bowl by default. i decided to avoid the kimchi because i didn't want the korean toppings to dominate the japanese broth. noodles were cooked perfect, and you can order extra noodles for $1.50.\n- <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>: this is the darker one, i believe it's miso/soy based. my gf had this, and i tried the broth and it seemed equally as delicious.\n- gyoza: it's like lightly grilled potstickers\n- <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>: typical <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> as expected - not something to die for, but good.\n- kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>: pretty much exactly like the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, except that it had a bit of the tangy flavor that the kimchi added\n- pork bellow bowl: this was my favorite out of the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> bowls. lightly cooked, tender, moist and juicy pork belly strips layered on top of <mark>White Rice</mark>. definitely worth getting along with the ramen.\n\nservice was fantastic. our group of 5 was sixth on the waitlist, but it moved pretty fast; we waited maybe about 20 or so minutes.\n\ncliff notes: tonkatsu ramen with hardboiled egg and extra pork. <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>.",

            "asian people love noodles. i am asian, therefore i love noodles.\n\ni was saddened by our earlier trip to monta where the waitress told us the wait would be close to an hour.  my growling stomach couldn't bear to wait so we settled for someplace else, cough swish shabu shabu cough, and was very unsatisfied. so we decided to give it one more try on my last night in vegas.\n\nthey won't seat you until your whole party is there and luckily the other two people made it just in time.  this is a cozy restaurant which just adds to the ambiance a japanese noodle house.  \n\nmenu: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/upiyurazvkninod1w8kqrq?select=0ivynxxhiyabnfoadj1era\n\ni ordered the tonkotsu- <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/upiyurazvkninod1w8kqrq?select=7-ni-npnmemyeojbnzksug\n\ni thought the ramen was delicious.  you could tell the noodles were \"wendy's\", fresh not frozen, and the garnish were all nicely cooked.  the pork was so tender and fatty and delicious.  you could eat that all day fa sho. \n\nwe also tried the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and the gyoza.  gyoza is top notch, some of the best i've ever had and i had some godly ones in japan..  the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was pretty delicious as well.\n\ni really liked my experience here.  the waitresses seemed to be imported straight from japan, very hospitable and nice.  the food was excellent.  and it didn't break our wallets either.\n\nso if you're asian or not, and you're craving ramen in las vegas, monta is definitely a \"safe bet\".. vegas pun intended.", 
            "i recently decided to try \"monta\" again when my mom came into town. i knew my mom would not like \"anime ramen\" because it's too loud in there. i wanted to originally take her to \"yagyu yakiniku\" because they have a very spicy broth that i know she likes, but to our surprise they were closed when we got there. and, we didn't like the new \"ramen sora\" when we went there a month ago... so we had no choice but to try monta. \n\nwe usually don't like to go to monta because of the long wait time to get a seat, but to our surprise there was no line and we were sat immediately. i've come to the conclusion that if you go before 5:00, there is usually no wait time. \n\nthe thing i like the best about monta is that you always get good service here. if i rank the service from 1 to 10(with 1 being the lowest),  i have never experienced anything less than a 20!\n\nthis time, i tried the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>. it was excellent. i think they have the best <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> in the world. no other restaurant compares. \n\neveryone knows from my previous reviews that my favorite ramen in the world is <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>. the thing about <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> is that no region has a similar recipe. and ramen houses that are located in the same area will always try to copy each others style. in san diego, the popular ramen houses pack their miso broth with boiled cabbage and give you nothing but noodles and broth. that means you get no egg, charsiu, bamboo, or fungus like you do anywhere else. in los angeles, the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> is typically pure white in color, and extremely spicy. at the restaurants which are run by ethnically chinese people who are japanese in nationality, the broth is very smooth, thin, and full of sesame oil. now, las vegas is the only region that doesn't have a typical style of  <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>. monta's <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> has a broth that is pure yellow, smooth in texture, not spicy, and the taste of the actual miso beans is extremely strong. anime ramen has a miso that is almost identical to what you get at the ethnically chinese-japanese ramen houses.  and yagyu has a spicy white-broth ramen that is very oily, and heavy in meats.  so, if you like a non-spicy traditional japanese taste then monta is for you. if you like a spicy traditional japanese ramen that has way more meat than noodles, then yagyu is for you. if you like a thin broth full of sesame with all the sides included, then anime ramen is for you. that's what i like about the lv ramen scene: diversity! \n\nin the end, after trying monta again after many months, i have come to the conclusion that monta is still the undisputed champion of las vegas ramen.", 
            "before my friends tricked me into going to monta, i thought the only kind of ramen available were the packs for 19 cents, how naive. as i'm sure you've heard the place only seats about 20 people at a time and there is often times a wait, but it's very much worth it. their menu is quite small but everything on there is a knock out. feeling like you can't go wrong when you order is an awesome feeling. i personally order the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with corn and <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, the first time i tired this i knew there was a heaven. it's so savory and authentic, if you ever go, take a spoonful of the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> dip it in the broth and i guarantee your taste buds will be enraptured with a euphoric taste. the price is fairly cheap as well around $15 a person. the waitresses are very friendly as well and always take time to teach me some new japanese every time i go. i definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for something different within a reasonable prince range.", 
            "upon a friend's recommendation, i decided to head over to try monta one night. it was 10 pm and dining options were starting to get scarce. the place was tucked away in a little mini mall. plenty of parking in the lot, but it can be a tight fit.\n\nat this time, the place was still relatively full. we were able to get the last open table. the menu is short and to the point. you can choose from four types of ramen broths, add your toppings, or even add extra noodles. as for other menu items, there was some <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> options and handmade gyozas. we ordered the tonkatsu ramen with charsui, egg, and nori; the tonkatsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> (a bit less rich than the regular tonkatsu ramen) with same toppings; pork belly rice bowl; kimchee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and an order of gyoza. all tasted great, especially the charsui topping. it had more flavor than in other ramen spots i've eaten at. i could've ordered another order of gyoza. \n\nall in all, a surprisingly good spot that i'll visit again. keep in mind, they open till 1:00 pm on friday and saturday, but they only have about 7 tables and another 7 seats at the counter.", 
            "really nice place and worth it as long as you go there right when it opens of off hours.\n\nthis is my third visit to monta but first time to review.  \n\n1.  the lines - the place is typical for a ramen shop, with limited space to eat and to wait, but it is worth it.  my suggestion is to go when it opens and it will be all good.\n\n2.  the food -  have had:\na.  <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> - bean paste ramen, very tasty. noodles perfect.\nb.  <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> - soy sauce flavored broth and a nice stand by.\nc.  tonkatsu ramen - pork bone broth - my favorite.\n\nall noodles are just right, al dente and the broth is not piping hot as i would expect, but tasty overall.  perhaps they believe the western palate does not prefer the hot broth, but to me, it has to be piping hot to be perfect.  the soups have a perfect blend of roasted pork slices that are tender and tasty.\n\n3.  price - very reasonable, approximately 7.00 depending if you put extra stuff in the noodles.\n\ncheck this place out.  you will not be disappointed.", 
            "by far only place too go for ramen! growing up in hawaii ramen just about stable food as spam musubi. so too finally find ramen place same style food excited. it has all the same character small place holds less then fifty people, bar area (cool get see them make the ramen), and when the place gets packed line out the door. it soo worth the wait. the timing is hit or miss. they first open in the morning for lunch that time always count on line. the whole small hole in the wall love because look where the restaurant located understand.\n\nthe food all the ramen is good. <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> i die for!! the flavor is spot on the depth nice light broth and depending if order additional topping can be hearty noodle dish. i prefer couple extras. other thing find must really perfect compliment too big bowl of ramen is gyoza. it steamed perfectly then seared off on flat top too perfection and the filling is tasty. the gyoza sauce optional but must only way too have it combine together is divine. \n\nthey other sides i order the kim chee good but stand out is kim chee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. it could ordered big bowl of that if they had it on the menu. =( it not over spicy but just the right amount of balance. they even have one beer offer on tap never think see small the place is never been good one too. i not remember name of it. sorry.\n\nthe service is excellent. all the servers are very friendly and attentive. the prices are really reasonable. it light healthy tasty any time meal! =))) if never been say give it try!!!", 
            "this place is amazing! i had never tried real ramen before and was take here by a friend for lunch one day. there are the 3 types of ramen you can have (tonkotsu \"pork bone\", miso \"bean paste\" or shoyu \"soy sauce\"). they also have a list of extra toppings like pork, egg, onion, corn, or kimuchi. you can also add extra noodles.\n\nthe ramen was really good and the place always seems to be very packed every time i come here. i liked it so much the one time i went for lunch i made it the place to go for my birthday outing. there were about 8 of us and even though the place was small they were eventually able to see us. we did have to wait a bit for enough people to clear out to get an appropriate sized table but everyone in my party loved this place. it was perfect for a cold november day.\n\nthe staff is very friendly and if you have any questions about the menu they are really helpful. they have other items on the menu but it's really about the ramen. also, the price is ridiculously reasonable for the amount of food you're given. $7-$8 for the ramen and $.50-$2.50 for toppings. \n\ni personally always get the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with pork topping. very good every time.", 
            "very good ramen.  not the best i've had, but absolutely solid and definitely hits the spot since i haven't had good ramen in several months.  i got the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> and added nori, egg, and char sui.  yes, i missed ramen.  the portion was completely decent.  the char sui was a waste of additional money i felt because the pork was way too fatty and broke apart too much in the soup.  not worth the trouble, especially when there was no particularly special flavor to it.  they serve canned iced <mark>Green Tea</mark> which was delicious as well.", 
            "i'm no ramen guy. actually, this is my first experience with true ramen from a restaurant. it definitely met my expectations. i got the tonkotsu-<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> on my friend's advice, and i also split some <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. loved the rich broth, the texture of the noodles, and the way that the chashu (which isn't like what i'm used to) just melted away in my mouth. i can see how some people would complain of saltiness, but i liked it just fine. the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was also delicious, although it did seem pricey for, you know, <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.\n\ni was surprised at first by how small the place is, but after it became apparent that this is a spot for a quick meal, including rapid filling of orders, i saw how they could get away with it. you definitely shouldn't pick this place if you wanna linger around for an hour or more.", 
            "definitely had to find a japanese ramen place in my new locale. \n\nluckily, some friends were in town and wanted to come back to their ramen house of choice. \n\nsimple menu options and great appetizers selection. \n\ni had the tonkotsu-<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> and had a few spoonfuls of the <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark>, which were both flavorful and delicious. \n\nthey request that your full party is there before you're seated, even had a bar to sit at which was quite nice for the smaller parties. \n\nwill come back to this place when i need my ramen fix.", 
            "i gotta agree 100% with respected yelper: tien n's review. he was the only guy brave enough to leave a low rating for monta. personally, i think that most people are riding the bandwagon and just rating this place up because everyone else is. i came again today, and just couldn't enjoy the ramen here like i used to. \n\nlike most of my yelp friends already know, i am somewhat an expert at ramen. during my college years, my friend takeichi and i went on a bizarre and pointless quest across the west coast in order to eat <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> at every single famous ramen house in america. 30 days and over 50 ramen houses later, we declared ourselves ramen masters.\n\nramen has a lot of historical and cultural significance to the japanese people. after the defeat of the imperial forces in ww2, japan had practically become a poverty stricken 3rd world country. it was around then that ramen became extremely popular due to how cheap the ingredients were. there was one ramen house in san diego which i visited years ago, that had the exact variation of post ww2 ramen. the ramen itself was practically a less salty version of shio. it had absolutely nothing in it besides for noodles and salt water. that means, you get no charsiu, egg, or vegetables. personally, i thought it was the worst bowl of ramen i have ever had. the owner of the ramen house told me that the only reason she serves this depressing version of ramen is because of it's cultural significance. at least monta doesn't have anything that bad...    \n\ni guess the reason i originally liked monta was because i was so used to eating the extremely spicy style of ramen from california, so when i first had monta's <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> it was so different that i actually thought it was good. i can't identify which regional variation of ramen is served at monta. me and takeichi think that it might be a specific shibuya variation, but we just can't come to a positive conclusion. but, we do believe though that it definitely is some kind of tokyo variation.\n\ni myself have begun to believe that the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> at monta is actually a combination of toyko style and a random american style. in the 1960s, ichiro mashita created the \"california roll\" because americans kept complaining to him that his rolls that had otoro in it tasted like garbage.  i kind of think that monta's recipe is the \"california roll\" of the ramen world. and that's why it's rare to find a full-blooded japanese person eating here.\n\nweird observation:the tonkatsu and the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> here at monta taste almost identical. this is very unusual. those two should never taste that  similar.\n\none of my friends who is full-blooded korean always refused to come here with us. when i asked him why, he said it was because koreans believe that ramen is \"the food of the rats\". i don't know what that's supposed to mean....\n\nit is just so difficult to move around here. the seats are designed for people who are less than 5'5\" and weight around 120lbs. the stools at the bar area are very uncomfortable. walking to the bathroom is difficult because you keep having to bump into other customers and the girls at the cash register. it's common for ramen houses to be small, even the most popular ramen house in america(orochon) only seats like 20 people and the chairs are very uncomfortable. but, somehow monta is far worse. \n\nlike 90% of the customers here are yelpers. every time i come here i recognize someone from their yelp picture. \n\nwhen i was here today, i overheard a person talking about how monta is \"the greatest\" and anime ramen is \"fake ramen\". to me, anime ramen is far better than monta. anime actually gives you gigantic portions of bamboo, mushrooms, corn, eggs, and charsiu for free, while monta charges extra and only gives about 1 tbsp of micro-sized diced bamboo. today, i ordered extra butter and i got a teaspoon. at sora or anime, they would have loaded my bowl with butter. also, at sora and anime, the bowls are at least 30% larger.  but, the best thing about anime is that they give you 3 slices of narutomaki for free.  also, the guy who runs anime ramen is a guy named ryosuke and his dad is one of the most  famous traditional japanese sushi chefs in america, so i don't understand where this \"non-japanese\" rumor is coming from.   \n\ni still believe that monta has the best <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>, but out of the 3 major ramen houses in lv(monta,anime,sora), i gotta say that monta has the worst <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>. maybe the reason why monta has bad <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> is because it is a toyko style ramen house. and toyko style ramen houses always specialize in shoyu. while, it is the sapporo style ramen houses that always specifically specialize in <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>(<mark>Miso Ramen</mark> was invented in the city of sapporo).  but, i still love the excellent customer service here, so i'll give monta 3-stars.", 
            "best ramen in vegas hands down. tried their fusion of tonkatsu and <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>. great broth, but wasn't a big fan of the thinner noodles, but they were very good. my friend got the shoyu one.. wished i had gotten that one. i like the fact is that they designed it to make you feel like you are in one of those hole in the wall ramen shops in japan. great experience and good food.", 
            "delicious, great place to go if your a noodle lover. although the location is very small, so most likely your going to be waiting. better bring a cold bottle of water to keep you cool not much waiting room inside. my wife suggest adding the boiled egg and two extra slices of chashu to any bowl. my favorite is the tonkotsu-<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> it's delicious with a couple of teaspoons of soy sauce, vinegar and the red powder stuff. the place is pretty clean and so is the bathroom. definitely will go back.", 
            "been eating here regularly since they first opened. by far, the best ramen in vegas. maybe best <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> on the west coast (believe me, i've eaten a lot of ramen up and down the west coast).  \n\nlove the atmosphere... very traditional ramenya... small cozy seating area, bar counter searing, usual garnishes.  it's how it's suppose to be.\n\nand yes, the waitresses really are and speak japanese (unlike most \"japanese\" places in vegas).  4.5-stars but i guess i have to round up.", 
            "this could be the \"best\" ramen in vegas but it certainly is not the \"best\" ramen i've ever had. \n\nthe bowls are small, cheap, and filling. \n<mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> came with two slices of <mark>Chashu Pork</mark>. the broth was light and subtle. it wasn't as thick and flavorful as i wanted. the chashu pieces were thin and flimsy. they weren't intact and was cut up. \ntonkotsu-<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> was ok, too. between the two, i prefer the tonkotsu broth. \nbig or small, i always finish my entire bowl because i hate to waste the delicious broth but it just wasn't good for me to finish it here. \n\nlots of parking in the lot. there will most likely be a wait because it's a small restaurant. hella cheap.", 
            "great little and i do mean tiny restaurant. we had <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> bowls and it was delicious.  in and out in 30 min, but don't be surprised if you have to wait for a seat.  place sits about 30. we will be back!", 
            "google maps will lead you past this tiny restaurant if you're heading west on spring mountain road. the icon will show that you need to pass hauck street. don't make that mistake, monta ramen is actually in the plaza before that street. google map takes you to this empty plaza with nothing but a sleazy looking massage parlor. hmmm....? \n\nthis small hole in the wall restaurant interior reminds me of daikokuya jtown la but even smaller! they had an l shaped bar which probably sits 10-12 people max. there were about 5-6 regular tables, some made for two people & some made for four. what happens in a place like this? a number of overflowing people waiting out the door. i recommend you coming early or during non-peaked hours. we got lucky because there was only one party ahead of us when we got in but that quickly changed. by the time we got out, there were at least 10 parties on that waiting list.\n\nfirst thing i noticed was the array of condiments in front of us. shredded pink ginger, purified garlic, white pepper, japanese chili powder, spicy a$$ hot chili oil, vinegar, soy sauce just to name a few. love restaurants that aren't all hipster tight up the butt about their condiments.\n\nhad the tonkotsu-<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>, a mixed blend of pork bone and soy sauce type soup based. the first one i've ever had actually since i'm typically accustomed to just tonkotsu base. it was a little less rich and thick then the tonkotsu base but still had that cloudy and strong taste. i added an egg and kimchi for a little more. for you carb lovers, you can add extra noodles for a minimal fee. i was quite satisfied with my ramen. my expectations were met even though they weren't that high since we were in vegas and we know la is crawling with bomb ramen houses. the <mark>Chashu Pork</mark> was quite fatty and the slices were on a smaller scale. the bowl of ramen itself was enough to make you full but not overly stuffed.\n\nalso ordered the <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> bowl - cod fish row, seaweed, <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, over rice. nothing significant to report. the fried gyozas (pork and vegetable filling) were decent.\n\nthe ramen is nothing to die for but it really wasn't too bad. if you have a mad craving for ramen or just want to get something other than pho on spring mountain road aka chinatown, then monta ramen is there for you. just be ready for a wait time. the ramen met my simple standards and the price was very affordable. the hard working staff are efficient and all \"peace sign\" fobby smiles.", 
            "we love us some good ramen and monta ramen was that!  a couple of weeks ago we spent the weekend out in vegas and this was our top destination :)\n\nwe ordered the tradition <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> ($6.95) as well as the tonkotsu-<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> ($6.95).  both were good but the tradition tonkotsu was what really caught our attention. the broth was really good. smooth, creamy and a tad salty.  \n\nthe noodles were perfectly cooked and tasted great.\n\nthe meat was also above average. tender with a good amount of fat.  \n\nwe also added an egg to our bowls and we were so glad we did. it was cooked correctly with the right amount of creaminess to it.\n\nit's the best ramen we've had since our trip back from japan.\n\nin addition to the ramen bowls, we ordered a mini <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> which was good enough to steal our attention from the ramen. the pork belly was thinly cut, which makes it a lot easier to eat with the rice. it's a great side to order if you visit.\n\nas for the staff they were friendly, maybe a little bit overwhelmed. the cook didn't look happy at all for some reason but he was still churning out some great food so we can't complain!\n\noverall we would recommend trying this place out. even in 110 degree weather, it's was oishii!

            "as an avid lover of all asian styles of food i was excited to finally try monta ramen since i had heard good things. at first glance it looked like this little noodle shop was going to have a very long wait. however, we did not have to wait too long even with people waiting outside. there are not many seats, but this is not really the place to linger for long. most people seem to leave fairly quickly once they are done. my friend and i sat at the counter and had fun watching the bustling kitchen while we waited for our ramen. the seating may feel cramped for some people, but i really liked the busy, controlled chaos feel of it. \n\non to the good stuff. i ordered the tonkotsu-<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with the regular house fixings and my friend had the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with thin noodles. i was instantly impressed with my choice as soon as i tried it. the broth was slightly creamy and full of flavor, the thin noodles cooked to the perfect point so they were not mushy at all. i found the soup very flavorful, but i had to add a liberal amount of chili oil since i like my ramen spicy. the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> was also very tasty, the clear beef broth had just as deep a flavor as my selection. we both had a can of <mark>Green Tea</mark> to drink, which was a refreshing counter to my spicy soup. my only gripe was the fact that i was not completely full when i left, which is mostly my own fault. they offer the option of extra noodles, which i will surely do next time. the gyoza and <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> are also on the list to try in the future. \n\nanother great aspect is the price. the total bill for two bowls of ramen and two drinks was $18 and change. a great deal for any sit down place. bottom line is that this place is a great option for a fun, cheap meal. i will definitely be going back.", 
            "i've been searching for a good bowl of ramen in this town and i finally found it! thanks to my friend's recommendation, as well as the rainy weather, we ended up at monta ramen last night. i ordered the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with thin noodles and the regular toppings. i was very impressed! the broth was flavorful and the noodles were cooked to perfection. i love spicy food, so i poured on the chili oil. i also added sesame seeds as well as chili powder. it was perfect! \n\nmy friend and i sat at the bar and got to watch a lovely lady prepare our ramen. the restaurant is small and very busy, so prepare for that. we waited a little bit for a seat, but it was well worth the wait. once we were seated, we were enjoying our ramen within 10 minutes of ordering it. i will definitely be frequenting monta for my ramen fix!", 
            "if you're craving for a steaming bowl of ramen, this place is it! \n\nnow i only gave them 4 stars as i wish they would expand even just a tad. seating is so tight but i guess it also adds to highlight of when your name is finally called and you sit on their wooden chairs and get served almost immediately. the menu consists of 4 simple but very different ramen bowls and a few add ons and very minimal side dishes. but so much easier to choose from.\n\nlove the tonkatsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>. i order mine with thick noodles instead which are seeped in pork and chicken broth. double the flavor. i make sure to always order extra chasyu (pork) although all ramen bowls come with 2 slices.\n\nlove the slurp of the noodles and melt in your mouth pork. slices of mushroom are added as a garnish but even that helps enhance the flavor.  this is only my second time here but i enjoy it immensely and even more so that i got to share it with 9 of my other friends...at the same time! :)", 
            "i started with the gyoza which were tasty and had a nicely crispy thin skins.  next came the tonkatsu-<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> which i enhanced with extra pork and an egg.  the pork is awesome and i could eat lots more of it.  \n\nthis place is small but has a cool vibe.  the only problem is the lack of space.  it was a bit uncomfortable to have people waiting and hovering so close.", 
            "i didn't realize how hard it would be to find a really good ramen restaurant after moving out of hawaii.  however, monta comes close to filling the void.  monta is a small japanese noodle house in a strip mall in china town.  if you don't like waiting to sit down, get there early as the line usually begins to form before the restaurant opens at 11:30am.  there are a few scattered tables, but i prefer to sit at the bar and watch the cooks prepare the dishes in the open kitchen.\n\nmonta makes tonkotsu ($6.95), shoyu ($6.95) and miso ($7.25) ramen broths.  while all three of the broths are very good, the milky white colored tonkotsu (stewed pork bone broth) has an especially savory meaty flavor.  my favorite is the combination tonkotsu-<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> ($6.95) which tempers the intense meaty taste of the tonkotsu with the salty shoyu broth.  the thin yellow ramen noodles have always been consistently cooked to the just right texture, neither too limp nor too firm and underdone.  the ramen comes with basic toppings (<mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, bamboo shoots, kikurage mushrooms and two thin slices of marinated <mark>Chashu Pork</mark>) however, like all good ramen joints, they have a whole list of additional toppings you can add (for a little extra cash) to make the dish your own.  the combination of flavors and textures soaking in the hot broth goes down well on a cold day.\n\nwe also usually order the pan fried pork gyozas ($5.15 for 6) and a small kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> ($6.95).  the gyozas are excellent and the moist rice has a good flavor.  each table has an array of sauces and condiments that you can add to your meal (rice vinegar, soy sauce, chili oil, sesame seeds, and chili pepper) as well as little jars of crushed garlic and red pickled ginger.  they also serve beer to wash it all down with.\n\nthe service is fast and the food comes out quickly.  so even if you do get stuck waiting in line, it usually moves fast.  and if you are in the mood for good ramen, it is worth the wait.", 
            "another great find through yelp!  arrived at monta around 9:30 and were lucky enough to get seated!  every spot was taken.  i counted 23 seats in the house.  mom and i had the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>. the flavor was delicious! dad had the tonkotsu/<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>.  the noodles were thinner, and the broth was a little thicker. my husband had the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> with corn and a side order of kimchi.  he ate every bit and said we would be back again.  great place for ramen!",

            "i'm pretty sure the first thing you hear when you walk in are the waitresses yelling the order in japanese and the chefs in the back confirming and the slurping of noodles from patrons which is a strong first impression. (* + 1) i'm no ramen expert but i believe the best places have distinctive flavors for their broths. at monta, you can definitely tell the miso from the tonkatsu, and the shoyu from the tonkatsu-shoyu which earns a star. ( * + 1) \n\nlocation+atmosphere: it's tucked away in a shady strip mall which i always seem to pass, but a good landmark is the bar at the beginning of the mall called kilroy's (named after the famous kilroy graffiti). i love the atmosphere which is an open kitchen where you see the chefs work. the bar seating has nice spinning bar stools and it's easy to get comfy/friendly with the strangers next to you. (* + 1)\n\nservice: at the door they don't really care who you are or what you do (whether you have a party of one or a party of 10, no special treatment; no forgiveness for leaving/having incomplete party). once seated, the service is quick and they get your stuff out as soon as possible to get another butt in your chair. with a small party (2-3) the wait shouldn't be too long. with a large (+4) party, at munch-time you're out of luck. service does not earn a star.\n\nfood: ramen (why would you get anything else here?). four different broths to choose from with their own noodle style. tonkatsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> comes with wavy noodles and the miso came with thin noodles. extra noodles are $1.25. i don't get add-ons because there's no need, the amounts which are portioned should be rich enough to keep you from wanting for a couple hours. which leads me to portion size. first time it came, i thought i could eat 3 bowls, but after the first tasty, rich bowl you find yourself satisfied. what you're looking for is the flavor of the broth and i think this place has one of the tastiest broths. i like to add the spicy powder, hot oil, and sesame seeds so maybe that's why it gets salty near the bottom, but it makes my noodles tastier. (* + 1) got the gyoza, tasted the gyoza, enjoyed the gyoza, did not write home about the gyoza.\n\nstrangest thing: i do not understand why they don't serve hot tea. too much work to serve and too little space for the cups? they do have canned oolong and <mark>Green Tea</mark> though.", 
            "food: 4\nservice: 4\natmosphere: 3. cramped in a strip mall (which is of course typical in lv.). it is located in the same strip mall as another popular japanese place, raku.\n\nfirst impression and ordering\nas we stood waiting for about maybe 15-20 min, we peeked over to the table of 4 who were eating on a table smack right next to the entry door where everyone was standing & waiting. we saw that the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> looked a tad greasy and so did the ramen broth. my dinner companion gave me that look of \"hmmm\" and i said \"i guess we'll just try it since we're already here\". we were curious to compare this to our usual ramen dojo (san mateo, ca).\n\nwe ordered one tonkotsu $6.95 (+egg $1.50  and corn $0.50), one <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> $6.95 with extra chasu (+4 pieces, $2.50) and one kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> $6.95 (hoping this would be less greasy than the regular <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and it was slightly less common in the ramen place).  having not eaten lunch that day, we were huuungry and ready to devour our order as soon as it arrived. first impression: noodles presentation looked neat and mouthwatering; the ingredients were neatly arranged on top and the bowl of ramen looked quite appetizing. especially with 2 hungry stomachs impatiently waiting to devour them. lol. \n\nthe broth didn't appear as greasy as my earlier glance at the previous table.  there was a curious black ring around each of the chasu (more about this later) that's usually not present in the other ramen's place chasu piece.  interesting, we thought.\n\nthe <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> still looked a tad on the greasy side by the shines it showed. but in all fairness, i haven't ordered japanese <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> in a ramen place for some time. maybe they all look like that.\n\nnow on to the fun part.\n\nfood\nthe broth on the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> was delish. slightly on the lighter side compared to ramen dojo, but it was still good. one big difference that made ramen dojo's broth more 'hearty' and tasty was the addition of chicken bits in their broths. if you like a lighter version of tonkotsu broth, you will like monta's version better.\n\nthe shoyu broth was light yet had a lot of flavor. \n\nthe tonkotsu bowl came with thin noodles. we both were very curious how good (smooth) this thin noodle would be. while not as 'smooth' as some of the other thin ramen noodles we've tried in japan, we were pleasantly surprised at how smooth and tasty it was. so, thumbs up here.\n\nthe noodles in the shoyu bowl was also pretty good. it is the yellow, thicker, curly kind; of course heavier than the one in the tonkotsu bowl, yet not super-heavy.\n\nas for the curious black ring around the chasu, as you probably have guessed, it is the pork skin. the skin itself was a real thin strip with a very thin layer of fat underneath it.  including this skin gave the soup broth an extra flavor and aroma that distinguished it from other ramen's place broth. it was probably also why the half-finished ramen bowl we peeked earlier looked slightly greasier. i don't typically see this pork skin included in other ramen shop. this is a plus for the broth. the slightly greasier broth didn't quite happen as much in my bowl. 'cause i like to scrape off the fat under the pork skin. lol. another thumbs up!\n\nthe last dish which was the kimchee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> ($6.95) was yum, though i still think it could be done with slightly less oil.  unlike the rice bowl-sized portion that it often comes in, this <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> came in a rounded square plate of the size that could've been a meal by itself.\n\nservice\nservice was friendly, efficient and brisk without making us feel rushed. but we did devoured our meal super fast and left quickly as a courtesy to the long lines of people waiting.\n\ntwo thumbs up for this place.\n\nanecdotal comments & observations (mostly rhetorical)\nwhy is it that most ramen house has the most 'house rules' posted on their outside window? no outside food. no outside drink. no tacos? (seriously, this place has a picture of tacos with a cross on it and japanese writing).",

            "i want to start by subtracting the one star because the restaurant was uncomfortably hot - at least where i was seated, it was. i was at the end of the bar practically inside the kitchen. there was a wait, as usual, but as usual, the wait is worth it. i brought a ramen enthusiast friend from out of town. he ordered the tonkatsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with egg and i ordered the tonkatsu ramen with mustard greens. we also split an order of the pork belly over rice. let me tell you. this pork belly over rice was so silky and delicious that i didn't want my ramen anymore. i didn't even need the pork belly. the oils and the flavors of the pork just sinks into the rice and the rice alone is out of this world. the ramen is no joke either. the texture of the noodles stays perfect throughout the entire meal. they don't become so bloated with soup that they turn into mush. i hate mushy noodles. my friend ate his entire ramen bowl down to the last drop of soup! now heed this warning: the portion sizes are not of america! if you think you are going to get this huge bowl of unfinishable noodles and broth, you're a glutton. the portion size is just right and leaves you with just enough room for you to share an appetizer and have a cup of tea. this isn't the type of place for socializing. eat your noodles and gtfo so that all of the other hopeful patrons can share a piece of the heaven that you have just experienced.",

            "not bad, monta ramen... not bad at all. \n\nthree of my friends and i came here after a night dancing looking for some soup to appease our parched bodies. here are some things you should expect: \n\n1. parking\neasy peasy. there is a big lot, so no need to worry about that.\n\n2. the wait\noh my goodness. we came to this place like 40 minutes before it opened, and there was already a line. this being said, i highly recommend coming early & waiting, unless you want to be in the hot las vegas sun, grumpy, hungry, hungover and sweaty. \n\n3. the ramen\ni ordered the new spicy tonkatsu ramen with an egg. it was so good! the broth was very flavorful and not too salty (although, i've been told that i have a salty palette.. to each his own.). the pork in the ramen was soft and melted in my mouth! my only regret is not getting extra. my boyfriend got the tonkatsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with fat noodles, which was good, but definitely not as good as mine... i think his was too salty for my taste (which again, has been known to be on the salty side). even thought my ramen was overall really good, i couldn't finish it because it felt way too heavy/greasy in my stomach. i actually ended up with a small stomach ache after. \n\n4. the service\nokay, i guess i have to cut some slack here, because there were only 2 workers manning the floor, but it took forever to order/flag someone down... it kind of felt like they were ig<mark>Nori</mark> us on purpose at first. nobody likes to have to compete for attention! #middlechildsyndrome #i'mnotevenamiddlechild #yelpdoesntevendohashtags\n\n5. the value\nsuper cheap! also, a coke was only one dollah! to me, that seems unheard of in a restaurant... \n\nall in all, i recommend it. if you're like me and you easily get stomach aches from food that is too heavy, <mark>Butter</mark> or greasy, i'd recommend getting a coke or a sprite with your ramen so that you can burp all out alll dat ish.", 
            "first off, this ramen place is in a favorite plaza of mine known for amazing food: trattoria nakamura-ya, snowflake shavery, zen? i have had this place on my bookmarks for a while.\n\nstopped in today for a solo lunch- was seated quick as there was a spare spot open at the bar, but when i first went in there was a wait list. yes, at 3pm on a saturday. plan ahead if you're going with a group!\n\nservice was great- two super-sweet ladies were attentive and friendly throughout my visit. placed my order for the tonkotsu-<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>, added the egg, nori, and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>. initially i was put off by having to add on my favorite ingredients separately, but the silver lining to doing so was that i was able to meet the $10 credit card minimum without buying a separate appetizer.\n\nwhile waiting for my bowl, i was entertained watching the guys in the kitchen making endless batches of noodles. got my order fairly quick as the restaurant started emptying out a bit.\n\nmy first reaction was one of happy surprise: the steep $1.50 fee for <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> got me a shredded nest of it atop my bowl, an unexpectedly gigantic amount that found itself in every bite i took. in a good way! found the noodles to be thinner than i prefer but cooked to a perfect al dente. shredded the nori into small pieces to distribute throughout my bites. the broth lacked the depth that i've had elsewhere, but i was pleasantly surprised to use the brown garlic oil on the table and get a robust improvement in the flavor. potential new favorite condiment alert!\nsad to note that the chashu was somehow lost among the kicked-up broth and sea of <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>. what is usually a highlight of my ramen experience was just mediocre here, the cut i had was not fatty nor was it particularly flavorful either.\n\ni will likely be back because service was great and there are other varieties to try on the menu, but i was slightly underwhelmed by the bowl i got today. location is everything though, and this noodle house is conveniently located and will likely result in repeat visits.", 
            "i had the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with egg. i didnt like the egg since it wasnt well done. but the soup was great especially on a cold day.\n\nthe <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> was delicious and the gyoza. \n\ni gave it a 4 star cos of the place its too small and crowded. i feel crammed in the restaurant.", 
            "a friend and i stopped by around 1:30 on a saturday. we were about 5th down the waiting list but did not wait very long. the service was quick and efficient. we ordered the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> and the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>. they were both delicious. the noodles were perfectly cooked. we ordered the flavored egg in our ramen and they were amazing. the egg white was amazingly tender while the yolk was perfectly runny and flavorful. the broth was a tad salty if you're just drinking it when you're done with the noodles. but other than that, it was a wonderful experience.", 
            "if you are a ramen fan, this is the place to be! incredible taste all around with their whole entire menu selection!!! \n\ntonkotsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> -the soup was perfectly seasoned and the noodles were done in perfection. highly recommended to order with additional sides (egg and seaweed) to complete the flavor. also i was able to ask the waitress to take out the bamboo shoots as i don't like the taste and it's used as soup filler. \n\nthis is a small place and it gets packed quick. it you want to come eat at this place, you should be prepared to wait in line or go early before the rush hour.", 
            "craving for some ramen! monta is the spot to go to. this place definitely satisfies your ramen craving. there was a long wait since this place is very small and their was 8 of us. it was worth the wait!\n\ni ordered the tonkotsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>. it was mighty delicious! i also ordered a side of the dumplings, which a must try. you can tell they make it fresh, it's not your typical frozen prepackaged ones.", 
            "this is a fantastic ramen house. i love places like this that have a small menu but what is on the menu is mastered by the chefs. i had the tonkotsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with a side of kimchi. so, so delicious. btw, you can get a refill on the noodles if you are hungry for $1.50 & just use what broth you have left over. amazing place.", 
            "this is definitely my go-to ramen shop.  i really wish the venue was bigger but i guess the size of the establishment is part of the charm.  i like adding the egg and corn to my tonkatsu, shio and <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>.", 
            "ordered the tonkatsu and the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>. well, this is a place u either extremely love it or hate it never coming back. the tonkatsu soup base is way too salty, as almost the chef dumped the entire jaw in the salt.its very very creamy and thick. it's how japanese noodle base should be like.  and it has a very strong taste of the pork fat. many might love the thickness, but i am not a pork fan, so is a no for me. shoyu base is just chicken soup with soy sauce, just soso. neither the thick wavy noodle or the thin noodle did the magic for me. i don't think i'm coming back, it's a good noodle place, just not for me.", 
            "3 1/2 stars. came in for lunch during the week. i sat at the counter due to the full house and went with the tonkotsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with egg and extra chashu.\n\nsitting at the counter i was able to watch them prepare the ramen and noticed there was a chef in training. when i received my bowl all looked decent and tasted good with the exception that the ramen was overcooked and soggy. the patron next to me received his bowl and he ordered double meat and they only give him a single serving also which wasn't cool either. \n\nservice was decent, but lets get it together in the kitchen!",

            "best ramen in vegas, hands down.  i have tried other ramen shops but i always find myself back here.  monta has delicious broth and great noodles.  i like the wavy thick noodles that is offered in the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> and <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>.  the thin straight noodles are good too but i like the thick kind.  you can choose from tonkatsu (pork), shoyu, tonkatsu-shoyu, or miso broth.  you can make any broth spicy.  there is also a new broth that is the tonkatsu broth with black garlic oil.  sounds yummy.  the broths are all great and there are yummy add-ins.  i always add corn.  if you are feeling extra indulgent add some butter!  i like to wear a dark colored shirt so that you can't see all of the splash marks from the soup. \n\nthe sides are good to start off with.  the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> is actually pretty amazing.  the chunks of meat in the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> are delicious.  gyoza is always a safe bet too.\n\nexpect to wait.  that is the only reason i am not here more often.  i hate waiting to eat.  this restaurant is tiny and there are a lot of monta fans out there.  you can try their other location monta chaya in henderson if you are closer to that side of town.  haven't been myself but it's owned by the same people. \n\nhappy ramen-ing :d", 
            "i came here as a result of yelp reviews. totally worth it. i had the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>. so rich and creamy! like savory, meat flavored <mark>Butter</mark> broth! i was worried that i would have a belly ache because it was so rich, but no, i was just fine! i didn't have any add-ins and i was so full! \n\nmy daughter had just had her wisdom teeth out a few days prior and was dying for some real food. she had the tonkotsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>. by the time she was done, she looked like a whole new person. when she walked in, she was pale and tired, her eyes were glassy. by the time she was done eating her ramen, she had a rosy glow in her cheeks and she perked up 100%! it was like ambrosia. \n\nwe loved this place so much that when my friend came to visit from the san francisco bay area the next day, we went again. my friend is a food snob and was leery that monta would be anywhere near as good as her beloved orenchi in santa clara (i've eaten there, it is heavenly). monta definitely passed her high standards. i couldn't get her to admit that monta was better, but she did agree that it was at least equal!\n\nvery friendly and attentive staff. small eating area, but just make sure you come before or after the normal busy times. we didn't have a wait either time when we went around 6:30pm, but worth the wait if you have to. \n\nif you are looking for a good ramen place, this is it! if you think ramen comes in a package with a seasoning packet, go here and prepare to be schooled. so ono!", 
            "i read the term \"complex tasting broth\" in a review for another ramen place and i never got the term till i tried the tonkotsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> here. best ramen ever! the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> is pretty good to but the gyoza is nothing to rave about.",

            "perhaps this is the best ramen that las vegas can produce, but it's definitely not the best ramen out there. it's not even \"pretty good\" ramen. it's simply decent. i came on a weekday for lunch and there were several people waiting outside for a table. this noodle shop is tiny. luckily, it was only my boyfriend and me so we snatched two seats at the bar. i ordered the tonkotsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> while he had the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> with an egg. \n\ntonkotsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> - pork and chicken broth with two slices of pork chashu, black mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and a pile of <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>. the broth was extremely salty, especially compared to my boyfriend's broth. the noodles were rather springy but they were still acceptable. half of the pork chashu was fat so there was actually very little meat.\n\n<mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> - pork broth with two slices of pork chashu, black mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and a pile of <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>. my boyfriend added an egg which was soft-boiled so the white was cooked through, but the yolk remained molten. he thought his ramen was ok (and he's a ramen fanatic!). the broth fell flat (although not as salty as mine).\n\nthe flavors here aren't very compelling. the portions are generous considering a bowl is about $7 and the noodles come out pipin' hot. the restaurant is quite small so i was feeling a bit claustrophobic. that, coupled with the relentless las vegas heat, made me want to bolt outta there the second i was done slurping my noodles. service was lackluster, not that i was expecting anything phenomenal. if you're in chinatown and need a quick and warm bowl of ramen, monta will suffice.",

            "ramen and waiting in line seem to come hand in hand anywhere but his place is definitely worth the wait. \nmenu- \non different occasions i had the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> and <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>. i definitely prefer the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>. so much more flavor!!! kaedama is a plus. service - \nonce you are seated, they get you in and out pretty quickly. they are really good about filling your water glass, i've noticed a lot of ramen places tend to forget about the water.\nambiance-\nsmall with very little tables. the counter space tends to have quicker turn around so if you are going there solo or as a couple you will get seated a lot quicker. \nother- \nparking is easy and this lot has quite a bit of restaurants. while waiting for your table, walk about the area and plan your next meal.", 
            "first off, i'm a huge ramen eater.\n\ni came on a saturday with two other people for dinner at around 6pm.  we had to wait about 20 minutes to get seated.  once seated, i went for their miso based ramen with added garlic oil, chili, egg, and corn.  it was delicious!  my only complaint was it was very salty.  not overwhelmingly salty, but salty.  the ramen was the perfect texture.  the meat was good and everything went together really well.  my sister went for their <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>, which is soy sauce based.  i had a sip of the broth and it was pretty good.  if you want a healthier choice, the shoyu would be the one to go with.  we also ordered one <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> bowl but didn't even touch it because we were so full.  but later tried it and the eggs were way too salty.  \n\nfor 3 bowls of ramen and the mentaiko, our total was about $24 without tip.  it was very reasonable.  the service was very fast.  our food came out super fast.  the inside of this place is teeny tiny.  there's about 5 small tables and the bar that's it.  prepare to wait on the weekends.\n\nps... if you have a crying baby/child, this is not the place to bring him or her.", 
            "tried the tonkotsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>, <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and gyoza.\n\nramen was good, but i have tried better ones. the soup was a little thin but had a nice flavor.\n\n<mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was good. had that smokey flavor to it.\n\ngyoza was ok. nothing special. a little soggy and oily.", 
            "monta should get 11*.\n\nit is my favorite place in las vegas to have a meal. oh, flight lands at las at 10pm? i'm at monta by 10:30.\n\ntonkotsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with nori and egg. just do it. char siu melts in your mouth, broth is incredibly rich, and it's difficult to spend $15 there, including a beer.\n\nalso have enjoyed several of their special ramens -- check the board.\n\nif you're a <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> fan (i'm not, but the wife is), probably want to check out ramen sora instead. and i tend to steer clear of the sides at monta -- not because they're bad, but because they are average, and i can focus on the ramen, which is what they do best.", 
            "this is a wonderful little ramen place that has friendly service and decent prices! my boyfriend and i stopped in for dinner around 6:00 pm on a monday and only had to wait 5 minutes for a table. the restaurant has about four tables, three tables seat four people each and one table seats six people, and then there is bar seating. as we were leaving the restaurant a little before 7:00 pm, i noticed that there were several people waiting outside for a table.\n\ni ordered the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>, while the boyfriend had the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>. our food came out quickly in 10 minutes or less, much to our delight. we both agreed that my clear shoyu broth was much better, as the creamy miso one was a bit salty. both of our dishes featured their thick and wavy noodles that had a great, chewy texture. the pork chashu is super tender and melts right in your mouth *drool*. if you are a meat lover, you may want to add extra chashu (four pieces) since the ramen only comes with two pieces. the fatty part of the pieces of meat is what packs such flavor and gets you hooked. i added corn and a soft flavored egg as extra toppings to my bowl. the bamboo and black jelly ear mushrooms that come with all ramen dishes made each bite unique and delicious. the gyoza dumplings were just alright - i probably wouldn't order them again. \n\ni will definitely visit monta ramen again the next time i am in vegas!", 
            "<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with extra pork is the best!!! <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> with rice is also amazing. i could eat here every day!! i prefer the eastern location better air seating arrangement.", 
            "oh monta ramen. i dream of you every night now. the tastiest ramen i've ever had! i had the tonkotsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with egg and my person had the black garlic oil ramen special. both packed with amazing flavor. we went around 2pm so although there was a tiny wait, it was nowhere near 20 minutes. the waitress was very nice and quick. we are definitely making this a tradition whenever we go to vegas!", 
            "very impressed and certainly will be back.  there are so many asian restaurants in the area, if you aren't local or know someone here, you could easily overlook this place.  while it is small, it seats more than you'd expect and they also have an l-shaped counter with additional seating when you come in.  always a good sign when you are greeted warmly, there's a sign-up sheet for waiting, there are kids with their folks, and regulars since the waitresses knew some of them by name. \n\nwe had the tonkatsu ramen and the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>, with corn and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>.  the noodles were perfect, chewy, and the broth was top notch.  we also had the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>.  don't miss these!  and the food does come out fast from the kitchen.  compared to the bay area, their prices are pretty reasonable and you get plenty to eat.\n\nservice was excellent.  if you don't like to wait or are a true vegetarian, probably not the place for you.  we got there at 5:30pm on a sunday and the place was just 1/2 full.  by 6:00pm, it was packed and they had more than a dozen people waiting.  i'm guessing if there's a line somewhere, it's usually a good bet the place is worth the wait.  it is located in a strip mall so there is parking, but there are also many restaurants as well.  they also called a taxi for us when we were done which was awesome.  i'll be back for sure.", 
            "i have to give this place 4 stars because it seemed not too far off in taste from my favorite ramen spot, shoki ramen in sacramento.  i got my usual, <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> without meat, and was not disappointed.  their noodles were not too cooked, which is just to my liking.  also, i thought the broth was pretty tasty.  i had no idea, though, how tiny the place is!  we got there just a few minutes after opening, and all the tables were already taken.  we had to sit on bar stools which was a little bit uncomfortable, especially since i was wearing a short dress on the hot day we went.  business was pretty steady at lunch time - tables/bar stools did not stay empty for very long at all.  and it seemed like everyone ordered their <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> - maybe i missed out on something?", 
            "small ramen shop but wonderful service! we had a large group and they were able to accommodate us with around 30 minutes wait. they also let us look at the menu and order while we were waiting so we could get our ramen soon after we got seated. \n\nmy personal favorite was the tonkatsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>, i've never had them mixed together and who knew they would be such a good combo! the tonkatsu gave the broth the fatty rich taste, and the shoyu gave it a bit more kick in the flavor. for the marinated half-boiled egg (ntamago), you have to order on the side, which is super worth it if you like them! the chashu was fatty and went well with the ramen. \n\nportion was okay, some of the guys in the group did wish they order extra noodle though. overall a great ramen place, will be back again!", 
            "great place in vegas if you are craving ramen. i went here by myself when i was working out there and ordered the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>. never disappoints. it's a small place though, so the wait for big groups can be a little long. also, if you come here at night around 9pm, parking gets really packed so i suggest to come 30mins early to scout out for parking. nonetheless, it's a great spot to go to.", 
            "very good ramen spot in vegas. the wait could be quite long (25 min wait) even on a weekday so just a heads up. i ordered the spicy <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with egg and seaweed. i like the thin noodles and tasty broth that they had to offer. the portion is a bit small but the price is very reasonable. might just have to order extra noodles next time.", 
            "yes, yes, and yes.\nthis is definitely the best ramen i've had in vegas, though it's still at an average quality compared to many places here in la. it's a small restaurant so there is definitely waiting involved but luckily some of my friends went earlier and put our party down on the list so i myself did not have to wait too long.\n\ni tried the tonkatsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>, but asked them to switch to thick chewy noodles since that's the way i like it. hungover aileen enjoyed the broth very much and it wasn't too salty, which is much appreciated. the noodles were the perfect texture. the chasu was also incredibly tender and just the right portion for me since i was able to get some in every bite of noodles.\n\nthe service by the older woman was so attentive and kind, while the younger waitress gave off the vibe that she was too cool for school. regardless, the food was quick and good so i have no complaints.", 
            "this is my first time having ramen in vegas. the location is off the strip and in chinatown. the restaurant is small, with not too much seating. my boyfriend and i came on a saturday afternoon at 2pm and we only waited 2 minutes and were seated. i ordered the tonkotsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>. food came out pretty quick and service was also quick. the ramen was a bit bland, i think it needs more toppings. overall not bad, but i don't know if i would come back if i was in the area.", 
            "went here based on other reviews and totally loved it! a very small place but the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> was delicious! the cold noodles we're good too! definitely beats over paying for designer food on the strip!", 
            "highly recommended, authentic. love the tonkatsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> and <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>. there seems to be a line but fast service makes up for it.", 
            "probably the best ramen place in vegas and the price is right!  we ordered one <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>, one tonkatsu ramen, and one shoyu tonkatsu ramen. also got the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>. all were pretty good. the kids, who are avid ramen fans couldn't decide between giving this a 3 or 4, so we agreed on a 3.5 star. my broth was a little salty - i think i'll be drinking a lot of water later!  the pork belly was very flavorful and was perfect over the bed of rice. service was friendly and fast! it's a small place, but we lucked out cuz it wasn't that busy at about 7pm on a tuesday. i would definitely come back when i'm craving ramen in vegas!", 
            "i am a ramen lover.\ni live in california and i love to drive to little tokyo for their ramen.\nwell.. while visiting vegas i have to say this place is a must!\ni ordered the tonkatsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> and it is delicious!! i ate everything that came in the bowl and also slurped up that broth.\n\nthe wait is long but i won't deduct stars for the parking/wait line. \n\nthe food is well worth the wait.", 
            "seriously one of the best ramen places i've been to in a long time! the service was great and the wait was manageable despite the small size of the restaurant. also, even though it's a small place, it didn't feel cramped or stuffy. you had the choice of sitting at the bar or at a table - which made for a very chill eating experience. \n\ni ordered the gypza to start, set the stage for a wonderful meal. then ordered the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> which has both chicken and pork broth, thick noodles, pork belly, mushrooms and egg (extra). the ratio of noodle to broth was perfect and all ingredients complimented each other very well. the broth wasn't salty at all either - which was great! \n\nmy go to spot whenever i'm in town, hands down!", 
            "entered this place after a good foot massage next door. the space is rather tight with ten seats on the bar counter and 18 more on the floor with tables. the menu was quite simple, ordered the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>, cold noodles, tonkatsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> & and gyoza.  everything was so tasty and especially the cold noodles tasted especially nice & cool, just soothing when the temperature was 106 f outdoors. among japanese restaurants that i have been to, this one is genuine japanese.", 
            "quick, inexpensive, and delicious! the only reasons i took a star away:\n\none of the kitchen exhaust fans was broken so it was very smoky, warm, and loud inside.\n\nalso, it would be great if they had some sort of non-pork offering. my husband does not eat pork so he got the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> without the chashu, but we suspect something may have wound up in the broth somehow because he had had an upset stomach the following morning. we enjoyed it though!", 
            "warning: this is not the place to go for a long meal, date, or to socialize. it is small, loud, and every part of the experience is very fast-paced. however, if you're looking for a quick and easy dining experience with incredible food, this is a must go!\n\nservice: extremely fast and efficient staff.\n\ndrink: although it tasted normal, i was put off by their hot <mark>Green Tea</mark> coming in a can. like what even?\n\nappetizer: the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> was delicious! not too salty which i really appreciated. try not to fill up on appetizers though, their ramen bowls are massive!\n\nramen: i ordered the tonkotsu-<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with egg, nori, and corn, and it was amazing! this is only the second time i have ever had ramen and my expectations were blown away. simply delicious.", 
            "my family and i have been coming here for the last five years off and on. sometimes once a month and there have been gaps as big as 9 months. we always have a pleasant experience and always have quality food. while there have been some slight inconsistencies over the years, we have almost always been happy with the food and service. this place is tiny and always busy. my favorites are the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with corn, 2 eggs, and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> and also the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. my kids adore this place and are always accommodated. the service is fast and the food is very reasonably priced. while i'm sure there are arguments for best ramen in las vegas, monta is in the lead for me.", 
            "<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with extra pork is the best!!! <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> with rice is also amazing. i could eat here every day!! i prefer the eastern location better  seating arrangement. they gave me a flower for mother's day!", 
            "once just a hole in the wall ramen spot, this place is consistently busy with a line out the door.  my go to is the tonkatsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> and an order of gyoza.  the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> is also a great one to try the first time.  the pork belly melts like butter compared to other ramen places.  pricing is very reasonable but be prepared to wait unless you go right before opening and in the middle afternoon.", 
            "first time here and man, that food was soooo good! perfect food for this cold weather! the only reason this place is short one star from 5 is because of the size of the restaurant. most ramen places are pretty small but because their food is awesome, they shouldn't shy away from expanding because the food itself sells. the staff is very quick and efficient, they try to get people in as fast as they can and they are pretty quick with the needs of the customers! we ordered the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>, <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>, gyoza, <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and kimchee. everything we had was tasty and the pricing is definitely reasonable!!! will be coming here again.. hopefully it won't be as busy and hopefully they can expand the restaurant size in the future.. but count on us as future regulars!", 
            "i arrived alone at this restaurant. not a bad place for a party of one since they have bar seating. it's small inside but even the large party's waiting were seated quickly. i ordered the tonkotsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with an egg. it was awesome. very good service and quality ramen. i was impressed and will definitely go back.", 
            "my friend and i got here around 7:30 p.m. and were lucky to grab the last two seats at the counter.   we got the tonkotsu-<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> and it was quite good.  the egg was cooked just right, it was running and i loved how it was perfect with the soup..  the noodles had a good bounce to it , but the pork had too much fat.  i felt like my portion of the pork was small and didn't have much meat.  it had more fat than meat, which is why i lowered my rating.   however, when i come back here, i need to try their kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, the table next to me ordered it  and it looked soooo good!!  it takes a while for the food to come, so if you super hungry prepare to wait.  when i left this place, i saw there was a large crowded gathered outside.  i'll make note of that the next time i'm back", 
            "delicious!!  i have been meaning to try monta forever since i keep hearing great things.  well, i finally made it and can't wait to come back.  i am already dreaming of that tasty broth again!!  i ordered the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> and added an egg (and no pork).  although at first it seemed like it might be a little basic and not enough, when i received my bowl it was more food than i thought it would be.  the noodles tasted great and the egg was cooked perfectly, not too runny which i don't care for.  the broth was the best, there's something about it that has left me with a craving for it.  just one bowl left me completely full and satisfied and all for about $8.00!  i must mention that i had gone to an expensive strip restaurant the night before and spent about 15-times that and was so unsatisfied with my food.  the price here for delicious food cannot be beat!  also worth noting - we arrived exactly at 5pm and there were only 2 parties in front of us.  but within 5-7 minutes of arriving, there was a huge line after us.  the place is small so you might have a wait.", 
            "my go-to ramen spot!! their broth is honestly my favorite because it's packed with flavor and it's not too salty for my preference with their bomb noodles!! the only downside is that this restaurant is packed like crazy during lunch/dinner times and such a small place. but because they have attentive waitresses who try to seat people asap and such heartwarming ramen, i really don't mind the wait for the speed my food comes out! i highly recommend this place, especially for people who haven't experienced passed package ramen!! my staple order is the ton katsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> (idk if i even typed that correctly) be aware: they will not seat you until your whole party is there",

            "i went here on a recommendation from a work friend.  i am blown away by this place.  it is like the holy grail from tanpopo.  this movie is amazing and it's about foodie ramen culture in japan.  they are as authentic as it comes.  just like the movie, the ramen is cooked al dente, the pork slices are placed carefully, the soup is hot and the broth is flavorful.  all the toppings are there and we were so excited we replicated a part of tanpopo when the zen ramen master mindfully eats his ramen.  \n\ni knew this place was it when i ate everything and drank the broth to the bottom of the bowl.  the soft boiled eggs are a must.\n\nthis place is amazing and the menu is simple and they just added the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> which is by far my favorite.\n\nthe <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> is light broth not overly salty, the tonkatsu is very meaty and flavorful and they use a different noodle.  i prefer the ramen noodles that come with the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> though.  the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> is delicious but, a little to salty (but, authentic for japanese taste)\n\ni wouldn't get their gyoza again.  pretty generic and expensive.\n\nthe ramen is cheap coming in at under $7 for the tonkatsu and $8 for the miso.\n\nthis place is damn good.  i went their for dinner and was so impressed i went back for lunch again the next day driving all the way from henderson.  \n\nmonta is pretty authentic looking and i hope it does well because i love little hole in the wall gems.", 
            "finally.  a shop in las vegas specializing in japanese ramen and monta does it quite well.  \n\ngreat space, simple and clean with a counter overlooking the kitchen.\n\nthe menu is straightforward.. two types of ramen, <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> and <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>.  then there are a few extra topping options such as a flavored soft boiled egg, and cha-shu.  in addition, they have a few rice dishes like the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>, <mark>Chashu Bowl</mark> and a mentaiko bowl. \n\nthe <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> is really good.  the pork broth/soup has great flavor... dense, rich , almost creamy.  \"umai\" would be the japanese expression to describe this taste.  the \"men\"  (noodles) were thin, typical of this style of ramen.. but i would've liked them to be a bit more hard or al dente as the italians would call it.  the cha-shu was good too.  \n\nhope everyone is excited to welcome this great new ramen shop to this city as much as i am..", 
            "the noodles were definitely decent in vegas. we tried the tonkatsu and <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>.\n<mark>Miso Ramen</mark> was too salty for me. miso is such a strong taste that you should not have that first before you tried the tonkatsu one. the noodles they used for this was perfect(it was the ramen noodles)! \ntonkatsu ramen was really tasty. the pork melted in your mouth. so good! the fungus gave the ramen a crunchy/texture to it! you always want to have some sort of bamboo in your ramen, which they did! the only thing i thought was missing was the noodles. they served mines with the thin noodles. i preferred to have my ramen with ramen noodles! i don't know if they are out of those ramen noodles or that's what they served but i'll have to request that next time. yes, there will be a next time! :) overall, it was pretty delish!", 
            "oh yay! i still love monta! i've been back three times since my first review. tonight was the first time i tried the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>. let me tell you, it was delicious! the noodles were actually ramen and the soup was a lil sweet. it was definitely not a disappointment at all. i can't wait for the winter, when its ramen eating weather! however, there was a weird smell inside but other than that the food was still awesome.", 
            "still going here every week if not more often.\nthey finally have a sign up so they're a bit easier to spot.\nanyway, i'm glad everyone else is liking this place.  i don't know why the bad reviews on the gyoza, because it's right up my alley.  and yes, they do use different noodles for the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> versus the others.  the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> is hakata style, and is known for the very thin, very delicious noodles.  they cook theirs a little more here than they do in hakata, but it's still great.\nanyway, having tried the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>, i'd say give this one a shot too.  it's their tonkotsu soup with miso added to give it a rich nutty flavor that really sticks to your ribs.\ni also have to recommend the chahan (<mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>), it is super peppery and delicious.  just the way i remember it from my highschool days in japan.\na second note.  anything you don't like on your ramen, let them know.  i keep going with picky eaters (1 vegan, others just picky), and they've made a vegan kimchi chahan, as well as bowls of ramen with extra this, no that, whatever you ask for.\nas always, they're eager to please, and definitely worth seeing, so help monta stay busy, and maybe even expand.  i would love to see more of these guys.", 
            "after stumbling through various japanese restaurants that serve decent bowls of ramen, i've finally found a place that specializes at it. in fact, it's pretty much all they serve. their menu reminded me of an in-n-out menu: you either order a <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> or a <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>. if you don't want ramen, there's <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and some basic japanese apps. not much in terms of variety. but, if this is what you're in the mood for, they do it great.\n\ni started off with an order of gyoza for an app. simple stuff and what you'd expect. nothing to write home about. then, came the steamy bowl of <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>. the broth was a real winner here. a lot of places that i have tried never really got the broth quite right. this was one place where the flavor really hit the spot. even though it's a scorching 100+ degrees outside, a routine stop for a bowl of ramen here is worth having. next time i drop by, i will probably give their <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> a shot.\n\nmonta is a tiny, quaint little place, though not very crowded when i went. it started out empty when we walked in, but started filling up as we were slurping up our noodles. i wouldn't expect a wait for a table, but i could see it happening if this place picks up in popularity.", 
            "one saturday afternoon, i finally had a chance to try ramen @monta noodle house. right after i entered the noodle shop, all the employees were shouting loudly in japanese usual expression in turn: irasshaimase, irasshaimase! i felt so welcomed :p \n\nso, i decided to try the 'tonkotsu' with boiled egg since it was one of their special dishes & highly recommended by the server. she brought some of the minced garlic and pickled ginger with it.  without hesitation, i put a little bit of garlic in the soup just because i love garlic so much :)  i could totally taste of very rich and milky pork bone broth in my mouth. the noodle was very thin and straight. one of the toppings that really stands out was the sliced pork, the 'chashu'. it was very tender and soft. \noverall, i was happy with the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> but, i liked the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> with lots of bean sprouts @shuseki little better. if someone wants to try richness of the broth & the amount of oil they want, the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> is the one... \nnext time, i still want to try their kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> & cold(chilled) noodle(hiyashi-chuka). \n\non my way out, i heard, \" arigatoh gozaimashita!\" once again, they were thanking customers and i was pleased with the service @monta!!!", 
            "on my first visit to the monta (ellis) noodle house i had an inclination that it was worthy of four sexy stars. after eating here, i'm quite certain of that.\n\nyour not going to drive past it on spring mountain in case you think you missed it because it's all the way in the back of the plaza.  \n\nif your a rameniac like myself.  this place is the new kid on the block and a must-try.  we know las vegas isn't exactly a hot-bed for ramen but monta meets my needs.\n\nthe <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> was delicious, it's probably one of the best in town. we waited 15 minutes, but definitely worth the wait. although many have first timers have said it wasn't worth.  monta wouldn't stand a chance vs. some ramen spots i frequent in the bay area. but all of my friends and they were all asian said it couldn't be better.  the kikurage was yummy as well.  but stay away from the specials like the kim-chi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.  but who the hell goes to a ramen house for <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>?  duh!", 
            "a quaint japanese noodle house packing big flavors best sums up monta. the place  is reminiscent to the noodle houses we frequent in torrance, ca and litte tokyo, offering a simple menu that doesn't detract patrons from the restaurant's main dish: ramens. we opted to try the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> (bean paste) and <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> (pork bone) with the addition of available toppings such as chasu (roasted pork -- not for the fat conscious eater), <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, and butter (yes, butter!). the third ramen offering, shoyu, is something we'll probably try on the next go. the noodles were chewy-soft and a bit firm which is how it should be, and with a flavor-rich broth that's a cross between creamy melted butter and meaty-savory -- a feat only possible with many hours of high heat infusion of the ingredients. on a hot summer day, the place suffers from the lack of a good a/c, but once you start chowing down your piping hot ramen, the warm ambience fades into obscurity. a definite must-try place that we're glad we stumbled upon!", 
            "so apparently i was being a bit stingy with my stars so says a friend of mine which i guess makes sense.  being that monta is probably the best ramen place in town i decided to add a star.\n\nanyways, came back over the weekend for a second try and ordered the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> with extra pork. it was mm mm good and the extra pork definitely hit the g-spot.  i did regret not adding the egg and corn, im sure it would've made it perfect.\n\nstill pretty hot inside even with the ac fixed but i guess it's tolerable after the use of 10 napkins to wipe off my sweat.", 
            "the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> broth was delicious.....yeah it was 110 degrees outside and the ac in the restaurant was not working, so as i'm eating my soup i was getting pretty sweaty, but despite of that the service was good and the soup was delicious...so i will be going back..!", 
            "my schedule at work was changed for the weekend, and a coworker who was leaving a hour after i am off the clock suggested going to get ramen.  then she said monta ramen.  i guess she has been reading the many positive reviews on yelp.\n\nso off we went to monta ramen.  the place was 85f with the fans (ceiling and the other portable ones) going full blast.  i suggested eating at the bar, since i know there is a fan blowing right next to the cashier area.  but the restaurant was still pretty packed (11 of us total) at around 4pm on a summer saturday.\n\ni tried the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> this time, while my friend tried the miso.  shoyu was good and i didn't feel it was too salty like the other two ramen.  and my coworker enjoyed the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>. both of these options are prepared with the thick ramen noodle (just fyi), which i prefer anyway.\n\noverall, another satisfying dining experience at monta ramen.", 
            "went there tonight with hubby and friend.  we ordered two <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>, one <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>, a side of chashu, an order of gyoza, and three beers on tap, total came out to $31.14 not bad.  \n\nthe gyoza was very tasty, chashu nice and tender, noodles were great, and the broth was alright nothing spectacular (better with the grated garlic they give you).   i like to put gyoza in my ramen (kinda like wonton mein or mandoo kook soo), there's something about dumplings in broth that makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside (my comfort food).  \n\nit is hot in there and eating hot ramen does not help, my husband couldn't wait to get out of there.   service was fast and friendly.  so far best ramen in vegas.", 
            "can't say enough good things about this place... i actually joined yelp  just to write a review. \n\ni travel very frequently & always try to seek out the best ramen / noodle houses in the cities i visit often as i'm a noodle junkie. i don't know why it took me so long to find monta, though i'm really happy i did as i'm in vegas every other week. \n\nfirstly, the greeting and staff are extremely friendly - which really surprised me in a positive way considering monta is located in chinese town (an area i typically expect to be underwhelmed by service). very attentive and happy - i left in such a better mood than i arrived!\n\ni sat at the comfortable wooden bar & ordered the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> with extra chashu. it was nice to watch the 2 cooks prepare the bowls ordered before mine as it was immediately clear that they were dedicated to the quality of preparation, ingredients and timing to ensure their guests received a perfect serving. in between orders i watched one cook prep and truss the pork for slow roasting & was impressed with the skill.\n\nmy bowl arrived as a perfect portion & nicely presented. i only added a dash or two of the toasted sesame seeds & a dash of the chili powder that were part of a good array of seasonings available to personalize the noodles to your taste. i like that.\n\nthe broth was truly wonderful: rich and creamy while carrying a fresh pork flavor. noodles were nicely cooked, although a little thinner than i find my favorite to be (santouka still purveys the finest noodle i have come across). the definite star of the bowl were the delicate and chashu slices that pinch perfectly into the grip of the chopsticks! the flavor, texture, and quality of this moist pork is truly superb.\n\nsuffice to say that monta has immediately become a favorite here in vegas; a city where the experience usually fails to measure up to the hype.\n\nenjoy.", 
            "the 5 star bump up is courtesy of my mom and grandma in law loving this place. my mom in law doesn't like asian foods, but grandma does since she grew up in indonesia. bf and i are food adventurous- them not so much. it's sometimes a struggle sometimes finding new places to please everyone so when they're happy with something, it makes me very happy. \n\nwe like to bring them out of their comfort zone and let them explore a bit. they shared a tonkatsu ramen and a <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>. they said it was the best soup and best pork they ever had. \n\nbf tried the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>- it is similar in profile that it is still the creamy brother like the tonkatsu but the added miso paste just add some sweetness. it's good but just whatever you're more into will determine the best soup: tonkatsu- savory/saltier, miso- sweeter and cuts the saltiness down a bit. they are very similar though. \n\ni went a different route and got the hiyashi chuka which is listed on a white board (not on the menu) as \"cold noodle salad\". the cold noodles come with julienned cucumbers, tomato, kikurage mushrooms, pork slices, half a egg. it has a ponzu sauce and has a smudge of karachi mustard on the side of the bowl to add as you wish (a little adds a perfect kick to everything). i also got a small chasu bowl too which is topped with some <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> and nori. \n\nthe service is friendly and attentive. i always appreciate places that have very nice servers. i have a habit of talking about the service and i think maybe i should start actually naming good servers so that maybe businesses can pay attention to who in their staff is doing things right. miki ( pulled these off receipts) just happened to be our server each time. :-)\n\nupdate 9/13\nbrought my mom in law and grandma for lunch. they didn't hesitate to say to eat here since they love the tonkatsu ramen and the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>. i got hiyashi chuka again since i love that dish and they do it well here. i also got a <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> bowl. not for everyone, but i like spicy roe and rice.\n\nupdate 10/26\nnothing better than soup on a crappy day. <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> this time. it's good. i think tonkatsu is my favorite, but i'll order this again. sometimes i feel a bit of variety. i always get a <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> though :-) it's noms.\n\nupdate 11/07 \ntried doing half shoyu and half tonkatsu broth. you can now order it as such. keep in mind this has the skinny noodles and not the curly ones incase you prefer one or the other. i think this is my favorite broth. tonkatsu is delicious- but it's rich. shoyu is good- but it's a bit lighter than i want. marry the two together and it's a really nice inbetween flavor and consistency. this is what i'll be ordering from now on. i will try to ask if i can do a shoyu miso as well since i think that would be a good, more delicate balance. \n\nupdate 11/16\ngot a <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>, but also tried their gyoza. it's pan fried, nothing too exciting about them, just what you'd expect a gyoza to be like. i was in the mood for them, but not something i'd get often i think.", 
            "so far i've tried their miso and soy sauce based ramen and they were \"wonderbar!\"  on the menu, you have the option of adding corn, a hard boiled egg, and scallions to your ramen; so its almost like a make your own ramen type deal.  i loved the shoyu (i think thats what it was called) ramen. amazing flavors to go along with the corn, egg, and onions i added to my ramen. \nthe second time i came, i had the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> which was good but i didn't expect the broth to be as thick as it was.  i also asked for extra noodles that i thought was already thrown into the soup but it actually came on the side.  for $2.50 extra, i had more than enough noodles and just saved the rest for later. \nas for the interior, its quite small but mimics the feel of how a real japanese restaurant would be. service is super nice and its in a good central location. so i'll be here a lot more often now that i've discover it. thanks fellow yelpers!!!", 
            "stopped by this place on a way back from red rock. it was full of middle-aged japanese guys that were apparently refueling after sunday golf.\n\ni had a <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> with some kind of a 'special roasted pork'. it was pretty good but i can hardly say that i was blown away (like quite a few reviewers of this place). it was just ok.", 
            "finally got around to visiting the latest addition to ramen houses in vegas - monta noodle house.  conveniently located on spring mountain, right next to the super busy raku.  (smart business choice i would say.)\n\nthis place is bare bones - as in minimal tables and a bar, so don't come with a large group.  their super simple menu gets you in and out fast!  (a couple who came in around the same time we did had ordered, gotten their food, finished, paid and left by the time we were eating ours.)\n\ni went for their most popular dish - <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> ($6.95).  the main component is the broth, which is made up of boiling pork bones, fat, and collagen for hours.  this results in a cloudy white broth and would usually have the consistency of a thin gravy.  it automatically comes with two slices of char sui, takenoko (bamboo sprouts), kikurage (type of mushroom), and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>.  their char siu (barbecued pork) definitely isn't like the chinese kind, but definitely tasty.\n\nthe husband went for the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> ($7.25), which is ultimately bean paste blended with the pork broth giving it a richer flavor.  this was also good, and quite filling.\n\nwe also shared a regular order of the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> ($5.75).  it sits on a bed of rice, with fresh scallions and pickled red ginger.  i adore pork belly and the next time i come here, i'm going to order a dish of this all to myself.  it's fatty and good.  \n\na side dish we added on was the <mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark> ($1.50).  you can have this on the side or in your broth.  it's pickled mustard greens that may or may not be to your liking.  it's adds a different texture and taste to your ramen.  other toppings you can add on included nitamago (seasoned hard boiled egg), corn, butter, kimchee, and more char siu or <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>.\n\nthere's only one other kind of ramen they offer here - shoyu, which means soy sauce based.  you can also add extra noodles for $2 more if you save your soup and ask for \"kaedama.\"  other dishes available are gyoza, <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, kim chee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, takana <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, cha siu bowl, and <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> (marinated polluck roe).\n\nservice was good.  with two waitresses, they keep the flow of business going great and refilled beverages as needed.  it's not the best place to loiter with the limited seating and all, but definitely a great place to grab a quick bite and go.\n\nupdate!  \ni returned the following month for my own bowl of the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>.  this time the pork belly was sliced thinner, which wasn't to my personal preference.  guess it depends on who is working the kitchen that day.", 
            "this review is long overdue, as this is one of those places that i keep forgetting to review even though i eat there quite often.  monta is my favorite ramen house in town, and is the best that i have tried.  the broth is deep, full-bodied, creamy, and very meaty.  this broth is what is missing from many ramen places.  the noodles have very nice texture, which is what i mainly look for in the noodles.  \n\ni usually get the tonkastu ramen with a little extra roasted pork, but i like the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>, too.  the miso is also very good, but just different.  i would characterize the miso as sweeter, and i usually prefer the meatier broth to the sweet broth, but that's just me.  i also love that all the ramen's are below $7, i believe.  i think i usually pay around 6.95 for the ramen, so it's a great deal.  \ni have also tried the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>, which i really like.  i always try to order pork belly wherever i see it, and monta's did not disappoint.  \ni also like to get their canned, chilled <mark>Oolong Tea</mark>.  i think they have a couple other types, but i usually just get the oolong.  \n\nif you like ramen, you should definitely check out monta.  but if you don't like soup, noodles, or any combination of these, i wouldn't come because most of their menu is ramen.", 
            "this charming restaurant offering the best ramen in vegas is located two doors down from raku in the seoul plaza on spring mountain, and could be one of the smallest restaurants in the city. monta is actually so pea-sized that if you come during peak times you'll almost certainly have to wait before you can sit down. don't let this be a deterrant, just keep it in mind before you go, and get there quickly before even more people find out about it.\n\nhalf of the restaurant is an open kitchen, so your dinner music consists of the clanking of woks and pans accompanied by the chatter of the waitresses, cooks, and other patrons. you can sit at the bar if you really want to be part of the action, or if none of the five tables are available. though the vibe is nice and busy, the waitresses are sweet and won't rush you through your meal.\n\nthere are three types of ramen to choose from; tonkatsu (rich, cloudy, almost creamy broth); shoyu (light and delicate soy sauce based broth); and miso (somewhere in the middle of the other consistencies and tastes like...miso). the shoyu and <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> come with chewy, thicker noodles which i much prefer in texture and taste to the thinner, less al dente noodles that come in the tonkatsu (you can sub if you like). all three varieties of the ramen cost around $7 and also come with chasu (tender, roasted, fatty pork), scallions, kikurage (mushroom), takenoko (bamboo shoots), and scallions. you can then customize your ramen with little extras that include perfectly coddled egg, butter, more pork, and my personal favorite, takana, or pickled <mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark>. these don't cost a lot, so customize away. also, be sure to add some of the fantastic accoutrement residing in your condiment tray such as pickled ginger strips and minced garlic.\n\nyou won't find much other than ramen on the menu, just a handful of appetizers and sides. of these i've had the gyoza ($5.95), which were excellent one time but not cooked correctly another, and <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> with takana. the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> is almost as good as the ramen, so if you aren't in the mood for soup get this instead. another plus is cheap beer ($2.50 for domestic).\n\ni can't think of any other meal i'd rather enjoy on a cold day than a steaming bowl of hearty home-made soup, so i plan on going to monta frequently this winter. if it continues to get even busier, however, i may be taking it to go in a perfectly packed parcel. i brought ramen home for my husband once and was amazed at the care put into ensuring the soup would be just as good at home as it is in the restaurant. the noodles were wrapped in their own little pouch, waiting to be cooked until they reached our stove, and all the other ingredients were individually wrapped to keep them in their peak state. attention to detail really separates the boys from the (ra)men.", 
            "i have previously mentioned that i subconsciously have high ramen expectations.  but for some reason, this place just somehow managed to smash that.\n\ni was first taken here on something of a whim.  we were going somewhere else, then the plans changed.  i'll admit, i was definitely not happy about it, as i know that any ramen place has a 90% chance of disappointing me.  but the second i walked in, i was taken aback to the tiny ramen shops back in japan, with 1 long bar and a few tables.  immediately my attitude changed for the good.  i looked at the menu, just 3 kinds of ramen, but you really don't need an exotic variety, just the ones you're really good at making.\n\nbeing kinda picky, i had ordered the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>, but with no mushroom or bamboo shoots, and added an egg and corn.  the soup came, and i did my usual broth test and was very surprised to find it was really good to me.  i added some sesame oil and went to town.  the egg was a nice addition, and the corn just reminded me of the food in japan.  \n\ni was highly satisfied by the food and the place.  i will definitely be back again.", 
            "i have been looking for a place in las vegas to grab some good ramen for a very long time, and up until now i have yet to be very satisfied. after hearing so much about monta me and a few friends decided to check the place out rather than go with our usual tuesday night plan of getting wing tuesdays at buffalo wild wings.\n\nwe get to the parking lot and this place is pretty much something that you definitely had to hear about to come find because it was buried inside a small restaurant complex which i have passed a million times but never really noticed. the venue is very small. according to the max capacity sign it could only hold about 26 people but on a tuesday night, it wasn't very busy.\n\nas i was browsing the menu, i wasn't too excited. i was hoping that they would have a larger selection of different ramen because all of the previous places i had been to had at least 7-8 different kinds. monta however had 3 main types of ramen; tonkatsu ramen, <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>, and <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>. to go along with the ramen they had various different toppings you could add including boiled egg, extra slices of pork, more noodles, <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> among other things that i don't recall.\n\ni ended up ordering the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> with a boiled egg and 4 extra slices of pork and upon taking my first bite i was instantly satisfied. this was the ramen place i had been hoping to find all along. the pork was amazing and the egg was cooked just right. the miso broth and the noodles, everything blended in together so nicely. an order for extra noodles were only $2.00 but unfortunately, i had eaten just a little bit before going here so i couldn't get more but i will definitely be coming back much more often especially now that winter is around the <mark>Corn</mark> and a nice bowl of hot <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> will do me some good.\n\noverall the meal cost me $10 which, considering all of the toppings i added, is very, very decently priced. i recommend this place to anyone who like me has been looking for really good japanese ramen.", 
            "whenever i wanted to eat ramen in las vegas the best option was to stay home and cook a bag of maruchan. why is that you ask? because at least then i'm already prepared to be disappointed. the ramen scene in vegas is not that great, there are few choices of where to go and even fewer options of what type to order.\n\nhearing from my friends that we were planning to visit a new ramen place i got quite excited. were we finally going to find a place worth eating ramen at after all these years? the simple answer, yes.\n\nas soon as i walked into monta i knew that this was going to be a place we would eat again. the decor was simplistic in nature and at the same time very enchanting. there were few seats, maybe 26 at most, but you didn't feel cramped at all. we chose to sit at the bar seating and got a great view of the chefs at work.\n\na first look at the menu told me that there were three different types of ramen to choose from. this may not seem like a lot but accompanying that was a decent sized list of sides that you can add for a small price. as my nickname is miso, i decided to stay true to it and order the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>. i requested no bamboo shoots or mushrooms, that come with the order at no extra cost along with some slices of pork. i also decided to add an egg to my order because egg in my opinion makes everything better.\n\nthe staff there was very upbeat and happily took our orders. they were very chatty with each other, but not in a bad way. this is the kind of staff that you know they enjoy their work. if anyone needed a refill on their drink the staff was very quick to notice and refill them without any trouble.\n\nas the food arrived all of us looked at our food putting off the first bite in fear of being disappointed once again by another bowl of ramen, boy were we wrong. the first bite was amazing and with that we began to devour our dinner with gusto. the flavor of the miso was a little on the salty side but not so much to over power it. the noodles were prepared well and the texture was enjoyable. the egg that i had ordered did not disappoint, and the pork was a pleasure to eat. the size of the order was enough to make me content. had i wanted more there was an option for more noodles for $2.00, which is not that bad at all.\n\noverall the experience at monta was a great one. it may not be the best ramen out there, but it is for sure the best ramen you are going to find here in vegas. the pricing is reasonable, the order came out to under $10.00, and the food did not disappoint. if you are looking for some good ramen, monta is the place to go in town! we will most definitely be making return visits in the future!", 
            "did you ever think there would be such a restaurant here in an \"all-nighter city\" that cooks and serves ramen noodles? yes, there is tucked in-between small shops along spring mountain road or otherwise known as \"chinatown\" in vegas.\n\nas you may or may not know it', \"ramen\" noodles is one of japanese noodles invented in 1958 by japan's nissin foods. these are thin, ribbon-like, lightweight, calorie-rich, tasty, and cheap that can be bought in packs of 1 or 10 (you can find them in your asian or oriental grocery near you or in any of your college friend's pantry). it's one of those quick cook-it-up soups.\n\nit's rather an eccentric choice of mine to dine in this place with my mom last night around 6 p.m. on a very rainy night in vegas. soup is the answer to the cold, wet rain! ramen is kind-of over-the-top in this restaurant!\n\nwith a sweet, smiling greeting from the waitress, \"moshi, moshi!\" in japanese, which translates to \"hello\" or rather \"welcome!\" (i have learned a few japanese greetings in high school and  having been to tokyo before, the greeting didn't sound \"foreign\"). it brought a smile to my lips, i knew i would have a good dining experience. \n\nthe restaurant is small and cozy but cheerful with minimalist japanese style decor including the bathroom's interior design was contemporary japanese. there are table seatings and bar-like seating available. menu is simple. three choices of ramen noodle soups in \"<mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>\" (pork bone), \"<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>\" (soy paste), and \"<mark>Miso Ramen</mark>\" (bean paste). nothing else to confuse any soup-hungry soup-lover. a list of toppings for the noodles soup for an extra charge, 8 \"other dishes\", 4 kinds of cold beverages, 2 kinds of beer choices, but no dessert and no hot beverages on the menu.\n\ni ordered the house specialty soup which is the \"tonkatsu ramen\" soup. it's very hearty soup in a thick, cloudy milk-like tasty broth. topped with <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, 3 slices of pork, bamboo shoots, and with kikurage (dried black mushrooms), i drizzled it with sesame seeds and hot spice powder. oh, wow, there was no need for chewing the roast pork that melted in my mouth. surely, the pork melts! another dish i ordered was the \"mimi mentaiko\" which consists of fish cod roe (or fish eggs which are red-orange in color is otherwise, caviar) with strips of nori seaweed and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> topped on a bowl of steamed japanese rice. very appetizing, a sure favorite! the \"<mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>\" is also one dish you ought to try; delicious. as usual <mark>Green Tea</mark> on ice was my beverage pairing for these meals.\n\nfunny thing...the cheerful smiling waitress who served us went to show her colleagues in the kitchen my soup bowl which made her shyly squeal in delight to show them all it was empty!! i caught a glimpse of the cook's smile.\n\nyes, i left nothing in the bowl, not even a drop of soup!\nit must have been that i really love soup, or it was cold and wet outside or just that i needed to fill my belly...how can you go wrong in making such a choice to eat for the night. for a price that's easy on your pocket, aahemm! wallet...an excellent deal! \"arigato gozaimas!\" (english translation is \"thank you!\"), as we left the restaurant in good spirit!",

            "first off, i respect any place that has great service & a friendly staff, so as long as they're respectful, they get a ton of points just for that.\n\nmy friend suggested i go to this place when i asked for a place to eat at because my friend#2 and i were pretty hungry. a few of my other friends have also been visiting this place a lot within the past week so i finally got a chance to try it out.\n\nthe place is in a small plaza and the building itself is very small and cozy. when we went there, the place was somewhat busy and there was limited seating. there was just one table left and instead of taking it, i took the bar with my friend because i thought another bigger party might need it later.\n\nbecause of a friend's suggestion, i ordered <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> for my first time, but that was disappointing. i didn't like it, but my friend did. he had his with the boiled egg as well. maybe it's because i'm not a ramen eater or something, but it was somewhat salty to me and i didn't really like the taste. i wonder if it has something to do with it being miso? i don't know.\n\nmy goal is to try all 3 types of ramen they have just to see if there is one i'll really like. i shall update then. they also have extra stuff that you can add to your ramen (ie: egg, extra pork, corn, etc.) that starts at $0.75+. the menu is quite cute and small. the choices are limited, but i think it's just right. beats all those menus that are overwhelming.\n\nmy friends all love this place. give it a try and you might fall in love with it, too.\n\nupdate: i've tried all the ramen and ever since, i always go back for tonkatsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>. updated to 5 stars.", 
            "this place is tiny. it has basically 3 different types of ramen and you pick and choose your toppings. it is very unique for vegas and it is what  typical ramen house is. i guess since i am not crazy for ramen, i just thought it was ohkay. i had the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> with kimchee and corn, because when it comes out it comes out bland. they give you 2 tiny pieces of pork, and it looks very fatty. the ramen noodles were good and seemed fresh. the soup is hearty. the noodles in the tonkatsu ramen are thin and look different.", 
            "i've always been on the lookout for good japanese ramen, and i always thought that ichiza's ramen was the closest i'd ever get to authentic. boy was i proven wrong, monta's was the most amazing and flavorful ramen i've ever had in a long time.  i'm not from japan, but i am from hawaii so i do know what good ramen's supposed to taste like.  despite it being a little pricey, i say i'd go back for another bowl.  the people were nice, and the atmosphere is very chill.  i ordered the tonkatsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> and added pork belly, nori, hard boiled egg, corn and butter....and damn! did that intensify the flavor. my best friend ordered the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> with pork, and nori.  his didn't look as amazing as mine, but it was good regardless.", 
            "monta noodle house is the kind of joint you end up in when you come to vegas with a bunch of asians.  ehem! let me rephrase that... hungover asians.  \n\nthis joint is mad smalls yo!  not only that, it was packed at 4pm!!! yeah the hungover asians woke up effin late for \"lunch\".  we obviously had to wait since we rolled 9 deep up... we waited around for maybe 20 minutes inside since it was way too cold to wait outside.  we were finally seated and served by the nicest waitress ever.  this chick smiled every moment that i remember at monta.  very nice and curtious.\n\nwe ordered the following dishes:\n\n<mark>Miso Ramen</mark> with chasu:  if you order this ramen, i warn you... do not add butter!  this thing is mad heavy.  i felt i was drinking mashed potatoes at one point.  the flavor was amazing but it came out warm and not hot enough for the weather.  i wish my bowl was just a bit warmer and less heavy.  other than this the soup was really good.  the chasu pork just melted in my mouth. mmmm\n\ndumplings:  perfectly fried.  now i've tried dumplings for many years and this place had one of the best!  dumplings are supposed to have that golden roast fried look.  monta's dumplings all had this color.  once your dumpling has dark brown or black then that mo'fo is burned out and will be waaay to crispy.  if your dumpling doesn't have that golden roast then it probably is just semi fried which is too bland and soggy.  \n\npork belly rice:  this was pretty good too.  very tender and well marinated meat and enough ginger for a unique taste.  most people in my party chose this as their favorite. \n\nton katsu ramen:  my friends ordered this ramen which was pretty good in my opinion.  the description on the menu made it seem very rich in fat and unhealthy but it actually turned out to be less heavy than the miso i ate.\n\ngood to know where to get my ramen fix in las vegas!", 
            "this is the best ramen i have had in any state.  i always get the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> with extra chashyu.  the chashyu is melt in your mouth amazing.  portions are huge the servers are nice... i really cant find anything wrong with this place.  to drink they even have calpico and some japanese beer.  the gyoza is good as well.  everything else on the menu looks delicious, but i also just end up ordering ramen since it is a noodle house.  don't go here with more than 4 people though, because as is common in japan ramen houses this place is very tiny and can get quite crowded.  i honestly recommend going right when they open.", 
            "if you have ever had ramen in so cal (santouka and shin-sen-gumi hakata for example), you'd know this place does not measure up at all.  \n\nmy <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> was thick and salty.  it was more like gravy than soup.  my fiance's gyoza tasted like they were bought from the asian supermarket.  while the botton was cooked, the top was still cold.  \n\nbad choice for dinner.", 
            "my first experience with authentic japanese ramen, and i was not disappointed. prior to monta, the only types of ramen i ate were in packages, cups and bowls, usually korean in descent and instant in nature. so i was surprised, in a good way, when i discovered that japanese ramen is nothing like the ramen i've eaten before. \n\nmy boyfriend was craving ramen for dinner, so i immediately suggested monta noodle house after remembering all the positive reviews on yelp. we entered the restaurant and, thankfully, they had a table for two available. the restaurant itself is small, reminiscent of an authentic ramen house in japan (at least in my mind). service was friendly and quick given the ratio of servers to customers. \n\nafter reading over the menu, he ordered the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> with extra char siu and a <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> while i ordered the tonkotsu/<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> and an order of gyoza. here is the breakdown of the food:\n\ngyoza- hot pan-fried pork and vegetable dumplings with just the right amount of crisp from the charred skin which contrasted well with the soft and juicy meat filling. overall, very good and savory. \n\n<mark>Miso Ramen</mark>- he enjoyed his ramen, saying that it tasted very authentic. i tried some of his ramen, and while i preferred the broth of his ramen, i liked the thinner noodles from my ramen more. \n\n<mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark>- he enjoyed this as well. i think it was the perfect light contrast to the heavy ramen. \n\ntonkotsu/<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>- delicious! the noodles were perfectly cooked, and the vegetables added texture and mildness to the rich broth. my only complaints are that the broth was just a tad too salty for my taste and the char siu lacked the meatiness i wanted. \n\noverall, we enjoyed dinner that night. i enjoyed my experience there so much that two days after my initiation into the japanese ramen world i went again with my mom.", 
            "we went to monta noodle house for japanese ramen.  it's in vegas chinatown area, behind the jack in the box, in the seoul plaza.\n\nthey have good hours something like 11:30a-10p everyday.  \n\ni got:\n\n<mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> $6.95 - it's a small bowl, 2 pcs fatty pork, small amount of noodles, some <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, & the broth, no egg that's extra, no seaweed - that's extra.  still liked it.\n\nb. got <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> $7.25 w/ extra bamboo shoots .50 + nori .75\n\nour total 15.45 + $1.25 tax = $16.70 before tip.  charged it.\n\nquick & fast dinner before our flight home.", 
            "i've been coming to this place since they've opened.  i would give them 5 stars if i had reviewed them earlier, but as of late their broth has been overly salty.  however, i keep coming back for more since this is pretty much the only legitimate ramen shop that i know of in the las vegas valley area.\n\ni usually order the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> with nitamago, <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, and corn (sometimes i go wild and order butter too).  the broth is on the fattier side, and is rich and nutty.  overall, this is a good bowl of ramen.\n\nservice is friendly and quick and their streamlined menu captures all the quintessential components of your basic ramen shop.", 
            "went back today for a big lunch. i ordered <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> and pork belly rice bowl ... so good ... i brought 2 coworkers with me ... they are hooked as well. service was excellent and food as well. not a big menu but executed well.", 
            "ordered the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>. great tasting ramen! i loved the broth, had a rich flavor. the portion was generous and quite affordable considering how much you're getting. although i don't really would want to get their bowls, my friend ordered the beef <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>, expecting it to be as big as the ramen bowl but alas it was really small. \n\nnote: this place is small and gets crowded real quick. don't come here with a group no bigger than 5-6. you're going to find it real difficult to get a table.", 
            "good service here, the girl is nice and speedy.  the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> is toooooo salty, but still tastes good. the portions are ok as well, but the price is def a little higher than what i would want to pay for gourmet ramen. will try again though", 
            "service here is hit or miss. sometimes excellent, sometimes not so attentive. i've eaten here about 9 or 10 times, and i noticed that it is server dependent. there are 2 servers that seem to consistently let me down, where as the other 2 are always great and work together well to make sure they always check up on us.\n\nthe chasu (bbq pork) here is quite good, imo it is better than the chasu at the well known daikokuya in los angeles. oddly, they have 2 different types of ramen noodles here that are assigned to the type of broth you choose and they will not let you choose the other noodles with a different broth. i prefer the noodles they use in the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>, but normally prefer a combination of tonkatsu and shoyu broth. the lack of flexibility is a bit upsetting and leaves the foodie in me yearning for food my way. \n\nfortunately, i tried all of their <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and rice bowls and have been pretty happy with all of them. my favorite is the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>. yum!!! i add a bit of the crushed garlic, chili oil, and japanese chili flakes to make it absolutely scrumptious. if you like pork (who doesn't), you must try this.", 
            "i love my noodle soup and so glad we tried monta.  we tried various dishes like tonkatsu ramen, <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>, pork belly with rice and kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.  everything was delicious.  like many reviewer commented, adding an egg in your ramen soup is greatly suggested.  the menu is fairly small, but i can go there numerous times a week if i live in vegas.  delicious food that won't break your bank.  what's not to love!", 
            "i have only had ramen at a few places but this is the best i have had.  i get the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> and it is such a smooth yummy broth.  i love how you can choose what toppings you want on it and i love the condiments as well.  this place is not very big so if you go during a busy time you may have to wait a little bit but if ramen is what you want, i think its the best place in vegas.", 
            "this place has the best ramen in vegas! the place is very tiny but i love sitting at the bar where you get a full view of what's going on in the kitchen. i like to order the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> with golden corn. i'm no expert in miso but it's the most delicious i have ever had! the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and gyoza are also really good too although sometimes the gyoza comes out stuck together and rip when you pull them apart. otherwise the service has always been great and friendly, but winter time is the best to go because they have no air-conditioning!",

            "best ramen in town imho... the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> broth is savory and quite rich, but a bit too salty for me. i tend to lean more towards the tonkatsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> where for me the broth is to my liking. all ramens are delicious though and i would recommend trying them all. my favorite adds are extra <mark>Chashu Pork</mark>, egg, shreaded <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>. i alway leave enough broth to order kaedama (extra noodles).",

            "holy crap the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> is really salty. the broth is still good though..you can really taste the miso. my sister had the tonkatsu ramen, which was much less salty, so i liked it more than the miso. both soups were yummy. it's amazing how they get the broth to be so creamy without any butter!\n\n<mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark> is meh, it wasn't as kimchi-y as i would have liked it to be.\n\nfyi: they have different noodles for each broth. the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> has a thicker, chewier noodle (dericious) while the tonkatsu ramen has a thinner noodle that i didn't really care for. i didn't do this, but you could probably ask for the thicker noodle + the tonkatsu broth! \n\ntry to go early to avoid lines! we went around 6 pm, and by the time we left (630), there was a long line outside the door. everyone seems to be in and out pretty fast, though.",

            "i recently decided to try \"monta\" again when my mom came into town. i knew my mom would not like \"anime ramen\" because it's too loud in there. i wanted to originally take her to \"yagyu yakiniku\" because they have a very spicy broth that i know she likes, but to our surprise they were closed when we got there. and, we didn't like the new \"ramen sora\" when we went there a month ago... so we had no choice but to try monta. \n\nwe usually don't like to go to monta because of the long wait time to get a seat, but to our surprise there was no line and we were sat immediately. i've come to the conclusion that if you go before 5:00, there is usually no wait time. \n\nthe thing i like the best about monta is that you always get good service here. if i rank the service from 1 to 10(with 1 being the lowest),  i have never experienced anything less than a 20!\n\nthis time, i tried the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>. it was excellent. i think they have the best <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> in the world. no other restaurant compares. \n\neveryone knows from my previous reviews that my favorite ramen in the world is <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>. the thing about <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> is that no region has a similar recipe. and ramen houses that are located in the same area will always try to copy each others style. in san diego, the popular ramen houses pack their miso broth with boiled cabbage and give you nothing but noodles and broth. that means you get no egg, charsiu, bamboo, or fungus like you do anywhere else. in los angeles, the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> is typically pure white in color, and extremely spicy. at the restaurants which are run by ethnically chinese people who are japanese in nationality, the broth is very smooth, thin, and full of sesame oil. now, las vegas is the only region that doesn't have a typical style of  <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>. monta's <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> has a broth that is pure yellow, smooth in texture, not spicy, and the taste of the actual miso beans is extremely strong. anime ramen has a miso that is almost identical to what you get at the ethnically chinese-japanese ramen houses.  and yagyu has a spicy white-broth ramen that is very oily, and heavy in meats.  so, if you like a non-spicy traditional japanese taste then monta is for you. if you like a spicy traditional japanese ramen that has way more meat than noodles, then yagyu is for you. if you like a thin broth full of sesame with all the sides included, then anime ramen is for you. that's what i like about the lv ramen scene: diversity! \n\nin the end, after trying monta again after many months, i have come to the conclusion that monta is still the undisputed champion of las vegas ramen.",

            "i gotta agree 100% with respected yelper: tien n's review. he was the only guy brave enough to leave a low rating for monta. personally, i think that most people are riding the bandwagon and just rating this place up because everyone else is. i came again today, and just couldn't enjoy the ramen here like i used to. \n\nlike most of my yelp friends already know, i am somewhat an expert at ramen. during my college years, my friend takeichi and i went on a bizarre and pointless quest across the west coast in order to eat <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> at every single famous ramen house in america. 30 days and over 50 ramen houses later, we declared ourselves ramen masters.\n\nramen has a lot of historical and cultural significance to the japanese people. after the defeat of the imperial forces in ww2, japan had practically become a poverty stricken 3rd world country. it was around then that ramen became extremely popular due to how cheap the ingredients were. there was one ramen house in san diego which i visited years ago, that had the exact variation of post ww2 ramen. the ramen itself was practically a less salty version of shio. it had absolutely nothing in it besides for noodles and salt water. that means, you get no charsiu, egg, or vegetables. personally, i thought it was the worst bowl of ramen i have ever had. the owner of the ramen house told me that the only reason she serves this depressing version of ramen is because of it's cultural significance. at least monta doesn't have anything that bad...    \n\ni guess the reason i originally liked monta was because i was so used to eating the extremely spicy style of ramen from california, so when i first had monta's <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> it was so different that i actually thought it was good. i can't identify which regional variation of ramen is served at monta. me and takeichi think that it might be a specific shibuya variation, but we just can't come to a positive conclusion. but, we do believe though that it definitely is some kind of tokyo variation.\n\ni myself have begun to believe that the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> at monta is actually a combination of toyko style and a random american style. in the 1960s, ichiro mashita created the \"california roll\" because americans kept complaining to him that his rolls that had otoro in it tasted like garbage.  i kind of think that monta's recipe is the \"california roll\" of the ramen world. and that's why it's rare to find a full-blooded japanese person eating here.\n\nweird observation:the tonkatsu and the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> here at monta taste almost identical. this is very unusual. those two should never taste that  similar.\n\none of my friends who is full-blooded korean always refused to come here with us. when i asked him why, he said it was because koreans believe that ramen is \"the food of the rats\". i don't know what that's supposed to mean....\n\nit is just so difficult to move around here. the seats are designed for people who are less than 5'5\" and weight around 120lbs. the stools at the bar area are very uncomfortable. walking to the bathroom is difficult because you keep having to bump into other customers and the girls at the cash register. it's common for ramen houses to be small, even the most popular ramen house in america(orochon) only seats like 20 people and the chairs are very uncomfortable. but, somehow monta is far worse. \n\nlike 90% of the customers here are yelpers. every time i come here i recognize someone from their yelp picture. \n\nwhen i was here today, i overheard a person talking about how monta is \"the greatest\" and anime ramen is \"fake ramen\". to me, anime ramen is far better than monta. anime actually gives you gigantic portions of bamboo, mushrooms, corn, eggs, and charsiu for free, while monta charges extra and only gives about 1 tbsp of micro-sized diced bamboo. today, i ordered extra butter and i got a teaspoon. at sora or anime, they would have loaded my bowl with butter. also, at sora and anime, the bowls are at least 30% larger.  but, the best thing about anime is that they give you 3 slices of narutomaki for free.  also, the guy who runs anime ramen is a guy named ryosuke and his dad is one of the most  famous traditional japanese sushi chefs in america, so i don't understand where this \"non-japanese\" rumor is coming from.   \n\ni still believe that monta has the best <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>, but out of the 3 major ramen houses in lv(monta,anime,sora), i gotta say that monta has the worst <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>. maybe the reason why monta has bad <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> is because it is a toyko style ramen house. and toyko style ramen houses always specialize in shoyu. while, it is the sapporo style ramen houses that always specifically specialize in <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>(<mark>Miso Ramen</mark> was invented in the city of sapporo).  but, i still love the excellent customer service here, so i'll give monta 3-stars.", 
            "ordered a <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> with the boiled egg and it was excellent .\n\nthe broth was done very well the egg tasted like butter don't know how they did it but it was great!!\n\nthe two pieces of chashu was not dry but tender and had a layer of bbq 'd jellied fat around it. two pieces were enough. \n\nservice was attentive\n\ni will be back when i visit vegas", 
            "after night one, we needed soup to help nurse our hangovers.  my friend turned to yelp and found that monta had a bunch of reviews and was overall rated four stars.  after dining at monta and though the price is right, my conclusion is either vegas lacks great ramen spots or vegas yelpers have low expectations for ramen...or maybe even both...\n\nwait:\nour party of seven arrived a bit after 1pm on a friday afternoon.  monta isn't a big place.  they accommodate approximately about 10 people at the bar and another 20-25 seated.  we waited about 30 minutes for a table which in the end, our party of seven had to split into two separate groups to be seated.\n\nfood:\n*tonkatsu ramen ($6.95) - though the broth was tasty and hearty, the noodles totally failed.  the noodles were different from what i am use to and i wasn't a fan of the thin, vermicelli like noodles which made the broth taste starchy the longer they sat there.  toppings on the noodles were two pieces of chasui, bamboo shoots, <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, and kikurage mushrooms.  one of our friends ordered the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> and it came with noodles we were more accustomed to.\n\n*<mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> ($3.95 small/$5.75 large) - delicious!  we ordered a large bowl and shared it with the table.  a generous amount of tasty pork belly is shredded over rice and topped with chopped <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>.\n\nservice:\ntypical asian restaurant as you basically order, get your food, and get the bill.  food took about 15 minutes or so to come out.\n\nparking:\nprivate lot", 
            "the gyoza and <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> at this place is killer. the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> a little salty for my liking and the noodles a little too soft. besides that excellent ramen.  the service sometimes isnt that great, but its understandable because they are usually pretty busy", 
            "seriously, im getting addicted to this place. noodles are perfect, broth is always creamy and perfectly seasoned, sides are delicious. service is quick and friendly. what more can i ask!!??\n\nso far my favorite is <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> with nitamago and nori. last time, i ordered the  <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> (with spicy cod row) and was blown away by how great everything tasted. \n\none of the best meals under $10 in a city of great restaurants.", 
            "monta is amazing. not only are the noodles killer but i love the idea of a tiny little restaurant that really only does a handful of items. you won't find desserts or even much for appetizers here. but what they do they do to perfection. every couple of weeks i need my <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> fix. i plan on moving next year and i know monta is one place i will miss.", 
            "the ramen scene here in the valley is mediocre at best. i guess i'm a bit spoiled by the quality ramen establishments in hawaii like nakamura ramen and orenchi in santa clara, ca. for las vegas, i believe monta is the best for here. i ordered the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> and it was heavy and thick in consistency. the noodles were slightly over cooked. despite this, i still believe its one of the better ramen establishments for las vegas", 
            "monta ramen: the 411 and maybe something different than the 559 other monta reviews...\n\nlocation: 1 block west of decatur on spring mountain road. it's tucked into the back of a small shopping center off the north side of spring mountain. signage is minimal which means if you're not paying attention you will miss it.  \n\nparking: limited parking spaces if other businesses nearby are open. can be tight to park if crowded. \n\nmonta is small. square footage wise they've taken a small space and maximized every square foot of it. don't be surprised if there's a wait that you have to stand outside as there's room for maybe 2-3 people inside the front door. \n\nseating. they have a handful of tables and a counter with slightly uncomfortable stools you can sit on that looks into a fun to watch kitchen. if you are shy, claustrophobic, or don't like slurping noodles where anyone can watch this is not the place for you. \n\nfood: i walked in here skeptical. 559 yelp reviews. lots of heated discussions, controversy abounds about monta. i came to try it, and i came in a bad mood to boot. i ordered <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> with extra slices of charziu. and i had an omg moment here that left me with a smile from ear to ear and i left the bowl totally empty. i will say that ramen sora has better charziu, hands down. but the overall experience i had at monta was superior in every other aspect.  \n\nspecial notes: monta's <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> has a bit more oil in the broth. it's not an oil that ruins the taste, it seems to enhance it somewhat. but it's also a small problem if you're sitting at the counter slurping a bowl of ramen and you get some splash back that lands on your shirt. if you've got to go back to work after eating at the counter, having some shout wipes on hand is essential. \n\noverall impression? i loved it. from the wide range of people i ate lunch beside to the overall awesomeness of the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> to the friendly and fast staff, count me among those who understand why monta inspires such a range of emotion. for me, this was an experience i won't soon forget, and i can't wait to go back and have more of it.", 
            "mmmm monta, i want to go to there. i always leave satisfied.  most delicious pork ever.  actually it's so rich that i don't usually order extras, 2 pieces is enough for me.   some reviewers have said that it's too salty and sometimes i agree, but then i just pour more water in it to balance it out.  my go-to ramen:  <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> with <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, egg, and kimchee.", 
            "everyone needs to be aware that this place is small. i think even using the word small is inaccurate, but tiny. absolutely no waiting area, so you have to wait inside, the place is crammed, and the parking lot itself isn't that big either. i had their <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>, which was yummy, but salty. the pork served in it....to die for! this place would be a lot better if they simply had more space! the good thing is that they are opening a new location next year in green valley! yay.", 
            "definitely yummy ramen and it comes out really fast, which is good because they only have 5 tables and maybe 10 seats at the bar, so they need to rotate people quickly. we went around 1pm on a saturday and had to wait about 15 minutes for a seat. \n\nordered the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> and the broth was really good, but a bit too salty for my taste, but still really good. the pork was really good, and the noodles were best towards the end of the meal because they had gotten softer after soaking in the juices. initially they were more al dente. \n\nsince this is my first visit to a ramen restaurant in las vegas, i'll probably try a different one the next time around so i have something to compare it to.", 
            "this tiny little ramen place was everything it was cracked up to be.  my parents live locally and they'd heard from several sources about how great this place was, so when we were visiting, we took them out to monta.\n\nwe managed to get there at the perfect time because only 1 table was occupied, so getting my dad in was quick and easy (he is in a wheelchair).  they don't have hot drinks, so enjoy some ucc oolong or <mark>Green Tea</mark> or a can of calpico (i wish they had ucc iced coffee!!)  we placed our order and watched as the crowd built up very quickly.  food arrived fast and piping hot.\n\nthe gyoza was fine - crunchy on one side, steamed on the other, hot all the way through.  my mom and hubs got the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> and my dad and i got the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> (i got mine with corn)\n\nthe charsiu/chashu/chasyu (how ever you want to spell it) was so amazing - i do not use this phrase lightly.  it was literally melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  the pork fat was flavorful and rich and just melted away when it hit your tongue.  so amazing!  i am sad that i didn't stop and order a side of it immediately.\n\nthe ramen noodles had a great chewy texture and the miso broth was delicious.  my mom was very pleased with the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>, as well.\n\nthe only thing that didn't live up to everything else was the mentaiko bowl.  i got it because i love hot rice and tarako (and my mom had made some for me the night before and i was still jonesing for it).  unfortunately, the rice was not very hot and a little on the dry side, so the bowl was disappointing.  i ladeled some of the miso broth into the bowl and that made the rice more palatable, but it messed with the flavor of the mentaiko.\n\nall in all, it was a great experience and i can't wait to go to vegas again so i can go to monta again! \n\n**accessibility note - the parking lot is not very wheelchair friendly and monta itself can be a little tight to try to get a wheelchair in and out.  the only wheelchair ramp up from the parking lot is blocked by the car when you park in the handicapped space, so once you get the person into their chair, you have to move the car to get them up to the sidewalk level where the restaurants are.", 
            "i've been to this place for a while. no matter when i go (11 am, 2 pm, 4 pm or 9 pm), it's always crowded. therefore, it's not a good restaurant for a big group celebration (because of the size of restaurant), but if you are looking for an authentic and delicious ramen, cold noodle or <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>, this is the place you shouldn't miss when you visit vegas.\n\nmy favorite is <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> and <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>. some of my friends claimed the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> was slightly salty, but i disagree with them. the fat of <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> created this awesome aroma and chewy texture from this simple dish. no matter what i ordered that day, i can't help but always order an extra small <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> every time i visited.", 
            "tonkatsu ramen was pretty good.  the broth and meat had a slightly different flavor then most ramen places that i've tried--in a positive way.  the broth was more creamy and the meat had a grilled taste to it.  my friend had the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>, but i think the tonkatsu was better.\n\nprice is usual for a ramen place.  the bowl comes standard with mushroom, 2 pieces of meat and bambo shoot.  i then added an egg and seaweed.\n\nthe place is super small and the wait is long.  but overall, i would come back if i craved ramen while i was in vegas (only if i was craving it though).", 
            "every bowl of ramen comes with two slices of pork chashu, <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, kikurage (black mushroom), and bamboo shoots. there are four different types of broths:\n\n1. shoyu- soy sauce-based broth, pretty salty and nothing spectacular, average\n\n2. miso- miso-based broth, salty but not overwhelmingly so, pretty run-of-the-mill <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>\n\n3. tonkotsu- pork flavored broth, savory, and has a creamy texture. the soup's thick consistency is due to boiling pork bones, collagen, and fat for a long period of time. some people find the thickness of the savory broth distasteful and unsettling. if you're not a fan of a thick soup, i would skip this one. definitely one of my favorite broths to get here.\n\n4. tonkotsu-shoyu- best of both worlds, the tonkotsu and shoyu work well to balance each other out. the shoyu waters down the tonkotsu so it's not as thick and the tonkotsu adds a bold, fuller flavor to the shoyu. this is definitely monta's signature ramen and a must try.\n\nadditional toppings: some of the toppings are noticeably more expensive compared to other local ramen joints that already include these toppings in their ramen.\n\nadditional notes: \n*if you order extra noodles (kaedama), it comes in a separate bowl usually in the middle of the meal. it's been heated up so your noodles are still delicious even if your broth is not as hot as in the beginning. \n* there are two types of noodles to choose from: thick cup ramen style noodles (that definitely taste nothing like those horrible cup noodles) or a thinner noodle similar to chinese egg noodles (not the noodle that usually comes with wonton noodle soup). i definitely prefer the thicker noodles; the thinner ones tend to be overcooked easily and soggy. \n*there is a $10 minimum on credit cards. bring cash if you don't plan to spend more than that.\n*they will not sit you at a table unless your whole party is present.\n\noverall:\n\nso far, monta has the best ramen in vegas. (still need to try anime ramen, and fukumimi though.) it's just the thing that hits the spot on a cold chilly night when you need some warming up. \n\nservice varies depending on how busy they are. bar seating may get uncomfortable for some but that's how traditional ramen houses are: small and cramped. seating is very limited so anticipate a wait if you're coming during peak hours. \n\nthe consistency of the ramen sometimes varies as well. sometimes the chashu is over done, resulting in a dry piece of meat that doesn't have that heavenly gelatinous soft layer of fat that melts in your mouth. also, the noodles sometimes come out too soft if they've been sitting there for a while. once in a while, the yolk of the hard boiled egg will be completely solid, with none of that ooey gooey goodness. these hiccups happen rarely, only when they're extremely busy and it's during peak hours. portions are decent sized for a regular person. if you're a gluttonous fatty like me, it's better to share <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> (which is quite delicious) with a buddy.\n\noverall, despite the ridiculous wait sometimes and food consistency issues, monta is definitely a must try for locals and tourists.", 
            "monta monta.. do you want to monta?.... f**k yeah i wanna monta. a friend of mines mention to me about this place when she was in vegas. so the next time i went to vegas, i decided to try this place out cause i love good ramen. line here sucks but it is well worth it. the first time i had this place i was blown away at how scrumdidilumpcious. i decided to go back to this place again the next day just so my friends can try it out also. <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> was excellent. the pork was so tender that it melts in your mouth. same with the egg. the only thing i would complain about is the gyoza. they tasted like the one you brought in the frozen good section at the store. stay away from the gyoza and you would definitely give this place 5 stars.",

            "i've probably been to monta ramen about 20+ times now, and in my opinion it's the best ramen noodle shop in town (fukumimi does come close in my opinion....more on that in another review. \n\nthe food (5 out of 5):\ni usually order either the tonkotsu shoyu or the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> and then add an egg. i absolutely love their broth (i am a big fan of salt after all). at times, we will order gyoza and/or <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> to go along with our orders of ramen, and that is usually a good way to round out the meal.\n\nthe service (4 out of 5):\ni love how fast the turnover of tables is after a patron as left because there is usually a line of people waiting to get in. this is my only true gripe about monta; i just wish that they had just a little more seating room. hint: if you go here for lunch, they open at 11:30am......just make sure that you are a couple of minutes early otherwise you will be waiting about 20-30 mins to get seated.\n\nthe price (5 out of 5): \nok, i guess that this could be better if it were free, but come on, that's not going to happen! but, you shouldn't be paying any more than $20 pp here (more like $10-12 pp if you're not getting any extras and/or having water as your drink). \n\noverall:\nmonta ramen is at the top of the pack for japanese ramen noodle shops in las vegas in my opinion!",

            "a vegas institution. delighted that i discovered it early on, as it's tough to get in these days. completely addicted to their <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>. i once went there straight from the airport after spending a month traveling in south america -- i didn't even drop my suitcase off at home first! this is not a place to linger over a meal, as they try to turn tables quite quickly, but there are plenty of other places nearby where you can get coffee and linger. fantastic food and very consistent. limited menu and just some beer and wine, so if you are looking for other items beside miso, some <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and some appetizers, i wouldn't choose monta. however, for the best miso soup in town: monta all the way. i am so hooked on their food that sometimes i go there twice a week. -- even if i happen to be on the other side of town. highly recommended.",

            "monta is the real deal, go here.\n\nthe restaurant is pretty small and you can almost count that there will be a wait any time of day, in fact, when they open for lunch at 11 there is often a line already forming.\n\nok the food:\n-<mark>Miso Ramen</mark> is fantastic,  it is my go to.the broth  is delicious and the noodles are chewy and plentiful, there is also the most tender sliced pork on top. you can also get extra items like more pork, butter, corn, sliced egg, all make your soup even better.\n- pork  belly over rice is a winner, just like it sounds, the pork belly will melt in your mouth.\n- gyoza is the best i have ever had!!\n\nthe atmosphere is nice and the service is quick and friendly.", 
            "monta, according to one of my friends who lived in japan, is as close to authentic japanese ramen as you can get in las vegas. i'll take his word for it.\n\nthe small ramen joint does not fit many and there is often a wait. your entire group has to be there in order to be seated as well. there is a $10 minimum for card.\n\nthe waitresses are obviously experienced and seemlessly work together and with the chefs to efficiently serve customers. they are friendly, but not overly so. food comes quickly as well because their menu is pretty small.\n\nmy usual order is a <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> with corn. the main reason i get corn is because the broth is a little too salty. many people complain about this but i never really felt the extent of monta's salty broth until the past year or so. it just seems thicker and more unhealthy than it used to be. i'm not sure if their recipes changed or if my tastes changed.\n\nyou get nori, chashu, and bamboo. condiments you can add include garlic puree, pickled ginger, sesame oil, soy sauce, sesame seeds, and chili powder. one thing that used to bother me when i first started coming here was that they only have <mark>Green Tea</mark> iced and in a can. \n\nthey also have a few other dishes besides the various ramen, including rice bowls, friend rice, cold noodles, and gyoza. for recent additions to the menu, they have the option to make your noodles spicy (+$1) or the kuro ramen, which is black garlic ramen. it's actually pretty tasty in my opinion, but i am an avid eater of garlic.\n\nregardless of the heavy mouthfeel of the ramen, the consistent service and food keeps regulars like me coming back.", 
            "this is the first restaurant i go to whenever i visit vegas.  no joke.  me and my gf eat here as soon as i get off the plane, it's that good.  we first tried monta before it received all of its well-deserved notoriety, and were able to get seated right away.  not anymore; expect long lines until near closing time.  the atmosphere is very authentic, very small and very loud and simultaneously chill.  service is excellent despite there being only two people working the floor at any given moment.\n\ni always order the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> with extra chasu.  it used to be my favorite until i noticed that it got a little saltier in the last few months.  so i've switched to regular tonkotsu.  what sets monta apart, in my opinion, is the melt-in-your-mouth goodness of the chashu, and the depth of the broth.  i consider monta to be in the top 3 pantheon of ramen in the western us, besting daikokuya in los angeles and hakata in gardena.  you must try this place if you are in vegas.", 
            "now this place is awesome, great atmosphere! i feel like i am in a real ramen house with all the hustle and bustle being around the small yet very effective kitchen. i got the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> and ordered a hard boiled egg. the broth was amazing, well seasoned and was not overpowering. the ramen itself was cooked perfect and the chasu was melt in your mouth! the egg was like the icing on top. all the flavors came together in perfect harmony and was such a treat to eat. i have eaten here multiple times and is a place that i highly recommend! if you have family coming into town, this is definitely a place that you should bring them to. if you are coming to vegas then this is also a place you should go and try, it is off the beaten path but it is worth it. great place and will be back time and time again.", 
            "i have been going to a lot of ramen places lately, looking for the best ones.  some have been amazing, some not so much.  this place was sort of in the middle.  it's very small, which is appropriate for a ramen shop.  our party of three waited for about half an hour for a table on a friday around noon, which was to be expected.  we were seated at the bar, which has a nice little shelf underneath to put your purses on.  =)  i ordered the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> and added boiled egg (nitamago).  the first few bites i thought were delicious.  then the saltiness became a little too much for me.  i couldn't eat it all, and took about half of it home in a to-go container.  i had the rest the next day, and again, it was tasty but way too salty.  and i usually love salt.  i still ate it though.  someone else in my party ordered the kuro ramen and loved it.  i'd go back, but maybe try a different flavor.", 
            "short: everyone in vegas, local or traveler, should go here. best ramen i've ever had (and i've had a lot).\n\nlong: i'm a very critical person who isn't impressed very easily. most of my reviews on yelp have 3, and the rare 4 stars. this is worth 5 stars. \ni went here with a friend, were a couple minutes late and had to wait. it's not in the best place in the shopping center, but doesn't matter much. get here when they open if you don't want to wait.\nwe ordered their specialty tankatsu ramen, and was served within 10 minutes (very quick). noodles were packaged, but very good. the roasted pork on top was thin, but tender and flavorful. the rest of the toppings; mushrooms and bamboo shoots and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> helped the ramen nicely. what makes it all go together was the soup stock. amazing. \non top of that, for $7 the price is totally right. not too cheap, not too expensive. and worth every penny.\n\nlike other reviews compare, the only contender to monta ramen is sora ramen. i suggest monta first, definitely. i believe it's on an entire different level than sora. but, sora's extra cost does get you more: thicker meat, more soup, a tad bit better topping, but the noodles and soup stock isn't as good.\n\nsecond visit: still amazing. had the <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> bowl. it was good, and a nice side.\nthird visit: still amazing.\nfourth, fifth, sixth... seventh... i forgot how many times i've been here, but it still blows me away. i had the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> and that was very good as well.",

            "yum yum yum, i love ramen, so of course i had to have it in vegas!\n\nwait was not bad at all , 5 minutes, but we came in on a monday night before my flight out, so that may have been why. i ordered the kuro ramen (black garlic oil ramen) and it was possibly the best kuro ramen i have had thus far. there is a restaurant that specializes in kuro ramen near my own home, but it does not compare to monta's. \n\nthe food came out pretty fast, which is always awesome. the garlic was incredibly flavorful and aromatic and just amazingly delicious. chashu was also really nice and tender. my only qualm was that the broth was a little salty for my own liking. i had to add some ginger and sesame seeds to cut the saltiness a bit, but other than that it was very, very good. if i had access to mona ramen close to my own home, i would eat there so much it would definitely not be too good for my blood pressure.\n\ncan't wait to come back and try their tonkatsu and <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> as well!", 
            "we had to wait quite a while because this is a very small place, but it was worth it. we ordered <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> and <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> (x3), gyoza, and the kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. the kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was a total hit with our group, and everything else was good as well. the gyoza was nice and crispy. we will definitely be back but we will probably try to find out what their peak hours are so we don't have to wait as long next time.", 
            "definitely a great place for ramen.\nhad tried all of their ramen. my favorite would be the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>. place is small, but definitely has the japanese ramen shop feel!\n<mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> is a must!", 
            "this ramen place could do well in the la area. i had the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> spicy and the flavor was on point. the charsu was delicious and basically melts in your mouth very quick service of course and a great feel to the restaurant. definitely will stop in again when i'm in town.",

            "this place is amazing! be prepared for a long wait if you come during peak hours because it's a small restaurant. we ordered <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>, <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>, pork bellly bowl and <mark>Chashu Bowl</mark>, and kimchi. my favorite was the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> (~$3 for small, ~$6 for regular size), the ramen bowls were fine but they weren't the best i've had in vegas.", 
            "i usually eat at orochon in la but, figured i'd give this place a try - excellent! better than orochon. ordered <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> with pork, <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, egg. flavor was awesome. service was quick, place was clean. only downside - it is small so get there early.\ntomorrow, <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> on bed of rice. see pics.", 
            "made fresh to order all the time.  <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> is great and the portions are plenty.  the soup base is so tasty and i love the corn added to it.  the pork is very tender and not too fatty.   \n\nthe waitress is pleasant and to the point.  usually always a line outside before they open so expect to wait a bit.  \n\ni will definitely be back for more good ramen after a fun night in vegas.", 
            "this place was super busy on a weekday. obviously they must know their ramen. thank goodness we only had to wait 30 minutes. \n\ni ordered their <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> while my husband ordered the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>. verdict? the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> was a lot taster and the noodles were better. the broth had a rich depth of flavor and the noodles were thicker and perfectly al dente in japanese terms. \n\nthe place is very small so be prepared for a wait, but i think it was worth a drive from the strip. cheap, good eats!", 
            "i love this place. i've been here several times but always forget to give a review. (probably due to the food coma). food is spot on and i always order the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>, gyoza and asahi beer. we're on our way tonight and i feel my mouth watering  already!  oh and food is cheap too!", 
            "i got the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>. the ramen was good, the prices are great, the wait was only 10 minutes on a friday. however, we were shocked that they had extremely limited options for our vegetarian friend. she ended up paying too much for a small portion of <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, for which they would not substitute the pork (expensive) for a side of corn (dirt cheap). this is a small place, not good for groups larger than 4. i wasn't blown away by the meal or experience.",

            "this is a wonderful little ramen place that has friendly service and decent prices! my boyfriend and i stopped in for dinner around 6:00 pm on a monday and only had to wait 5 minutes for a table. the restaurant has about four tables, three tables seat four people each and one table seats six people, and then there is bar seating. as we were leaving the restaurant a little before 7:00 pm, i noticed that there were several people waiting outside for a table.\n\ni ordered the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>, while the boyfriend had the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>. our food came out quickly in 10 minutes or less, much to our delight. we both agreed that my clear shoyu broth was much better, as the creamy miso one was a bit salty. both of our dishes featured their thick and wavy noodles that had a great, chewy texture. the pork chashu is super tender and melts right in your mouth *drool*. if you are a meat lover, you may want to add extra chashu (four pieces) since the ramen only comes with two pieces. the fatty part of the pieces of meat is what packs such flavor and gets you hooked. i added corn and a soft flavored egg as extra toppings to my bowl. the bamboo and black jelly ear mushrooms that come with all ramen dishes made each bite unique and delicious. the gyoza dumplings were just alright - i probably wouldn't order them again. \n\ni will definitely visit monta ramen again the next time i am in vegas!", 
            "delicious!!\nthe place was so small. i think it has about 20 seats includes bar table. so we expected to wait during weekends. ramen was cooked perfectly, and the soup was good. we all like the tonkotsu, shoyu and <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>. also tried the black garlic oil ramen but not as good as we thought.  other dishes like <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, mentaiko and gyoza were good too. if a bowl of ramen can't fill you up, you can order extra ramen with just $1.5.", 
            "the ramen here is pretty good. i personally got the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> and the broth was alright. you have to pay for extra toppings such as corn, egg, and butter, which i did not like. overall, ramen sora is better in my opinion, but monta is not a bad place to go for your ramen fix.", 
            "what a great place to have lunch.. remember to get here early and make sure that everybody in your party is here because the won't seat you and the place is tiny so the waiting sometimes could be long but totally worth it.\nwe usually order <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, gyozas and the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> with egg and onions, food here is always amazing  as well as their service.\nthere is also a location in henderson but for some reason this one is just it!!", 
            "wow!!! i have tried several other ramen places in chinatown and this one definitely had the best <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>, ever! it was so inexpensive, too. i am definitely going back. thank you for making my night, monta ramen!!", 
            "my this would be my go-to ramen spot if it wasn't always so damn busy. it's small and popular. they really need to expand this location. but if you do get in, try the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> and a few upgrades. don't be afraid of the the butter. trust me, it's worth the extra calories.", 
            "affordable and delicious! sat at the bar area. it was interesting to watch them make the ramen over the counter. smaller location but that doesn't bother me. i had the spicy <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> and the broth was just right. the only thing i added was an egg because what's ramen without egg? amiright? but the portion was perfect for me. i also tried the gyoza. a good appetizer if you just want gyoza, but nothing special. i would come back!", 
            "our usual ramen sora was closed, so we decided to give their rival down the street a try.  we were there 5 minutes before opening, joined the throng of people waiting to get in, and happily we were able to get seats at the bar immediately.  i couldn't believe it when friends said that this place makes ramen sora look huge, but boy were they right!!  i think monta ramen seats maybe 35 people total and has a tiny waiting area.\n\ni was very happy with the service!  waitstaff was friendly, efficient, and checked on us regularly, even with a completely full house.  i loved being able to sit at the bar and watch the food being prepared.  this is one area they have a leg up on ramen sora.\n\ni ordered <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> with corn, butter, and soft cooked egg and hubs had <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> with <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>.  at first, i thought my broth was completely lacking in flavor and was so disappointed.  turns out that all the flavor had settled into the bottom of the bowl.  a good stirring fixed the problem.  wish i had realized that earlier!  lol!  hubs and i both felt that the pork was extremely fatty and the texture was just not good.  \n\ni suppose that if i had never had ramen sora, this might have been fine.  but i have had it and i will be going back to our usual from now on.  at least i can say that i've now made an informed decision between the two rivals.  :)",

            "this was my first meal in vegas and it was really good! finding parking here was kinda annoying since the parking lot for this shopping center was small. we were actually surprised that we were able to be seated right away as a party of 5. when we left there was a line going outside the door, so i'd either come early or expect a wait because this place is super tiny inside (there's a few tables and then bar style seating). \n\nlooking over the menu, i was shocked at how cheap the ramen was. but then i realized that the ramen is very basic -- broth, 2 slices of pork, <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, ramen and bamboo shoots. if you want extras like egg, extra pork, corn, kimchi, etc. you'll have to pay extra. but even after adding toppings my food still came out to be like $10. \n\nwe started off sharing a <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> as a table. it was pretty good! as for my meal, i ordered the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> and asked for spicy paste on the side. i also opted to add the egg and corn.  after adding the spicy paste in my <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> it tasted great and was full of flavor! the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> also had the thick wavy noodles that i love. \n\nservice was quick and efficient. i kind of got the vibe that they wanted us to leave quickly after paying the bill, but i can't really blame them with a line out of the door! if you're looking for an inexpensive meal that will fill you up then you should check out monta ramen!",

            "entered this place after a good foot massage next door. the space is rather tight with ten seats on the bar counter and 18 more on the floor with tables. the menu was quite simple, ordered the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>, cold noodles, tonkatsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> & and gyoza.  everything was so tasty and especially the cold noodles tasted especially nice & cool, just soothing when the temperature was 106 f outdoors. among japanese restaurants that i have been to, this one is genuine japanese.",

            "google maps will lead you past this tiny restaurant if you're heading west on spring mountain road. the icon will show that you need to pass hauck street. don't make that mistake, monta ramen is actually in the plaza before that street. google map takes you to this empty plaza with nothing but a sleazy looking massage parlor. hmmm....? \n\nthis small hole in the wall restaurant interior reminds me of daikokuya jtown la but even smaller! they had an l shaped bar which probably sits 10-12 people max. there were about 5-6 regular tables, some made for two people & some made for four. what happens in a place like this? a number of overflowing people waiting out the door. i recommend you coming early or during non-peaked hours. we got lucky because there was only one party ahead of us when we got in but that quickly changed. by the time we got out, there were at least 10 parties on that waiting list.\n\nfirst thing i noticed was the array of condiments in front of us. shredded pink ginger, purified garlic, white pepper, japanese chili powder, spicy a$$ hot chili oil, vinegar, soy sauce just to name a few. love restaurants that aren't all hipster tight up the butt about their condiments.\n\nhad the tonkotsu-<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>, a mixed blend of pork bone and soy sauce type soup based. the first one i've ever had actually since i'm typically accustomed to just tonkotsu base. it was a little less rich and thick then the tonkotsu base but still had that cloudy and strong taste. i added an egg and kimchi for a little more. for you carb lovers, you can add extra noodles for a minimal fee. i was quite satisfied with my ramen. my expectations were met even though they weren't that high since we were in vegas and we know la is crawling with bomb ramen houses. the <mark>Chashu Pork</mark> was quite fatty and the slices were on a smaller scale. the bowl of ramen itself was enough to make you full but not overly stuffed.\n\nalso ordered the <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> bowl - cod fish row, seaweed, <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, over rice. nothing significant to report. the fried gyozas (pork and vegetable filling) were decent.\n\nthe ramen is nothing to die for but it really wasn't too bad. if you have a mad craving for ramen or just want to get something other than pho on spring mountain road aka chinatown, then monta ramen is there for you. just be ready for a wait time. the ramen met my simple standards and the price was very affordable. the hard working staff are efficient and all \"peace sign\" fobby smiles.", 
            "this was definitely a great find!  if you like soup noodles, soups that takes hours to make, or melt in your mouth pork belly...then this is a must try. \n\nthis place is very small with minimum seating area and a limited menu.  their main focus is their ramen and <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>, so if you do decide to make the trip out from the strip of las vegas (about a 10 min taxi ride), then you have to try their ramen and <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>.  tip:  anticipate a wait due to the limited seating area.  fortunately, we were in luck...no wait!  score!!!  the prices here are very reasonable for the portion and the flavor you receive.  you are definitely getting your money worth.\n\nwe ordered the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> and a small <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>.\n\nthe <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> was a small size, but it was plenty for us since we totally devoured ourselves with tons of fantastic food on our trip to vegas.  the bowl was pretty when it arrived!  the bowl was decorated with pickled ginger to cut the fattiness of the pork belly and an abundant amount of scallions to give the bowl a fresh green flavor.  below the green and the red, was a pile of juicy, tender, and fatty pork belly gleaming at you. \n\nthen our star...<mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>.  we added extra <mark>Chashu Pork</mark>, corn, butter, and egg (this is a definite must add...super soft and melt in your mouth!) to our bowl of ramen.  i have to say, this was a delight to the eye.  the portion was a good size, about the equivalent of a large bowl of pho.  the flavor of the soup was deep and meaty, the noodles had a good bite to it and every bite had the yummy soup flavoring (we saw them cook the noodles in the slow cooked broth), the pork was drool worthy, the crisp sweet corn added an additional tastiness to the bowl, and the black fungus and bamboos added earthiness.\n\noverall a delicious experience...simple yet still makes us think about it all the time.  of course not as good as the ramen you can get in japan, but definitely pretty good for usa.  we would rate this place a 7 for flavor, price, and quality of ingredients.", 
            "i didn't realize how hard it would be to find a really good ramen restaurant after moving out of hawaii.  however, monta comes close to filling the void.  monta is a small japanese noodle house in a strip mall in china town.  if you don't like waiting to sit down, get there early as the line usually begins to form before the restaurant opens at 11:30am.  there are a few scattered tables, but i prefer to sit at the bar and watch the cooks prepare the dishes in the open kitchen.\n\nmonta makes tonkotsu ($6.95), shoyu ($6.95) and miso ($7.25) ramen broths.  while all three of the broths are very good, the milky white colored tonkotsu (stewed pork bone broth) has an especially savory meaty flavor.  my favorite is the combination tonkotsu-<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> ($6.95) which tempers the intense meaty taste of the tonkotsu with the salty shoyu broth.  the thin yellow ramen noodles have always been consistently cooked to the just right texture, neither too limp nor too firm and underdone.  the ramen comes with basic toppings (<mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, bamboo shoots, kikurage mushrooms and two thin slices of marinated <mark>Chashu Pork</mark>) however, like all good ramen joints, they have a whole list of additional toppings you can add (for a little extra cash) to make the dish your own.  the combination of flavors and textures soaking in the hot broth goes down well on a cold day.\n\nwe also usually order the pan fried pork gyozas ($5.15 for 6) and a small kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> ($6.95).  the gyozas are excellent and the moist rice has a good flavor.  each table has an array of sauces and condiments that you can add to your meal (rice vinegar, soy sauce, chili oil, sesame seeds, and chili pepper) as well as little jars of crushed garlic and red pickled ginger.  they also serve beer to wash it all down with.\n\nthe service is fast and the food comes out quickly.  so even if you do get stuck waiting in line, it usually moves fast.  and if you are in the mood for good ramen, it is worth the wait.", 
            "it's about time i write a review for my beloved monta! first things first i didn't like this place at the beginning but i gave it a second try and i am hooked. i came here so much that i became the duchess after having 30-35 check ins lol yes i'm that obsessed. sadly someone took my spot but whatever lol \n\ni usually order tonkatsu shoyu with chashu,nitamago & corn..\nthe broth is just sooooooo gooood! i've been to so many ramen places here in vegas and none of them can compare to this! \nthe broth is like creamy pork flavor with shoyu (soy sauce), the <mark>Chashu Pork</mark> is very tender and thin which is perfect for me it's so so so good! the noodles are firm and not too soggy which i love as well ^__^ \nfor side dishes i usually get takana <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and gyoza :) so yummy \n\nas for the people that work there, they already know that i'm a regular so they usually give us good seats and we also tip them really good lol\njust don't go there during the weekends or around 7pm so many people waiting in line. i just wish they would renovate & make the place bigger since its very famous already and u get to sit more customers ya know?! \ni can't wait to go back this week & eat there again. writing this review just made me hungry!! :p",

            "during my last 3 visits here to monta i did not see even one japanese person eating or waiting in the 2 hour long line. do you know why it is that the japanese community in lv has turned their back on monta? there are many reasons.....\n\ni was confused. i was really confused. why was i not a fan of monta? every chinese person kept telling me that monta was \"the best\". every korean woman kept telling me that it was \"the best\". even their white husbands kept telling me that monta is \"the best\". my mexican-american and black foster kids kept telling me that monta was \"the best\". why is it that i didn't like it when everyone around me kept saying that it was the greatest? am i just not japanese enough to enjoy monta? my dad is a 3rd generation japanese-american and he did marry a korean woman, so maybe that korean blood in me erased my ability to determine what a good ramen is. but then i started noticing that all my friends and business partners who were born and raised in japan kept insisting that monta was not \"the best\", in fact they thought it was \"the worst\". so i came to the conclusion that japanese people just don't like monta like everyone else does. \n\npersonally, i think monta is  the california roll of ramen. it's a slightly americanized variation, just like how the california roll is an americanized variation of traditional maki. monta's ramen belongs to no true japanese region.  it's made in america like burgers and fries. \n\nno one eats comfortably at monta. the place is extremely cramped, the chairs are very uncomfortable. the counter is made of that cheap plywood you find at discount furniture outlets on maryland and flamingo.  the bathroom is like 4 feet from the bar, and some guy always insists on taking a huge dump and leaving the door open. there is never any parking in the lot. frequently, i just drive across the street to shuseki(a chinese-japanese restaurant) where it's much more comfortable and the ramen is f*cking awesome.  monta is the most popular ramen-ya in vegas, so why won't they move to a larger space? one of the wealthy korean business owners who is a member of my asian-american activism agency informed me that seoul plaza(where monta is located) has the cheapest rent in chinatown.  the owner of monta is attempting to cut costs to maximize profits and that's why he won't leave seoul plaza.  cheapness is the main reason! and cheapness is also the reason why your bowl of ramen at monta is only half the size of the other 4 major ramen-ya's in lv. and cheapness is why you have to pay extra for every little thing. you gotta pay extra for noodles, you gotta pay extra for the egg, you gotta pay extra for butter and corn! how cheap is that!!! if you get all the add ons, the bowl of ramen comes out to like $15.00. you can get the egg, extra charsu, extra noodles, 50% more broth, corn, butter, and garlic oil all included in the $8.00-$9.00 bowl of ramen at fukumimi. the deluxe ramen at sora also has everything included and it's only like $10.00 flat.\n\nthe f*cking hipsters! this is a major reason why the japanese have left monta.  hipsters are usually white people, but they think it's cool to hang out in latino areas or chinatowns. i don't know why, but hipsters think it's \"lame\" being around other whites. unfortunately, they have chosen monta as their \"cool mi<mark>Nori</mark> hangout spot!\". as a japanese-american, do i wanna sit with a bunch of guys with \" david lynch eraserhead\" haircuts who wear geek-sheek  glasses and talk about their feelings? do i wanna sit with a 6 foot 4\" man in a dress who is attempting to start a conversation with me about: indie rock, indie flicks,  jesus(aka obama), apple products, and how cool it is to wear sunglasses indoors?  my response= that's it! no more!  i'm f*cking out of here! i'm going to fukumimi!\n\nby the way... how f*cking long does it take for you guys to eat one bowl of ramen? while i'm on the waiting list for over 1 hour, i always notice how people finish their ramen after 15 minutes but just sit there and talk for another 45 minutes. this is the reason why we gotta wait so f*cking long to get a seat. \n\nmonta has the worst gyoza in lv. it tastes like the chinese variation, and they all stick together like they are frozen(look at my pics). and they give you like 5 pieces for $5.00. that's like a dollar a piece!! walk 2 minutes to shuseki for a much better gyoza.\n\nwhy did my egg come from the alley? they ran out of eggs during my last visit and then they ran into the alley and grabbed another box? are the eggs just sitting out there in some kind of big jar?\n\na japanese restaurant is supposed to have kim-uchi, not kimchi. i saw with my own eyes, the cook here at monta going to greenland to buy one of those giant glass jars of korean kimchi. at fukumimi, katsu-san makes his own kim-uchi which is slightly sweeter than korean kimchi. it's a true japanese variation of a classic korean dish.  \n\n#$@!*$#%$ *%#!  f*ck i just hit that 5001 word limit", 
            "a friend from los angeles recommended this ramen joint to me.  \"not the same but good enough\" were his exact words comparing it to daikokuya.  monta ramen is literally in the midst of other small asian food joints in a mini-strip mall in las vegas' chinatown on spring mountain road.  i honestly would have not known this place existed if my friend didn't tell me  about it.  parking was, for one, a bit limited.  \n\ni walked in to a small, maybe 6 (or 7?)  tables and the counter bar, stuffy and unventilated ramen joint.  it had the same feel of daikokuya:  cramped and rushed.  there were people standing, waiting and blocking the door.  i was offered to sit on the bar but there was no elbow room so i stood up and told the lady i would wait for a table instead.  the wait staff are japanese, but noticed 2 latinos working behind the bar/kitchen with an asian guy.  red flag i thought but then again i saw the framed accolades from different local papers and publications ho<mark>Nori</mark> and awarding monta as the best or one of the best in las vegas.   \n\ni sat down in one of the small tables and ordered their tonkatsu ramen ($6.95).   the bowls are smaller, i noticed, and they're somewhat stingy with everything, including the broth and the toppings.  i had a couple small slices of chasu, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>.  mine didn't come with marinated boiled egg.  i come to find out that you can order the toppings for extra charge.  really? for an egg? \n\nthe broth was a bit salty to my liking, heavy and tasted like it was enriched with milk or cream, or maybe miso.  the wavy thinner noodles were somewhat seasoned too, but not overwhelmingly salty.  their chasu, however, is to die for!  it's perfectly seasoned, cooked, caramelized and charred to my personal standards!  for that alone, i will come back and try their chasu rice bowl.  for their ramen soups?  i might try a different one the next time around, and maybe request thicker noodles.\n\nsidenote:  monta ramen was shut down by the southern nevada health department in mid march 2013 for 47 demerits, but have since re-inspected and reopened.", 
            "not bad, monta ramen... not bad at all. \n\nthree of my friends and i came here after a night dancing looking for some soup to appease our parched bodies. here are some things you should expect: \n\n1. parking\neasy peasy. there is a big lot, so no need to worry about that.\n\n2. the wait\noh my goodness. we came to this place like 40 minutes before it opened, and there was already a line. this being said, i highly recommend coming early & waiting, unless you want to be in the hot las vegas sun, grumpy, hungry, hungover and sweaty. \n\n3. the ramen\ni ordered the new spicy tonkatsu ramen with an egg. it was so good! the broth was very flavorful and not too salty (although, i've been told that i have a salty palette.. to each his own.). the pork in the ramen was soft and melted in my mouth! my only regret is not getting extra. my boyfriend got the tonkatsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with fat noodles, which was good, but definitely not as good as mine... i think his was too salty for my taste (which again, has been known to be on the salty side). even thought my ramen was overall really good, i couldn't finish it because it felt way too heavy/greasy in my stomach. i actually ended up with a small stomach ache after. \n\n4. the service\nokay, i guess i have to cut some slack here, because there were only 2 workers manning the floor, but it took forever to order/flag someone down... it kind of felt like they were ig<mark>Nori</mark> us on purpose at first. nobody likes to have to compete for attention! #middlechildsyndrome #i'mnotevenamiddlechild #yelpdoesntevendohashtags\n\n5. the value\nsuper cheap! also, a coke was only one dollah! to me, that seems unheard of in a restaurant... \n\nall in all, i recommend it. if you're like me and you easily get stomach aches from food that is too heavy, <mark>Butter</mark> or greasy, i'd recommend getting a coke or a sprite with your ramen so that you can burp all out alll dat ish."

            "there's an authentic ramen place in las vegas! i was really impressed with monta noodle house. their menu is very simple and short. i tried the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> and it was delicious! all this pork fatty goodness in the broth and the noodles were perfectly cooked not too soggy not too hard. you can add an egg, pork, corn, more noodles or <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> for a couple more bucks. it's a small place which only fits about 26 people max, but it definitely is the best place for ramen. the broth is not from a package and i think this is what makes it oh so delicious. we added eggs to ours, but i wasn't that huge of a fan. the egg was too \"raw\" for me, but the bf loved it.  the bf also ordered the <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> bowl, which is rice with cod roe. i didn't try it, but he liked it and the eggs are a lil more fishy than masago. definitely coming back for more and be prepared to be a lil sweaty when you eat!", 
            "hakata style ramen originates in northern kyushu.  it is in my opinion the best ramen you can get, with maybe kurume being at the same level.\nstart with a thick pork broth made with boiled pork bones to release the collagen into the soup.  next, add some of the best noodles i've ever tasted.  throw on some basic toppings like roast pork, <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, mushrooms and bamboo, and that's your standard bowl.  they also have one with miso.\nthe menu here is very simple.  there are the two bowls of ramen, and additional toppings, then there are a few small rice dishes (mostly <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> with some topping), and pot stickers.\neverything is amazing, be it service, staff, taste, decor.  there is not a good enough rating to describe this place.\ncome on in today, and look for them next to raku, and say hello to your new favorite restaurant.", 
            "dropped by today after googling ramen in las vegas and eventually found this new ramen-ya on spring mountain (it is in the same plaza as raku).  read the raving positive reviews posted on google and also by rod m., and i decided that i will resume my thus far unsuccessful search for a decent or better ramen place in las vegas.\n\nafter driving in the still very warm heat to the restaurant, i saw about 6 asians standing or sitting outside the restaurant.  i was thinking, damn word sure got out fast for these vegas yelpers, but it turns out that they weren't waiting for this particular eatery.\n\nanyway, i went in and immediately saw that it is a very cozy and nicely decorated (i would describe it as very modern japanese minimalist) restaurant with seating for 18 at the tables, and another 10 at the bar.  there is a small board hanging on the wall, on the right as you enter the restaurant, listing a few specials items not on their very simple menu (see the photo that i have uploaded).\n\ni decided to order their tonkotsu \"pork bone\" ramen and add a side of nitamago (hard boiled egg seasoned with soyu).  the ramen was prepared in a very clean and small kitchen, which you can clearly see if you are seated at the bar.  the ramen was served in an average size bowl, not small but definitely not large and probably just right for most people.  the broth was piping hot, the noodle cooked just right, and garnished with a small mound of <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> and two thin slices of their melt in your mouth chashu. i first tried the broth, which has a good depth of pork flavor and not too salty or greasy or water down like at some of the other local ramen places that i have tried on the east side of town.  the noodle was the thin variety, which is not my preference, but it was cooked just right.  overall, it was a good bowl of ramen and definitely the best i have had in las vegas. but to jeff and my other ramen connoisseur friends, it is not as good as the really awesome and highly regarded ramen served at santouka ramen (torrance, california) or santa ramen (san mateo, ca), but still worth a try when you guys are in town.\n\ni also ordered a <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> bowl, which was served with a decent amount of rice.  mentaiko rice bowl is nothing special, and not difficult to prepared, but it was delicious because it was made with fresh and quality ingredients.\n\nthe staff were very friendly and the waitress, megumi, was very attentive.  it wasn't busy at the time of my visit (just one other customer who was already there before i arrived), but i can see that this place starts to get more crowded as word spread of their good quality soupy goodness for a reasonable price.\n\n<mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> $6.95\n+ nitamago           $1.50\n<mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> bowl  $2.95\n\nto the owner(s):  i recommend that you consider adding chicken karaage to the menu or as a special.", 
            "\"got ramen?\"\n\nmy life has never been the same ever since i became lactose-intolerant. i've tried to substitute with soy milk to no avail. now thanks to monta, i can drink tonkatsu broth all-day to get my nutrients! yes, tonkatsu broth, rich, creamy pork marrow. served with slow roasted pork in pork fat. topped with <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>. i wish i drank this growing up, i would have been 6 foot-tall and playing in the nba. instead, i'm short and pull people's teeth for a living. \n\nmy one complaint, turn up the ac yo! it is hot! i was sweating more than the pig i just ate. i was sweating like a hooker in church. like junkie in withdrawal. like clinton next to an intern. like a blonde reading a math book. seriously chuck norris would complain that it's hot in there..", 
            "a quaint japanese noodle house packing big flavors best sums up monta. the place  is reminiscent to the noodle houses we frequent in torrance, ca and litte tokyo, offering a simple menu that doesn't detract patrons from the restaurant's main dish: ramens. we opted to try the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> (bean paste) and <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> (pork bone) with the addition of available toppings such as chasu (roasted pork -- not for the fat conscious eater), <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, and butter (yes, butter!). the third ramen offering, shoyu, is something we'll probably try on the next go. the noodles were chewy-soft and a bit firm which is how it should be, and with a flavor-rich broth that's a cross between creamy melted butter and meaty-savory -- a feat only possible with many hours of high heat infusion of the ingredients. on a hot summer day, the place suffers from the lack of a good a/c, but once you start chowing down your piping hot ramen, the warm ambience fades into obscurity. a definite must-try place that we're glad we stumbled upon!", 
            "went here last night for dinner and had a tasty, satisfying meal.   the restaurant is small and casual.  we ordered some gyoza, a tonkatsu ramen and a <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with egg and kimchi and some cold <mark>Green Tea</mark>.  i loved that they offered kimchi as a side (i can't have ramen without it!) even though it was 'kimuchi' on the menu.  we tried to get the extra pork but they were out.  the gyoza was too greasy but tasted good.  the tonkatsu ramen was delish!  the broth was white, cloudy, flavorful and less greasy than the shoyu and the noodles were thinner.  \nthe shoyu would be perfect for a  hangover.  the broth was darker, clearer, greasier, and saltier than the tonkatsu.  the ramens come with some <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, and two pieces of tender pork. \nthe one thing that will keep me from going back is the temperature.  it is too hot in there, uncomfortably hot to really enjoy your meal especially if its a bowl of hot noodle soup.", 
            "shoyu - soy sauce based, probably the most salty one out of the three, but not overwhelmingly salty which you can't bear.. like some places. \n\nmiso - straight foward miso based soup, savory, and goes well with the premium <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>.\n\nside note: there are two different types of noodles, a skinny noodle similar to the golden chinese egg noodles, and a fatter one, similar to the form of noodles from an instant noodle cup, but has absolutely no resemblance to the flavorless, soggy cup noodles.", 
            "(update: this place is always jam packed with people now. it has earn the reputation of being the best place in town for ramen).  due to all of your rave reviews i was compelled to give this place a try.  (i can just hear my dad saying, \"if everyone jumped off a cliff would you jump too?  if it were into a yummy ocean of noodle soup, hell yeah!)\n\nthis little gem is hidden a bit back from the road and does not have a huge eye catching front.  it modestly blends in with the rest of the shops.  as you enter you will be greeted by the cooks, servers, and maybe a few customers.  it is a simple small noodle shop fighting the vegas heat with a weak ac system and a multitude of fans.  was it warm?  yes sir, very much so.  but my good friend told me, that regardless of the heat we should endure and it would be worth it.\n\nwe sat at the rotating wooden stools at a lovely solid one piece of wood bar.  service was immediate and friendly.  i found the very short menu to be a relief from the pages and pages of food offerings of other establishments.  i often have trouble deciding what to eat, and then leave with regrets if i did not enjoy my meal.  neither would be the case today.  i have heard a hero of mine speak of restaurants that only make one thing, but they make it better than anyone else around.  i hoped for a similar experience.\n\ni quickly decided on the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> with tamago, chashu, mustard cabbage, and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>.  i noticed from everyone's pictures that many of us decided on the exact same combination.  great minds think alike right?  \n\na few minutes later a large hot bowl of aroma and color found its way to me.  i dug in and didn't stop till the bowl was tilting to my face and the last drops of soup were tickling my tongue.  i love the thinner noodles over udon, so i am a bit biased here.  the noodles where not over cooked for my taste and the broth had great flavor.  the chashu i got was soft and delicious.  everything just seemed to go together perfectly.\n\nif i were judging this restaurant against all noodle places in vegas, 5 stars.  but since i have had some outstanding noodles in california that i set my standards by, i'll give this 4.  don't get me wrong, this place is great, and i will be back, but i am saving the 5 star rating for a place i love in california.  i just need to eat there a few more times and make sure that it wasn't just the one time.", 
            "mmmmm, thank you yelp, this place is good, i love ramen and this place reminds me of orochon ramen in los angeles. not necessarily better but for las vegas this might be one of the best. \n\npros: the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> and tonkatsu were so good with extra <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> and chashu. my friend didn't like the chashu (pork) so much because she felt it was a weird texture thing but i loved it, put extra in mine and took hers, so my gain! tonkatsu noodles were good, and the egg was good but you had to let it sit in the hot broth for awhile, otherwise you'd realize that they tossed a cold egg in there. service was good, very friendly and nice.\n\nthe biggest cons were the size and the temperature. i got there early so i was able to secure a spot at the bar but outside of that, there were three small table for maybe four, and a group of eight sitting together and that's all there was room for. i couldn't imagine what this place is like during lunch hour or dinner. when i first arrived i didn't think the temperature was that bad since they have fans everywhere. but after eating hot ramen, having a couple asahis, and being right next to the busy kitchen, the sweat started coming (felt like i was cutting weight for a fight) but it's manageable. all in all, i will definitely be coming back here", 
            "yup, i went to monta again.... \nthis time i had 'hiyashi chuka(cold noodle)' & 'small bowl of chashu'! \ni loved it!! the ponzu sauce for the cold noodle was very citrus and just right. i'm wondering if they are making the homemade ponzu at their place instead of using the sauce from the bottle :) the hint of sesame oil was really blended into the dish and i was happy with the amount of the vegetables that they served with the noodle. \n\nthe chashu is a popular topping for the ramen, but i wanted to try with my rice this time. the <mark>Chashu Bowl</mark> comes with several piece of fried pork, chopped dried seaweed, and chopped <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> on top of rice. it was sooooo good!  i think i am sometimes very superstitions. whenever i eat rice, i gobbled every grain in my bowl . my mom taught me to finish all the rice and eventually it will bring a good luck?! i still feel like that little girl :) anyways, the dish was so tasty that i finished it all. \n\nthe server always welcoms customers with big smile :p  by the way, i happened to see the owner of sushi mon who was helping the kitchen staffs that day..,and the waitress said it's own by him.. what a great success! :-p", 
            "one word: tonkatsu! \n\ndeelish! great broth, wonderful noodles, melt in your mouth roast pork and crunchy <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>! \n\ni can't wait to go back and try the miso which i have heard it is better in flavor.", 
            "i know, i was here on tuesday. \n\nbf has been out sick the whole week and thought a good broth would do him some good. he liked the tonkatsu and thought the brother was quality. he even suggested we bring his mom and grandma here. that is always a good sign. \n\nnew thing i tried was the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>. the rice bowl just has thin slices of belly with some diced <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, long shave \"premium\" <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, and red ginger. its fatty, but not overwhelming in such little slices. it's flavored more delicately than chashu, which has a more \"porky\" cut of meat. little bit of furikake, and vinegar to my liking and it was quite nice. \n\nservice is again quite friendly. i think japanese ladies demeanor is so cute!", 
            "the 5 star bump up is courtesy of my mom and grandma in law loving this place. my mom in law doesn't like asian foods, but grandma does since she grew up in indonesia. bf and i are food adventurous- them not so much. it's sometimes a struggle sometimes finding new places to please everyone so when they're happy with something, it makes me very happy. \n\nwe like to bring them out of their comfort zone and let them explore a bit. they shared a tonkatsu ramen and a <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>. they said it was the best soup and best pork they ever had. \n\nbf tried the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>- it is similar in profile that it is still the creamy brother like the tonkatsu but the added miso paste just add some sweetness. it's good but just whatever you're more into will determine the best soup: tonkatsu- savory/saltier, miso- sweeter and cuts the saltiness down a bit. they are very similar though. \n\ni went a different route and got the hiyashi chuka which is listed on a white board (not on the menu) as \"cold noodle salad\". the cold noodles come with julienned cucumbers, tomato, kikurage mushrooms, pork slices, half a egg. it has a ponzu sauce and has a smudge of karachi mustard on the side of the bowl to add as you wish (a little adds a perfect kick to everything). i also got a small chasu bowl too which is topped with some <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> and nori. \n\nthe service is friendly and attentive. i always appreciate places that have very nice servers. i have a habit of talking about the service and i think maybe i should start actually naming good servers so that maybe businesses can pay attention to who in their staff is doing things right. miki ( pulled these off receipts) just happened to be our server each time. :-)\n\nupdate 9/13\nbrought my mom in law and grandma for lunch. they didn't hesitate to say to eat here since they love the tonkatsu ramen and the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>. i got hiyashi chuka again since i love that dish and they do it well here. i also got a <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> bowl. not for everyone, but i like spicy roe and rice.\n\nupdate 10/26\nnothing better than soup on a crappy day. <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> this time. it's good. i think tonkatsu is my favorite, but i'll order this again. sometimes i feel a bit of variety. i always get a <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> though :-) it's noms.\n\nupdate 11/07 \ntried doing half shoyu and half tonkatsu broth. you can now order it as such. keep in mind this has the skinny noodles and not the curly ones incase you prefer one or the other. i think this is my favorite broth. tonkatsu is delicious- but it's rich. shoyu is good- but it's a bit lighter than i want. marry the two together and it's a really nice inbetween flavor and consistency. this is what i'll be ordering from now on. i will try to ask if i can do a shoyu miso as well since i think that would be a good, more delicate balance. \n\nupdate 11/16\ngot a <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>, but also tried their gyoza. it's pan fried, nothing too exciting about them, just what you'd expect a gyoza to be like. i was in the mood for them, but not something i'd get often i think.", 
            "ok so before i came to this place the only other ramen i had eaten was the classic meal of cheap college students, so keep in mind i am in no way an expert on authentic ramen. that said, this place is delicious!! i've had the tonkatsu ramen both times and each time it was great, tried the egg addition once and the extra <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>. i would get the <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> again, the egg was a little much for me. either way the broth has an amazing smooth creamy like texture for a pork broth, the noodles are cooked perfectly, the service is timely and very polite, and they have some amazing iced <mark>Oolong Tea</mark>. i can't wait for it to get cooler out so i can come here even more often.", 
            "finally got around to visiting the latest addition to ramen houses in vegas - monta noodle house.  conveniently located on spring mountain, right next to the super busy raku.  (smart business choice i would say.)\n\nthis place is bare bones - as in minimal tables and a bar, so don't come with a large group.  their super simple menu gets you in and out fast!  (a couple who came in around the same time we did had ordered, gotten their food, finished, paid and left by the time we were eating ours.)\n\ni went for their most popular dish - <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> ($6.95).  the main component is the broth, which is made up of boiling pork bones, fat, and collagen for hours.  this results in a cloudy white broth and would usually have the consistency of a thin gravy.  it automatically comes with two slices of char sui, takenoko (bamboo sprouts), kikurage (type of mushroom), and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>.  their char siu (barbecued pork) definitely isn't like the chinese kind, but definitely tasty.\n\nthe husband went for the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> ($7.25), which is ultimately bean paste blended with the pork broth giving it a richer flavor.  this was also good, and quite filling.\n\nwe also shared a regular order of the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> ($5.75).  it sits on a bed of rice, with fresh scallions and pickled red ginger.  i adore pork belly and the next time i come here, i'm going to order a dish of this all to myself.  it's fatty and good.  \n\na side dish we added on was the <mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark> ($1.50).  you can have this on the side or in your broth.  it's pickled mustard greens that may or may not be to your liking.  it's adds a different texture and taste to your ramen.  other toppings you can add on included nitamago (seasoned hard boiled egg), corn, butter, kimchee, and more char siu or <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>.\n\nthere's only one other kind of ramen they offer here - shoyu, which means soy sauce based.  you can also add extra noodles for $2 more if you save your soup and ask for \"kaedama.\"  other dishes available are gyoza, <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, kim chee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, takana <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, cha siu bowl, and <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> (marinated polluck roe).\n\nservice was good.  with two waitresses, they keep the flow of business going great and refilled beverages as needed.  it's not the best place to loiter with the limited seating and all, but definitely a great place to grab a quick bite and go.\n\nupdate!  \ni returned the following month for my own bowl of the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>.  this time the pork belly was sliced thinner, which wasn't to my personal preference.  guess it depends on who is working the kitchen that day.", 
            "it amazes me how adding one vegetable (s) or without can add or miss the flavor of the delicious monta noodles offered.\n\ni finally tried miso and i thought it was amazing and actually has a better taste than tonkatsu. only i prefer the straight noodles served with tonkatsu instead of curly ramen noodles with miso.  with my miso, i had <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, corn and <mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark>! the taste was flavorful and decadent with a touch of spice! \n\nthe following week, i ordered my miso with my favorite noodle along with my extra vegetable components just like my last visit but forgot to add the mustard green. i swore up and down to the chef that they gave me tonkatsu because miso was spicy last time.  well, after a discussion with the chef we realized that the <mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark> presented the spicy flavor to the broth, which was forgotten! \n\ni am astonished how one element can change the flavors! \n\ncheers to the chef for helping me figure that out and making a fresh batch of miso with my extra kicks.\n\nmonta monta....you know you wanna monta monta!", 
            "i have been looking for a place in las vegas to grab some good ramen for a very long time, and up until now i have yet to be very satisfied. after hearing so much about monta me and a few friends decided to check the place out rather than go with our usual tuesday night plan of getting wing tuesdays at buffalo wild wings.\n\nwe get to the parking lot and this place is pretty much something that you definitely had to hear about to come find because it was buried inside a small restaurant complex which i have passed a million times but never really noticed. the venue is very small. according to the max capacity sign it could only hold about 26 people but on a tuesday night, it wasn't very busy.\n\nas i was browsing the menu, i wasn't too excited. i was hoping that they would have a larger selection of different ramen because all of the previous places i had been to had at least 7-8 different kinds. monta however had 3 main types of ramen; tonkatsu ramen, <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>, and <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>. to go along with the ramen they had various different toppings you could add including boiled egg, extra slices of pork, more noodles, <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> among other things that i don't recall.\n\ni ended up ordering the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> with a boiled egg and 4 extra slices of pork and upon taking my first bite i was instantly satisfied. this was the ramen place i had been hoping to find all along. the pork was amazing and the egg was cooked just right. the miso broth and the noodles, everything blended in together so nicely. an order for extra noodles were only $2.00 but unfortunately, i had eaten just a little bit before going here so i couldn't get more but i will definitely be coming back much more often especially now that winter is around the <mark>Corn</mark> and a nice bowl of hot <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> will do me some good.\n\noverall the meal cost me $10 which, considering all of the toppings i added, is very, very decently priced. i recommend this place to anyone who like me has been looking for really good japanese ramen.", 
            "its official; i made my quest here today and i'm already craving round 2. it's gooooood!\n\nfor those not in the know, i've been a ramen-iac since i was 12 and first learned how to cook myself a cup o' noodles. i spent several summers as a gawky teenager watching cartoons and gobbling noodles like a fiend. over the years, and through thousands of packets of freeze-dried noodles i slurped onward. kimchi flavor, maruchan, nissan, yam-noodles, dandan mien and instant jjangmyun, my adoration for the comfort of a big steaming bowl of chewy noodles drenched in broth steadily growing. i've tried ichiza's, shuseki's and making it myself- this tops the list. ichiza's was close, but this place will most likely be my number one noodle-spot this winter. \n\ncoming up to the restaurant, i wouldn't have thought it was open if it weren't for the neon sign saying so. there's plenty of parking and it's right across the street from the shopping center with shuseki. \n\ni sat at the bar as i was having lunch alone and wanted to see the action. one chef would feel out the proper amount of fresh noodles per bowl, roughly a fistful, and drop them into the boiling cauldron of water. on the other side was a large kettle of broth steaming away, ready at a moment's notice. in the background several men worked on various other tasks involving the pork and other side dishes. at the front of the bar was the vegas weekly magazine that mentioned them, as well as a good-luck kitty, which i thought was cute.\n\ntoday, i opted for the miso. at first i couldn't decide- i'd tried the miso flavors at other establishments, so should i continue the trend for consistency of comparison, or deviate and expand my horizons further. i opted for the miso with nitamago, or egg. it didn't take long before my noodles were politely presented to me.\n\nthe broth: super porky. no msg taste at all. rich miso flavor-seemed like it was all white [sweet] miso. great depth of flavor, with an intense, <mark>Butter</mark> mouth feel. hit all the right notes and was intensely satisfying. tastes like homemade.\n\nnoodles: al dente egg noodles. chewy and lots of them! much better than anything instant with great slurpability. \n\nthe egg: beautifully cooked, creamy and custardy, it added an entirely new level of complexity to the broth and had an exceptional texture. ichiza's eggs are close, but the one i had here was supple and gelatinous, cooked slowly and well. it was easily the best egg i've had in a restaurant this year. \n\npork: my bowl came with 2 slices of succulent, fall-apart tender pork. i could pull bite-size pieces off using my chopsticks. thousands of times better than the terrifying piece of pork we were served at shuseki. the pieces were thin, but i was satisfied with the amount i was given. you can always order more if you're willing to pay the additional charge. \n \nextras: the ramen comes with bamboo shoots, a few pieces of mushroom and a mountain of <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>. you can also add minced garlic paste, benishoga [red pickled ginger], sesame oil, furikake mix, sesame seeds, what looked like vinegar & a couple of other options are available either through the menu or asking your server.\n\ni found the portion large enough for a late brunch, tiding me over for hours and powering me through a trip to the dog park with 3 rowdy puppies. i'm extremely satisfied and happy with the meal i had here, and i bragged to several of my friends. i'm looking forward to trying the shoyu flavor next, as well as trying the spicy greens with it. \n\ni'll be back very soon!", 
            "did you ever think there would be such a restaurant here in an \"all-nighter city\" that cooks and serves ramen noodles? yes, there is tucked in-between small shops along spring mountain road or otherwise known as \"chinatown\" in vegas.\n\nas you may or may not know it', \"ramen\" noodles is one of japanese noodles invented in 1958 by japan's nissin foods. these are thin, ribbon-like, lightweight, calorie-rich, tasty, and cheap that can be bought in packs of 1 or 10 (you can find them in your asian or oriental grocery near you or in any of your college friend's pantry). it's one of those quick cook-it-up soups.\n\nit's rather an eccentric choice of mine to dine in this place with my mom last night around 6 p.m. on a very rainy night in vegas. soup is the answer to the cold, wet rain! ramen is kind-of over-the-top in this restaurant!\n\nwith a sweet, smiling greeting from the waitress, \"moshi, moshi!\" in japanese, which translates to \"hello\" or rather \"welcome!\" (i have learned a few japanese greetings in high school and  having been to tokyo before, the greeting didn't sound \"foreign\"). it brought a smile to my lips, i knew i would have a good dining experience. \n\nthe restaurant is small and cozy but cheerful with minimalist japanese style decor including the bathroom's interior design was contemporary japanese. there are table seatings and bar-like seating available. menu is simple. three choices of ramen noodle soups in \"<mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>\" (pork bone), \"<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>\" (soy paste), and \"<mark>Miso Ramen</mark>\" (bean paste). nothing else to confuse any soup-hungry soup-lover. a list of toppings for the noodles soup for an extra charge, 8 \"other dishes\", 4 kinds of cold beverages, 2 kinds of beer choices, but no dessert and no hot beverages on the menu.\n\ni ordered the house specialty soup which is the \"tonkatsu ramen\" soup. it's very hearty soup in a thick, cloudy milk-like tasty broth. topped with <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, 3 slices of pork, bamboo shoots, and with kikurage (dried black mushrooms), i drizzled it with sesame seeds and hot spice powder. oh, wow, there was no need for chewing the roast pork that melted in my mouth. surely, the pork melts! another dish i ordered was the \"mimi mentaiko\" which consists of fish cod roe (or fish eggs which are red-orange in color is otherwise, caviar) with strips of nori seaweed and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> topped on a bowl of steamed japanese rice. very appetizing, a sure favorite! the \"<mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>\" is also one dish you ought to try; delicious. as usual <mark>Green Tea</mark> on ice was my beverage pairing for these meals.\n\nfunny thing...the cheerful smiling waitress who served us went to show her colleagues in the kitchen my soup bowl which made her shyly squeal in delight to show them all it was empty!! i caught a glimpse of the cook's smile.\n\nyes, i left nothing in the bowl, not even a drop of soup!\nit must have been that i really love soup, or it was cold and wet outside or just that i needed to fill my belly...how can you go wrong in making such a choice to eat for the night. for a price that's easy on your pocket, aahemm! wallet...an excellent deal! \"arigato gozaimas!\" (english translation is \"thank you!\"), as we left the restaurant in good spirit!", 
            "being a pretty lucky teen, i've had the chance to travel, and try many ramen shops around las vegas area, california, as well as japan and hong kong. though it is not up to what i have tried in japan, it is pretty close. \n\nthis is a small ramen shop at the back of a shopping centre. max occupancy is probably give or take 25-30 people max with option to sit at the bar or table. staff gives a very friendly welcome upon entry. a lot of times, this restaurant is quite busy. the restaurant has a nice warm feeling (not due to the heat from cooking) but it resembles some ramen shops i have tried and seen in tokyo, japan. \n\nupon sight of the menu, the front cover has a little story of origins of ramen. when you see the selection of foods they provide, it is not much. this is one of the few places, that i really like, that don't offer a wide variety of foods. not only do they specialize in what they offer, it is also the only thing they need because of how well made it is. \n\nthey have three broth selections. tonkotsu, which is a pork bone based broth (usually slowly boiled and simmered for many hours to create a white flavor-filled broth), miso, and shoyu (soy-sauce based). being a fan of <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>, that was the first broth i had tried and loved. price range for the different soup is i believe 6.95 - 7.95 with shoyu and tonkotsu being $6.95 and miso at 7.95 [don't quote me on the pricing but i do remember the miso being more expensive than tonkotsu for some reason... you'd think the one with more work (tonkotsu) would be more expensive]\n\nthey offer a variety of toppings ($1 - $2.50 each) you can choose to add to the ramen as well, ranging from extra pork, <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, corn, butter, some green vegetable (forgot the name). hearing great things about their pork, that was what i had ordered as an additional topping. there is also the option of getting extra noodles for a small fee of $2. \n\ntake note, there are two types of noodles they use between the 3 broths. i believe tonkotsu uses one, while miso and shoyu uses another. they also offer sides like gyoza, pork over rice, etc. \n\nupon arrival of food, i was amazed how well the ramen looked. the soup had a deep white color, pipping hot freshly made. the soup was not thin but not thick as well. not sure how to explain, but it was a broth that looked to be filled of flavor. as most people, the first thing to try was the soup. upon tasting of the soup, i was amazed. the flavor of the soup was rich, extremely flavorful, not too salty or sweet. it was like, perfection was reached. the noodles were a little over al dente which was perfect for ramen. the table has spices that you can add on top of your ramen like chili oil and this spicy spice mix. \n\nthe pork they used was a 1/2 fatty 1/2 meat type of cut formed in a circular shape. being of asian origin, it was exactly how i liked it. as said before, the option of extra noodles was available so some of the pork was saved. they amount of noodles you get is quite an amount (usually wont expect too much for \"additional noodles\" but if anything, it may have been a slightly larger serving then that was in the original bowl. the additional noodles is given in a bowl, heated and ready to be thrown into your original soup. \n\nlets just say, every single time, i order a bowl of ramen, additional noodles.. and never have soup left over =] \n\nservice is great. food is great. price is reasonable. recommend to many friends and family. one of the best ramen places i've ever been to", 
            "when we woke up today it was and my wife had a cold. so we figured it would be a good day for soup and headed off to monta for some ramen.\n\nwe both ordered <mark>Green Tea</mark> hoping for a soothing, warm start to the meal. the waiter brought out two cans of cold <mark>Green Tea</mark>. we explained we were expecting hot tea and were told they don't have any hot tea. so we asked for water with lemon but were told they don't have lemon. i ended up ordering a <mark>Diet Coke</mark> and my wife stuck with plain water\n\nthings went smoother from there.\n\ni ordered the tonkatsu ramen with egg, nori, and mustard greens. it was good, salty.\n\nmy wife ordered the tonkatsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with egg and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>. it was also good and less salty than mine.\n\ni highly recommend getting the eggs. it was a great addition to both. beyond that, choose what you like.\n\noverall, i preferred my wife's ramen and she preferred mine. we switched midway through though i was only halfway done and she'd finished two-thirds of hers. i got ripped off.\n\nwe also ordered kimchee and gyoza. the kimchee was good but nothing special. the gyoza never arrived. however, the kimchee and ramen were plenty, so we didn't make a big deal of it. (i did check the receipt and verified we weren't charged for the gyoza.)\n\ngreat place for a rainy day, some of the best ramen i've ever had.", 
            "best ramen in vegas?  only true ramen house in vegas?  yes and yes... monta's simple.  hot.  tasty.  highly recommend to anyone in vegas or visiting vegas and wants to try something off the strip.  \n\nthe mister and eldest son had the miso and i had the tonkatsu shoyu (less salty than the miso).  i had mine plain while extra chashu was added to one of the miso's.  all of them were so good. the younger son had a small pork belly rice bowl but we had to spoon away all the vegetables that decorated it (<mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, pickled ginger shreds...).  he liked it.\n\ni only gave 4 stars because i'm not much of a ramen eater because of all the msg.  and unfortunately, i did end up with a migraine :(.  it's a super small joint and soda's are served in a can... i don't think they have hot drinks... yet.", 
            "finally! a very good ramen joint in vegas. this place is much more the real japanese ramen joint than the (now defunct) togoshi ramen.\n\nmonta is in a small strip mall on sprint mountain rd, just west of decatur. it is very easy to miss as you go by. and the shop is very small, with only four 4 place table, 1 2 place table, and about 10 counter seats. they only accept cash so beware.\n\ni recently learned of this place right here on yelp and had to give it a try. like others on this forum, i grew up eating fantastic ramen all over japan. and have long been searching... i was elated when santouka came to the states and even more ecstatic when local joints like orenchi (cupertino, ca) that are very much like the ramen i used to know in japan... started to pop up.\n\ni'd like to preface this review with the fact that i like tonkotsu, thick chijirimen (wavy noodles) usually, so i am usually biased towards that. monta has 4 basic types of ramen flavors: tonkotsu, shoyu, miso, and new (at least it said new today) tonkotsu shoyu which is a combination of the tonkotsu and shoyu broths.\n\ntonkotsu, of course, is pork based broth. the shoyu uses chicken broth (according to monta), but i also detected some dashi (fish based) in there as well. tonkotsu, and tonkotsu shoyu uses thin straight noodles. shoyu and miso uses the thick wavy noodles. each ramen @  $6.95 comes with 2 slices of char shu, kikurage (woodear mushrooms), memma (seasoned bamboo shoots), and chopped <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>. there are other toppings available as mentioned in other reviews, along with kaedama (literally means \"replacement ball\") extra noodles.\n\nkaedama is usually ordered as you go, not in the beginning. this is because if get it at the same time as your ramen, then the noodles either go cold, or get overcooked. this is one of the reasons why i do not like places that have a \"large\" size. by the time you're half way through, the noodles are too overcooked. i commend monta for doing the kaedama the right way.\n\nanyway, i was @ monta today, thu, at 2 pm, and the place had a waiting list 8 deep! it took us abobut 20 minutes to get seated, and as we got seated, the wait line even got longer. ok... my expectations are way high... but be cautious... this, after all, is the only ramen only joint in vegas....\n\ni ordered the tonkotsu shoyu with nitamago and extra char shu. my wife had the shoyu with nitamago. we also had gyoza. in the kitchen, there are basically 2 guys preparing the dishes. one guy that does the ramen, another that does the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and others. and with the packed house, the service was slow.\n\nbut when the ramen finally came, i was not disappointed. despite my doubts, the tonkotsu shoyu had a wonderful balance and marriage of pork and chicken broth. my wife's shoyu, i believe due to the chicken stock, had a very mellow aspect to it which also gave the tonkotsu a very mellow and non-overpowering flavor. i finished the broth to the last drop, including my wife's shoyu/chicken broth.\n\nthe noodles... my thin noodles were not overcooked, and about just right when my ramen came out. but because of its thinness, by the time i got half way through my ramen (and i'm a relatively quick ramen eater, beating my wife by a good 10 minutes :-)) was way overcooked and mushy soft. next time, i will see if they will cook it less (katame, or as i do at kyushu jyangara in tokyo, bari-kata... crispy as in ironed with starch). my wife's chijirimen was very good with good amount of al dente,a and the chewiness one expects in good ramen.  if i can't get them to cook the thin noodles to super al dente, then my backup plan is to have them use the thick noodles in the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>.\n\nthe boiled egg is soft boiled, but the yolk does not run. i like my soft boiled egg a with a bit more runny yolk. but nevertheless it was still good. the char shu was one the the better ones i had in the states. very tender, melts in your mouth, with good flavor... not too over powering, not too bland. the slices were on the thin side, but i got a total of 8 slices by ordering the extra char shu topping ($2.50). \n\nin summary both the tonkotsu shoyu and <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> were done very well, with a good balance of broth, noodles, and toppings in a dish that came together very very well. too many times, i have been to ramen places in the states where the broth may be good, but noodles lack, or vice versa, or even where all the individual ingredients are good, but the finished product just doesn't cut it.\n\nthe gyoza, unlike one reviewer here, i though were also very good. i would beg to differ that this is not like store bought gyoza as it is stuffed with pork whereas the store bought ones are more heavy on the nappa cabbage and not stuffed. the flavor is also very good, however, i like my gyoza wet...that is with a bit more juice as you bite into them.\n\nin the end though, i give monta 5 stars even with the few deficiencies. monta, in my book, share the top honors with orenchi in cupertino,", 
            "we went to monta noodle house for japanese ramen.  it's in vegas chinatown area, behind the jack in the box, in the seoul plaza.\n\nthey have good hours something like 11:30a-10p everyday.  \n\ni got:\n\n<mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> $6.95 - it's a small bowl, 2 pcs fatty pork, small amount of noodles, some <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, & the broth, no egg that's extra, no seaweed - that's extra.  still liked it.\n\nb. got <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> $7.25 w/ extra bamboo shoots .50 + nori .75\n\nour total 15.45 + $1.25 tax = $16.70 before tip.  charged it.\n\nquick & fast dinner before our flight home.", 
            "i've been coming to this place since they've opened.  i would give them 5 stars if i had reviewed them earlier, but as of late their broth has been overly salty.  however, i keep coming back for more since this is pretty much the only legitimate ramen shop that i know of in the las vegas valley area.\n\ni usually order the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> with nitamago, <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, and corn (sometimes i go wild and order butter too).  the broth is on the fattier side, and is rich and nutty.  overall, this is a good bowl of ramen.\n\nservice is friendly and quick and their streamlined menu captures all the quintessential components of your basic ramen shop.", 
            "my experience with ramen is limited. there was a place near the beverly center in los angeles where i had some and liked it enough to return. the ramen at monta is a whole other level of good. it's not only the best ramen i've ever had, it's the best japanese food. my experience with japanese food is that presentation is more important than flavor. that wasn't the case here. \nwe started with gyoza. these dumplings were tasty although maybe a tad too salty for me. then our ramen soon arrived. i got the kontatsu with pork belly, <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, egg and corn. the broth was tasty. a couple of different flavors going on. quite savory. the noodles were perfect. not overcooked and delicious. and all the toppings were good, too. \njanet got miso soup and was quite happy with her choice. she noted it was thicker than my soup.\nit seems like a winner.\nwhen we got there at 7 p.m. there were a couple of open tables and most of the bar was empty. by the time we left just after 8 p.m., every seat was taken, we had to push through a half dozen people standing at the door waiting to eat and another couple of cars pulled up with people going there to eat. it seems quite popular. most of the people inside appeared to be of japanese descent.", 
            "monta is definitely one of the better ramen shops in las vegas. its in the same strip mall as raku on decatur/ spring mtn. \n\nmonta reminds us of japan's ramen shops...its all about order your food, eat your food, and get out, so the next group can eat. it's not a posh restaurant, minimal tables/ seats. the restaurant holds at most 30 people (5 tables of 4 seats and about 10 seats on the counter), so if you go with a large party, just sit wherever you can and when you can or you might be waiting for awhile.\n\nthe menu is simple. miso, tonkatsu, or <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>. my favorite is...all of them. huge stock pots in the back have been boiling bones and veg for hours to create the backbone of their heavenly broth.  i seem to be on a tonkatsu ramen kick lately with its hearty broth... you could add some thickener to the broth and you would have a damn good gravy. they give you a good amount of ramen, a few slices of tender charsiu, bamboo, takenoko, <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, half boiled egg, and kikurage. its a solid meal for a cheap price, $7-8 and you can add other extras for a small price.\n\nanother favorite is their <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>. its cheap and filling...not to mention very tasty. you get the thinly sliced pork served over rice in a small bowl garnished with beni shoga. its tasty, fatty, and better when you get eat a little beni shoga (red pickled ginger) with it.. we always get a small bowl and share it.\n\ntheir gyoza is good as is the kim chee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. we need to try more of the items on their menu but we are creatures of habit and sometimes its hard to stray away from the  dishes that monta is known for.\n\nits easy to over order food at monta. because the ramen bowls are big...resist ordering other dishes unless you have a big party and you want to share. \n\nmonta is great on a hot day and better on a cold day!! \n\narooha!!!!!",

            "this is what i call good ramen. this place is quaint and cute nestled away in a little shopping center off of spring mountain. it is small so there may be a wait around peak times. that's probably the only downside. but it's definitely worth it.\n\nthey had four ramen to choose from: tonkatsu (pork bone), shoyu, miso, or tonkatsu-shoyu. all of which come with the basics: chashu (pork slices), bamboo shoots, <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, and kikurage mushrooms. you have the option to add \"extras\" to personalize your ramen.\n\ni had the tonkatsu-<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with a boiled egg (as an extra). in retrospect, i should have ordered extra chashu -- which i recommend you do if you like pork. the meat was so tender and melt-in-your-mouth that the two slices the bowl comes with wasn't nearly enough! the broth was very tasty and not too salty like how some ramen can be.\n\nthey have other side dishes (gyoza, <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, etc) but i have a feeling those aren't the reason people come here. they're simply there as fillers. stick to the star of the place: ramen of course!\n\nthis is definitely the place i will come to to satisfy my ramen cravings that i get once in a while. i have a feeling as soon as winter hits, i will definitely be frequenting this place for the warm deliciousness that is monta ramen :)",

            "**3.5 stars**\n\nlocated conveniently next to raku on the outskirts of las vegas chinatown, monta is the latest darling in the vegas foodie scene and follows the popular ramen trend that has already hit la, nyc, and the bay area.  \n\nauthentically japanese owned and frequented by many japanese during our visit, monta offers shoyu, tonkotsu, and miso broths.  tonkotsu appears to be their most popular offering and bowls start at a reasonable $6.95.  each bowl comes with two pieces of chashu, <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, and some bamboo shoots.  \n\noverall, the bowls are on the small side and toppings a bit sparse than other top places i've frequented.  corn, butter, kim chee, and a hard boiled, not soft boiled, egg can be added.  \n\nbroth flavor was good though a tad salty and one noted compared to the more complex broths i love at santouka.   the noodles are fresh but thin reminding me of the fresh made noodles at maru ichi in the bay area. i personally like thicker noodles like orenchi in sunnyvale.\n\nservice, due to the small space and crowds, can feel a bit rushed and they initially forgot our drink orders.  no biggie and quickly fixed.  \n\nmonta is a nice addition to the ramen scene but with minimally topped bowls and solid broths, ramen aficionados will likely have tried more polished ramen parlors in socal and norcal.  \n\nmonta doesn't accept credit cards and is cash only.",

            "you can tell food is good when people are willing to stand in line (which is often out the door) to wait through our blistering summers and biting winters.  luckily, service and cook time are quick, so i have never had to wait more than fifteen minutes or so for a table or spot even when it's crowded.  \n\nmonta is a small, hole in the wall ramen place.  there are three kinds of seating: booth, table and bar stools.  if you're eating solo or you have a small party, you'll probably get seated more quickly because the individual bar stools will open up.  additionally, so they can keep the flow going and keep wait times down, you'll have to sign in on a sheet, and they won't seat you until your entire party is present.  from the bar, you can see the crew in the kitchen cooking the meals.\n\non to the food.  i normally order the tonkot-shoyu (mixed broth of the tonkotsu and shoyu) with corn and nori (dried seaweed), and add in some chili oil and spices from the table set.  the soup itself comes with <mark>Chashu Pork</mark>, bamboo shoots, kikarage (black mushrooms) and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>.  i've tried ramen at two other locations (one in the galleria mall in henderson, and the other was anime ramen) and this is definitely my favorite spot to go.  the noodles have just the right amount of chewiness, the broth is flavorful but not overpowering, and the chashu is tender, melt in your mouth goodness.  \n\ni have also tried the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> and gyoza, and both are pretty good.  i wish they had a different sauce for the gyoza, but soy sauce mixed with vinegar and a little chili oil works just fine.  i've only discovered this place in the last year, but i can honestly say it's become one of my go-to restaurants and it's definitely a comfort food.  prices are more expensive than your fifty cent package of top ramen, but it's still cheap for a restaurant at under ten dollars an entree.  \n\nmy only bone to pick is that their <mark>Green Tea</mark> is only chilled and it comes in a can, though as far as canned <mark>Green Tea</mark> goes, it's not bad.",

            "i didn't realize how hard it would be to find a really good ramen restaurant after moving out of hawaii.  however, monta comes close to filling the void.  monta is a small japanese noodle house in a strip mall in china town.  if you don't like waiting to sit down, get there early as the line usually begins to form before the restaurant opens at 11:30am.  there are a few scattered tables, but i prefer to sit at the bar and watch the cooks prepare the dishes in the open kitchen.\n\nmonta makes tonkotsu ($6.95), shoyu ($6.95) and miso ($7.25) ramen broths.  while all three of the broths are very good, the milky white colored tonkotsu (stewed pork bone broth) has an especially savory meaty flavor.  my favorite is the combination tonkotsu-<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> ($6.95) which tempers the intense meaty taste of the tonkotsu with the salty shoyu broth.  the thin yellow ramen noodles have always been consistently cooked to the just right texture, neither too limp nor too firm and underdone.  the ramen comes with basic toppings (<mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, bamboo shoots, kikurage mushrooms and two thin slices of marinated <mark>Chashu Pork</mark>) however, like all good ramen joints, they have a whole list of additional toppings you can add (for a little extra cash) to make the dish your own.  the combination of flavors and textures soaking in the hot broth goes down well on a cold day.\n\nwe also usually order the pan fried pork gyozas ($5.15 for 6) and a small kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> ($6.95).  the gyozas are excellent and the moist rice has a good flavor.  each table has an array of sauces and condiments that you can add to your meal (rice vinegar, soy sauce, chili oil, sesame seeds, and chili pepper) as well as little jars of crushed garlic and red pickled ginger.  they also serve beer to wash it all down with.\n\nthe service is fast and the food comes out quickly.  so even if you do get stuck waiting in line, it usually moves fast.  and if you are in the mood for good ramen, it is worth the wait.",

            "every bowl of ramen comes with two slices of pork chashu, <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, kikurage (black mushroom), and bamboo shoots. there are four different types of broths:\n\n1. shoyu- soy sauce-based broth, pretty salty and nothing spectacular, average\n\n2. miso- miso-based broth, salty but not overwhelmingly so, pretty run-of-the-mill <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>\n\n3. tonkotsu- pork flavored broth, savory, and has a creamy texture. the soup's thick consistency is due to boiling pork bones, collagen, and fat for a long period of time. some people find the thickness of the savory broth distasteful and unsettling. if you're not a fan of a thick soup, i would skip this one. definitely one of my favorite broths to get here.\n\n4. tonkotsu-shoyu- best of both worlds, the tonkotsu and shoyu work well to balance each other out. the shoyu waters down the tonkotsu so it's not as thick and the tonkotsu adds a bold, fuller flavor to the shoyu. this is definitely monta's signature ramen and a must try.\n\nadditional toppings: some of the toppings are noticeably more expensive compared to other local ramen joints that already include these toppings in their ramen.\n\nadditional notes: \n*if you order extra noodles (kaedama), it comes in a separate bowl usually in the middle of the meal. it's been heated up so your noodles are still delicious even if your broth is not as hot as in the beginning. \n* there are two types of noodles to choose from: thick cup ramen style noodles (that definitely taste nothing like those horrible cup noodles) or a thinner noodle similar to chinese egg noodles (not the noodle that usually comes with wonton noodle soup). i definitely prefer the thicker noodles; the thinner ones tend to be overcooked easily and soggy. \n*there is a $10 minimum on credit cards. bring cash if you don't plan to spend more than that.\n*they will not sit you at a table unless your whole party is present.\n\noverall:\n\nso far, monta has the best ramen in vegas. (still need to try anime ramen, and fukumimi though.) it's just the thing that hits the spot on a cold chilly night when you need some warming up. \n\nservice varies depending on how busy they are. bar seating may get uncomfortable for some but that's how traditional ramen houses are: small and cramped. seating is very limited so anticipate a wait if you're coming during peak hours. \n\nthe consistency of the ramen sometimes varies as well. sometimes the chashu is over done, resulting in a dry piece of meat that doesn't have that heavenly gelatinous soft layer of fat that melts in your mouth. also, the noodles sometimes come out too soft if they've been sitting there for a while. once in a while, the yolk of the hard boiled egg will be completely solid, with none of that ooey gooey goodness. these hiccups happen rarely, only when they're extremely busy and it's during peak hours. portions are decent sized for a regular person. if you're a gluttonous fatty like me, it's better to share <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> (which is quite delicious) with a buddy.\n\noverall, despite the ridiculous wait sometimes and food consistency issues, monta is definitely a must try for locals and tourists.",

            "a friend from los angeles recommended this ramen joint to me.  \"not the same but good enough\" were his exact words comparing it to daikokuya.  monta ramen is literally in the midst of other small asian food joints in a mini-strip mall in las vegas' chinatown on spring mountain road.  i honestly would have not known this place existed if my friend didn't tell me  about it.  parking was, for one, a bit limited.  \n\ni walked in to a small, maybe 6 (or 7?)  tables and the counter bar, stuffy and unventilated ramen joint.  it had the same feel of daikokuya:  cramped and rushed.  there were people standing, waiting and blocking the door.  i was offered to sit on the bar but there was no elbow room so i stood up and told the lady i would wait for a table instead.  the wait staff are japanese, but noticed 2 latinos working behind the bar/kitchen with an asian guy.  red flag i thought but then again i saw the framed accolades from different local papers and publications ho<mark>Nori</mark> and awarding monta as the best or one of the best in las vegas.   \n\ni sat down in one of the small tables and ordered their tonkatsu ramen ($6.95).   the bowls are smaller, i noticed, and they're somewhat stingy with everything, including the broth and the toppings.  i had a couple small slices of chasu, bamboo shoots, mushrooms, and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>.  mine didn't come with marinated boiled egg.  i come to find out that you can order the toppings for extra charge.  really? for an egg? \n\nthe broth was a bit salty to my liking, heavy and tasted like it was enriched with milk or cream, or maybe miso.  the wavy thinner noodles were somewhat seasoned too, but not overwhelmingly salty.  their chasu, however, is to die for!  it's perfectly seasoned, cooked, caramelized and charred to my personal standards!  for that alone, i will come back and try their chasu rice bowl.  for their ramen soups?  i might try a different one the next time around, and maybe request thicker noodles.\n\nsidenote:  monta ramen was shut down by the southern nevada health department in mid march 2013 for 47 demerits, but have since re-inspected and reopened.",

            "as soon as you walk in - sign in! haha there's always a wait for this place.  (but if you're in a hurry to get back to work or wherever there are multiple of good restaurants you can go to in that same complex). so with that statement, it's the type of place you order--- eat--- and leave... you don't want to be the jerk holding up the wait :p \n\none thing that really caught my attention was how the chefs were dipping the bowl into hot boiling water before making your order to keep your food hot even longer.  i like to enjoy every bite of my food so by the end of my last bite my soup was still warm :p ( but i'll have to admit the last time i went they didn't dip my bowl ) \n\ni've tried all three <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> on different occasions and all were good :) i think the kimchi is my favorite.  as for the  gyoza, it's pretty delicious and crispy.  \n\ni've tried all soups and i'll have to say i'll stick to the pork broth with thin noodles and of course adding some <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> and egg to that - call it my usual order :)", 
            "i'm not a big fan of monta, maybe it's because i get sick every time i come here and eat something with the charsui (which i figured out after i was about to give up). everyone else claims it's the best ramen in las vegas, maybe, but i haven't been to enough places around to say for certain just yet. so far it's a no for me, because of the way i get sick.\n\n\ngrowing up in japan with a chinese family, i know what good ramen tastes like and they're decent but when they're busy the noodles are hard (not cooked long enough) which i hate, they have to be consistant! and on top of that i can't eat the charsui without getting sick which then it's game over for me for the day, so it usually ends with me giving it away to someone. \n\nso like i said, when it's busy they're not that consistant because they're trying to keep up with the demand and not be slow, but it shows in their cooking. i always get gyoza with my ramen and would feel weird if i didn't! something i've done since i was a little child, besides the pair together taste great! \n\nthe soup base itself is light as it should be, though sometimes i feel it's a bit salty (maybe my asian taste buds were a little too active then, but it's good. also depends on the one you want, i'm pretty traditional and don't stray from the shoyu (soy sauce base). the noodles is a hit and miss, since they're usually busy and rarely not, though i like going when most people aren't eating, the noodle can be either perfect or too hard for me. people like their noodles differently and not many places give you an option (very few in japan do), but like i said hit and miss usually it's okay. \n\noutside of their regular toppings you can add extra stuff like corn, butter, <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, etc for some extra costs which isn't much at all! they also have kaedame which is a second helping of noodles, but you need to leave some soup base and not drink it if you're going to do that.\n\noverall the price for what you get is decent and not too bad especially comparing it to places in japan. my only complaint is that the charsui gets me sick every time i've eaten it and since i've stopped it's been okay.", 
            "i would have to say that monta is the best ramen joint in vegas that i've been to. $7-$8 for a bowl (that's pretty big in my opinion) and it's worth every penny. you can add extra toppings and or even order extra noodles if you're still hungry. they also have a variety of side dishes that you can order with your meal. \n\nwhen i go to monta, i usually order a tonkatsu ramen. i like to get thick-wavy noodles instead of thin noodles as well. ramen usually comes with two pieces of pork chashu, bamboo shoots, black mushrooms, and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>.their broth is flavorful and thick in a way. i swear it's pretty freaking good. the bowl usually comes pretty fast even if the place may be packed so that's a plus as well. \n\ni also enjoy their <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>. their rice to meat portion seems just right to me! and of course, it tastes great!\n\nif you want to eat at monta during the night, you have a really high chance of having to wait to be seated. monta is pretty small and they can only seat so little at a time. if you're patient this place is worth the wait! another thing, if you have a big party you should make sure that everyone is present. if not they'll let another party go instead and wait til your party is all there.",

(dry seaweed and hard boiled egg, respectively) some corn, etc. my gal got the tonkotsu black. and whoa. i've never had a ramen to that degree ever in my 30 years of life. what is this? a smoky flavored broth? almost like a bbq tang? this was my highlight. it was unusual. it was weird. but in the most gnarliest of ways a ramen can be. i highly recommend that one. \n\nfyi: their chasu bowl is one of the better ones i have experienced in all of ca. definitely worth it as a side dish. \n\nas a matter of fact. i am visiting monta again for mdw (memorial day weekend) i am coming back. it wouldn't be a successful vegas trip without a visit to monta. seriously best ramen in town.",

            "environment\noff the strip in chinatown. this place is quaint with only about five tables and a bar, which means there's a slight wait. \n\nramen\ntonkotsu shoyu - comes with noodles and basic toppings such as pork chad by, black mushrooms, bamboo shoots and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>. make it spicy.\n\nnot the best ramen i've had. i almost want to say it's bland and this place needs to offer more toppings.", 
            "our usual ramen sora was closed, so we decided to give their rival down the street a try.  we were there 5 minutes before opening, joined the throng of people waiting to get in, and happily we were able to get seats at the bar immediately.  i couldn't believe it when friends said that this place makes ramen sora look huge, but boy were they right!!  i think monta ramen seats maybe 35 people total and has a tiny waiting area.\n\ni was very happy with the service!  waitstaff was friendly, efficient, and checked on us regularly, even with a completely full house.  i loved being able to sit at the bar and watch the food being prepared.  this is one area they have a leg up on ramen sora.\n\ni ordered <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> with corn, butter, and soft cooked egg and hubs had <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> with <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>.  at first, i thought my broth was completely lacking in flavor and was so disappointed.  turns out that all the flavor had settled into the bottom of the bowl.  a good stirring fixed the problem.  wish i had realized that earlier!  lol!  hubs and i both felt that the pork was extremely fatty and the texture was just not good.  \n\ni suppose that if i had never had ramen sora, this might have been fine.  but i have had it and i will be going back to our usual from now on.  at least i can say that i've now made an informed decision between the two rivals.  :)", 
            "this was my first meal in vegas and it was really good! finding parking here was kinda annoying since the parking lot for this shopping center was small. we were actually surprised that we were able to be seated right away as a party of 5. when we left there was a line going outside the door, so i'd either come early or expect a wait because this place is super tiny inside (there's a few tables and then bar style seating). \n\nlooking over the menu, i was shocked at how cheap the ramen was. but then i realized that the ramen is very basic -- broth, 2 slices of pork, <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, ramen and bamboo shoots. if you want extras like egg, extra pork, corn, kimchi, etc. you'll have to pay extra. but even after adding toppings my food still came out to be like $10. \n\nwe started off sharing a <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> as a table. it was pretty good! as for my meal, i ordered the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> and asked for spicy paste on the side. i also opted to add the egg and corn.  after adding the spicy paste in my <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> it tasted great and was full of flavor! the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> also had the thick wavy noodles that i love. \n\nservice was quick and efficient. i kind of got the vibe that they wanted us to leave quickly after paying the bill, but i can't really blame them with a line out of the door! if you're looking for an inexpensive meal that will fill you up then you should check out monta ramen!", 
            "one of my favorite restaurants in las vegas, hands down, and i'm not alone. every time i go to this place there is a line out the door because of all the people waiting to experience this culinary delight. \n\nthe noodles and toppings are all delicious, but there's something about the broth that makes this ramen to die for. also, the pork. it's flavorful and fatty, and i would recommend getting extra if you feel like spoiling yourself. \n\nbe careful though, this stuff is about as addicting as crack. after your first time, you'll keep going back until you realize it's gotten out of hand, and that you need to stop for the sake of your bank account and health. i put on about five pounds after first discovering this place, and i've gotten many friends addicted as well. \n\nmy personal favorites include the spicy tonkatsu with egg and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, and kuro with butter and extra pork.", 
            "my friend and i had a rough morning at the dayclubs on a saturday, we were starving and figured we grab some ramen before heading back to our hotel. i love their simple menu, just exactly what we needed that afternoon. i went with the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> and added <mark>Chashu Pork</mark>, <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, and nitamago (soft boiled egg). the broth was delicious, savory and well seasoned, toppings all hit the spot as well. the service was great and since we came at an off hour there was no wait at all. this was the perfect afternoon pick-me-up and a great spot for some quality ramen in vegas.", 
            "don't let the lines sway you this place is worth the wait!  the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> was an eye opening gastronomic experience. after years of ordering various phos and miso soups this broth blew every other out of the park. it's ruined us forever. with a creamy consistency that rivals milk or melted butter this stock made from pork bones, fat, and collagen is heaven in a bowl. add to that some amazing thin noodles (you can order thicker noodles if you desire) and throw in the basic toppings of <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, two slices of chashu, bamboo shoots and kikurage mushrooms. omg it was to die for!  there are many additional toppings you can order to customize and make it perfect for your tastes. \n\nwe also ordered the gyoza and the regular <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. after reading all the reviews we had to give them a try. the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was good, but not fabulous. perhaps there's a difference if you order the takana <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>?  the gyoza were great. thin pillows stuffed with vegatables and pork. hot and delish!  \n\nlucky for us, we're in town for a couple of weeks so we'll definitely be back!", 
            "my family and i have been coming here for the last five years off and on. sometimes once a month and there have been gaps as big as 9 months. we always have a pleasant experience and always have quality food. while there have been some slight inconsistencies over the years, we have almost always been happy with the food and service. this place is tiny and always busy. my favorites are the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with corn, 2 eggs, and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> and also the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. my kids adore this place and are always accommodated. the service is fast and the food is very reasonably priced. while i'm sure there are arguments for best ramen in las vegas, monta is in the lead for me.", 
            "absolutely delicious. 30$ (including tip) tried the spicey tonkotsu. the chazu rice and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>. the pork gyoza was great and had some special <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.  the flavor of the soup was so good i was ready to go back for more the next day."

            "finally got around to visiting the latest addition to ramen houses in vegas - monta noodle house.  conveniently located on spring mountain, right next to the super busy raku.  (smart business choice i would say.)\n\nthis place is bare bones - as in minimal tables and a bar, so don't come with a large group.  their super simple menu gets you in and out fast!  (a couple who came in around the same time we did had ordered, gotten their food, finished, paid and left by the time we were eating ours.)\n\ni went for their most popular dish - <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> ($6.95).  the main component is the broth, which is made up of boiling pork bones, fat, and collagen for hours.  this results in a cloudy white broth and would usually have the consistency of a thin gravy.  it automatically comes with two slices of char sui, takenoko (bamboo sprouts), kikurage (type of mushroom), and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>.  their char siu (barbecued pork) definitely isn't like the chinese kind, but definitely tasty.\n\nthe husband went for the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> ($7.25), which is ultimately bean paste blended with the pork broth giving it a richer flavor.  this was also good, and quite filling.\n\nwe also shared a regular order of the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> ($5.75).  it sits on a bed of rice, with fresh scallions and pickled red ginger.  i adore pork belly and the next time i come here, i'm going to order a dish of this all to myself.  it's fatty and good.  \n\na side dish we added on was the <mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark> ($1.50).  you can have this on the side or in your broth.  it's pickled mustard greens that may or may not be to your liking.  it's adds a different texture and taste to your ramen.  other toppings you can add on included nitamago (seasoned hard boiled egg), corn, butter, kimchee, and more char siu or <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>.\n\nthere's only one other kind of ramen they offer here - shoyu, which means soy sauce based.  you can also add extra noodles for $2 more if you save your soup and ask for \"kaedama.\"  other dishes available are gyoza, <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, kim chee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, takana <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, cha siu bowl, and <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> (marinated polluck roe).\n\nservice was good.  with two waitresses, they keep the flow of business going great and refilled beverages as needed.  it's not the best place to loiter with the limited seating and all, but definitely a great place to grab a quick bite and go.\n\nupdate!  \ni returned the following month for my own bowl of the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>.  this time the pork belly was sliced thinner, which wasn't to my personal preference.  guess it depends on who is working the kitchen that day.", 
            "it amazes me how adding one vegetable (s) or without can add or miss the flavor of the delicious monta noodles offered.\n\ni finally tried miso and i thought it was amazing and actually has a better taste than tonkatsu. only i prefer the straight noodles served with tonkatsu instead of curly ramen noodles with miso.  with my miso, i had <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, corn and <mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark>! the taste was flavorful and decadent with a touch of spice! \n\nthe following week, i ordered my miso with my favorite noodle along with my extra vegetable components just like my last visit but forgot to add the mustard green. i swore up and down to the chef that they gave me tonkatsu because miso was spicy last time.  well, after a discussion with the chef we realized that the <mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark> presented the spicy flavor to the broth, which was forgotten! \n\ni am astonished how one element can change the flavors! \n\ncheers to the chef for helping me figure that out and making a fresh batch of miso with my extra kicks.\n\nmonta monta....you know you wanna monta monta!", 
            "this charming restaurant offering the best ramen in vegas is located two doors down from raku in the seoul plaza on spring mountain, and could be one of the smallest restaurants in the city. monta is actually so pea-sized that if you come during peak times you'll almost certainly have to wait before you can sit down. don't let this be a deterrant, just keep it in mind before you go, and get there quickly before even more people find out about it.\n\nhalf of the restaurant is an open kitchen, so your dinner music consists of the clanking of woks and pans accompanied by the chatter of the waitresses, cooks, and other patrons. you can sit at the bar if you really want to be part of the action, or if none of the five tables are available. though the vibe is nice and busy, the waitresses are sweet and won't rush you through your meal.\n\nthere are three types of ramen to choose from; tonkatsu (rich, cloudy, almost creamy broth); shoyu (light and delicate soy sauce based broth); and miso (somewhere in the middle of the other consistencies and tastes like...miso). the shoyu and <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> come with chewy, thicker noodles which i much prefer in texture and taste to the thinner, less al dente noodles that come in the tonkatsu (you can sub if you like). all three varieties of the ramen cost around $7 and also come with chasu (tender, roasted, fatty pork), scallions, kikurage (mushroom), takenoko (bamboo shoots), and scallions. you can then customize your ramen with little extras that include perfectly coddled egg, butter, more pork, and my personal favorite, takana, or pickled <mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark>. these don't cost a lot, so customize away. also, be sure to add some of the fantastic accoutrement residing in your condiment tray such as pickled ginger strips and minced garlic.\n\nyou won't find much other than ramen on the menu, just a handful of appetizers and sides. of these i've had the gyoza ($5.95), which were excellent one time but not cooked correctly another, and <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> with takana. the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> is almost as good as the ramen, so if you aren't in the mood for soup get this instead. another plus is cheap beer ($2.50 for domestic).\n\ni can't think of any other meal i'd rather enjoy on a cold day than a steaming bowl of hearty home-made soup, so i plan on going to monta frequently this winter. if it continues to get even busier, however, i may be taking it to go in a perfectly packed parcel. i brought ramen home for my husband once and was amazed at the care put into ensuring the soup would be just as good at home as it is in the restaurant. the noodles were wrapped in their own little pouch, waiting to be cooked until they reached our stove, and all the other ingredients were individually wrapped to keep them in their peak state. attention to detail really separates the boys from the (ra)men.", 
            "very good ramen.  i've been here about five times and i like the tonkotsu the best, which is pork bone broth.  but it is very filling.  right now, they are offering the tonkotsu mixed with the shoyu broth.  it has pieces of pork and the tonkotsu noodles.  this is a little less filling but does not have enough of the pork taste for me.  my husband prefers the noodles in the shoyu so we might try to get those noodles in the tonkotsu/shoyu.  we shall see.  i have not tried the miso as most people tell me it is very thick and salty.  i can't tear myself away from the tonkotsu - it is so good!  i'll just stick with that.\n\ni highly recommend getting the <mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark> in your ramen.  it is very, very flavorful.  also, they have containers of fresh garlic and ginger scattered about the place.  if there isn't one on your table, just ask.  it's a great addition to the ramen if you are a fan of garlic and/or ginger.  free addition to the ramen! the gyoza is good too, but keep in mind, you will likely be surprisingly full after just some ramen.\n\nif the place is crowded, they will set up a waitlist that you have to write your name on.  it's outside taped to a table by the door.  if they are really busy, they may not stop to explain this to you, so just keep an eye out for the list if the place is full.\n\nit's true, as some of the reviewers say, that it is unbearably hot inside the restaurant during the summer. but they are good with the beverage refills (asahi on tap!) and just be thankful you don't have to work there all day! plus, when it was too warm inside, the turnover was quick so the wait for a table was shorter.  now that it is colder outside, it seems like people linger and chat.  but still, turnover is decent so if there is a wait, don't despair.  you need to spend $10 minimum to use a credit card.", 
            "having been to japan i can say this ramen is on par. i have been looking for a good ramen place in town and this one looks to be a keeper. the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> rocks my world. the broth was light and the noodles cooked al dente. i got mine with extra pork, butter and corn. slurped it right up. since i am a bit picky, i usually end up picking out the bamboo shoots, <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> and kikurage.\n\nnot a big fan of the gyoza, a little too many vegetables in them for a carnivore like me.  my mom really enjoyed her <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>. she also went with extra pork as well as nitamago and <mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark>. my bf always gets the miso broth. this time he went for extra noodles in addition to usual his add-ons of pork and egg.\n\nboth times i have been so far has been on a weekend for late lunch. the first time, we didn't wait very long but we did end up sitting at the bar. there were a fair amount of people waiting the second time but they moved fast and the wait for us was reasonable. i would really like to see how they do on a weekday for lunch since it is a hop skip and a jump away from my work.", 
            "this place was recommended by a friend who had eaten here before. \n\nit has a very small dining area and we understood why yelpers complained about the wait. lucky for us, we went at the perfect time because the bar area opened up just in time for the 6 of us to chow down. \n\ni got the tonkotsu-<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with a side of <mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark>. others enjoyed the other types of ramen and the bf got the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>. since i've been in sb for a while, i haven't had good ramen, so this was a special treat! \n\ni must warn you though, the container of reddish spices was very salty and i personally don't recommend it unless you try your dish first and want more salty goodness. i love adding white pepper to kick it up a notch and the sesame seeds were a nice mild addition as well.\n\ni took a bite of the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> and it had a nice flavor. it's pretty much marinated bacon, how can you go wrong? the ramen was very tasty and i was finished before i knew it. the <mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark> added additional flavor, but wasn't really needed. \n\nthis is a great find and a place that i'll definitely come back to.", 
            "as comfort food goes, ramen can be such a go-to meal when it's cold outside (we both sweat way too much to be slurping noodles in mega hot molten lava broth in the summer)! so during the colder months, we make our way as much as possible to monta for ramen\n\nit's tiny noodle shop, the counter seats ten and five table tops that seats twelve total.  it's open until late at night and it cranks out people like no one's business-prety much there's always a waiting list to get into this place!\n\nand it is well worth it,  the ramen is some of the best that we have had, (and that includes japan!  gasp! horror! blasphemy!) but it's true-we went to hide chan ramen in fukuoka and the broth wasn't as good as monta's!\n\nas we always do, there's a couple of things that we order and not much else, (it's hard to venture out when you know a dish is that good).  we start the japanese journey with an order of the gyoza; these pork dumplings are perfectly cooked, a crunchy charred exterior that holds in the moist juices of the pork.  add sujoyu, (a mixture of vinegar and soy sauce) rayu (chili oil) and some raw garlic, dip these little moon shaped suckers in it and pop' em in your pie hole! \n\nafter you've wet your appetite, it's time move onto the main event; the ramen.  as is, we're partial to the tonkotsu (pork bone) ramen- the broth is made from simmered pork bone, fat and collagen which gives it its super rich, almost creamy soup that can easily fill you up and warm your body.  it's most definitely the most satisfying noodle soup on this planet.  and especially since this is a kyushu dish, (fukuoka is on the  island of kyushu) i'm particular to the flavor.  (japan based on its regions have different tastes and styles to the same dish).  \n\nmonta's <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> recipe is from kurume, (not far from fukuoka) so it's really close to my heart.  which is why you won't see me ordering the other ramen, (there's shoyu, miso and tonkotsu-shoyu).  one of these days, we'll get to them......\n\nthere's a couple of add ons and i would definitely go and order an extra chashu, (roasted pork) these tender slices of heaven are as much as a main character as the noodles and broth.  getting to the noodles, have you ever had anything better than ramen noodles? they're just so unique; chewy and monta really cooks them right.  we also get the nitamago, (cooked egg) takana, (<mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark>) and sometimes nori, (seaweed) -the egg for extra protein, the takana for the vegetable and crunch and nori for the contrast in texture.  you can also order an extra helping of ramen noodles (kaedama) if you have extra broth, but there's no way i have ever had enough room for that!!!\n\nin the summertime, they serve hiyashi-chuka (cold chinese noodles). it's refreshing and cold perfect for the summer with bits of ham, cucumber, bean sprouts, takana, nori and sesame seeds over ramen noodles in a light soy; it's the best on a hot day!!!\n\ni forgot to mention the rice bowls that they serve as well; i'm not the biggest fan of these bowls but that just me- a lot of people rave about them!  i know what i like and i'm happy staying on my side of the menu if you know what i mean...the service here is excellent, the waitresses are terribly polite and the the food comes outs really fast! (they need too, cuz they have to get people in and out of there)!\n\n\nratings (out of five stars)\n\nfood          4.75\nambience  4\nservice      4.5", 
            "ode to monta's <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>\n\ncue violin\n\nhey, i just ate you, and this is crazy... but here's my hunger , so feed me maybe?   all of the ramen bowls, try to tempt me, but here's my chopsticks, so feed me maybe?  \n\nyeah this will probably be out of date by the time i hit submit review, but i'll deal with it.   i've been to monta several times since it opened, and the first 8 or 9 times i stuck with getting various ramen.  of those my favorite quickly became the tonkotsu as i really enjoyed the creaminess of it.  i did like the other two as well, but always found myself going back to tonkotsu.  as a quick aside, i actually found the tonkotsu-shoyu to be my least favorite.  the pork was always tender and tasty, and i would almost always get an egg added and i tried most of the other additions as well.   i personally didn't find many of them to be worth the extra cost to add, though i did like the <mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark> on occasion.  \n\nfor an appetizer i had the gyoza a few times and found them to be very good examples, but not extraordinary at the same time.   then one day i decided to split a <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> with a friend as an appetizer.  game change.   it's seriously all i think about when i think of monta now.  as much as i enjoyed the ramen whenever i'd had it, it took a backseat to this dish in my heart and stomach.  currently saving up for an engagement ring.  <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> will make a lovely bride.\n\nservice is always friendly if a little rushed, and i always thought the overall price was decent.\n\nstill need to try anime and sora so no comparison on ramens unfortunately, but unless they have <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> on their menu, it might not matter.", 
            "now that i've come here enough to practically remember the whole menu, i think it's ready for a review. \n\nwhen i found this place (through yelp of course) i thought to myself, \"could it be? a true authentic ramen place that the city i originally resided in devastatingly lacked of? my own little nyc momofuku only a 15 minute drive away?\" oh, sweet baby jesus it could! \n\nbefore making the trip to your next lunch or dinner date here, you should probably consider what day you're going and at what time. this place is small, like 5 tables (2 4-tops, 3 2-tops) small with a couple seats at the bar, and it gets crazy packed! the first time i came here i literally drove by and was like, \"awh hailll noo,\" and drove away. however i will say that if there's just a couple of people before you, just be patient and wait. the tables turn over rather quickly.\n\nwhich leads me to the menu. it's very simple and quick to prepare. if you're going with ramen, they have 4 different broth options: shoyu (chicken), tonkotsu (pork), tonkotsu-shoyu (chicken & pork) and miso. all are priced around 6.95 a bowl. just forget the rest and go with the tonkotsu-shoyu. all ramens are prepared with two slices of pork, bamboo, and chopped <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>. don't forget to add extra ingredients like an egg and <mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark>! if you've never tried <mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark>, it really compliments the broth and makes it extra delicious...order it on the side and try it out! adding in the ingredients is what really gets the meal to be pricier than expected. just 1 egg is an extra $1.75, but it's okay to indulge a little every now  and then, so just go all out with you bad ramen self! \n\nthey have other items as well such as <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, small plates, and cold ramen! i still have yet to try them.. will do an update after my next visit! \n\nthe only negative thing i'd have to say about the ramen is it can get pretty salty, of course you can mention to them less sodium, but i'm pretty sure all they're going to do is dilute it with hot water. to leave it on a positive note, aside from the saltiness the broth is perfection. extremely murky, so you know its packed with flavor and takes overnight cooking to prepare.", 
            "i love this place... the waiting sucks, the small seating area sucks, but once you sit down and start eating all those sucky parts melt away. you have to order their ramen. this time i got tonkatsu-shoyu - pork/soy sauce..? extra order of noodles and added 1 egg, 3 extra orders of chashu (i absolutely do not regret this), half order of pork belly, gyoza and <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> (<mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark>). i loved everything, the gyoza and pork belly i can live without, but the ramen and chashu and <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was pure heaven for me. regretting that i moved out of vegas.", 
            "be patient there will be a wait here.  this is a small restaurant with a bar seating area.  nothing too fancy for just getting a good wholesome bowl of ramen \n\nsee below my lunch meal after a crazy night in vegas.  everything is an additional w/cost.   \n\n<mark>Miso Ramen</mark> 7.25 \npork broth w/thin noodles (you can choose between chicken or pork broth, thin or wide noodles) \n\nspecial toppings for your ramen:\nchasu pork $2.50\nspicy $1.50\nshreeded <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> $1.50\nseasoned hard boiled egg $1.50\n<mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark>  $1.50\ncorn .50\n\nother: \ngyoza $5.50\n\nso this place is off the strip, you would need to take a cab here.  it is located in the chinatown area of vegas.  we waited for about 45mins, got seated and went straight into ordering our meal.  the service was fast.  ingredients on the ramen are placed on top, but before i mixed everything altogether i tried the broth and it was very good.   adding the ingredients of the spicy sauce, <mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark> and chasu in pork broth made the soup just way too salty for me to eat it.  i really wish the server would had informed me that this would have happened.  otherwise, the chasu was really tender and the thin noodles were not too overwhelming.  everything in the bowl was well portioned. then i had the gyoza, it just tasted like any frozen gyoza purchased at a super market.  overall, i would come back here and not make the same mistake by ordering too many salty add ons in my ramen.", 
            "it has been some time since i had good ramen.  san francisco is one of the best foodie towns but it fails miserably in terms of ramen offerings.\n\nwe stopped by monta on a recent trip to vegas.  it is located on spring mountain road like most of the other popular nearby offstrip spots and is located in the same strip as raku and kung fu tea.  the parking lot is a bit tight and can fill up pretty quickly on busy nights but there is street parking and we have used the lot opposite of the strip (store was closed).\n\nthere was a short wait at monta as expected but it was reasonable - only 3 other names on the clipboard.  the shop consisted of a long l shaped bar and 10 or so small tables.  not a huge place but not small either.  we all ordered the tonkatsu ramen and tanaka <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> as recommended.  the default toppings were a bit sparse (pork, bamboo, ginger, 'shrooms) but considering the price (under $7) i didn't mind.  i added a soft boiled egg to mine - other standard toppings were available (corn, more pork, butter, etc) we were pleasantly surprised at the turnaround for the ramen - within 5-10 minutes.\n\nthe broth carried plenty of flavor but was a bit thicker than the other ramen shops.  the noodles were thin and firm but not overly so.  the bowl only came with 2 slices of pork but it was expertly prepared - tender with a good combination of meat and fat.  there was a slight aftertaste (from msg?) but easily queched from the kung fu milk tea from next door.\n\nthe <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was solid but a bit salty.  it was more than likely from the <mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark> either being too abundant or just overly salty themselves.  not bad but i may go with the potstickers or simply stick with the ramen next time.\n\na definite stop for me in vegas the next time i am craving something soupy or noodles.", 
            "you must sign up on the wait list at the door - good thing another customer told me, i'd never have guessed that! the food was amazing, although yes, salty, as some have stated, especially toward the end of the bowl. i had added <mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark>, that's very salty and will make it worse. i almost ordered extra noodles ($1.50) to compensate but was so full i just couldn't. the menu is very simple and service is quick. i'd gladly come here again... but there are so many great places to try, even in this very plaza, i doubt i'll get the chance."

            "i have been looking for a place in las vegas to grab some good ramen for a very long time, and up until now i have yet to be very satisfied. after hearing so much about monta me and a few friends decided to check the place out rather than go with our usual tuesday night plan of getting wing tuesdays at buffalo wild wings.\n\nwe get to the parking lot and this place is pretty much something that you definitely had to hear about to come find because it was buried inside a small restaurant complex which i have passed a million times but never really noticed. the venue is very small. according to the max capacity sign it could only hold about 26 people but on a tuesday night, it wasn't very busy.\n\nas i was browsing the menu, i wasn't too excited. i was hoping that they would have a larger selection of different ramen because all of the previous places i had been to had at least 7-8 different kinds. monta however had 3 main types of ramen; tonkatsu ramen, <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>, and <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>. to go along with the ramen they had various different toppings you could add including boiled egg, extra slices of pork, more noodles, <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> among other things that i don't recall.\n\ni ended up ordering the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> with a boiled egg and 4 extra slices of pork and upon taking my first bite i was instantly satisfied. this was the ramen place i had been hoping to find all along. the pork was amazing and the egg was cooked just right. the miso broth and the noodles, everything blended in together so nicely. an order for extra noodles were only $2.00 but unfortunately, i had eaten just a little bit before going here so i couldn't get more but i will definitely be coming back much more often especially now that winter is around the <mark>Corn</mark> and a nice bowl of hot <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> will do me some good.\n\noverall the meal cost me $10 which, considering all of the toppings i added, is very, very decently priced. i recommend this place to anyone who like me has been looking for really good japanese ramen.", 
            "probably the best japanese ramen place in town. its tucked in a little <mark>Corn</mark> on spring mountain across sf market so you might actually miss it. the restaurant is actually quite small and if you come during peak lunch hours, you might have a 20-30 min (which is what happened to me).\n\nyou have 4 broth flavors to choose from: \n\ntonkotsu (very savory) - my favorite\nshoyu (salty/soy sauce)\ntonkotsu-shoyu (combination of the first two which tastes funky to me)\nmiso \n\neach comes with 2 slices of chashu, some bamboo shoots and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>. you have the option of adding more chashu, boiled egg, corn, kimch etc. usually 2 slices of chashu isn't enough for me since its a gigantic bowl of ramen and i can never finish it. they do have rice dishes and gyoza which is okay but not the best. bill came out to be around $20 for two noodles so very reasonable.", 
            "this is my first review so be gentle! i would like to say i came in here at a very good time! from what i hear, it's a densely crowded place with a bit of a wait, but i didn't wait and had a nice seat with my friends! this took place on a saturday night as well, mind you.\n\nservice was so-so, but goes well with a small shabby place such as monta. shabby, but clean. it reminded me very well of the <mark>Corn</mark> noodles houses they have in japan. stepping into monta reminded me of the times i stayed in japan during hot summers and cold autumns. \n\ni ordered the tonkotsu-<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>. dericious aromatic smell, and served hot. i could say i enjoyed every bite and every piece of pork in this ramen! (mind you, i am not a pork fan.) i believe monta deserves a first-timers graced visit, so check em out! :)", 
            "so glad my partner for good times had to experience this quality ramen here after being disappointed going the the ramen fest and not having ramen because of the long line just for the food ticket to get the ramen.  forget that! \nconsidering this would be my pfgt's experience with quality ramen, i punched in best ramen on google and monta came up.  typical ramen shop.  small and yet comfortable.  just after lunch but was still 90% full but sat almost immediately in the <mark>Corn</mark> table. perfect.  i ordered asahi, gyoza, tonkutsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> for me and <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> for her.  gyoza came out first and that was decent gyoza.  ramen came in about 10 minutes.  the smell was outrageous but that first taste before i added the 3 pepper blend was insane!  i told my pfgt, \"this is ramen!\" her <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> was just as good.  needless to say, down to the last slurp of the broth, i would definitely go back!  prices are fantastic!", 
            "first tried monta at one of the japanese ramen festivals out in torrance, ca. there were maybe several competitors but not one jazzed me. except enter monta. small booth tucked in a <mark>Corn</mark>. no heavy signage just three folks sweatin in the polstering heat serving up what unbeknowst to me the best ramen showcasing. found out that they have a location out in las vegas and decided to take some family members out there to give it a try.\n\ngot there 30 minutes before they opened. all of us hungover from the night before, only to see that there is a line about to form! we turned off our engines parked and snagged in front of the line. in 30 minutes i kid you not, at least 40 others joined. luckily we were in front. \n\nstarving and dehydrated. we ordered. i settled for the spicy tonkotsu with the added <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, two slices of chashu, bamboo shoots and kikurage. added additionally the nori + nitamago. (dry seaweed and hard boiled egg, respectively) some corn, etc. my gal got the tonkotsu black. and whoa. i've never had a ramen to that degree ever in my 30 years of life. what is this? a smoky flavored broth? almost like a bbq tang? this was my highlight. it was unusual. it was weird. but in the most gnarliest of ways a ramen can be. i highly recommend that one. \n\nfyi: their chasu bowl is one of the better ones i have experienced in all of ca. definitely worth it as a side dish. \n\nas a matter of fact. i am visiting monta again for mdw (memorial day weekend) i am coming back. it wouldn't be a successful vegas trip without a visit to monta. seriously best ramen in town.", 
            "look i'll keep it short.... everyone on here raving about how good it is, and too be completely honest, it was pretty tasty. fact is though, my wife and i have still only been in the us for less than 1 month.... soooo the japanese ramen of our home, which is japan lol, still is heavy on our pallet. \nok so i enjoyed it. my wife said the soup (broth) was very good and very authentic. however, she had a problem with the noodles. she said the broth was real, the look was real, but it was kinda mind messing because the noodles were too soft for the kind she ordered. she used a bunch of japanese words of course but i'm just giving the typical american consumer the gist. taste is 3 stars, authenticity is 3-4 stars, seating is like wow, packed 24/7. price was fine... i mean, my wife felt bad for being critical about a ramen place and her japanese blood came out when she stared being thankful instead for even being able to have japanese food in this american desert. her final decision was, for a western country, this was pretty solid ramen. 3 stars! \nso that's that. it's not the worst... and my american ass honestly doesn't know the one details and difference... so it's whatever.  don't take my word for it... thousands have reviewed this place. do take my wife's word though... for america this is a 4 or 5 star... in reality (in japan) this would be like a 2... not the worst but in the homeland your ramen gotta be dope to compete. so this might sound harsh but just saying... overall... it's worth it. if you can get in (always packed) please go in... if there's a long line (like out the door, which is common as this place is popular) walk catty <mark>Corn</mark> to curry zen in same parking lot... personally, japanese curry is my fav... but this is about monta.... and monta is a 3star ramen shop in the world... but closer to 5 stars a far as america goes. cheap too... good on a budget. \\u3044\\u305f\\u3060\\u304d\\u307e\\u3059", 
            "so the fiancee and i were next door at kung fu tea, and she said: \"let's not go exactly at 11:30 am when it opens\".\n\nso 5 minutes later we walked in and man the place was already packed. we got lucky and scored a <mark>Corn</mark> table. a line had quickly formed after. it's a small establishment so be prepared to wait.\n\nbut the wait is worth it. featuring a very easy to read menu (think, shin-sen gumi in fountain valley/gardena/alhambra), we both ordered a regular bowl each featuring their pork broth.\n\naside from the ingredients, which were tasty (the pork can be on the fatty side, which i love, but may vary for others), the broth itself was super rich and very very savory. quite simply some (if not the) best ramen you can find in vegas.\n\nthe servers take your orders down on ipads and are fast/friendly.\n\nparking seemed easy given the time we went, and this place does take credit cards. major kudos to this place and i can't wait to come back.", 
            "i dont get it. portions are way less than other places like jinya and sora. tight and small. in the <mark>Corn</mark> of massage parlors. i really love ramen, i believe some of the best is right here in las vegas. i didnt feel that flavor from either the food or staff, no hello or goodbye? more like: next! really left feeling meh and i found myself not eating the rest. there is just nothing special about this place like sora with its broth or jinya with its noodles etc...meh. i've experienced better.",

            "hakata style ramen originates in northern kyushu.  it is in my opinion the best ramen you can get, with maybe kurume being at the same level.\nstart with a thick pork broth made with boiled pork bones to release the collagen into the soup.  next, add some of the best noodles i've ever tasted.  throw on some basic toppings like roast pork, <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, mushrooms and bamboo, and that's your standard bowl.  they also have one with miso.\nthe menu here is very simple.  there are the two bowls of ramen, and additional toppings, then there are a few small rice dishes (mostly <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> with some topping), and pot stickers.\neverything is amazing, be it service, staff, taste, decor.  there is not a good enough rating to describe this place.\ncome on in today, and look for them next to raku, and say hello to your new favorite restaurant.",

            "after stumbling through various japanese restaurants that serve decent bowls of ramen, i've finally found a place that specializes at it. in fact, it's pretty much all they serve. their menu reminded me of an in-n-out menu: you either order a <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> or a <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>. if you don't want ramen, there's <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and some basic japanese apps. not much in terms of variety. but, if this is what you're in the mood for, they do it great.\n\ni started off with an order of gyoza for an app. simple stuff and what you'd expect. nothing to write home about. then, came the steamy bowl of <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>. the broth was a real winner here. a lot of places that i have tried never really got the broth quite right. this was one place where the flavor really hit the spot. even though it's a scorching 100+ degrees outside, a routine stop for a bowl of ramen here is worth having. next time i drop by, i will probably give their <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> a shot.\n\nmonta is a tiny, quaint little place, though not very crowded when i went. it started out empty when we walked in, but started filling up as we were slurping up our noodles. i wouldn't expect a wait for a table, but i could see it happening if this place picks up in popularity.",

(ok, i'll admit to normally eating a shoyu-based one many many times) the broth is actually a bit creamy (very addictive) and the stuff inside the bowl is tops.\n\ncan i tell you how much in love with the marinated boiled/almost soft egg in it, aka nitamago? it's so damn great! if you like hardboiled or softboiled egg, you'll love it i guarantee.\n\ni have to try the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and their gyoza. they smell very very good, but i have to have more people with me to get it all eaten! when the weather cools down, i'm going to be here lots!\n\nbtw, they have a very funky restroom!",

            "yum yum yum! \n\nmy friend's cousin recommended this place to me. she has family in vegas and this is one of her favorite hole in the wall spots.\n\nwhen i first walked in, i wasn't too sure about the place. no air conditioning, just a fan. the place is super tiny. we ordered the <mark>Chashu Bowl</mark>, <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, and <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>. \n\nthe pork in the <mark>Chashu Bowl</mark> and <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> melts in you mouth. it is that delicious. both had very good flavor. the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> also was very good. all the food felt like it was home-made and in a very positive way. it brought back the comforts of home.\n\nwhen i am back in town, i will for sure do my best to visit this place.\n\n i really wish there was a place like this in san diego.",

(a couple who came in around the same time we did had ordered, gotten their food, finished, paid and left by the time we were eating ours.)\n\ni went for their most popular dish - <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> ($6.95).  the main component is the broth, which is made up of boiling pork bones, fat, and collagen for hours.  this results in a cloudy white broth and would usually have the consistency of a thin gravy.  it automatically comes with two slices of char sui, takenoko (bamboo sprouts), kikurage (type of mushroom), and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>.  their char siu (barbecued pork) definitely isn't like the chinese kind, but definitely tasty.\n\nthe husband went for the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> ($7.25), which is ultimately bean paste blended with the pork broth giving it a richer flavor.  this was also good, and quite filling.\n\nwe also shared a regular order of the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> ($5.75).  it sits on a bed of rice, with fresh scallions and pickled red ginger.  i adore pork belly and the next time i come here, i'm going to order a dish of this all to myself.  it's fatty and good.  \n\na side dish we added on was the <mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark> ($1.50).  you can have this on the side or in your broth.  it's pickled mustard greens that may or may not be to your liking.  it's adds a different texture and taste to your ramen.  other toppings you can add on included nitamago (seasoned hard boiled egg), corn, butter, kimchee, and more char siu or <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>.\n\nthere's only one other kind of ramen they offer here - shoyu, which means soy sauce based.  you can also add extra noodles for $2 more if you save your soup and ask for \"kaedama.\"  other dishes available are gyoza, <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, kim chee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, takana <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, cha siu bowl, and <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> (marinated polluck roe).\n\nservice was good.  with two waitresses, they keep the flow of business going great and refilled beverages as needed.  it's not the best place to loiter with the limited seating and all, but definitely a great place to grab a quick bite and go.\n\nupdate!  \ni returned the following month for my own bowl of the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>.  this time the pork belly was sliced thinner, which wasn't to my personal preference.  guess it depends on who is working the kitchen that day.", 
            "i just came back from japan and this is really close to being the real thing.    i've tried all broths (shoyu, miso, tonkotsu) and they're all very good.  <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and the bowls are all legit.  all japanese staff.  best thing thats happened to vegas since raku.", 
            "last week i ate at monta four nights out of seven. i don't think i'll ever get tired of their delicious ramen - only three different options, but with many toppings available. and if i do, i'll move onto the kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> or <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>. the gyoza are pretty meh though. i won't get those again. \n\ni'm so glad there's finally a simple, authentic japanese ramen spot in vegas. it's small, it's hot and it's usually crowded. like the best ramen places in l.a. i used to drive the five hours just to get a bowl, now i can hit up this place between trips. huzzah.", 
            "this charming restaurant offering the best ramen in vegas is located two doors down from raku in the seoul plaza on spring mountain, and could be one of the smallest restaurants in the city. monta is actually so pea-sized that if you come during peak times you'll almost certainly have to wait before you can sit down. don't let this be a deterrant, just keep it in mind before you go, and get there quickly before even more people find out about it.\n\nhalf of the restaurant is an open kitchen, so your dinner music consists of the clanking of woks and pans accompanied by the chatter of the waitresses, cooks, and other patrons. you can sit at the bar if you really want to be part of the action, or if none of the five tables are available. though the vibe is nice and busy, the waitresses are sweet and won't rush you through your meal.\n\nthere are three types of ramen to choose from; tonkatsu (rich, cloudy, almost creamy broth); shoyu (light and delicate soy sauce based broth); and miso (somewhere in the middle of the other consistencies and tastes like...miso). the shoyu and <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> come with chewy, thicker noodles which i much prefer in texture and taste to the thinner, less al dente noodles that come in the tonkatsu (you can sub if you like). all three varieties of the ramen cost around $7 and also come with chasu (tender, roasted, fatty pork), scallions, kikurage (mushroom), takenoko (bamboo shoots), and scallions. you can then customize your ramen with little extras that include perfectly coddled egg, butter, more pork, and my personal favorite, takana, or pickled <mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark>. these don't cost a lot, so customize away. also, be sure to add some of the fantastic accoutrement residing in your condiment tray such as pickled ginger strips and minced garlic.\n\nyou won't find much other than ramen on the menu, just a handful of appetizers and sides. of these i've had the gyoza ($5.95), which were excellent one time but not cooked correctly another, and <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> with takana. the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> is almost as good as the ramen, so if you aren't in the mood for soup get this instead. another plus is cheap beer ($2.50 for domestic).\n\ni can't think of any other meal i'd rather enjoy on a cold day than a steaming bowl of hearty home-made soup, so i plan on going to monta frequently this winter. if it continues to get even busier, however, i may be taking it to go in a perfectly packed parcel. i brought ramen home for my husband once and was amazed at the care put into ensuring the soup would be just as good at home as it is in the restaurant. the noodles were wrapped in their own little pouch, waiting to be cooked until they reached our stove, and all the other ingredients were individually wrapped to keep them in their peak state. attention to detail really separates the boys from the (ra)men.", 
            "if anyone read my review on the ramen restaurant in anaheim recently, i am so happy to announce that the wonderful ramen experience there has been found at monta!\n\nthe one thing that made me fall in love with the other restaurant's ramen was the melt-in-your-mouth chasu.  monta has just that.  their ramen is delicious, the meat is wonderfully soft and flavorful, and their <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> is do darn good.  i could eat four orders of their <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> in one sitting!  \n\ni'm glad that i found more traditional ramen in vegas--finally!  monta is one hell of a ramen restaurant.  i believe that i'm retiring from the other ramen places in vegas and sticking with monta from now on.  if you haven't tried it and were looking on yelp for some assistance as to whether or not you should--you should.\n\ni fall for noodles made with love, and monta serves a bowl of it every order they fill.  if i could serenade food, i'd ask monta's ramen and chasu to marry me.", 
            "my wife and i finally got to try this restaurant last night.  from all the reviews, we were excited to try this place out.  wow!!  we are fans.  the tonkotsu and <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> were excellent.  the thick noodle was cooked to perfection. the broth, in my opinion even tastes better than some of the restaurants in tokyo.  also the char siu is very flavourful, but a little too thinly sliced.  the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was also very good.  i am so happy that we finally have an authentic ramen noodle house in my backyard.  will definitely be back for more delicious ramen and broth.   i want to give 4.5 stars but i can't.  1/2 star off for those thin sliced char siu.", 
            "man, oh man!  the tonkatsu ramen was sooooo goood!  it was a cool day in las vegas and what better way to warm up than with a big bowl of ramen.  very tasty rich broth.  the ramen noodles was cooked al dente.  the pork slices were actually slices of belly pork and when you touched it, it kind of melts into the broth!  oooooh, delicious!  i had my ramen with the boiled egg.  there were condiments on the table and i put some of that pureed garlic into my soup to give it an extra garlic kick!  \n\nwe also ordered one <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and a gyoza appetizer.  yummy!  all items gold stars!  \n\nthe restaurant is tiny with 4 tables of 4 and 1 table of 2 and a l-shaped  bar counter, facing the open kitchen.  you can watch the cooks make the ramen in front of you.  the wait staff are all very polite.  turnover is fast as people come and go all the time we were at the restaurant for lunch today.\n\ndefinitely will come back to monta noodle house!", 
            "overall, i'm giving this place 4 stars but the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> deserves 5 stars by itself.  i loved the flavor of the soup and how the noodles were cooked just right.  my brother and bf were hesitant to go because they've had not so good ramen before but both of them loved the ramen they ordered (tonkotsu and shoyu).  my brother loved it so much, he went again 2 days later.  i'll definitely be going back again and again for the ramen!  and next time, i'll try the extra toppings..but it says a lot about the flavor of the soup when i loved it plain the way it came.\n\nso why the 4 stars?  we also ordered kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and the dumplings.  the dumplings were ok, nothing special about it.  it came slightly burnt and were all stuck together.  the kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was ok too, but more sour than the normal ones i've had.  \n\nstick to the ramen and you'll love this place!", 
            "thank the gods las vegas has a place like this.  i was addicted to the pork at gomen in anaheim until i came here.  \n\nthe order consisted of:\ngyoza\n<mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>\n<mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>\n<mark>Chashu Bowl</mark>\n\ni found myself anticipating each round of umami goodness because each dish was devoured so quickly.  those gyoza were nice and crispy and tasted great.  the definite star was the pork.  i found myself assuring i got a piece in every bit of the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.  the chashu in the ramen was a perfect combination and that <mark>Chashu Bowl</mark> was just pure pork indulgence.  we even ordered some <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and extra chashu to go because i was sure to be craving that pork later in the night, and sure enough i did.  i'm craving\n\nthis place is an easy choice.  it's a small menu but everything is done so well.  great prices for the quaity of food you get.  you can't go wrong with anything here imo.", 
            "we ordered the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> and <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.  i did enjoy the soup but i felt the noodles were a bit al dente.  i've had better <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, it just had tons of chunky onions in it.  \n\na quick fix to my ramen craving in vegas.", 
            "finally! a very good ramen joint in vegas. this place is much more the real japanese ramen joint than the (now defunct) togoshi ramen.\n\nmonta is in a small strip mall on sprint mountain rd, just west of decatur. it is very easy to miss as you go by. and the shop is very small, with only four 4 place table, 1 2 place table, and about 10 counter seats. they only accept cash so beware.\n\ni recently learned of this place right here on yelp and had to give it a try. like others on this forum, i grew up eating fantastic ramen all over japan. and have long been searching... i was elated when santouka came to the states and even more ecstatic when local joints like orenchi (cupertino, ca) that are very much like the ramen i used to know in japan... started to pop up.\n\ni'd like to preface this review with the fact that i like tonkotsu, thick chijirimen (wavy noodles) usually, so i am usually biased towards that. monta has 4 basic types of ramen flavors: tonkotsu, shoyu, miso, and new (at least it said new today) tonkotsu shoyu which is a combination of the tonkotsu and shoyu broths.\n\ntonkotsu, of course, is pork based broth. the shoyu uses chicken broth (according to monta), but i also detected some dashi (fish based) in there as well. tonkotsu, and tonkotsu shoyu uses thin straight noodles. shoyu and miso uses the thick wavy noodles. each ramen @  $6.95 comes with 2 slices of char shu, kikurage (woodear mushrooms), memma (seasoned bamboo shoots), and chopped <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>. there are other toppings available as mentioned in other reviews, along with kaedama (literally means \"replacement ball\") extra noodles.\n\nkaedama is usually ordered as you go, not in the beginning. this is because if get it at the same time as your ramen, then the noodles either go cold, or get overcooked. this is one of the reasons why i do not like places that have a \"large\" size. by the time you're half way through, the noodles are too overcooked. i commend monta for doing the kaedama the right way.\n\nanyway, i was @ monta today, thu, at 2 pm, and the place had a waiting list 8 deep! it took us abobut 20 minutes to get seated, and as we got seated, the wait line even got longer. ok... my expectations are way high... but be cautious... this, after all, is the only ramen only joint in vegas....\n\ni ordered the tonkotsu shoyu with nitamago and extra char shu. my wife had the shoyu with nitamago. we also had gyoza. in the kitchen, there are basically 2 guys preparing the dishes. one guy that does the ramen, another that does the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and others. and with the packed house, the service was slow.\n\nbut when the ramen finally came, i was not disappointed. despite my doubts, the tonkotsu shoyu had a wonderful balance and marriage of pork and chicken broth. my wife's shoyu, i believe due to the chicken stock, had a very mellow aspect to it which also gave the tonkotsu a very mellow and non-overpowering flavor. i finished the broth to the last drop, including my wife's shoyu/chicken broth.\n\nthe noodles... my thin noodles were not overcooked, and about just right when my ramen came out. but because of its thinness, by the time i got half way through my ramen (and i'm a relatively quick ramen eater, beating my wife by a good 10 minutes :-)) was way overcooked and mushy soft. next time, i will see if they will cook it less (katame, or as i do at kyushu jyangara in tokyo, bari-kata... crispy as in ironed with starch). my wife's chijirimen was very good with good amount of al dente,a and the chewiness one expects in good ramen.  if i can't get them to cook the thin noodles to super al dente, then my backup plan is to have them use the thick noodles in the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>.\n\nthe boiled egg is soft boiled, but the yolk does not run. i like my soft boiled egg a with a bit more runny yolk. but nevertheless it was still good. the char shu was one the the better ones i had in the states. very tender, melts in your mouth, with good flavor... not too over powering, not too bland. the slices were on the thin side, but i got a total of 8 slices by ordering the extra char shu topping ($2.50). \n\nin summary both the tonkotsu shoyu and <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> were done very well, with a good balance of broth, noodles, and toppings in a dish that came together very very well. too many times, i have been to ramen places in the states where the broth may be good, but noodles lack, or vice versa, or even where all the individual ingredients are good, but the finished product just doesn't cut it.\n\nthe gyoza, unlike one reviewer here, i though were also very good. i would beg to differ that this is not like store bought gyoza as it is stuffed with pork whereas the store bought ones are more heavy on the nappa cabbage and not stuffed. the flavor is also very good, however, i like my gyoza wet...that is with a bit more juice as you bite into them.\n\nin the end though, i give monta 5 stars even with the few deficiencies. monta, in my book, share the top honors with orenchi in cupertino,", 
            "i admit that monta has the best ramen anywhere in vegas.  the stuff they serve at ichiza and shuseki has nothing on them!  the noodles are fresh and the broth, whether tonkatsu, miso, or shoyu, is always steaming hot and extremely flavorful.  i appreciate that it's the real stuff and not the packaged, powder crap other places use.  \n\nyes, monta is a noodle house but their <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> is just as good, if not better.  for someone who doesn't really like <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, i would come just for that.  their gyoza was just okay.  i've had better.   \n\neven though the place is (extremely) small, i like that it's cozy.  there was only one time when i actually had to wait for a table, but as always, the wait was worth it.  \n\na basic bowl of ramen will cost you almost $8.  that's kind of steep, especially in the economy that we're in now.  an extra $1.50 for a hard boiled egg also seems a bit much, don't you think?  i guess it's really quality over quantity with this place. \n\nfour out of five stars because food quality is good, service is good, but pricing isn't the best.  this place is always a pleasure though.  if you haven't been, you probably should soon.", 
            "best. ramen. ever. i suggest the tonkatsu ramen and the kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. soooo delicious.", 
            "rick moonen (top chef master's contestant and owner of rm seafood in mandalay bay) was spotted in this hole of a wall.\ndespite how low his restaurant ratings are, the fact that he chose to eat at this specific noodle house says a little something something about their food. \n\nto keep this short and sweet: \n- friendly service\n- was a wait around 12:30 (prime lunch time) but still got seated and served within 30 min\n- tonkatsu ramen= perfect portions. i ended up slurping up more of the broth than the noodles which was very surprising (i never drink the broth)\n- small <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> seemed small at first for the four of us but was just the right amount with the ramen. \n- lots of ginger and garlic sauces for unlimited consumption\n- parking lot big in plaza\n \ni want more!!!", 
            "monta is definitely one of the better ramen shops in las vegas. its in the same strip mall as raku on decatur/ spring mtn. \n\nmonta reminds us of japan's ramen shops...its all about order your food, eat your food, and get out, so the next group can eat. it's not a posh restaurant, minimal tables/ seats. the restaurant holds at most 30 people (5 tables of 4 seats and about 10 seats on the counter), so if you go with a large party, just sit wherever you can and when you can or you might be waiting for awhile.\n\nthe menu is simple. miso, tonkatsu, or <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>. my favorite is...all of them. huge stock pots in the back have been boiling bones and veg for hours to create the backbone of their heavenly broth.  i seem to be on a tonkatsu ramen kick lately with its hearty broth... you could add some thickener to the broth and you would have a damn good gravy. they give you a good amount of ramen, a few slices of tender charsiu, bamboo, takenoko, <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, half boiled egg, and kikurage. its a solid meal for a cheap price, $7-8 and you can add other extras for a small price.\n\nanother favorite is their <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>. its cheap and filling...not to mention very tasty. you get the thinly sliced pork served over rice in a small bowl garnished with beni shoga. its tasty, fatty, and better when you get eat a little beni shoga (red pickled ginger) with it.. we always get a small bowl and share it.\n\ntheir gyoza is good as is the kim chee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. we need to try more of the items on their menu but we are creatures of habit and sometimes its hard to stray away from the  dishes that monta is known for.\n\nits easy to over order food at monta. because the ramen bowls are big...resist ordering other dishes unless you have a big party and you want to share. \n\nmonta is great on a hot day and better on a cold day!! \n\narooha!!!!!", 
            "before i get flamed on giving this place only two starts let me explain why to me it deserves three stars.\n\ni was a us marine stationed overseas on mainland japan for three years. during those three years i've had the opportunity to eat sushi, ramen, bento bowls, curries, udon, miso soups, and other foods of japanese origins they way they make it and the way they eat it.\n\nthe ramen that is offered here is a step above instant ramen but is far from authentic. \n\nthe broths are noticeably lighter and less flavorful from authentic, the noodles are in the middle, they're close but dont have the right texture, sides such as meats are too fatty but seasoned better then authentic ramen.\n\nthe biggest difference is the price. here a bowl of ramen runs from 6.25 to 7.something which isnt bad but it's the sides that get you back. 1.50 for a hard boiled egg? 1.50 for a spoon full of pickled mustard greens? 2.50 for extra noodles?\n\nback in downtown iwakuni a bowl of ramen, a side of goyza, and a plate of kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was only about 700ish yen back in 2006ish. who would have figured five years later i'd pay double the cash to have a sixteenth a meal...", 
            "great hangover food. awesome ramen broth. must also get pork belly rice when you're here. it's tasty, fatty, and simply the best. their pork belly rice is even better than daikokuya's! planning to try their kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> next time i'm back in town.",

            "i love my noodle soup and so glad we tried monta.  we tried various dishes like tonkatsu ramen, <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>, pork belly with rice and kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.  everything was delicious.  like many reviewer commented, adding an egg in your ramen soup is greatly suggested.  the menu is fairly small, but i can go there numerous times a week if i live in vegas.  delicious food that won't break your bank.  what's not to love!", 
            "so i was nursing a las vegas hangover (you know, still drunk at 9 am kinda hangover) by lying in fetal position in the back of the car, clutching a gigantic bottle of powerade, and damning myself for my excessive behavior (hey, only in vegas!)\nmy cousin said she that she had the perfect hang over cure.\n\"jamba juice?\" i groaned painfully.\n\"no, we're going to monta.\"\nthe thought of food made my stomach churn.\nwe walked in and were seated at one of the bigger tables. i made it a point to sit next to the wall so i can rest my head. i asked for a hot tea, and alas they serve no hot drinks. sorry, one star off for that one.\ni ordered the tonkatsu ramen. even just the smell of the broth was oh so soothing - i felt my headache fade away with every slurp of the soup and ramen. from my understanding, they put great care into their broth by letting it boil down for hours. it is creamy, salty, and hot. essentially, a perfect cap to a crazy night. the noodles were quite delicious too - it was slightly crispy and went very well with the soup. tonkatsu comes with two pork pieces. you can order extra sides to put in your ramen (i felt like corn that day), but they do charge you.\ni also had a side order of <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, which i thought was very salty. it is good, but it needs something to offset the saltiness.\nthe service was also prompt, and our server was quite cheery and polite.  the boys at our table kept mentioning how cute she was too.", 
            "i love this place, great lunch spot and for dinner too.  for lunch you can keep it light with just a soup so you don't pass out later in the day.  for dinner you can get soup plus some gyoza or <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> (which is the bomb, i love it here)\n\na new thing which is not on the menu is that you can get a mix of the tonkatsu and the shoyu broth, that's what i get.  in addition, i always add corn and chopped onion, and an egg if i'm in the mood.\n\nserver's are very friendly, and they work very fast and efficient. it's not a place where you're gonna chill for 3 hours and hang out, the place is small so people are in and out pretty fast.\n\na little side note:  they have cans of japanese iced tea which i had in japan and never had in the us until coming here.  i love that!", 
            "monta is an authentic japanese ramen restaurant. from the moment you enter its cramped, busy little space with a cheerful greeting from the staff to the satisfied feeling of a bellyful of delicious ramen it's a wonderful experience. the ramen is on-par with the real stuff in japan, and the tonkotsu and miso varieties are especially good. the gyoza and <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> leave a bit to be desired but as this is primarily a ramen restaurant that can be forgiven. the beer is cheap too, with asahi on tap for about $2.95 a glass. all in all it's a wonderful experience and if you are looking for authentic ramen in las vegas this is your best bet.",

            "i love their ramen! came with a couple of friends and my sister. i tried the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> for 6.95 and added a side of kimchee (because me loves some kimchee. yes i do!). i also ordered the kimchee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> as well for $6.95. \n\nawesome execution for both i may say! i loved the texture of the noodle. it was soft, but it still had that firm bite that you take into it. that's how i like my ramen! it also hd a very tender slice of pork in it and a few other garnishes. i loved the shoyu broth. i don't know what else to say! it wasn't salty or overpowering. it was just right. not too salty, and the broth was very nice with the mixture of the meat in it. yay brothiness!\n\nkimchee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> is also of a+ quality. you can taste that nice grill taste to it. the cut o the kimchee was small and so were the small bits of egg which is how i like it too be. so yay kimchee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>! \n\nit's such a good price too so i felt like i got more than what i payed for. the service was awesome. the server was very cheery and upbeat and attentive which i loved. so...yay service! thumbs up for such personal service in such a little place. i just love how authentic japanese restaurants like to keep things small, simple, and intimate. yay japan!", 
            "solid place for good ramen. and the kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> is delicious too!\n\nthere is usually a wait during lunch hours as the restaurant is very small. the service is always friendly and prompt. the prices are a little high for the portion sizes, but it is still a good lunch spot.", 
            "asian people love noodles. i am asian, therefore i love noodles.\n\ni was saddened by our earlier trip to monta where the waitress told us the wait would be close to an hour.  my growling stomach couldn't bear to wait so we settled for someplace else, cough swish shabu shabu cough, and was very unsatisfied. so we decided to give it one more try on my last night in vegas.\n\nthey won't seat you until your whole party is there and luckily the other two people made it just in time.  this is a cozy restaurant which just adds to the ambiance a japanese noodle house.  \n\nmenu: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/upiyurazvkninod1w8kqrq?select=0ivynxxhiyabnfoadj1era\n\ni ordered the tonkotsu- <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/upiyurazvkninod1w8kqrq?select=7-ni-npnmemyeojbnzksug\n\ni thought the ramen was delicious.  you could tell the noodles were \"wendy's\", fresh not frozen, and the garnish were all nicely cooked.  the pork was so tender and fatty and delicious.  you could eat that all day fa sho. \n\nwe also tried the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and the gyoza.  gyoza is top notch, some of the best i've ever had and i had some godly ones in japan..  the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was pretty delicious as well.\n\ni really liked my experience here.  the waitresses seemed to be imported straight from japan, very hospitable and nice.  the food was excellent.  and it didn't break our wallets either.\n\nso if you're asian or not, and you're craving ramen in las vegas, monta is definitely a \"safe bet\".. vegas pun intended.", 
            "went here for a quick afternoon snack before dinner.  beat the crowd, authentic japanese ramen place.  the staff from the all you can eat sushi place at the outlets even stopped by for lunch.  great flavors from the broth and the ramen noodles were very tasty.  we hear the kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> is a must.  didn't want to eat too much as we had dinner at mesa grill.  would definitely go back.", 
            "what a great find in las vegas! initially, i didn't come here with much expectations because no other ramen places i've been to have impressed me as much as ramen dojo in norcal. knowing that the capacity of monta noodle house fit around 20 or so customers, i anticipated a wait so arrived 30 minutes before opening on a friday afternoon. arriving early got me a table right at opening...yay to that! so come early to avoid waiting. \n\nmonta noodle house offers three different kinds of broth but i got a recommendation from one of their regular customers to order the tonkatsu-shoyu combo broth! the standard bowl comes with noodles, bamboo shoots, onions, and two pieces of pork. i wanted the ultimate ramen experience so i added on some extra stuff to spice up my bowl - i added the soft boiled egg (a must for every ramen bowl!), sweet yellow corn and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> (must add - gives great flavoring to the whole bowl). i also garnished my ramen bowl with the togarashi chili powder and sesame seeds! the addition of sesame seeds in the bowl was just perfect =) i have to say the best part about this place is the ramen that they used - the noodles were so soft & the thickness was about the size of egg noodles but with a softer texture. i definitely enjoyed this.they also give you plenty of noodles to fill you up real good! \n\nif you're ever craving ramen in las vegas and can wake up early enough after a night of partying..remember to check this place out! it's located in chinatown so having a rental car is convenient. solid 4 stars for satisfaction and it's location in vegas!!\n\nfyi: i also heard that the kimchee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was also good to try. \n\nhappy eating =)", 
            "before my friends tricked me into going to monta, i thought the only kind of ramen available were the packs for 19 cents, how naive. as i'm sure you've heard the place only seats about 20 people at a time and there is often times a wait, but it's very much worth it. their menu is quite small but everything on there is a knock out. feeling like you can't go wrong when you order is an awesome feeling. i personally order the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with corn and <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, the first time i tired this i knew there was a heaven. it's so savory and authentic, if you ever go, take a spoonful of the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> dip it in the broth and i guarantee your taste buds will be enraptured with a euphoric taste. the price is fairly cheap as well around $15 a person. the waitresses are very friendly as well and always take time to teach me some new japanese every time i go. i definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for something different within a reasonable prince range.", 
            "suffice to say monta has become the next best thing to hit vegas since <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, but why you may wonder did i only give it a 4 star? as you may all have read the rest of the 400+reviews & counting, everyone is raving about the food at monta & the prices, and i definitely agree with all the positive reviews, i mean c'mon you have a menu that would fit in one sheet of paper, how can you mess that one up? they have followed the in n out burger's mantra...kisss (keep it simple st*p*d) less is more, no frills, no guess work, in fact i love everything on their menu so much it is so hard for me to pick just one item! the only disadvantage to the \"if it ain't broke don't fix it\" attitude is that it gets boring, and you might get monta'd out (especially if you are eating there almost every week sometimes two) i guess some good things must come to an end, and as the law of gravity dictates, what comes up, must come down, even if it is the best noodle & chiar su pork in town. with this popularity also comes one downfall....be prepared to wait for a table! especially during the peak hours of lunch & dinner. they open at 11 am and trust me there is a line already forming outside waiting for them to open. this is a sure way to tell that a place is sure to be good especially when it's packed, but what if you are really hungry already??? hmmm bring some crackers with you. keep in mind also that at monta it is first come first serve, you can not make reservations, nor will they seat you if your whole party is not there yet (they frown upon this) monta is suitable for parties of a maximum of 4 if your party is more than that you probably won't sit together or even eat at the same time. the waiting time is often discouraging, hungry people are angry people! it has happened on more than one occasion that we had to go somewhere else because we got discouraged by the slew of people waiting to be seated anplay how pressed for time we already are. so by now you probably figured out why it is missing that 1 more star, me & monta definitely have a love-hate relationship. like in any other relationship, if you fall too quickly, you will fall out as quickly as you fell. so for now or until i crave you again, sayunara monta-san.", 
            "i never considered any other reason to visit las vegas aside from the strip, but visitors rejoice! there is another reason..it's in the form of a little ramen restaurant called monta! fellow yelper vicky l. recommended it to me and i made it my first stop in vegas, right after picking up the rental car.\n\nwe arrived at around 11:45 and got extremely lucky with seats at the counter, because the place filled up quickly by noon with the lunch crowd.\n\ni had the tonkotsu-shoyu and the husband had the tonkotsu. the broth for both were extremely creamy and delicious. if you like things with a bit more flavor, i suggest the tonkotsu-shoyu. the ramen noodles are the thin, angel-hair type which is a nice change from the usual ones we get in sf. \n\nthe egg..how could i forget to order the soft-boiled egg? i'm actually still bitter about that. so please do me (and yourself) a favor and add a soft-boiled egg to your ramen. \n\nwe also smelled the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> aroma from our neighbor and couldn't help but get a small order to share ourselves. it was the perfect portion and hit the spot.", 
            "upon a friend's recommendation, i decided to head over to try monta one night. it was 10 pm and dining options were starting to get scarce. the place was tucked away in a little mini mall. plenty of parking in the lot, but it can be a tight fit.\n\nat this time, the place was still relatively full. we were able to get the last open table. the menu is short and to the point. you can choose from four types of ramen broths, add your toppings, or even add extra noodles. as for other menu items, there was some <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> options and handmade gyozas. we ordered the tonkatsu ramen with charsui, egg, and nori; the tonkatsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> (a bit less rich than the regular tonkatsu ramen) with same toppings; pork belly rice bowl; kimchee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and an order of gyoza. all tasted great, especially the charsui topping. it had more flavor than in other ramen spots i've eaten at. i could've ordered another order of gyoza. \n\nall in all, a surprisingly good spot that i'll visit again. keep in mind, they open till 1:00 pm on friday and saturday, but they only have about 7 tables and another 7 seats at the counter.", 
            "by far only place too go for ramen! growing up in hawaii ramen just about stable food as spam musubi. so too finally find ramen place same style food excited. it has all the same character small place holds less then fifty people, bar area (cool get see them make the ramen), and when the place gets packed line out the door. it soo worth the wait. the timing is hit or miss. they first open in the morning for lunch that time always count on line. the whole small hole in the wall love because look where the restaurant located understand.\n\nthe food all the ramen is good. <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> i die for!! the flavor is spot on the depth nice light broth and depending if order additional topping can be hearty noodle dish. i prefer couple extras. other thing find must really perfect compliment too big bowl of ramen is gyoza. it steamed perfectly then seared off on flat top too perfection and the filling is tasty. the gyoza sauce optional but must only way too have it combine together is divine. \n\nthey other sides i order the kim chee good but stand out is kim chee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. it could ordered big bowl of that if they had it on the menu. =( it not over spicy but just the right amount of balance. they even have one beer offer on tap never think see small the place is never been good one too. i not remember name of it. sorry.\n\nthe service is excellent. all the servers are very friendly and attentive. the prices are really reasonable. it light healthy tasty any time meal! =))) if never been say give it try!!!",

            "went right after visiting the grand canyon. i was sun burnt and sweaty, i needed some comfort food. mmm... ramen. i gave this place two stars because i had better, way better ramen in new york. also the service was not all that. we stood at the entrance for a while then realize there was a book to put your name down. you would think the waitress that kept passing by would clue us in, sheesh, i been to shittier ramen places service was never this bad. that made my experience there so much worst. japanese people are usually so straightforward what is with this guessing game? the ramen is nothing to brag about, the broth is the same salty mess i complain about in most ramen places. one thing thats good though i have to say was their <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. that was delish. yes go to a ramen place and get the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.",

            "as an avid lover of all asian styles of food i was excited to finally try monta ramen since i had heard good things. at first glance it looked like this little noodle shop was going to have a very long wait. however, we did not have to wait too long even with people waiting outside. there are not many seats, but this is not really the place to linger for long. most people seem to leave fairly quickly once they are done. my friend and i sat at the counter and had fun watching the bustling kitchen while we waited for our ramen. the seating may feel cramped for some people, but i really liked the busy, controlled chaos feel of it. \n\non to the good stuff. i ordered the tonkotsu-<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with the regular house fixings and my friend had the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with thin noodles. i was instantly impressed with my choice as soon as i tried it. the broth was slightly creamy and full of flavor, the thin noodles cooked to the perfect point so they were not mushy at all. i found the soup very flavorful, but i had to add a liberal amount of chili oil since i like my ramen spicy. the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> was also very tasty, the clear beef broth had just as deep a flavor as my selection. we both had a can of <mark>Green Tea</mark> to drink, which was a refreshing counter to my spicy soup. my only gripe was the fact that i was not completely full when i left, which is mostly my own fault. they offer the option of extra noodles, which i will surely do next time. the gyoza and <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> are also on the list to try in the future. \n\nanother great aspect is the price. the total bill for two bowls of ramen and two drinks was $18 and change. a great deal for any sit down place. bottom line is that this place is a great option for a fun, cheap meal. i will definitely be going back.", 
            "i'm not a big fan of ramen and this place didn't help change my opinion about it.. monta is a tiny restaurant tucked in a strip mall that seats about 25-30 people.. they serve ramen with a choice between 4 different broths and every bowl comes with char-su, mushroom, and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>.. there are other options that you can add to your noodles for an additional cost too.. the broth was thick and a yellow-milky color which wasn't the best for drinking and the noodles didn't have any distinction that would make them \"the best\" ramen.. we also tried their regular <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and that was probably the only thing everyone enjoyed and would come back for again.. but as for the ramen i think i'll pass!",

            "now that i've come here enough to practically remember the whole menu, i think it's ready for a review. \n\nwhen i found this place (through yelp of course) i thought to myself, \"could it be? a true authentic ramen place that the city i originally resided in devastatingly lacked of? my own little nyc momofuku only a 15 minute drive away?\" oh, sweet baby jesus it could! \n\nbefore making the trip to your next lunch or dinner date here, you should probably consider what day you're going and at what time. this place is small, like 5 tables (2 4-tops, 3 2-tops) small with a couple seats at the bar, and it gets crazy packed! the first time i came here i literally drove by and was like, \"awh hailll noo,\" and drove away. however i will say that if there's just a couple of people before you, just be patient and wait. the tables turn over rather quickly.\n\nwhich leads me to the menu. it's very simple and quick to prepare. if you're going with ramen, they have 4 different broth options: shoyu (chicken), tonkotsu (pork), tonkotsu-shoyu (chicken & pork) and miso. all are priced around 6.95 a bowl. just forget the rest and go with the tonkotsu-shoyu. all ramens are prepared with two slices of pork, bamboo, and chopped <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>. don't forget to add extra ingredients like an egg and <mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark>! if you've never tried <mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark>, it really compliments the broth and makes it extra delicious...order it on the side and try it out! adding in the ingredients is what really gets the meal to be pricier than expected. just 1 egg is an extra $1.75, but it's okay to indulge a little every now  and then, so just go all out with you bad ramen self! \n\nthey have other items as well such as <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, small plates, and cold ramen! i still have yet to try them.. will do an update after my next visit! \n\nthe only negative thing i'd have to say about the ramen is it can get pretty salty, of course you can mention to them less sodium, but i'm pretty sure all they're going to do is dilute it with hot water. to leave it on a positive note, aside from the saltiness the broth is perfection. extremely murky, so you know its packed with flavor and takes overnight cooking to prepare.", 
            "delicious <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. quite possibly the best <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> i've had here in las vegas. as for the ramen, we tried both the pork and chicken broth and while the chicken ramen was very tasty, the pork ramen was a bit too salty for our taste. also, i don't think i'm a big fan of ramen noodle but i will absolutely come back here for the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.", 
            "this is my favorite ramen in town.\n\ni prefer the \"tonkotsu-shoyu\" mix over the other two separate and the miso.  so much flavor...i have no idea how they do it.\n\ni usually add in the egg and a little extra pork to go crazy, and this would be plenty for the avg joe to fill up on.\n\notherwise, i order the kim chi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>...amazing!  this is one of my favorite <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> dishes of all time.  very very good.  if i order this, i tend not to get the extras inside the ramen otherwise i will burst at the seams.\n\nservice is fast...this is a quick bite and go kind of place, so don't expect to stay and converse for an hour after dinner.  they don't rush you, but there are typically others waiting to eat, and the place is tiny, you will feel guilty staying much later than the meal lol.\n\ndo it!", 
            "i didn't realize how hard it would be to find a really good ramen restaurant after moving out of hawaii.  however, monta comes close to filling the void.  monta is a small japanese noodle house in a strip mall in china town.  if you don't like waiting to sit down, get there early as the line usually begins to form before the restaurant opens at 11:30am.  there are a few scattered tables, but i prefer to sit at the bar and watch the cooks prepare the dishes in the open kitchen.\n\nmonta makes tonkotsu ($6.95), shoyu ($6.95) and miso ($7.25) ramen broths.  while all three of the broths are very good, the milky white colored tonkotsu (stewed pork bone broth) has an especially savory meaty flavor.  my favorite is the combination tonkotsu-<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> ($6.95) which tempers the intense meaty taste of the tonkotsu with the salty shoyu broth.  the thin yellow ramen noodles have always been consistently cooked to the just right texture, neither too limp nor too firm and underdone.  the ramen comes with basic toppings (<mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, bamboo shoots, kikurage mushrooms and two thin slices of marinated <mark>Chashu Pork</mark>) however, like all good ramen joints, they have a whole list of additional toppings you can add (for a little extra cash) to make the dish your own.  the combination of flavors and textures soaking in the hot broth goes down well on a cold day.\n\nwe also usually order the pan fried pork gyozas ($5.15 for 6) and a small kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> ($6.95).  the gyozas are excellent and the moist rice has a good flavor.  each table has an array of sauces and condiments that you can add to your meal (rice vinegar, soy sauce, chili oil, sesame seeds, and chili pepper) as well as little jars of crushed garlic and red pickled ginger.  they also serve beer to wash it all down with.\n\nthe service is fast and the food comes out quickly.  so even if you do get stuck waiting in line, it usually moves fast.  and if you are in the mood for good ramen, it is worth the wait.", 
            "my friends and i found this place in one of the las vegas magazines. we opted to try it out. i have been addicted ever since. i have not wanted to write this review because this place is like y secret treasure and very small. there is almost always await. the food comes out very fast it has a limited menu of ramen noodles.  it is awesome. the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> is out of the park good.  the bowls of noodles are quite big and you pay like $7 bucks. you can't go wrong with that.  the wait staff is nice and fast.  i can eat here everyday since ramen noodles are one of my favorite.  it is a bit out of the way for me plus its small and often packed. definitely worth going and checking it out and even if you have never had ramen (the pack for .25 cents in the grocery store does not count) for less then ten bucks its worth it try.", 
            "great ramen place!  been here twice and have been thoroughly satisfied each time.  with how small this place is, i'm not surprised at the wait...even at 10pm at night.  \n\nthe service, though brisk, is also very helpful and friendly.  no one has time to stand around to chat and explain things to you but they try very hard to seat everyone as quickly as possible and they manage to bring you your food quickly and correctly.\n\nhubby and i are purists...we stay with the tonkotsu broth.  the broth was rich and sticky...didn't taste like it was brewed only from pork bones but also from pork feet/hock.  very tasty and comforting.  on our second visit, i got extra char siu.  when the fat from the char siu melted into my broth, it got even thicker and richer.  hey, you say greasy, i say yummy!!\n\nother standouts - takana <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>...all very good!!  definitely going to be a staple for us when we're in lv.",

            "food here is pretty solid.  i've had ramen in la (which is much better back home, and i'm not trying to sound snobby, rather it's just something i can compare to), and the food here is a decent.  \n\n<mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> $(7) and +$2 for egg- slightly above average-the broth is pretty good.  it comes w/ 2 pieces of meat (which is detailed on the menu).  the pork base is pretty thick, so if you are into thick broths this is the place to go.  \n\nmy gripe is they don't give you complimentary egg w/ the broth, so you gotta pay $2 extra (which is pretty steep if you ask me).  i mean, who eats ramen w/o egg?  it's almost required!!!  i also would've preferred my egg to be a little more runny.  part of the egg yoke should seep into the soup (but still retain it's shape).  the egg i got was slightly hard when i got it.\n\npork belly rice ($5.50 for a large, $3.50 for small) - average.  the pork belly is extremely sweet!  i think they use too much sauce or something. the sauce almost over-powers the taste of the meat.  i'd pass on this next time.\n\ni was able to try my friends takana <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and it's delicious.  10x better than the pork belly.\n\ntips:\n-not good for groups.  restaurant is small, maybe seats 20 people inside.   parties of 4 or larger might have trouble sitting.\n-egg isn't complimentary w/ the ramen, so you gotta spend $2 extra =(\n-no garlic press available", 
            "every bowl of ramen comes with two slices of pork chashu, <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, kikurage (black mushroom), and bamboo shoots. there are four different types of broths:\n\n1. shoyu- soy sauce-based broth, pretty salty and nothing spectacular, average\n\n2. miso- miso-based broth, salty but not overwhelmingly so, pretty run-of-the-mill <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>\n\n3. tonkotsu- pork flavored broth, savory, and has a creamy texture. the soup's thick consistency is due to boiling pork bones, collagen, and fat for a long period of time. some people find the thickness of the savory broth distasteful and unsettling. if you're not a fan of a thick soup, i would skip this one. definitely one of my favorite broths to get here.\n\n4. tonkotsu-shoyu- best of both worlds, the tonkotsu and shoyu work well to balance each other out. the shoyu waters down the tonkotsu so it's not as thick and the tonkotsu adds a bold, fuller flavor to the shoyu. this is definitely monta's signature ramen and a must try.\n\nadditional toppings: some of the toppings are noticeably more expensive compared to other local ramen joints that already include these toppings in their ramen.\n\nadditional notes: \n*if you order extra noodles (kaedama), it comes in a separate bowl usually in the middle of the meal. it's been heated up so your noodles are still delicious even if your broth is not as hot as in the beginning. \n* there are two types of noodles to choose from: thick cup ramen style noodles (that definitely taste nothing like those horrible cup noodles) or a thinner noodle similar to chinese egg noodles (not the noodle that usually comes with wonton noodle soup). i definitely prefer the thicker noodles; the thinner ones tend to be overcooked easily and soggy. \n*there is a $10 minimum on credit cards. bring cash if you don't plan to spend more than that.\n*they will not sit you at a table unless your whole party is present.\n\noverall:\n\nso far, monta has the best ramen in vegas. (still need to try anime ramen, and fukumimi though.) it's just the thing that hits the spot on a cold chilly night when you need some warming up. \n\nservice varies depending on how busy they are. bar seating may get uncomfortable for some but that's how traditional ramen houses are: small and cramped. seating is very limited so anticipate a wait if you're coming during peak hours. \n\nthe consistency of the ramen sometimes varies as well. sometimes the chashu is over done, resulting in a dry piece of meat that doesn't have that heavenly gelatinous soft layer of fat that melts in your mouth. also, the noodles sometimes come out too soft if they've been sitting there for a while. once in a while, the yolk of the hard boiled egg will be completely solid, with none of that ooey gooey goodness. these hiccups happen rarely, only when they're extremely busy and it's during peak hours. portions are decent sized for a regular person. if you're a gluttonous fatty like me, it's better to share <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> (which is quite delicious) with a buddy.\n\noverall, despite the ridiculous wait sometimes and food consistency issues, monta is definitely a must try for locals and tourists.",

'cause i like to scrape off the fat under the pork skin. lol. another thumbs up!\n\nthe last dish which was the kimchee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> ($6.95) was yum, though i still think it could be done with slightly less oil.  unlike the rice bowl-sized portion that it often comes in, this <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> came in a rounded square plate of the size that could've been a meal by itself.\n\nservice\nservice was friendly, efficient and brisk without making us feel rushed. but we did devoured our meal super fast and left quickly as a courtesy to the long lines of people waiting.\n\ntwo thumbs up for this place.\n\nanecdotal comments & observations (mostly rhetorical)\nwhy is it that most ramen house has the most 'house rules' posted on their outside window? no outside food. no outside drink. no tacos?

            "i never liked going to eat ramen, but the more places i try, the more i love and appreciate monta. \n\nthis place is very small, and sometimes the wait can be a while, but the service is actually really quick. i've tried every flavor, but my favorite would have to be the tonkatsu with corn. the corn just puts it over the top! my boyfriend is usually a die hard miso fan, it's pretty good, i don't love it, but so far he likes monta's the best. \n\ni don't ever order <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> at restaurants, but this one time i did and it was actually pretty good! it had a lot of flavor, it reminded me of my mom's. the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> is delicious too, but i wouldn't go there for that. overall, monta would have to be my favorite ramen spot!", 
            "ramen house. that's exactly what this place is, no frills just ramen with a few sides (<mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>/gyoza items on the menu) monta is truly a place that focuses on the ramen.  tonight i had the shoyu basic ramen and didn't need to add anything to it.  i'm still a ramen newb so hearing tables next to me adding extra pork, extra noodles etc made me realize you can customize your own ramen bowls, but just the basic ramen as is is just fine.  this is good comfort food and beats your top ramen like during your college years. *there will be a wait and this place is small, but definitely worth it! **the hot tea comes in cans cold or hot.",

            "i'm not sure what else i can add that won't echo the other 700+ reviews listed for monta, but the legitimacy of the food here can be proven by the 30+ minute wait in the dead heat of a vegas summer.\n\nmonta is tiny and maybe seats about 50 people-pretty sure the max occupancy sign inside the restaurant said 70, but they'd be pushing it. the service is quick and no frills but friendly. the menu is simple-there are four types of ramen and a variety of appetizers and alternative dishes like kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, gyoza, cold noodles and a <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>. ramen comes with add ons like seasoned egg (so good), mustard greens, scallions, extra pork belly, corn and butter. \n\nthe broths are rich and flavorful and it's hard for me to pinpoint a favorite, but if i had to pick the tonkotsu-shoyu would probably be it. the noodles have that perfect ramen texture-chewy and slurpy, in a good way!\n\nbecause of the size of the space, it can be an intimate dining experience with complete strangers particularly if you sit at the bar. but it's also one of those places that solo dining isn't awkward and can actually be to your benefit when there is a line out the door.\n\nmonta is your spot for legit ramen with no pretense!",

            "hey monta, you make some good ramen, just saying.\n\nit took me some time to finally try this place. for one, i didn't know of its existence until after it was open for some time, and i had a hard time finding it. it is inside of a plaza where i had a hard time locating it, but you just have to make sure you make the turn into the plaza or the little street next to the plaza.\n\nmy friends that have tried monta beforehand liked it enough where i had some expectations for this place. it didn't have to be rated g-a-f, but it had to be tasty. the first time i came, i just got a bowl of their tonkatsu ramen and i must say, i was one happy guy afterwards. the noodles were pretty good, their egg made me happy, their pork melted in my mouth, but the broth is what impressed me. the broth was probably my favorite part about the meal. needless to say, i finished the whole bowl, soup and all! i was really happy. \n\nthe next few times i came, i started customizing and ordering different things on the menu. i added more noodles the next few times, got some of their <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, gyoza, added some corn to my soup, just customizing things to the point where i was happy! their <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was pretty tasty. the kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> may not be for everyone, because unless you like kimchi, you may not like it. adding various things to your ramen makes it takes a lot better and funner to eat since it has more color and just the feeling of being able to customize your food just makes it that much better. \n\nif you want to try some ramen and you're in the area, i highly recommend monta. the only downside is that the restaurant is fairly small and during peak hours, you should expect a wait. people get turned away from places that have waits, but if you think about it, why do they have waits? it is small, but people keep going back because the food is delicious, it's as simple as that.", 
            "while visiting las vegas i was doing research on ramen restaurants on yelp and kept reading about everyone who had a positive and delicious experience at monta ramen.  today i made the trip with my brother.  we got here about 10 minutes after they opened and found the last remaining table.  the place was already packed.  after looking at the menu i ordered the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> which is a rich pork broth with two slices of melt in your mouth pork with wood-ear mushrooms and scallions.  i added the nitamago which is a seasoned hard-boiled egg.  this meal did not disappoint.  it came to the table within 10 minutes and was a great looking bowl of ramen.  very savory and fresh.  we also had the gyoza  which is a pan-fried pork and vegetable dumpling.  my brother ordered the takana pork-<mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.  this rice was a nice addition to our ramen bowls.  \n\njust a note:  as our ramen bowls were delivered i looked up and noticed that monta ramen must have a lot of fans because the little doorway was filled with people waiting to eat but the line also went out the door.   knowing what i do now about how delicious this ramen is i would have gladly waited outside for my turn to enjoy this bowl.  \n\nmonta ramen will definitely be on my list to visit the next time i come to las vegas.  can't wait to bring my wife here.  very affordable.  i recommend.", 
            "quick cheap and good.  just the way i ilkes it.  this place is tiny; the seating is limited, so they can't seat you until your entire party has arrived.  once seated, however, i had a surprisingly generous amount of space -- didn't feel crowded like i do at some places.  on the recommendation of a friend, i had the kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and pot-stickers.  i liked them both.   i was a bit leery at first because the odor from kimchi made just about every other way is a real turn-off for me, but i had no problem with it in this case.", 
            "yummy! ramen noodles! the broth is sup@ delicious. if you like minchin, the have an awesome dish of kmchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>!\nif you have small children they welcome the challenge to win them over with their house specialties. ask the wait svc for the winning dishes...some clippings of news articles are hung up by the door which also informs you of what's good!\none important tip...if you see that it's packed you must go to the podium and sign in. \nand fyi it is a very quaint place (small) seats are limited. and prepare to be face down in a bowl of something wonderful!", 
            "first time trying ramen in las vegas and came to this highly recommended hole in the wall spot. but to my husband and my disappointment the ramen was mediocore. he had the tonkotsu and i had miso. we both thought it was too salty. however we shared a kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and it was delicious! \nwe have much better ramen spots here in california.", 
            "as soon as you walk in - sign in! haha there's always a wait for this place.  (but if you're in a hurry to get back to work or wherever there are multiple of good restaurants you can go to in that same complex). so with that statement, it's the type of place you order--- eat--- and leave... you don't want to be the jerk holding up the wait :p \n\none thing that really caught my attention was how the chefs were dipping the bowl into hot boiling water before making your order to keep your food hot even longer.  i like to enjoy every bite of my food so by the end of my last bite my soup was still warm :p ( but i'll have to admit the last time i went they didn't dip my bowl ) \n\ni've tried all three <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> on different occasions and all were good :) i think the kimchi is my favorite.  as for the  gyoza, it's pretty delicious and crispy.  \n\ni've tried all soups and i'll have to say i'll stick to the pork broth with thin noodles and of course adding some <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> and egg to that - call it my usual order :)",

            "came to vegas for vacation and my friend kept telling me that i must try this place out.  i am from out of town so i cant really tell you where this place is at since i took a taxi but it seems like the chinatown of vegas.  it seems to be sorta hidden in the back of the shopping center but just look for the white sign.\n\ngot here around 12pm and there was a slight wait (nothing compared the wait when we were leaving).  sat down and the friendly waitress took my order: <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with corn and also the small <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> (my friend said i had to get it no matter what) and yes i know thats a lot of carbs.\n\n<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>:  my ramen came out with extra chasu and with no corn.  the waitress quickly realized this and immediatly gave me some corn on the side and didnt charge me for the extra chasu (kudos to her to rectify the situation).  the broth was very good and not overly salty.  i consider this one of the better ramens that i have eaten.  but the thing that stood out the most to me are the noodles.  wow! this has got to be one of the best noodles ive eaten at any ramen joint and i have been to many in ny, ca and hawaii.  many places forsake the noodles and focus too much on the broth and chasu but very very good noodles.\n\n<mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>: this was the dish my friend kept raving about and keep telling me to order.  i am not a huge <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> person but it was pretty darn good! i devoured it within minutes of it coming out and didnt even leave a spec for my friend.\n\nvery good place i will definitely come again when i go to vegas.", 
            "the cure for a las vegas hangover is ramen. and with all the raves and reviews monta ramen was worth a visit. upon arriving, there was already a crowd outside (it opens at 11:30). luckily, the bar had two open seats for my friend and i.\n\nthinking with our appetites, we began the order:\n\n2 <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> (this is what they're known for)\n1 gyoza (it's gyoza and i was hungover, so give me a break)\n1 kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> (once again, we were hungover!)\n\nafter taking the last bite and having to unbutton my pants, i looked at my friend and gave him the approving nod, which summed up our experience.", 
            "i went to the one on spring mt & decatur location and man.. that place is so small! so many people were lining up and i felt so clusterphobic! i still stayed and waited because i wanted to see why this place is so popular! anyway, after 20 minutes of waiting, me and my party were finally sat. customer service could be better. i understand its busy, but if you work there, that's just something you know you have to deal with especially if its a popular place. the food was good. ramen.. delicious. <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.. delicious as well!  overall, it was a good experience!", 
            "got here a little before opening and already a line had formed (at least 15 people deep).  pretty cramped inside, with about 6-7 tables and counter seating for 10.  food took a while to come out, and a big reason why was there was only one person cooking the noodles, prepping the bowls, and plating/garnishing (with one person taking care of the rice items).  the waitstaff would just stand and wait for the food to be ready.  it could have been more efficient (and thus quicker), but maybe they were limited by the size of the kitchen.  oh well...\n\nthe ramen itself was just okay, with average-tasting broth and average noodles.  i ordered the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> with the wavy noodles, and some <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> and <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> for the kids.  not bad overall, and service was good, but i prefer fukumimi ramen to this place.  but mad props to that multi-tasking cook, he sure was fun to watch!", 
            "big drop-off since the last time i dined here, which was probably a year ago when i came here with some friends and let me say that my friends and i  liked this place so much that we literally came here 3 days straight!!! i raved about this place so much to my girlfriend back home in austin, so the expectations from us were pretty high coming in on a monday evening around 7 o'clock. the wait time was about 20 min., so it wasn't too bad and the restaurant was pretty full. so i ordered 3 of my fav dishes i had last time to share with my girlfriend. we had <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> w/ ajitama (seasoned egg) and corn, kim chi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, and cold noodles with sesame sauce...so\n\n<mark>Miso Ramen</mark>- broth was a lil salty and luke  warm, cold corn (which prob made the broth luke warm), the noodles were stuck together in a ball shape, so that was obvious it wasn't boiled long enough. \n\nkim chi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>- was very wet and was obvious drenched with a lot of oil\n\ncold noodles- were a bit sour and visibly covered with way too much sesame sauce.\n\ni really don't understand the big drop off in the quality of taste and food and it saddens me to just give monta 1 star ( star for good service) which seems harsh, but when you get food poisoning that causes your stomach to ache and many trips to the restrooms. how could you consider to go back...", 
            "we ate here twice in 3 days! the first time we actually came to eat at the snowflake shavery for dessert, but noticed the crowd milling around monta and decided to throw our name on the waiting list. since we had our baby in tow, we weren't exactly expecting to wait it out. however, the woman working at monta was so incredibly nice, she save us a table and made it as comfortable as possible for the baby, even helping us store the stroller in the back! now to be honest we weren't incredibly hungry after the wonderful shavery but we managed to still enjoy my tonkotsu and <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with the egg and my wife the black garlic oil flavored kuro ramen. i've definitely had better egg in my time so next time i'd try some other add on.\n\nwhile the food was good, the service was what stuck in our minds that first night. nicest wait staff ever! we also vowed to take my noodle loving 10 year old nephew and my sister when they rolled into town the next day.  \n\nso today we went around lunch time, and longer line so again we hit the snowflake shavery first! while waiting, we saw the flyer that they opened a monta in henderson! we'll definitely try that next. this time the wait was longer and we worked up our post-snow appetites...and score! the nephew and sister loved it! also i tried the takana <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> this time which i thought was great. just the right amount of spiciness and with the mustard green, unique from chinese <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. my better half had the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> this time, which was indeed lighter than the tonkotsu broth. i think i preferred the tonkotsu but it was good to have tried them both.\n\nnext stop will definitely be the one near my parents house on eastern. thanks yelp for the recommendation!", 
            "one of the best ramen places in us. it definitely goes into top three of our ramen list. \nit's a bit crowded at dinner time and you might need to wait like 15 minutes. but once we had our food, all the waiting is worthwhile!\nit's a small place and we sat at counter. once you got seated, the service is pretty fast. my bf ordered tonkotsu soyu and i got tonkotsu.\nthe soup base if very thick and rich, very yummy, feels like a good stew from good pork. and the noodle is just right, not too soft and not too hard. try eat noodle dipped in soup in one bite, it's heaven. :) i almost finished the whole bowl. the bowl is cheap like 6.95 - 8.95. you can add extra topping if you want. it only comes with chashu and a bit veggie for my meal but the good taste makes me happy enough.\nthey don't have other sides or appetizers. as far as i remember, only gyozer and some <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. if i go lv later and want some asian food, that'll probably be the first item popped into my mind.", 
            "i like this place, but have come less over time because of the crowds you have to fight through to get a table here. if you come on a weekend, expect to wait 30-45 min to get a table since they don't have very many. enjoyed it a lot more the 1st few times i came here but have been less impressed lately. seems like as it's gotten more crowded, the food quality and service has gone downhill.\n\ni've had the ramen, <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, and <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> here and nearly any choice you get is pretty decent. sometimes you may get a bowl of ramen that's a little saltier than others...i'm sure this is directly related to how busy they've gotten. hopefully they will look into expanding or adding another location to alleviate the crowd issue here.",

            "we came here on a saturday afternoon around 1220 and it was super packed. we waited for an hourish but it's also because we had a party of 9. this place is right next to raku and a korean restaurant. \n\nwe ordered a bowl of tonkotsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with an extra order of egg, kimchee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, and gyoza. let's actually start with the ramen which was the most disappointing dish of the 3....however it was better than i expected. i have recently lost my hope for ramen so this place was actually better than i expected. the broth was a bit too salty for my taste but the chashu was really good. the noodles weren't bad. \n\nthe gyoza was really good. it was crispy and the inside of it was juicy and perfectly seasoned. the skin wasn't too thick so it had that perfect crispy to it when you bite into it. \n\nthe kimchee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was the shiitttt. no joke. i think i'm gonna have dreams about the kimchee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> to be honest. it was moist and tasty. so much seasoning to it and there's little kick to it from the kimchee. there are restaurants that makes it super dry but monta made it perfectly. obviously it is oily, but it is seriously bomb-diggity good. it was sooooo good that we ordered a to-go right before we left and we ate it at midnight. we ate it cold cause there was no microwave in the hotel but it was still so damnnn good.\n\ni would seriously come back only to get the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>...i'm really curious about the takana <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> too. service was actually really good and i actually gave monta a 4 just because of the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>...or else i would probably give it a two stars. \n\nthe lesson is...you come early to avoid the wait, you get the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, and be happy with life.",

            "during a foodie excursion to vegas, we wanted to eat something delicious, yet budget-friendly. after pouring over a few years' worth of vegas weekly magazines, authentic japanese ramen at monta ramen made the cut. the restaurant was crowded, but we scored seats! we split an order of kuro ramen and kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.  the slurp-worthy broth was full of flavor and quite excellent, and the noodles were chewy and delicious. it was my first time having kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and it was love at first bite. by now, i've probably eaten my weight in <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, but monta ramen's kimchi variation was kickass. monta ramen for the best ramen in vegas!",

            "me and my friends actually ended up here because the line at oyster bar was too long and we were starving. i personally am a ramen fan in general so i like trying new places, my other friend and her hubby are not big ramen fans, but luckily, after coming to monta they have found a renewed interest in ramen.\n\nwe all started with a glass of beer, pretty cheap at about $3 but they are not pints, i think more like 10oz-ers? still it was a refreshing way to start the meal. \nshared the pickled greens <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and the pork belly rice bowl. <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was cooked well and flavorful, the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> was even better. the fatty pieces of pork were cooked perfectly tender with their greasy goodness seaping into the rice underneath. \n\nfor ramen i got the half pork half chicken broth and added an egg. the chicken broth is supposed to be a little less rich but mine was still a pretty thick broth. not that that's a bad thing, thick as in thick with flavor but sometimes i prefer a less rich broth because it can get very filling. so depending on what you like, the full tonkatsu broth would be richest and most flavorful and a the half and half would be a lighter version. noodles were cooked perfectly. \n\nthe place is typical small japanese style shop, they have a list for you to write your name on and wait. the waitresses do a nice job of clearing the tables and getting everyone seated as soon as possible so even though we had a few parties ahead of us the wait wasn't too bad for lunch hour. it does get a little hot inside though, so be warned for those coming in the summer months.",

            "monta is by far the most amazing ramen house in las vegas! i stumbled upon it and decided to take my wife and two kids (4 and 2) to give it a try. last week we tried another ramen house down the street from monta and it was nowhere near as good. we've had ramen in japan, hawaii and california and monta is the closest to what you can find on the streets of tokyo. \n\nwe started out with kimchee and the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. they were both amazing! the kimchee had an amazing taste and the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was probably the best i have had! i had the spicy <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>, my wife had the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> and my kids shared the cold noodles. all had amazing flavor with robust noodles and tender meat. the dishes were bursting with flavor! my kids pounded the cold noodles and the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.\n\noverall, monta is a must try when in las vegas. this is going to be a regular spot for us. oh, the place is really small... so don't expect to have a big party and get in right away. you'll wait 20-30 minutes before you get in. enjoy!",

            "this place was such a good find. never had been here before and we just searched up a ramen place to try (since our favorite ramen joint closed down) and i would have to say that monta ramen is probably our new favorite. their menu is small and simple, which i like because then i don't have to sit there forever trying to decide which one i want to order. i was able to see what they have and decide what i wanted quickly. we ordered the tonkatu shoyu and added an egg (extra $1.00-$1.50) and it was soooooooooooooooooooo yummy! we also ordered their <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and gyoza. all was delicious. \n\nthe only downfall i have is that it is such a small restaurant that many people enjoy going to, so if you're there on a busy night.... most likely there will be a wait for a while and you'll be stuck waiting outside.

            "called here on a tuesday around 8p.m. and found out there's not wait. i was finally able to try this place that has lines every time i had passed by. \n\n<mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> - 3 star. it was good, salty, but nothing super extraordinary. i didn't find it to be amazing, and have definitely had better ramen elsewhere...in cali and tokyo. \n\nkuro ramen- 3.5 star. this was richer in flavor and had depth that was different compared to the tonkotsu, but i sure wasn't raving about it either. \n\nkimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>- 2.5. i was looking forward to this since people had mentioned that it's quite amazing. nah. i shoulda known better ordering kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> at a ramen shop for one, and a japanese restaurant. \n\noverall it's a 3 star. an a-ok for me. i don't think i'll be back here again. oh, but i am proud that the food here got me to drink two big glasses of water.", 
            "this place reminds me of men-oh in little tokyo in the settings.  walk in to a small entry way, stools greet you at the bar table and you turn in to a small room with tight seating.  it's packed and you will be fortunate if you are seated right away.  at the same time, both times we were there we only waited 5-10 minutes so they do turn them pretty quickly.  orders are taken promptly by pleasant wait staff, and your meal is turned around quickly as well, within 10 minutes.\n\ntheir ramen are overall the best i've had - not greasy, fresh, with nicely firm noodles - although from pure taste standpoint i probably prefer hiromaru (rip).  their <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> is really good, as is the chashu don.  these are more like side dishes from size standpoint, but probably too much for one person to have a ramen and one of these.  maybe 2 ramen dishes and one will work for two... i say that because they're really good and you should really try them.\n\ngreat atmosphere, bustling crowd, and great food all equal to the best ramen joint i have been to yet.  it's probably more like 4.5 stars, but i want to differentiate between this and other 4-star places i've rated so i'm giving it a 5.\n\ntable-for-1 factor:  yes, and there are many who partake.", 
            "i get a craving for monta nearly once a week...nah who am i kidding, it's more like a daily burn. if i lived closer to their chinatown location, i would seriously consider a 5x a week lunch adventure, transporting me back to japan with an enveloping nostalgia of aroma, atmosphere, personality, texture and umami. oh man, the umami. the wait (and there always is one) is well worth it. whether it's 10 minutes for lunch or a 30-60 minute wait for dinner, your olfactory glands, umami super sensors and full warm belly will thank you profusely. \n\ni am a massive fan of the basic tonkotsu, always with a nitamago (soft boiled, soy sauce-seasoned egg), with a spicy iteration thrown in the routine every so often. i am also slightly obsessed with their kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, on which i pile on pink pickled ginger. they should probably start charging me for the pickled ginger, as i definitely take advantage of the free-for-paying-customers-with-the-notion-it-will-be-used-sparingly jar of the condiment/dish enhancer. $2.95 asahi on tap?? give me a couple! \n\nmonta is incredibly well priced, intimate in a truly authentic japanese way, lively, wicked efficient (in the manner they move customers in and out), clean and so consistent. i will be back, in approximately 15 minutes! damn spring mountain traffic!", 
            "i love this place so very much. i'm not a big ramen fan, so i begrudgingly went along with some friends for my first visit. i now go willingly, without any hesitation. i don't get ramen, but i do get the pork <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, which is some of the best i have ever had in my life (and i have lived in the bay and la). it's flavorful and rich, and so amazingly priced (~$6?). i could eat it everyday. all my friends love the ramen, so they're obviously doing something right there. they also have pretty great appetizers as well.\n\nbe aware that the sitting room is really small. i think my parent's living room is about the size of the whole space. as a result, there can sometimes be a really long wait. the longest i'm ever willing to wait for cheap food is 30 minutes, and i've waited that long for monta. but there have been times where my wait has been less than ten minuted on a friday night. so it really depends on when you get there, and luck honestly. i will say that it is a terrible place for large parties though. it's always been such a hassle coming here with more than four people. if you want to try it out, i would recommend going with only one other person, maximum two, for your first visit. the shorter wait will make your experience much more enjoyable!", 
            "this place is very much... alright.\n\ncame here because a few friends raved about it and it looked like it had amazing reviews, came half an hour before opening time just to make sure we wouldn't have to wait too long. luckily my group of about 20 just barely fit behind a few other couples. very small place that seats less than 30?\n\nthe ramen wasn't bad but it definitely wasn't all that great. i'm from la so i guess i probably am lucky to have much more options but you would figure vegas has the best of all worlds. compare to anything else i've ever had around la, this was much more salty, portions were a tad bit smaller, other than the saltiness not that flavorful. menu here is small but some japanese restaurants tend to be so that wasn't too big of a surprise.\n\nyou definitely have to be a pork lover because that's pretty much all they have, if i remember right they have approximately four different ramen choices, and a few other side dishes like <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and gyoza.\n\nif you are a local i'm sure this may be as good as it gets? but if you're from out of town only try this place if there is no wait. totally not worth a wait.", 
            "awesome food but be prepared for a long wait. \n\ncame here based on the awesome reviews. showed up a little after 1pm on a weekday. we waited easily more than an hour. this place is super tiny, but the turnover seemed as speedy as it could be. it was cold outside and there was no shelter from the cold. i would never wait to eat at this place during the heat of summer!!! impossible!!! \n\nwhen we finally got seated, our orders were taken promptly. surprised to find a little cubby to stash my stuff under the bar!!! clever!!! i loved my sapporo on tap. sitting at the bar gave us a bird's eye view on how the food, especially the pork roasts were prepared. the logs of pork roasts were seared on something that looks like a huge george forman grill. oh!!!!! if you could only hear the sizzle of the hot grill & the smell the wonderful umami flavor of roast pork!!! the roasts are then placed into an oven and cooked until tender. this pork is then cut into nice generous slices to garnish the ramen or cut up into the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. i take the time to mention what i witnessed because you feast not only with your palate but also with your other senses as well. i love that they roasted the pork & didn't just boil or steam them to oblivion. this is probably what makes this ramen house so yummy...the care in how the pork is prepared. \n\nwhat we ordered...\n\nspicy <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>...the most popular ramen on yelp. also highly recommended by those drooling to get in. i hear that corn & butter add-ons are a must!! \nthe broth was delicious, the ramen noodles were cooked perfectly, and the ramen was garnished with nice big round slices of roast pork. in most ramen houses, the chasu is often half fat... although there is nothing wrong with some good fat. these slices were mostly meaty. yay!!! \n\n<mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>...also popular on yelp, but the pork in my bowl wasn't crispy at all. good, but not as good as the....\n\nkimchee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>....surprisingly very good!! i am usually skeptical to order \"korean\" items at japanese restaurants and vice versa, but it tasted so good!!! the big juicy pieces of pork made the rice so decadent!!! yum!!!!\n\ni didn't take off any stars for the wait...they can't help that they're a fabulous popular place!!! :d", 
            "i look forward to the kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> every time i come here. fast and friendly service. you may have to wait a bit before being seated although it is worth the wait every time. just make sure your whole party is present or else they will not seat you.", 
            "visited this small restaurant based on popular review. indeed, this restaurant is so popular that you will have to wait in the line. another reason why you'll have to wait is that the dining room can probably fit about 30 dining guests at each time, half of the guests will need to be on the bar table. me and my wife are lucky to get a table after about 45 minutes of wait with about 6 parties waiting in front of us for dinner (by the way, you will need to check yourself in as there are only 2 very busy waitresses). the menu was very simple - noodle, <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> or some small variety of specialty. there are flyers if 2 today's special pasted on the wall, which we ordered - spicy <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>. we also ordered a <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> bowl (basically some fish eggs with sesame over small bowl of rice). i would not say it is super delicious, but it is really worth the price. the ramen was very flavorful (can be a little salty). you also have the option to add another noodle if you still feel hungry after you finish the bowl - i think most people will do since there was actually not much noodle in it. for us, the bowl of rice does the job. the rice is nothing special and almost had no flavor. i just seasoned the rice with the broth of the ramen i had. overall, not bad, and it is definitely worth the price. but if you don't have much time in vegas, you can safely skip this place as it is not worth that much of wait, unless you really want to save money in your trip.", 
            "authentic ramen noodle, not those milky <mark>Butter</mark> broth that is overwhelming after two sips. their gyoza was amazzzinggg, filling is pork+veggie. does not smell or taste like old meat with tons of ingredients to mask it. \nkim chi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was so flavorful , not too salty either. however, it is a tad bit oily for me, but what's <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> without a little oil huh? \nthe place is small and have about five small tables and the rest of the seatings are located at the noodle bar( sits about 8 people) \nwe were so full and only paid 34 bucks!!(2\nramen noodles, <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, gyoza)\n\ni strongly suggest trying out this place asap!",

(i had the black garlic tonkotsu one). great <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. when i'm back in town, i'm coming back. this is the real thing. i shouldn't be surprised because it was recommended by someone i know to be a real food sophisticate.",

            "very impressed and certainly will be back.  there are so many asian restaurants in the area, if you aren't local or know someone here, you could easily overlook this place.  while it is small, it seats more than you'd expect and they also have an l-shaped counter with additional seating when you come in.  always a good sign when you are greeted warmly, there's a sign-up sheet for waiting, there are kids with their folks, and regulars since the waitresses knew some of them by name. \n\nwe had the tonkatsu ramen and the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>, with corn and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>.  the noodles were perfect, chewy, and the broth was top notch.  we also had the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>.  don't miss these!  and the food does come out fast from the kitchen.  compared to the bay area, their prices are pretty reasonable and you get plenty to eat.\n\nservice was excellent.  if you don't like to wait or are a true vegetarian, probably not the place for you.  we got there at 5:30pm on a sunday and the place was just 1/2 full.  by 6:00pm, it was packed and they had more than a dozen people waiting.  i'm guessing if there's a line somewhere, it's usually a good bet the place is worth the wait.  it is located in a strip mall so there is parking, but there are also many restaurants as well.  they also called a taxi for us when we were done which was awesome.  i'll be back for sure.",

            "went on sunday 9-20-15 around 12:45 pm.  this is located on the <mark>Corn</mark> of spring mountain and decatur in the same shopping center as raku, kung-fu tea, big wong, and curry zen.  \n\nyou go inside and write your name on the list and they'll call you when a table's ready.  we put our name on the list and went over to kung-fu tea to wait.  when we went back over, they had called us and crossed our name off the list so we had to put our name on the list again and wait all over again.  oops.  but when they called my name they had a high chair ready for my boy and i thought that was pretty great.  \n\n$11.78 got me a bowl of <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> and a small order of <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.  the ramen was pretty great but dat <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> tho....dang it was awesome.  i absolutely loved it. when i go back (and i definitely will) i will just ask for a trough full of that <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.  i only got 4-5 bites before my baby stole it and stuffed it all in his face.  it is a strange type of rice and i think it has pork belly in it.  \n\ncheap, delicious, eats.  woohoo! as good as it gets!",

            "came here for lunch and it was super packed! i wasn't aware there was a sign in sheet so i was kinda just standing there until someone came behind me and signed in. thankfully he said i could go before him anyways! wait was only about 5 minutes, but since there were no seats available i had to wait outside in the heat. definitely not a place where you have an intimate meal, but i spent 45 minutes there without feeling they were rushing me out the door.\n\nthe food was pretty good. i got the tonkotsu shoyu, <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, and <mark>Green Tea</mark>. the ramen soup and noodles were very good, although i didn't like the meat. it says it's pork but it tasted like turkey and a mix of something else so i didn't eat it. the rice was good too with soy sauce but was a bit too eggy for my liking. \n\nservice was good! was asked twice if i needed refills, check came quickly, and just about everyone said thank you as i left! i would definitely come back just not get the pork or whatever that meat was.", 
            "don't let the lines sway you this place is worth the wait!  the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> was an eye opening gastronomic experience. after years of ordering various phos and miso soups this broth blew every other out of the park. it's ruined us forever. with a creamy consistency that rivals milk or melted butter this stock made from pork bones, fat, and collagen is heaven in a bowl. add to that some amazing thin noodles (you can order thicker noodles if you desire) and throw in the basic toppings of <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, two slices of chashu, bamboo shoots and kikurage mushrooms. omg it was to die for!  there are many additional toppings you can order to customize and make it perfect for your tastes. \n\nwe also ordered the gyoza and the regular <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. after reading all the reviews we had to give them a try. the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was good, but not fabulous. perhaps there's a difference if you order the takana <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>?  the gyoza were great. thin pillows stuffed with vegatables and pork. hot and delish!  \n\nlucky for us, we're in town for a couple of weeks so we'll definitely be back!",

            "yes, there's always usually a wait. sometimes you'll get lucky and you'll just wait a few minutes and sometimes you'll wait till a group finishes their meal to get sat. it's a really small space. but oh man the ramen is delicious! i usually get the tonkotsu shoyu with additional egg and corn. yesterday i tried the kuro ramen which had black garlic oil and it didn't disappoint. the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> here is also a must. the service is usually fast and friendly. my only complaint is that once in a while, the broth is too salty. oh and yeah don't expect you're gonna sit around and chat with your group after your meal because you'll get some serious death stares from hungry customers waiting to get sat lol", 
            "asked a friend where to meet for lunch and they picked out this place. it was 4 of us and it took about a hour to be seated around 11am on a weekday. wouldn't recommend coming here during busy hours with a larger group because of limited seating. \n\nordered the special on the spicy ramen and it was very good but needed a bit more spice in my opinion,  also the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was really good. would come here again if they didnt have the wait.", 
            "i love their ramen. it is to die for. also, their beef belly <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> taste like heaven. get their tonkatsu ramen with the flavored egg topping. trust me.",

            "first time here and man, that food was soooo good! perfect food for this cold weather! the only reason this place is short one star from 5 is because of the size of the restaurant. most ramen places are pretty small but because their food is awesome, they shouldn't shy away from expanding because the food itself sells. the staff is very quick and efficient, they try to get people in as fast as they can and they are pretty quick with the needs of the customers! we ordered the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>, <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>, gyoza, <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and kimchee. everything we had was tasty and the pricing is definitely reasonable!!! will be coming here again.. hopefully it won't be as busy and hopefully they can expand the restaurant size in the future.. but count on us as future regulars!",

            "i am no connoisseur on japanese food or ramen, but this place really has me addicted lately.  i found it while browsing reviews on yelp, and yelp was right on target!  \n\nthe place is quite small, seating maybe 30 people, including the bar.  during lunch, there is a wait to get seated.  the cooks are out in the open, similar to the sushi bar trend.  i've always had good service, although sometimes there is a little bit of a communication problem... my english isn't so good sometimes! ;-)  but that's never annoyed me because i love the soups here.\n\nso far i have only tried the tonkatsu. i ordered with extra pork, egg, and (i know, shame on me), butter.  you can also order extra noodles if you aren't a big broth eater.  the tonkatsu is, i believe, a pork based broth.  its thick (for a broth), a little salty (but not too salty), and very flavorful.  the pork was cut very thinly, and was so juicy, almost <mark>Butter</mark>.  i barely had to chew it.  now, i am no expert in homemade noodles or anything, but the noodles for me were quite good... filling and tasty.  \n\ni can't wait to try the other two main ramen dishes they have.  i know now isn't the perfect time for hot ramen, but i'll make an exception to that rule for this place any time!", 
            "its official; i made my quest here today and i'm already craving round 2. it's gooooood!\n\nfor those not in the know, i've been a ramen-iac since i was 12 and first learned how to cook myself a cup o' noodles. i spent several summers as a gawky teenager watching cartoons and gobbling noodles like a fiend. over the years, and through thousands of packets of freeze-dried noodles i slurped onward. kimchi flavor, maruchan, nissan, yam-noodles, dandan mien and instant jjangmyun, my adoration for the comfort of a big steaming bowl of chewy noodles drenched in broth steadily growing. i've tried ichiza's, shuseki's and making it myself- this tops the list. ichiza's was close, but this place will most likely be my number one noodle-spot this winter. \n\ncoming up to the restaurant, i wouldn't have thought it was open if it weren't for the neon sign saying so. there's plenty of parking and it's right across the street from the shopping center with shuseki. \n\ni sat at the bar as i was having lunch alone and wanted to see the action. one chef would feel out the proper amount of fresh noodles per bowl, roughly a fistful, and drop them into the boiling cauldron of water. on the other side was a large kettle of broth steaming away, ready at a moment's notice. in the background several men worked on various other tasks involving the pork and other side dishes. at the front of the bar was the vegas weekly magazine that mentioned them, as well as a good-luck kitty, which i thought was cute.\n\ntoday, i opted for the miso. at first i couldn't decide- i'd tried the miso flavors at other establishments, so should i continue the trend for consistency of comparison, or deviate and expand my horizons further. i opted for the miso with nitamago, or egg. it didn't take long before my noodles were politely presented to me.\n\nthe broth: super porky. no msg taste at all. rich miso flavor-seemed like it was all white [sweet] miso. great depth of flavor, with an intense, <mark>Butter</mark> mouth feel. hit all the right notes and was intensely satisfying. tastes like homemade.\n\nnoodles: al dente egg noodles. chewy and lots of them! much better than anything instant with great slurpability. \n\nthe egg: beautifully cooked, creamy and custardy, it added an entirely new level of complexity to the broth and had an exceptional texture. ichiza's eggs are close, but the one i had here was supple and gelatinous, cooked slowly and well. it was easily the best egg i've had in a restaurant this year. \n\npork: my bowl came with 2 slices of succulent, fall-apart tender pork. i could pull bite-size pieces off using my chopsticks. thousands of times better than the terrifying piece of pork we were served at shuseki. the pieces were thin, but i was satisfied with the amount i was given. you can always order more if you're willing to pay the additional charge. \n \nextras: the ramen comes with bamboo shoots, a few pieces of mushroom and a mountain of <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>. you can also add minced garlic paste, benishoga [red pickled ginger], sesame oil, furikake mix, sesame seeds, what looked like vinegar & a couple of other options are available either through the menu or asking your server.\n\ni found the portion large enough for a late brunch, tiding me over for hours and powering me through a trip to the dog park with 3 rowdy puppies. i'm extremely satisfied and happy with the meal i had here, and i bragged to several of my friends. i'm looking forward to trying the shoyu flavor next, as well as trying the spicy greens with it. \n\ni'll be back very soon!", 
            "destined to find yummy ramen where ever my travels takes me...lol. a little removed from the strip for the tourist but not too difficult to find.  definitely a busy place at around 7ish on a weekday night. lucked out for a table as there are only 5/6 depending how they're arranged for size. wood benches, chairs, stools, tables and wainscoting lined the restaurant.   there's also l shaped seating for around 10, bar style, around the kitchen area.  the restaurant later filled up with people waiting outside, so be prepared to wait during the typical eat times.\n\nmenu was simple as there was only 3 types of ramen you could order, miso, shoyu, tonkotsu and a couple of rice dishes.  decided to try the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> ($6.95) with toppings (ranges from $0.50 - $1.50) corn, kimchi, and kaedama (extra noodles).  the broth was tasty and not too salty and the pork was flavourful with the melt in your mouth taste.  the corn was not too <mark>Butter</mark> but the kimchi could of been better. i was expecting more taste from the kimchi, as it was toned down from other ramen places i've tried in the past as well as korean restaurants. the extra noodles was served on the side and was fist sized.  do this if you're extra hungry...i was comatose after finishing this.  the noodle was a little skinnier than expected but had the right consistency and texture. the gyoza was not too my liking (didnt finish) and i can live off dumplings! the exterior was grilled too long aka burnt and the 'insides' was semi cold like another yelper had mentioned....hmmmm...im guessing store bought?  i imagine them being frozen and put on the grill not long enough but on extra high heat!!! (i know this how??? i make them when i'm home...lol)\n\nyes, i'd come here again for a quick bowl of noodles but thats about it.", 
            "attention: this is not the ramen you ate in college, it's about 1000x better.  the tonkatsu i had tonight was delicious, and the pork they serve with it was flavorful, <mark>Butter</mark>, and fell about when you tried to pick it up, in other words, perfect.  the noodles were done perfectly, to what most would consider al dente, and held up really well to the broth.  i got a side of kim chi to go with it, and they paired really nicely.  it's a small restaurant in the back of a strip mall in chinatown, but if you don't mind the drive and maybe missing it once or twice, i would say you need to go here at least once to try good ramen if you haven't had it before.", 
            "for a place that's doing so well and getting to be extremely popular, you think they'd have more capabilities to upgrade their ac system or even turn it up a few notches... \n\nbut nope! located in las vegas, over 100* in the summer and serving nothing but boiling soup and an open kitchen that lets heat from the stove circulate throughout the extremely small dining area...monta is a great place to dine in the winter, but in the summer, you'd have to eat it with struggle. i'd hate to give it less than 4 stars because of its environment, since the food is delicious, but monta is one of those places where it's really a diamond in the rough, and it will eventually affect the way you feel about the meal overall.\n\nthe restaurant itself is very tiny. it sits up to around 30 people max and because of its popularity, it is always packed. they have about 10 items on their menu only, with 4-5 of it being their specialty noodles. the broth here is superb, especially their miso flavored ramen. it is very rich and <mark>Butter</mark> in taste. the soup is not salty at all, and their noodles are extremely fresh and chewable. it is almost uniquely sweet when you bite into them. the char siu pork that comes with the noodles (japanese pork with soy on the outer skin and slow bbq) is delicious. the meat is thinly sliced and fatty at the same time. when you bite into it, with the combination of the <mark>Butter</mark> taste of the broth, you will get an almost guilty sensation of rich flavors. it is really worth the experience, if you can deal with the heat. \n\nmonta gives you the option of adding extra items into your ramen, each of it having a charge from like .50 to $3 ... the only thing that is worth the extra charge (since i ordered it all before-- not worth it!) is the boiled egg, butter, and extra char siu. everything else will just overwhelm your soup and by the time you're done eating half.. the soup will be soggy and floating with stuff in it. \n\njust beware though, the standard price starts off at like 6.95.. but  if you get carried away with the extra sides... your ramen can come out to about $14 without you even realizing it!", 
            "this place is amazing!!! coming back to visit my family after moving away from vegas, my brother decided to bring me here. being in the navy and travelled around, he said this is the most legit ramen house he's found since being in japan. not having left the country since i was 5, i took his word for it.\n\nboy, was i impressed! it's so worth the wait for a spot in the tiny hole-in-the-wall!\ni'd been craving ramen and haven't had any luck finding a good place to try in the bay area, this really hit the spot! i got the shoyu-tonkatsu broth which was rich and savory. i love that you can add different ingredients to personalize your meal. while my brothers opted for nori, i chose mustard greens. the sour crunch of the veggies balanced well with the salty, <mark>Butter</mark> broth. it appealed to my filipino-taste buds in just the perfect way.\n\ni wasn't overly-stuffed with my meal - i couldn't imagine ordering a double noodle portion!!! - but i was definitely satisfied. this is one of the things i'll miss about vegas, besides my family.",

            "wow, this is the best ramen i have had in vegas.\n\nkeep in mind the place is super tiny, maybe seats 20 at most...and a/c doesn't really work so it is like sitting in a ups truck(not that i've ever been in one but...u get the idea)\n\nwe were seated almost right away even though there were ppl waiting in front of us(perhaps they are in large groups).  the lady who seated us was really nice, later on there was another waitress who brought our ramen to us, cute and also nice(i think it is probably the owner and her daughter as they look alike), of course the 5 stars isn't based on the looks but honestly it does help a little(even without it, the ramen itself still deserves 5 stars).  we tried the #1 <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> with thin noodles, it was very rich in flavor, but our favorite was the kuro ramen(the tonkotsu broth with black garlic oil), it was superb! and the chashu was not only <mark>Butter</mark> but also taste like it was grilled first!\n\nthere is also a shave ice place in same plaza which is also very good, and a foot massage place(make sure you yelp for the one with 4 stars, not the one with 1 star... :p)\n\ni hope they open one in la soon!", 
            "our last day in las vegas, we decided to go to monta ramen for lunch. monta opened at  11:30am, and there is a line already!! we saw people lining up outside, after waiting for a little bit, my friend noticed there is a sign up sheet inside!!! damn it!! they should leave the sign up outside! oh, there is no sign saying manto in front, but you can't miss it with the long line outside.\n\nanyways, after about almost 1 hour wait, we finally got seated at the bar ... which was fine, we get to look at the chefs.\n\nfood! we ordered a large pork belly rice bowl to share - the fatty pieces of pork were cooked perfectly, so tender, <mark>Butter</mark>, just goes perfect with rice! i really miss this!\n\nhubby ordered the basic <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> with egg added - broth is very bold and tense, and what i love the most is not overly salty!\n\ni ordered the kuro ramen with egg added on the daily special board - black garlic oil ramen, i really love it. egg was perfectly soft boiled, runny center. i do wish that it was thick noodles, this is just personal preference :)\n\nmy friend ordered <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> with egg and corn added - looks amazing!!\n\nvery good and authentic ramen place!", 
            "this ramen place is pretty popular in vegas so i thought i would check it out. \n\nthe place is pretty small, so the wait was a little long. but when we were finally able to order i got the spicy tonkatsu ramen with an added egg and seaweed. \n\nthe soup was a little <mark>Butter</mark> and heavy for my taste, but still not bad.", 
            "monta ramen is one of the best ramen spots in las vegas. is it the best in town? maybe...\n\nmy order i always get is the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> + extra chashu + nitamago + corn\n\nsometimes i order gyoza, sometimes <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, sometimes both. depends on how hungry i am.\n\neverything is done well and if you need more heat just add chili powder.\n\nwhat sets monta apart from the rest is their chashu. i don't really fuck with pork but their chashu just melts with good <mark>Butter</mark> & rich flavor. the broth can get heavy but their must be an egg in every japanese hot noodle dish.\n\nthe spot is like how a ramen spot should be. limited spacing with more seats at the bar than tables. you get in and get out (if no wait time) in 30 mins...\n\nwhen it comes to japanese food i'm a harsh critic because the times i've been to tokyo and my mom's cooking\n\noverall it's maybe the best in town as i've converted non ramen lovers into lovers of ramen...if you haven't been go for sure!", 
            "amazing every time! great ramen, quick, and friendly service. chashu isn't the most <mark>Butter</mark> i've had, but the broth is dericious. will be back!", 
            "authentic ramen noodle, not those milky <mark>Butter</mark> broth that is overwhelming after two sips. their gyoza was amazzzinggg, filling is pork+veggie. does not smell or taste like old meat with tons of ingredients to mask it. \nkim chi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was so flavorful , not too salty either. however, it is a tad bit oily for me, but what's <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> without a little oil huh? \nthe place is small and have about five small tables and the rest of the seatings are located at the noodle bar( sits about 8 people) \nwe were so full and only paid 34 bucks!!(2\nramen noodles, <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, gyoza)\n\ni strongly suggest trying out this place asap!", 
            "loved it! checked it out friday around 7:30pm.   small place, very busy but was able to accommodate a part of 7. long wait but totally worth it.\n\n<mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> was delicious. pork broth was <mark>Butter</mark>, thin noodles were fresh and pork was tender. added an egg and corn which made my bowl complete!\n\n<mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> was yummy and great for sharing. \n\nalthough the place was packed and super busy, the 2 waitresses managed to get things done! they took our orders, refill drinks, take empty bowls and plates and clean up for the next party quickly and efficient.\n\nwould love to come back next time we are in town!", 
            "for the longest time i've heard this place was the go to place for some ramen. well finally decided to give it a try instead of ramen sora where i usually went and had one of the best bowls of ramen in my experience. i think ramen in vegas in general is just super cheap compared to northern ca, so i definitely give this place a +1 on that ($8 ramen). one of the thing that surprised me most was having the minced pork over rice at a ramen shop. that i was not expecting. \n\n<mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> was what i ordered. it did come with some good flavors, but personally i think i liked the minced pork over rice more than i liked the ramen. the flavors were pretty good but they seemed like a flavor i'd get at any other ramen shop. broth was <mark>Butter</mark> but felt like it was made me more thirsty than anything. i got this other noodle that i didn't like but my friends had the original type of ramen noodle. i didn't notice that they paired different noodles to different flavors or that you can request to have them changed, so that was a fail on my part. add an egg and some butter corn and that makes anything close to good. add some mouth melting tender pork and you should be good to go. \n\nplace was kinda crowded and we had 9 people so our wait was a little long. there's a nice little boba joint next door, so get some boba and wait in the ac. \n\ntips: \n1) get the minced pork over rice\n2) add the egg and pork \n3) enjoy", 
            "thank you, vegas for sharing this amazing ramen with us.  this ramen made our entire trip.  we walked two miles from the strip to get there, and it was worth every step!  blissful and stuffed, the 2 mile walk back was perfect to burn off all the magnificent calories. \n\nit is in a little strip mall and is quite crowded no matter the time of day (we were there at 2:30 and waited about 20 minutes)  you write your name down on the clipboard right inside the doorway and when a table is ready they call you.  most people wait outside, there are a few benches to sit on.\n\nthe interior is very clean, neat, and cute.  there is a counter and a few small tables.   it is not a place you want to come to if you have a large group. \n\nthe service was very pleasant.  the waitstaff was extremely kind, patient, and attentive.  \n\nwe ordered some of the regular <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and it was the best we have ever tasted.  it was extremely fresh, well seasoned, and downright delicious.  we also ordered the gyoza which were cooked to order and impeccable. \nonto the ramen, i ordered the tonkotsu which is a pork based broth where the bones are cooked in the broth to create a creamy, thick, almost <mark>Butter</mark> texture.  it was extremely flavorful and very rich.  my husband got the combo shoyu tonkotsu which is the same pork broth mixed with a soy/chicken based broth.  this was a little less rich and was also close to perfect.  the noodles were fresh and the perfect texture.  there are tons of add ons and extra seasonings at the table so you can make the broth exactly the way you want it! \n\ni would recommend this establishment to anyone visiting the area.  it was amazing."

            "hakata style ramen originates in northern kyushu.  it is in my opinion the best ramen you can get, with maybe kurume being at the same level.\nstart with a thick pork broth made with boiled pork bones to release the collagen into the soup.  next, add some of the best noodles i've ever tasted.  throw on some basic toppings like roast pork, <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, mushrooms and bamboo, and that's your standard bowl.  they also have one with miso.\nthe menu here is very simple.  there are the two bowls of ramen, and additional toppings, then there are a few small rice dishes (mostly <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> with some topping), and pot stickers.\neverything is amazing, be it service, staff, taste, decor.  there is not a good enough rating to describe this place.\ncome on in today, and look for them next to raku, and say hello to your new favorite restaurant.", 
            "still going here every week if not more often.\nthey finally have a sign up so they're a bit easier to spot.\nanyway, i'm glad everyone else is liking this place.  i don't know why the bad reviews on the gyoza, because it's right up my alley.  and yes, they do use different noodles for the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> versus the others.  the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> is hakata style, and is known for the very thin, very delicious noodles.  they cook theirs a little more here than they do in hakata, but it's still great.\nanyway, having tried the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>, i'd say give this one a shot too.  it's their tonkotsu soup with miso added to give it a rich nutty flavor that really sticks to your ribs.\ni also have to recommend the chahan (<mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>), it is super peppery and delicious.  just the way i remember it from my highschool days in japan.\na second note.  anything you don't like on your ramen, let them know.  i keep going with picky eaters (1 vegan, others just picky), and they've made a vegan kimchi chahan, as well as bowls of ramen with extra this, no that, whatever you ask for.\nas always, they're eager to please, and definitely worth seeing, so help monta stay busy, and maybe even expand.  i would love to see more of these guys.", 
            "nice place!  they are always eager to please their customers.  the food is tasty.  i love the hiyashi chuka, kimchee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, and an iced <mark>Green Tea</mark>.  \n\ni feel like such a fatty after walking away each time, but it's damn good food.  will visit again and again.", 
            "after stumbling through various japanese restaurants that serve decent bowls of ramen, i've finally found a place that specializes at it. in fact, it's pretty much all they serve. their menu reminded me of an in-n-out menu: you either order a <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> or a <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>. if you don't want ramen, there's <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and some basic japanese apps. not much in terms of variety. but, if this is what you're in the mood for, they do it great.\n\ni started off with an order of gyoza for an app. simple stuff and what you'd expect. nothing to write home about. then, came the steamy bowl of <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>. the broth was a real winner here. a lot of places that i have tried never really got the broth quite right. this was one place where the flavor really hit the spot. even though it's a scorching 100+ degrees outside, a routine stop for a bowl of ramen here is worth having. next time i drop by, i will probably give their <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> a shot.\n\nmonta is a tiny, quaint little place, though not very crowded when i went. it started out empty when we walked in, but started filling up as we were slurping up our noodles. i wouldn't expect a wait for a table, but i could see it happening if this place picks up in popularity.", 
            "one saturday afternoon, i finally had a chance to try ramen @monta noodle house. right after i entered the noodle shop, all the employees were shouting loudly in japanese usual expression in turn: irasshaimase, irasshaimase! i felt so welcomed :p \n\nso, i decided to try the 'tonkotsu' with boiled egg since it was one of their special dishes & highly recommended by the server. she brought some of the minced garlic and pickled ginger with it.  without hesitation, i put a little bit of garlic in the soup just because i love garlic so much :)  i could totally taste of very rich and milky pork bone broth in my mouth. the noodle was very thin and straight. one of the toppings that really stands out was the sliced pork, the 'chashu'. it was very tender and soft. \noverall, i was happy with the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> but, i liked the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> with lots of bean sprouts @shuseki little better. if someone wants to try richness of the broth & the amount of oil they want, the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> is the one... \nnext time, i still want to try their kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> & cold(chilled) noodle(hiyashi-chuka). \n\non my way out, i heard, \" arigatoh gozaimashita!\" once again, they were thanking customers and i was pleased with the service @monta!!!", 
            "on my first visit to the monta (ellis) noodle house i had an inclination that it was worthy of four sexy stars. after eating here, i'm quite certain of that.\n\nyour not going to drive past it on spring mountain in case you think you missed it because it's all the way in the back of the plaza.  \n\nif your a rameniac like myself.  this place is the new kid on the block and a must-try.  we know las vegas isn't exactly a hot-bed for ramen but monta meets my needs.\n\nthe <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> was delicious, it's probably one of the best in town. we waited 15 minutes, but definitely worth the wait. although many have first timers have said it wasn't worth.  monta wouldn't stand a chance vs. some ramen spots i frequent in the bay area. but all of my friends and they were all asian said it couldn't be better.  the kikurage was yummy as well.  but stay away from the specials like the kim-chi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.  but who the hell goes to a ramen house for <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>?  duh!", 
            "allright, i went back for lunch today to monta. it was 3:45 in the afternoon, and it wasen't busy like last sunday. therefore, it wasen't as ungodly hot and stifling inside as it was last time.\n\ni ate the whole bowl of ramen again. i have begun to really grasp just what makes the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> so good. it's savory and not overly salty. in fact, it's un-ramen-like in that regard. (ok, i'll admit to normally eating a shoyu-based one many many times) the broth is actually a bit creamy (very addictive) and the stuff inside the bowl is tops.\n\ncan i tell you how much in love with the marinated boiled/almost soft egg in it, aka nitamago? it's so damn great! if you like hardboiled or softboiled egg, you'll love it i guarantee.\n\ni have to try the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and their gyoza. they smell very very good, but i have to have more people with me to get it all eaten! when the weather cools down, i'm going to be here lots!\n\nbtw, they have a very funky restroom!", 
            "yes. if you sit at the bar, there is a shelf underneath where you can stow your purse, baby, or other personal belongings. yes. \n\nalso the counter is made out of this beautiful hunk of nice solid wood. what is that? walnut? it's nice. \n\nso anyways. this place is located next a korean bbq and raku. makes me wonder if it's the same owner as raku? \n\nthe ramen is okay. anyone that has had the standard of ramen (daikokuya in la, hello?) will tell you that monta isn't as good, but for vegas, it'll do. \n\nmonta only does three kinds of ramen: tonkatsu, shoyu, and miso (around $7-8). all are decent. the menu has short descriptions of each for us gaijin. there is also a short list of accouterment like egg, butter, corn, and spring onions available for nominal additional costs. i recommend the butter. it is exquisite. \n\nthe very limited menu has gyoza, <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> (around $3), kim chi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> (not very good). sometimes they have specials written on the white board on the wall. \n\non the front of the menu, there's a short history of ramen. the reading lists the source: ramenlicious.com\n\nthey have a few beers including asahi and something domestic, maybe bud. my friend got a $3 glass of asahi. it was like a double shot of beer.  \n\nthey do not make their own noodles, at least not on the day we came. \n\nthe unisex bathroom is practical and has a weird interior design nonsensicalness to it. meh. \n\nthe joint is pretty small. a bar that accommodates eight and maybe five four-tops. \n\nall of the staff is japanese. one of the cooks looks hardcore prison cook with the burns all up and down his forearm. heck yeah. \n\nthe restaurant is small and will possibly never have air conditioning. but there is a plethora of fans running and the back door remains open on the hottest of days. when some one opens the front door to leave or enter, the joint turns into a wind tunnel. \n\nthey're only open til 11p. i'm sure they could stay open later and do just fine with the late night belligerent crowd. \"whoo, i'm so wasted! i need lots of calories in my system. whoo!\"\n\nwatch tampopo. \n\n\n* off the strip, non-casino", 
            "it's on my monthly must have menu.   <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> is the best out of the 3 ramen selections on the menu imo.   creamy savory broth, perfectly cooked noodle and the tender chashu (pork) make it very addictive.  this is not something you can cook at home.  the pork has the perfect amount of fat makes the ramen rich and flavorful without being greasy.  you can tell it takes a lot of time and effort to prepare the pork.  their other side dishes (<mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, gyoza, pork belly...) are all very delicious as well.  service was ok and bareable as most of the small scale asian restaurants. \n\nthe downside of the restaurant:\n--the broth is a bit saltier than i'd prefer.\n--i'd prefer more chashu (pork) pieces per ramen order for the price they're charging\n--sometimes they run out of extra chashu.\n--it's always hot in there.  they need to invest some money in ac.\n--i felt like i was being ripped off a little when i went there the first time because it seems a little overpriced for the portion and the ingredients.  however, now i'm totally addicted and have no choice cause it's very yummy and they don't have many competitions.", 
            "i saw that there was a new ramen shop in las vegas so i decided to check it out.  from the outside it doesnt look like much and the inside is no different.  you would say its just a hole in the wall place.  they have a very limited menu since the kitchen is so small and thats understandable.  \ni ordered the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>, gyoza and the small <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.  i was amazed by how delicious it was.  i am japanese so i like a good ramen from time to time.  the gyoza (potstickers) was home made.  trust me i have eaten enough store bought gyozas to know the difference.  oh! and the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was very tasty as well not mushy like other places.  each grain of rice perfectly seperated from eachother..  \nwith that being said the only 2 turn offs is the price.  althouggh a lot of the pricing is dead on correct.  there are few items on the menu that i feel is over priced for the amount they give.  another thing is the temperture inside the restaurant.  i guess they dont have any ac so they use a fan to cool down the room.  after eating hot soup i started sweating like a horse.  \noverall i am satisfied with the product and i will be going back to eat again... that's for sure...", 
            "yum yum yum! \n\nmy friend's cousin recommended this place to me. she has family in vegas and this is one of her favorite hole in the wall spots.\n\nwhen i first walked in, i wasn't too sure about the place. no air conditioning, just a fan. the place is super tiny. we ordered the <mark>Chashu Bowl</mark>, <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, and <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>. \n\nthe pork in the <mark>Chashu Bowl</mark> and <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> melts in you mouth. it is that delicious. both had very good flavor. the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> also was very good. all the food felt like it was home-made and in a very positive way. it brought back the comforts of home.\n\nwhen i am back in town, i will for sure do my best to visit this place.\n\n i really wish there was a place like this in san diego.", 
            "finally got around to visiting the latest addition to ramen houses in vegas - monta noodle house.  conveniently located on spring mountain, right next to the super busy raku.  (smart business choice i would say.)\n\nthis place is bare bones - as in minimal tables and a bar, so don't come with a large group.  their super simple menu gets you in and out fast!  (a couple who came in around the same time we did had ordered, gotten their food, finished, paid and left by the time we were eating ours.)\n\ni went for their most popular dish - <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> ($6.95).  the main component is the broth, which is made up of boiling pork bones, fat, and collagen for hours.  this results in a cloudy white broth and would usually have the consistency of a thin gravy.  it automatically comes with two slices of char sui, takenoko (bamboo sprouts), kikurage (type of mushroom), and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>.  their char siu (barbecued pork) definitely isn't like the chinese kind, but definitely tasty.\n\nthe husband went for the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> ($7.25), which is ultimately bean paste blended with the pork broth giving it a richer flavor.  this was also good, and quite filling.\n\nwe also shared a regular order of the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> ($5.75).  it sits on a bed of rice, with fresh scallions and pickled red ginger.  i adore pork belly and the next time i come here, i'm going to order a dish of this all to myself.  it's fatty and good.  \n\na side dish we added on was the <mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark> ($1.50).  you can have this on the side or in your broth.  it's pickled mustard greens that may or may not be to your liking.  it's adds a different texture and taste to your ramen.  other toppings you can add on included nitamago (seasoned hard boiled egg), corn, butter, kimchee, and more char siu or <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>.\n\nthere's only one other kind of ramen they offer here - shoyu, which means soy sauce based.  you can also add extra noodles for $2 more if you save your soup and ask for \"kaedama.\"  other dishes available are gyoza, <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, kim chee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, takana <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, cha siu bowl, and <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> (marinated polluck roe).\n\nservice was good.  with two waitresses, they keep the flow of business going great and refilled beverages as needed.  it's not the best place to loiter with the limited seating and all, but definitely a great place to grab a quick bite and go.\n\nupdate!  \ni returned the following month for my own bowl of the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>.  this time the pork belly was sliced thinner, which wasn't to my personal preference.  guess it depends on who is working the kitchen that day.",

            "last week i ate at monta four nights out of seven. i don't think i'll ever get tired of their delicious ramen - only three different options, but with many toppings available. and if i do, i'll move onto the kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> or <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>. the gyoza are pretty meh though. i won't get those again. \n\ni'm so glad there's finally a simple, authentic japanese ramen spot in vegas. it's small, it's hot and it's usually crowded. like the best ramen places in l.a. i used to drive the five hours just to get a bowl, now i can hit up this place between trips. huzzah.", 
            "this charming restaurant offering the best ramen in vegas is located two doors down from raku in the seoul plaza on spring mountain, and could be one of the smallest restaurants in the city. monta is actually so pea-sized that if you come during peak times you'll almost certainly have to wait before you can sit down. don't let this be a deterrant, just keep it in mind before you go, and get there quickly before even more people find out about it.\n\nhalf of the restaurant is an open kitchen, so your dinner music consists of the clanking of woks and pans accompanied by the chatter of the waitresses, cooks, and other patrons. you can sit at the bar if you really want to be part of the action, or if none of the five tables are available. though the vibe is nice and busy, the waitresses are sweet and won't rush you through your meal.\n\nthere are three types of ramen to choose from; tonkatsu (rich, cloudy, almost creamy broth); shoyu (light and delicate soy sauce based broth); and miso (somewhere in the middle of the other consistencies and tastes like...miso). the shoyu and <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> come with chewy, thicker noodles which i much prefer in texture and taste to the thinner, less al dente noodles that come in the tonkatsu (you can sub if you like). all three varieties of the ramen cost around $7 and also come with chasu (tender, roasted, fatty pork), scallions, kikurage (mushroom), takenoko (bamboo shoots), and scallions. you can then customize your ramen with little extras that include perfectly coddled egg, butter, more pork, and my personal favorite, takana, or pickled <mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark>. these don't cost a lot, so customize away. also, be sure to add some of the fantastic accoutrement residing in your condiment tray such as pickled ginger strips and minced garlic.\n\nyou won't find much other than ramen on the menu, just a handful of appetizers and sides. of these i've had the gyoza ($5.95), which were excellent one time but not cooked correctly another, and <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> with takana. the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> is almost as good as the ramen, so if you aren't in the mood for soup get this instead. another plus is cheap beer ($2.50 for domestic).\n\ni can't think of any other meal i'd rather enjoy on a cold day than a steaming bowl of hearty home-made soup, so i plan on going to monta frequently this winter. if it continues to get even busier, however, i may be taking it to go in a perfectly packed parcel. i brought ramen home for my husband once and was amazed at the care put into ensuring the soup would be just as good at home as it is in the restaurant. the noodles were wrapped in their own little pouch, waiting to be cooked until they reached our stove, and all the other ingredients were individually wrapped to keep them in their peak state. attention to detail really separates the boys from the (ra)men.", 
            "if anyone read my review on the ramen restaurant in anaheim recently, i am so happy to announce that the wonderful ramen experience there has been found at monta!\n\nthe one thing that made me fall in love with the other restaurant's ramen was the melt-in-your-mouth chasu.  monta has just that.  their ramen is delicious, the meat is wonderfully soft and flavorful, and their <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> is do darn good.  i could eat four orders of their <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> in one sitting!  \n\ni'm glad that i found more traditional ramen in vegas--finally!  monta is one hell of a ramen restaurant.  i believe that i'm retiring from the other ramen places in vegas and sticking with monta from now on.  if you haven't tried it and were looking on yelp for some assistance as to whether or not you should--you should.\n\ni fall for noodles made with love, and monta serves a bowl of it every order they fill.  if i could serenade food, i'd ask monta's ramen and chasu to marry me.",

            "man, oh man!  the tonkatsu ramen was sooooo goood!  it was a cool day in las vegas and what better way to warm up than with a big bowl of ramen.  very tasty rich broth.  the ramen noodles was cooked al dente.  the pork slices were actually slices of belly pork and when you touched it, it kind of melts into the broth!  oooooh, delicious!  i had my ramen with the boiled egg.  there were condiments on the table and i put some of that pureed garlic into my soup to give it an extra garlic kick!  \n\nwe also ordered one <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and a gyoza appetizer.  yummy!  all items gold stars!  \n\nthe restaurant is tiny with 4 tables of 4 and 1 table of 2 and a l-shaped  bar counter, facing the open kitchen.  you can watch the cooks make the ramen in front of you.  the wait staff are all very polite.  turnover is fast as people come and go all the time we were at the restaurant for lunch today.\n\ndefinitely will come back to monta noodle house!", 
            "overall, i'm giving this place 4 stars but the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> deserves 5 stars by itself.  i loved the flavor of the soup and how the noodles were cooked just right.  my brother and bf were hesitant to go because they've had not so good ramen before but both of them loved the ramen they ordered (tonkotsu and shoyu).  my brother loved it so much, he went again 2 days later.  i'll definitely be going back again and again for the ramen!  and next time, i'll try the extra toppings..but it says a lot about the flavor of the soup when i loved it plain the way it came.\n\nso why the 4 stars?  we also ordered kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and the dumplings.  the dumplings were ok, nothing special about it.  it came slightly burnt and were all stuck together.  the kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was ok too, but more sour than the normal ones i've had.  \n\nstick to the ramen and you'll love this place!",

            "we ordered the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> and <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.  i did enjoy the soup but i felt the noodles were a bit al dente.  i've had better <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, it just had tons of chunky onions in it.  \n\na quick fix to my ramen craving in vegas.", 
            "finally! a very good ramen joint in vegas. this place is much more the real japanese ramen joint than the (now defunct) togoshi ramen.\n\nmonta is in a small strip mall on sprint mountain rd, just west of decatur. it is very easy to miss as you go by. and the shop is very small, with only four 4 place table, 1 2 place table, and about 10 counter seats. they only accept cash so beware.\n\ni recently learned of this place right here on yelp and had to give it a try. like others on this forum, i grew up eating fantastic ramen all over japan. and have long been searching... i was elated when santouka came to the states and even more ecstatic when local joints like orenchi (cupertino, ca) that are very much like the ramen i used to know in japan... started to pop up.\n\ni'd like to preface this review with the fact that i like tonkotsu, thick chijirimen (wavy noodles) usually, so i am usually biased towards that. monta has 4 basic types of ramen flavors: tonkotsu, shoyu, miso, and new (at least it said new today) tonkotsu shoyu which is a combination of the tonkotsu and shoyu broths.\n\ntonkotsu, of course, is pork based broth. the shoyu uses chicken broth (according to monta), but i also detected some dashi (fish based) in there as well. tonkotsu, and tonkotsu shoyu uses thin straight noodles. shoyu and miso uses the thick wavy noodles. each ramen @  $6.95 comes with 2 slices of char shu, kikurage (woodear mushrooms), memma (seasoned bamboo shoots), and chopped <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>. there are other toppings available as mentioned in other reviews, along with kaedama (literally means \"replacement ball\") extra noodles.\n\nkaedama is usually ordered as you go, not in the beginning. this is because if get it at the same time as your ramen, then the noodles either go cold, or get overcooked. this is one of the reasons why i do not like places that have a \"large\" size. by the time you're half way through, the noodles are too overcooked. i commend monta for doing the kaedama the right way.\n\nanyway, i was @ monta today, thu, at 2 pm, and the place had a waiting list 8 deep! it took us abobut 20 minutes to get seated, and as we got seated, the wait line even got longer. ok... my expectations are way high... but be cautious... this, after all, is the only ramen only joint in vegas....\n\ni ordered the tonkotsu shoyu with nitamago and extra char shu. my wife had the shoyu with nitamago. we also had gyoza. in the kitchen, there are basically 2 guys preparing the dishes. one guy that does the ramen, another that does the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and others. and with the packed house, the service was slow.\n\nbut when the ramen finally came, i was not disappointed. despite my doubts, the tonkotsu shoyu had a wonderful balance and marriage of pork and chicken broth. my wife's shoyu, i believe due to the chicken stock, had a very mellow aspect to it which also gave the tonkotsu a very mellow and non-overpowering flavor. i finished the broth to the last drop, including my wife's shoyu/chicken broth.\n\nthe noodles... my thin noodles were not overcooked, and about just right when my ramen came out. but because of its thinness, by the time i got half way through my ramen (and i'm a relatively quick ramen eater, beating my wife by a good 10 minutes :-)) was way overcooked and mushy soft. next time, i will see if they will cook it less (katame, or as i do at kyushu jyangara in tokyo, bari-kata... crispy as in ironed with starch). my wife's chijirimen was very good with good amount of al dente,a and the chewiness one expects in good ramen.  if i can't get them to cook the thin noodles to super al dente, then my backup plan is to have them use the thick noodles in the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>.\n\nthe boiled egg is soft boiled, but the yolk does not run. i like my soft boiled egg a with a bit more runny yolk. but nevertheless it was still good. the char shu was one the the better ones i had in the states. very tender, melts in your mouth, with good flavor... not too over powering, not too bland. the slices were on the thin side, but i got a total of 8 slices by ordering the extra char shu topping ($2.50). \n\nin summary both the tonkotsu shoyu and <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> were done very well, with a good balance of broth, noodles, and toppings in a dish that came together very very well. too many times, i have been to ramen places in the states where the broth may be good, but noodles lack, or vice versa, or even where all the individual ingredients are good, but the finished product just doesn't cut it.\n\nthe gyoza, unlike one reviewer here, i though were also very good. i would beg to differ that this is not like store bought gyoza as it is stuffed with pork whereas the store bought ones are more heavy on the nappa cabbage and not stuffed. the flavor is also very good, however, i like my gyoza wet...that is with a bit more juice as you bite into them.\n\nin the end though, i give monta 5 stars even with the few deficiencies. monta, in my book, share the top honors with orenchi in cupertino,", 
            "i admit that monta has the best ramen anywhere in vegas.  the stuff they serve at ichiza and shuseki has nothing on them!  the noodles are fresh and the broth, whether tonkatsu, miso, or shoyu, is always steaming hot and extremely flavorful.  i appreciate that it's the real stuff and not the packaged, powder crap other places use.  \n\nyes, monta is a noodle house but their <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> is just as good, if not better.  for someone who doesn't really like <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, i would come just for that.  their gyoza was just okay.  i've had better.   \n\neven though the place is (extremely) small, i like that it's cozy.  there was only one time when i actually had to wait for a table, but as always, the wait was worth it.  \n\na basic bowl of ramen will cost you almost $8.  that's kind of steep, especially in the economy that we're in now.  an extra $1.50 for a hard boiled egg also seems a bit much, don't you think?  i guess it's really quality over quantity with this place. \n\nfour out of five stars because food quality is good, service is good, but pricing isn't the best.  this place is always a pleasure though.  if you haven't been, you probably should soon.", 
            "best. ramen. ever. i suggest the tonkatsu ramen and the kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. soooo delicious.",

            "monta is definitely one of the better ramen shops in las vegas. its in the same strip mall as raku on decatur/ spring mtn. \n\nmonta reminds us of japan's ramen shops...its all about order your food, eat your food, and get out, so the next group can eat. it's not a posh restaurant, minimal tables/ seats. the restaurant holds at most 30 people (5 tables of 4 seats and about 10 seats on the counter), so if you go with a large party, just sit wherever you can and when you can or you might be waiting for awhile.\n\nthe menu is simple. miso, tonkatsu, or <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>. my favorite is...all of them. huge stock pots in the back have been boiling bones and veg for hours to create the backbone of their heavenly broth.  i seem to be on a tonkatsu ramen kick lately with its hearty broth... you could add some thickener to the broth and you would have a damn good gravy. they give you a good amount of ramen, a few slices of tender charsiu, bamboo, takenoko, <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, half boiled egg, and kikurage. its a solid meal for a cheap price, $7-8 and you can add other extras for a small price.\n\nanother favorite is their <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>. its cheap and filling...not to mention very tasty. you get the thinly sliced pork served over rice in a small bowl garnished with beni shoga. its tasty, fatty, and better when you get eat a little beni shoga (red pickled ginger) with it.. we always get a small bowl and share it.\n\ntheir gyoza is good as is the kim chee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. we need to try more of the items on their menu but we are creatures of habit and sometimes its hard to stray away from the  dishes that monta is known for.\n\nits easy to over order food at monta. because the ramen bowls are big...resist ordering other dishes unless you have a big party and you want to share. \n\nmonta is great on a hot day and better on a cold day!! \n\narooha!!!!!", 
            "before i get flamed on giving this place only two starts let me explain why to me it deserves three stars.\n\ni was a us marine stationed overseas on mainland japan for three years. during those three years i've had the opportunity to eat sushi, ramen, bento bowls, curries, udon, miso soups, and other foods of japanese origins they way they make it and the way they eat it.\n\nthe ramen that is offered here is a step above instant ramen but is far from authentic. \n\nthe broths are noticeably lighter and less flavorful from authentic, the noodles are in the middle, they're close but dont have the right texture, sides such as meats are too fatty but seasoned better then authentic ramen.\n\nthe biggest difference is the price. here a bowl of ramen runs from 6.25 to 7.something which isnt bad but it's the sides that get you back. 1.50 for a hard boiled egg? 1.50 for a spoon full of pickled mustard greens? 2.50 for extra noodles?\n\nback in downtown iwakuni a bowl of ramen, a side of goyza, and a plate of kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was only about 700ish yen back in 2006ish. who would have figured five years later i'd pay double the cash to have a sixteenth a meal...", 
            "great hangover food. awesome ramen broth. must also get pork belly rice when you're here. it's tasty, fatty, and simply the best. their pork belly rice is even better than daikokuya's! planning to try their kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> next time i'm back in town.",

            "monta is an authentic japanese ramen restaurant. from the moment you enter its cramped, busy little space with a cheerful greeting from the staff to the satisfied feeling of a bellyful of delicious ramen it's a wonderful experience. the ramen is on-par with the real stuff in japan, and the tonkotsu and miso varieties are especially good. the gyoza and <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> leave a bit to be desired but as this is primarily a ramen restaurant that can be forgiven. the beer is cheap too, with asahi on tap for about $2.95 a glass. all in all it's a wonderful experience and if you are looking for authentic ramen in las vegas this is your best bet.",

            "asian people love noodles. i am asian, therefore i love noodles.\n\ni was saddened by our earlier trip to monta where the waitress told us the wait would be close to an hour.  my growling stomach couldn't bear to wait so we settled for someplace else, cough swish shabu shabu cough, and was very unsatisfied. so we decided to give it one more try on my last night in vegas.\n\nthey won't seat you until your whole party is there and luckily the other two people made it just in time.  this is a cozy restaurant which just adds to the ambiance a japanese noodle house.  \n\nmenu: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/upiyurazvkninod1w8kqrq?select=0ivynxxhiyabnfoadj1era\n\ni ordered the tonkotsu- <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/upiyurazvkninod1w8kqrq?select=7-ni-npnmemyeojbnzksug\n\ni thought the ramen was delicious.  you could tell the noodles were \"wendy's\", fresh not frozen, and the garnish were all nicely cooked.  the pork was so tender and fatty and delicious.  you could eat that all day fa sho. \n\nwe also tried the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and the gyoza.  gyoza is top notch, some of the best i've ever had and i had some godly ones in japan..  the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was pretty delicious as well.\n\ni really liked my experience here.  the waitresses seemed to be imported straight from japan, very hospitable and nice.  the food was excellent.  and it didn't break our wallets either.\n\nso if you're asian or not, and you're craving ramen in las vegas, monta is definitely a \"safe bet\".. vegas pun intended.", 
            "went here for a quick afternoon snack before dinner.  beat the crowd, authentic japanese ramen place.  the staff from the all you can eat sushi place at the outlets even stopped by for lunch.  great flavors from the broth and the ramen noodles were very tasty.  we hear the kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> is a must.  didn't want to eat too much as we had dinner at mesa grill.  would definitely go back.", 
            "what a great find in las vegas! initially, i didn't come here with much expectations because no other ramen places i've been to have impressed me as much as ramen dojo in norcal. knowing that the capacity of monta noodle house fit around 20 or so customers, i anticipated a wait so arrived 30 minutes before opening on a friday afternoon. arriving early got me a table right at opening...yay to that! so come early to avoid waiting. \n\nmonta noodle house offers three different kinds of broth but i got a recommendation from one of their regular customers to order the tonkatsu-shoyu combo broth! the standard bowl comes with noodles, bamboo shoots, onions, and two pieces of pork. i wanted the ultimate ramen experience so i added on some extra stuff to spice up my bowl - i added the soft boiled egg (a must for every ramen bowl!), sweet yellow corn and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> (must add - gives great flavoring to the whole bowl). i also garnished my ramen bowl with the togarashi chili powder and sesame seeds! the addition of sesame seeds in the bowl was just perfect =) i have to say the best part about this place is the ramen that they used - the noodles were so soft & the thickness was about the size of egg noodles but with a softer texture. i definitely enjoyed this.they also give you plenty of noodles to fill you up real good! \n\nif you're ever craving ramen in las vegas and can wake up early enough after a night of partying..remember to check this place out! it's located in chinatown so having a rental car is convenient. solid 4 stars for satisfaction and it's location in vegas!!\n\nfyi: i also heard that the kimchee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was also good to try. \n\nhappy eating =)", 
            "before my friends tricked me into going to monta, i thought the only kind of ramen available were the packs for 19 cents, how naive. as i'm sure you've heard the place only seats about 20 people at a time and there is often times a wait, but it's very much worth it. their menu is quite small but everything on there is a knock out. feeling like you can't go wrong when you order is an awesome feeling. i personally order the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with corn and <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, the first time i tired this i knew there was a heaven. it's so savory and authentic, if you ever go, take a spoonful of the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> dip it in the broth and i guarantee your taste buds will be enraptured with a euphoric taste. the price is fairly cheap as well around $15 a person. the waitresses are very friendly as well and always take time to teach me some new japanese every time i go. i definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for something different within a reasonable prince range.", 
            "suffice to say monta has become the next best thing to hit vegas since <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, but why you may wonder did i only give it a 4 star? as you may all have read the rest of the 400+reviews & counting, everyone is raving about the food at monta & the prices, and i definitely agree with all the positive reviews, i mean c'mon you have a menu that would fit in one sheet of paper, how can you mess that one up? they have followed the in n out burger's mantra...kisss (keep it simple st*p*d) less is more, no frills, no guess work, in fact i love everything on their menu so much it is so hard for me to pick just one item! the only disadvantage to the \"if it ain't broke don't fix it\" attitude is that it gets boring, and you might get monta'd out (especially if you are eating there almost every week sometimes two) i guess some good things must come to an end, and as the law of gravity dictates, what comes up, must come down, even if it is the best noodle & chiar su pork in town. with this popularity also comes one downfall....be prepared to wait for a table! especially during the peak hours of lunch & dinner. they open at 11 am and trust me there is a line already forming outside waiting for them to open. this is a sure way to tell that a place is sure to be good especially when it's packed, but what if you are really hungry already??? hmmm bring some crackers with you. keep in mind also that at monta it is first come first serve, you can not make reservations, nor will they seat you if your whole party is not there yet (they frown upon this) monta is suitable for parties of a maximum of 4 if your party is more than that you probably won't sit together or even eat at the same time. the waiting time is often discouraging, hungry people are angry people! it has happened on more than one occasion that we had to go somewhere else because we got discouraged by the slew of people waiting to be seated anplay how pressed for time we already are. so by now you probably figured out why it is missing that 1 more star, me & monta definitely have a love-hate relationship. like in any other relationship, if you fall too quickly, you will fall out as quickly as you fell. so for now or until i crave you again, sayunara monta-san.", 
            "i never considered any other reason to visit las vegas aside from the strip, but visitors rejoice! there is another reason..it's in the form of a little ramen restaurant called monta! fellow yelper vicky l. recommended it to me and i made it my first stop in vegas, right after picking up the rental car.\n\nwe arrived at around 11:45 and got extremely lucky with seats at the counter, because the place filled up quickly by noon with the lunch crowd.\n\ni had the tonkotsu-shoyu and the husband had the tonkotsu. the broth for both were extremely creamy and delicious. if you like things with a bit more flavor, i suggest the tonkotsu-shoyu. the ramen noodles are the thin, angel-hair type which is a nice change from the usual ones we get in sf. \n\nthe egg..how could i forget to order the soft-boiled egg? i'm actually still bitter about that. so please do me (and yourself) a favor and add a soft-boiled egg to your ramen. \n\nwe also smelled the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> aroma from our neighbor and couldn't help but get a small order to share ourselves. it was the perfect portion and hit the spot.", 
            "upon a friend's recommendation, i decided to head over to try monta one night. it was 10 pm and dining options were starting to get scarce. the place was tucked away in a little mini mall. plenty of parking in the lot, but it can be a tight fit.\n\nat this time, the place was still relatively full. we were able to get the last open table. the menu is short and to the point. you can choose from four types of ramen broths, add your toppings, or even add extra noodles. as for other menu items, there was some <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> options and handmade gyozas. we ordered the tonkatsu ramen with charsui, egg, and nori; the tonkatsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> (a bit less rich than the regular tonkatsu ramen) with same toppings; pork belly rice bowl; kimchee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and an order of gyoza. all tasted great, especially the charsui topping. it had more flavor than in other ramen spots i've eaten at. i could've ordered another order of gyoza. \n\nall in all, a surprisingly good spot that i'll visit again. keep in mind, they open till 1:00 pm on friday and saturday, but they only have about 7 tables and another 7 seats at the counter.", 
            "by far only place too go for ramen! growing up in hawaii ramen just about stable food as spam musubi. so too finally find ramen place same style food excited. it has all the same character small place holds less then fifty people, bar area (cool get see them make the ramen), and when the place gets packed line out the door. it soo worth the wait. the timing is hit or miss. they first open in the morning for lunch that time always count on line. the whole small hole in the wall love because look where the restaurant located understand.\n\nthe food all the ramen is good. <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> i die for!! the flavor is spot on the depth nice light broth and depending if order additional topping can be hearty noodle dish. i prefer couple extras. other thing find must really perfect compliment too big bowl of ramen is gyoza. it steamed perfectly then seared off on flat top too perfection and the filling is tasty. the gyoza sauce optional but must only way too have it combine together is divine. \n\nthey other sides i order the kim chee good but stand out is kim chee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. it could ordered big bowl of that if they had it on the menu. =( it not over spicy but just the right amount of balance. they even have one beer offer on tap never think see small the place is never been good one too. i not remember name of it. sorry.\n\nthe service is excellent. all the servers are very friendly and attentive. the prices are really reasonable. it light healthy tasty any time meal! =))) if never been say give it try!!!",

            "as an avid lover of all asian styles of food i was excited to finally try monta ramen since i had heard good things. at first glance it looked like this little noodle shop was going to have a very long wait. however, we did not have to wait too long even with people waiting outside. there are not many seats, but this is not really the place to linger for long. most people seem to leave fairly quickly once they are done. my friend and i sat at the counter and had fun watching the bustling kitchen while we waited for our ramen. the seating may feel cramped for some people, but i really liked the busy, controlled chaos feel of it. \n\non to the good stuff. i ordered the tonkotsu-<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with the regular house fixings and my friend had the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with thin noodles. i was instantly impressed with my choice as soon as i tried it. the broth was slightly creamy and full of flavor, the thin noodles cooked to the perfect point so they were not mushy at all. i found the soup very flavorful, but i had to add a liberal amount of chili oil since i like my ramen spicy. the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> was also very tasty, the clear beef broth had just as deep a flavor as my selection. we both had a can of <mark>Green Tea</mark> to drink, which was a refreshing counter to my spicy soup. my only gripe was the fact that i was not completely full when i left, which is mostly my own fault. they offer the option of extra noodles, which i will surely do next time. the gyoza and <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> are also on the list to try in the future. \n\nanother great aspect is the price. the total bill for two bowls of ramen and two drinks was $18 and change. a great deal for any sit down place. bottom line is that this place is a great option for a fun, cheap meal. i will definitely be going back.", 
            "i'm not a big fan of ramen and this place didn't help change my opinion about it.. monta is a tiny restaurant tucked in a strip mall that seats about 25-30 people.. they serve ramen with a choice between 4 different broths and every bowl comes with char-su, mushroom, and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>.. there are other options that you can add to your noodles for an additional cost too.. the broth was thick and a yellow-milky color which wasn't the best for drinking and the noodles didn't have any distinction that would make them \"the best\" ramen.. we also tried their regular <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and that was probably the only thing everyone enjoyed and would come back for again.. but as for the ramen i think i'll pass!",

            "now that i've come here enough to practically remember the whole menu, i think it's ready for a review. \n\nwhen i found this place (through yelp of course) i thought to myself, \"could it be? a true authentic ramen place that the city i originally resided in devastatingly lacked of? my own little nyc momofuku only a 15 minute drive away?\" oh, sweet baby jesus it could! \n\nbefore making the trip to your next lunch or dinner date here, you should probably consider what day you're going and at what time. this place is small, like 5 tables (2 4-tops, 3 2-tops) small with a couple seats at the bar, and it gets crazy packed! the first time i came here i literally drove by and was like, \"awh hailll noo,\" and drove away. however i will say that if there's just a couple of people before you, just be patient and wait. the tables turn over rather quickly.\n\nwhich leads me to the menu. it's very simple and quick to prepare. if you're going with ramen, they have 4 different broth options: shoyu (chicken), tonkotsu (pork), tonkotsu-shoyu (chicken & pork) and miso. all are priced around 6.95 a bowl. just forget the rest and go with the tonkotsu-shoyu. all ramens are prepared with two slices of pork, bamboo, and chopped <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>. don't forget to add extra ingredients like an egg and <mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark>! if you've never tried <mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark>, it really compliments the broth and makes it extra delicious...order it on the side and try it out! adding in the ingredients is what really gets the meal to be pricier than expected. just 1 egg is an extra $1.75, but it's okay to indulge a little every now  and then, so just go all out with you bad ramen self! \n\nthey have other items as well such as <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, small plates, and cold ramen! i still have yet to try them.. will do an update after my next visit! \n\nthe only negative thing i'd have to say about the ramen is it can get pretty salty, of course you can mention to them less sodium, but i'm pretty sure all they're going to do is dilute it with hot water. to leave it on a positive note, aside from the saltiness the broth is perfection. extremely murky, so you know its packed with flavor and takes overnight cooking to prepare.", 
            "delicious <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. quite possibly the best <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> i've had here in las vegas. as for the ramen, we tried both the pork and chicken broth and while the chicken ramen was very tasty, the pork ramen was a bit too salty for our taste. also, i don't think i'm a big fan of ramen noodle but i will absolutely come back here for the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.", 
            "this is my favorite ramen in town.\n\ni prefer the \"tonkotsu-shoyu\" mix over the other two separate and the miso.  so much flavor...i have no idea how they do it.\n\ni usually add in the egg and a little extra pork to go crazy, and this would be plenty for the avg joe to fill up on.\n\notherwise, i order the kim chi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>...amazing!  this is one of my favorite <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> dishes of all time.  very very good.  if i order this, i tend not to get the extras inside the ramen otherwise i will burst at the seams.\n\nservice is fast...this is a quick bite and go kind of place, so don't expect to stay and converse for an hour after dinner.  they don't rush you, but there are typically others waiting to eat, and the place is tiny, you will feel guilty staying much later than the meal lol.\n\ndo it!", 
            "i didn't realize how hard it would be to find a really good ramen restaurant after moving out of hawaii.  however, monta comes close to filling the void.  monta is a small japanese noodle house in a strip mall in china town.  if you don't like waiting to sit down, get there early as the line usually begins to form before the restaurant opens at 11:30am.  there are a few scattered tables, but i prefer to sit at the bar and watch the cooks prepare the dishes in the open kitchen.\n\nmonta makes tonkotsu ($6.95), shoyu ($6.95) and miso ($7.25) ramen broths.  while all three of the broths are very good, the milky white colored tonkotsu (stewed pork bone broth) has an especially savory meaty flavor.  my favorite is the combination tonkotsu-<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> ($6.95) which tempers the intense meaty taste of the tonkotsu with the salty shoyu broth.  the thin yellow ramen noodles have always been consistently cooked to the just right texture, neither too limp nor too firm and underdone.  the ramen comes with basic toppings (<mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, bamboo shoots, kikurage mushrooms and two thin slices of marinated <mark>Chashu Pork</mark>) however, like all good ramen joints, they have a whole list of additional toppings you can add (for a little extra cash) to make the dish your own.  the combination of flavors and textures soaking in the hot broth goes down well on a cold day.\n\nwe also usually order the pan fried pork gyozas ($5.15 for 6) and a small kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> ($6.95).  the gyozas are excellent and the moist rice has a good flavor.  each table has an array of sauces and condiments that you can add to your meal (rice vinegar, soy sauce, chili oil, sesame seeds, and chili pepper) as well as little jars of crushed garlic and red pickled ginger.  they also serve beer to wash it all down with.\n\nthe service is fast and the food comes out quickly.  so even if you do get stuck waiting in line, it usually moves fast.  and if you are in the mood for good ramen, it is worth the wait.", 
            "my friends and i found this place in one of the las vegas magazines. we opted to try it out. i have been addicted ever since. i have not wanted to write this review because this place is like y secret treasure and very small. there is almost always await. the food comes out very fast it has a limited menu of ramen noodles.  it is awesome. the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> is out of the park good.  the bowls of noodles are quite big and you pay like $7 bucks. you can't go wrong with that.  the wait staff is nice and fast.  i can eat here everyday since ramen noodles are one of my favorite.  it is a bit out of the way for me plus its small and often packed. definitely worth going and checking it out and even if you have never had ramen (the pack for .25 cents in the grocery store does not count) for less then ten bucks its worth it try.", 
            "great ramen place!  been here twice and have been thoroughly satisfied each time.  with how small this place is, i'm not surprised at the wait...even at 10pm at night.  \n\nthe service, though brisk, is also very helpful and friendly.  no one has time to stand around to chat and explain things to you but they try very hard to seat everyone as quickly as possible and they manage to bring you your food quickly and correctly.\n\nhubby and i are purists...we stay with the tonkotsu broth.  the broth was rich and sticky...didn't taste like it was brewed only from pork bones but also from pork feet/hock.  very tasty and comforting.  on our second visit, i got extra char siu.  when the fat from the char siu melted into my broth, it got even thicker and richer.  hey, you say greasy, i say yummy!!\n\nother standouts - takana <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>...all very good!!  definitely going to be a staple for us when we're in lv.",

            "food here is pretty solid.  i've had ramen in la (which is much better back home, and i'm not trying to sound snobby, rather it's just something i can compare to), and the food here is a decent.  \n\n<mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> $(7) and +$2 for egg- slightly above average-the broth is pretty good.  it comes w/ 2 pieces of meat (which is detailed on the menu).  the pork base is pretty thick, so if you are into thick broths this is the place to go.  \n\nmy gripe is they don't give you complimentary egg w/ the broth, so you gotta pay $2 extra (which is pretty steep if you ask me).  i mean, who eats ramen w/o egg?  it's almost required!!!  i also would've preferred my egg to be a little more runny.  part of the egg yoke should seep into the soup (but still retain it's shape).  the egg i got was slightly hard when i got it.\n\npork belly rice ($5.50 for a large, $3.50 for small) - average.  the pork belly is extremely sweet!  i think they use too much sauce or something. the sauce almost over-powers the taste of the meat.  i'd pass on this next time.\n\ni was able to try my friends takana <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and it's delicious.  10x better than the pork belly.\n\ntips:\n-not good for groups.  restaurant is small, maybe seats 20 people inside.   parties of 4 or larger might have trouble sitting.\n-egg isn't complimentary w/ the ramen, so you gotta spend $2 extra =(\n-no garlic press available", 
            "every bowl of ramen comes with two slices of pork chashu, <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, kikurage (black mushroom), and bamboo shoots. there are four different types of broths:\n\n1. shoyu- soy sauce-based broth, pretty salty and nothing spectacular, average\n\n2. miso- miso-based broth, salty but not overwhelmingly so, pretty run-of-the-mill <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>\n\n3. tonkotsu- pork flavored broth, savory, and has a creamy texture. the soup's thick consistency is due to boiling pork bones, collagen, and fat for a long period of time. some people find the thickness of the savory broth distasteful and unsettling. if you're not a fan of a thick soup, i would skip this one. definitely one of my favorite broths to get here.\n\n4. tonkotsu-shoyu- best of both worlds, the tonkotsu and shoyu work well to balance each other out. the shoyu waters down the tonkotsu so it's not as thick and the tonkotsu adds a bold, fuller flavor to the shoyu. this is definitely monta's signature ramen and a must try.\n\nadditional toppings: some of the toppings are noticeably more expensive compared to other local ramen joints that already include these toppings in their ramen.\n\nadditional notes: \n*if you order extra noodles (kaedama), it comes in a separate bowl usually in the middle of the meal. it's been heated up so your noodles are still delicious even if your broth is not as hot as in the beginning. \n* there are two types of noodles to choose from: thick cup ramen style noodles (that definitely taste nothing like those horrible cup noodles) or a thinner noodle similar to chinese egg noodles (not the noodle that usually comes with wonton noodle soup). i definitely prefer the thicker noodles; the thinner ones tend to be overcooked easily and soggy. \n*there is a $10 minimum on credit cards. bring cash if you don't plan to spend more than that.\n*they will not sit you at a table unless your whole party is present.\n\noverall:\n\nso far, monta has the best ramen in vegas. (still need to try anime ramen, and fukumimi though.) it's just the thing that hits the spot on a cold chilly night when you need some warming up. \n\nservice varies depending on how busy they are. bar seating may get uncomfortable for some but that's how traditional ramen houses are: small and cramped. seating is very limited so anticipate a wait if you're coming during peak hours. \n\nthe consistency of the ramen sometimes varies as well. sometimes the chashu is over done, resulting in a dry piece of meat that doesn't have that heavenly gelatinous soft layer of fat that melts in your mouth. also, the noodles sometimes come out too soft if they've been sitting there for a while. once in a while, the yolk of the hard boiled egg will be completely solid, with none of that ooey gooey goodness. these hiccups happen rarely, only when they're extremely busy and it's during peak hours. portions are decent sized for a regular person. if you're a gluttonous fatty like me, it's better to share <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> (which is quite delicious) with a buddy.\n\noverall, despite the ridiculous wait sometimes and food consistency issues, monta is definitely a must try for locals and tourists.",

'cause i like to scrape off the fat under the pork skin. lol. another thumbs up!\n\nthe last dish which was the kimchee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> ($6.95) was yum, though i still think it could be done with slightly less oil.  unlike the rice bowl-sized portion that it often comes in, this <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> came in a rounded square plate of the size that could've been a meal by itself.\n\nservice\nservice was friendly, efficient and brisk without making us feel rushed. but we did devoured our meal super fast and left quickly as a courtesy to the long lines of people waiting.\n\ntwo thumbs up for this place.\n\nanecdotal comments & observations (mostly rhetorical)\nwhy is it that most ramen house has the most 'house rules' posted on their outside window? no outside food. no outside drink. no tacos?

            "i never liked going to eat ramen, but the more places i try, the more i love and appreciate monta. \n\nthis place is very small, and sometimes the wait can be a while, but the service is actually really quick. i've tried every flavor, but my favorite would have to be the tonkatsu with corn. the corn just puts it over the top! my boyfriend is usually a die hard miso fan, it's pretty good, i don't love it, but so far he likes monta's the best. \n\ni don't ever order <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> at restaurants, but this one time i did and it was actually pretty good! it had a lot of flavor, it reminded me of my mom's. the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> is delicious too, but i wouldn't go there for that. overall, monta would have to be my favorite ramen spot!", 
            "ramen house. that's exactly what this place is, no frills just ramen with a few sides (<mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>/gyoza items on the menu) monta is truly a place that focuses on the ramen.  tonight i had the shoyu basic ramen and didn't need to add anything to it.  i'm still a ramen newb so hearing tables next to me adding extra pork, extra noodles etc made me realize you can customize your own ramen bowls, but just the basic ramen as is is just fine.  this is good comfort food and beats your top ramen like during your college years. *there will be a wait and this place is small, but definitely worth it! **the hot tea comes in cans cold or hot.",

            "i'm not sure what else i can add that won't echo the other 700+ reviews listed for monta, but the legitimacy of the food here can be proven by the 30+ minute wait in the dead heat of a vegas summer.\n\nmonta is tiny and maybe seats about 50 people-pretty sure the max occupancy sign inside the restaurant said 70, but they'd be pushing it. the service is quick and no frills but friendly. the menu is simple-there are four types of ramen and a variety of appetizers and alternative dishes like kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, gyoza, cold noodles and a <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>. ramen comes with add ons like seasoned egg (so good), mustard greens, scallions, extra pork belly, corn and butter. \n\nthe broths are rich and flavorful and it's hard for me to pinpoint a favorite, but if i had to pick the tonkotsu-shoyu would probably be it. the noodles have that perfect ramen texture-chewy and slurpy, in a good way!\n\nbecause of the size of the space, it can be an intimate dining experience with complete strangers particularly if you sit at the bar. but it's also one of those places that solo dining isn't awkward and can actually be to your benefit when there is a line out the door.\n\nmonta is your spot for legit ramen with no pretense!",

            "hey monta, you make some good ramen, just saying.\n\nit took me some time to finally try this place. for one, i didn't know of its existence until after it was open for some time, and i had a hard time finding it. it is inside of a plaza where i had a hard time locating it, but you just have to make sure you make the turn into the plaza or the little street next to the plaza.\n\nmy friends that have tried monta beforehand liked it enough where i had some expectations for this place. it didn't have to be rated g-a-f, but it had to be tasty. the first time i came, i just got a bowl of their tonkatsu ramen and i must say, i was one happy guy afterwards. the noodles were pretty good, their egg made me happy, their pork melted in my mouth, but the broth is what impressed me. the broth was probably my favorite part about the meal. needless to say, i finished the whole bowl, soup and all! i was really happy. \n\nthe next few times i came, i started customizing and ordering different things on the menu. i added more noodles the next few times, got some of their <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, gyoza, added some corn to my soup, just customizing things to the point where i was happy! their <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was pretty tasty. the kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> may not be for everyone, because unless you like kimchi, you may not like it. adding various things to your ramen makes it takes a lot better and funner to eat since it has more color and just the feeling of being able to customize your food just makes it that much better. \n\nif you want to try some ramen and you're in the area, i highly recommend monta. the only downside is that the restaurant is fairly small and during peak hours, you should expect a wait. people get turned away from places that have waits, but if you think about it, why do they have waits? it is small, but people keep going back because the food is delicious, it's as simple as that.", 
            "while visiting las vegas i was doing research on ramen restaurants on yelp and kept reading about everyone who had a positive and delicious experience at monta ramen.  today i made the trip with my brother.  we got here about 10 minutes after they opened and found the last remaining table.  the place was already packed.  after looking at the menu i ordered the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> which is a rich pork broth with two slices of melt in your mouth pork with wood-ear mushrooms and scallions.  i added the nitamago which is a seasoned hard-boiled egg.  this meal did not disappoint.  it came to the table within 10 minutes and was a great looking bowl of ramen.  very savory and fresh.  we also had the gyoza  which is a pan-fried pork and vegetable dumpling.  my brother ordered the takana pork-<mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.  this rice was a nice addition to our ramen bowls.  \n\njust a note:  as our ramen bowls were delivered i looked up and noticed that monta ramen must have a lot of fans because the little doorway was filled with people waiting to eat but the line also went out the door.   knowing what i do now about how delicious this ramen is i would have gladly waited outside for my turn to enjoy this bowl.  \n\nmonta ramen will definitely be on my list to visit the next time i come to las vegas.  can't wait to bring my wife here.  very affordable.  i recommend.", 
            "quick cheap and good.  just the way i ilkes it.  this place is tiny; the seating is limited, so they can't seat you until your entire party has arrived.  once seated, however, i had a surprisingly generous amount of space -- didn't feel crowded like i do at some places.  on the recommendation of a friend, i had the kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and pot-stickers.  i liked them both.   i was a bit leery at first because the odor from kimchi made just about every other way is a real turn-off for me, but i had no problem with it in this case.", 
            "yummy! ramen noodles! the broth is sup@ delicious. if you like minchin, the have an awesome dish of kmchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>!\nif you have small children they welcome the challenge to win them over with their house specialties. ask the wait svc for the winning dishes...some clippings of news articles are hung up by the door which also informs you of what's good!\none important tip...if you see that it's packed you must go to the podium and sign in. \nand fyi it is a very quaint place (small) seats are limited. and prepare to be face down in a bowl of something wonderful!", 
            "first time trying ramen in las vegas and came to this highly recommended hole in the wall spot. but to my husband and my disappointment the ramen was mediocore. he had the tonkotsu and i had miso. we both thought it was too salty. however we shared a kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and it was delicious! \nwe have much better ramen spots here in california.", 
            "as soon as you walk in - sign in! haha there's always a wait for this place.  (but if you're in a hurry to get back to work or wherever there are multiple of good restaurants you can go to in that same complex). so with that statement, it's the type of place you order--- eat--- and leave... you don't want to be the jerk holding up the wait :p \n\none thing that really caught my attention was how the chefs were dipping the bowl into hot boiling water before making your order to keep your food hot even longer.  i like to enjoy every bite of my food so by the end of my last bite my soup was still warm :p ( but i'll have to admit the last time i went they didn't dip my bowl ) \n\ni've tried all three <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> on different occasions and all were good :) i think the kimchi is my favorite.  as for the  gyoza, it's pretty delicious and crispy.  \n\ni've tried all soups and i'll have to say i'll stick to the pork broth with thin noodles and of course adding some <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> and egg to that - call it my usual order :)",

            "came to vegas for vacation and my friend kept telling me that i must try this place out.  i am from out of town so i cant really tell you where this place is at since i took a taxi but it seems like the chinatown of vegas.  it seems to be sorta hidden in the back of the shopping center but just look for the white sign.\n\ngot here around 12pm and there was a slight wait (nothing compared the wait when we were leaving).  sat down and the friendly waitress took my order: <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with corn and also the small <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> (my friend said i had to get it no matter what) and yes i know thats a lot of carbs.\n\n<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>:  my ramen came out with extra chasu and with no corn.  the waitress quickly realized this and immediatly gave me some corn on the side and didnt charge me for the extra chasu (kudos to her to rectify the situation).  the broth was very good and not overly salty.  i consider this one of the better ramens that i have eaten.  but the thing that stood out the most to me are the noodles.  wow! this has got to be one of the best noodles ive eaten at any ramen joint and i have been to many in ny, ca and hawaii.  many places forsake the noodles and focus too much on the broth and chasu but very very good noodles.\n\n<mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>: this was the dish my friend kept raving about and keep telling me to order.  i am not a huge <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> person but it was pretty darn good! i devoured it within minutes of it coming out and didnt even leave a spec for my friend.\n\nvery good place i will definitely come again when i go to vegas.", 
            "the cure for a las vegas hangover is ramen. and with all the raves and reviews monta ramen was worth a visit. upon arriving, there was already a crowd outside (it opens at 11:30). luckily, the bar had two open seats for my friend and i.\n\nthinking with our appetites, we began the order:\n\n2 <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> (this is what they're known for)\n1 gyoza (it's gyoza and i was hungover, so give me a break)\n1 kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> (once again, we were hungover!)\n\nafter taking the last bite and having to unbutton my pants, i looked at my friend and gave him the approving nod, which summed up our experience.", 
            "i went to the one on spring mt & decatur location and man.. that place is so small! so many people were lining up and i felt so clusterphobic! i still stayed and waited because i wanted to see why this place is so popular! anyway, after 20 minutes of waiting, me and my party were finally sat. customer service could be better. i understand its busy, but if you work there, that's just something you know you have to deal with especially if its a popular place. the food was good. ramen.. delicious. <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.. delicious as well!  overall, it was a good experience!", 
            "got here a little before opening and already a line had formed (at least 15 people deep).  pretty cramped inside, with about 6-7 tables and counter seating for 10.  food took a while to come out, and a big reason why was there was only one person cooking the noodles, prepping the bowls, and plating/garnishing (with one person taking care of the rice items).  the waitstaff would just stand and wait for the food to be ready.  it could have been more efficient (and thus quicker), but maybe they were limited by the size of the kitchen.  oh well...\n\nthe ramen itself was just okay, with average-tasting broth and average noodles.  i ordered the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> with the wavy noodles, and some <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> and <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> for the kids.  not bad overall, and service was good, but i prefer fukumimi ramen to this place.  but mad props to that multi-tasking cook, he sure was fun to watch!", 
            "big drop-off since the last time i dined here, which was probably a year ago when i came here with some friends and let me say that my friends and i  liked this place so much that we literally came here 3 days straight!!! i raved about this place so much to my girlfriend back home in austin, so the expectations from us were pretty high coming in on a monday evening around 7 o'clock. the wait time was about 20 min., so it wasn't too bad and the restaurant was pretty full. so i ordered 3 of my fav dishes i had last time to share with my girlfriend. we had <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> w/ ajitama (seasoned egg) and corn, kim chi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, and cold noodles with sesame sauce...so\n\n<mark>Miso Ramen</mark>- broth was a lil salty and luke  warm, cold corn (which prob made the broth luke warm), the noodles were stuck together in a ball shape, so that was obvious it wasn't boiled long enough. \n\nkim chi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>- was very wet and was obvious drenched with a lot of oil\n\ncold noodles- were a bit sour and visibly covered with way too much sesame sauce.\n\ni really don't understand the big drop off in the quality of taste and food and it saddens me to just give monta 1 star ( star for good service) which seems harsh, but when you get food poisoning that causes your stomach to ache and many trips to the restrooms. how could you consider to go back...", 
            "we ate here twice in 3 days! the first time we actually came to eat at the snowflake shavery for dessert, but noticed the crowd milling around monta and decided to throw our name on the waiting list. since we had our baby in tow, we weren't exactly expecting to wait it out. however, the woman working at monta was so incredibly nice, she save us a table and made it as comfortable as possible for the baby, even helping us store the stroller in the back! now to be honest we weren't incredibly hungry after the wonderful shavery but we managed to still enjoy my tonkotsu and <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with the egg and my wife the black garlic oil flavored kuro ramen. i've definitely had better egg in my time so next time i'd try some other add on.\n\nwhile the food was good, the service was what stuck in our minds that first night. nicest wait staff ever! we also vowed to take my noodle loving 10 year old nephew and my sister when they rolled into town the next day.  \n\nso today we went around lunch time, and longer line so again we hit the snowflake shavery first! while waiting, we saw the flyer that they opened a monta in henderson! we'll definitely try that next. this time the wait was longer and we worked up our post-snow appetites...and score! the nephew and sister loved it! also i tried the takana <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> this time which i thought was great. just the right amount of spiciness and with the mustard green, unique from chinese <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. my better half had the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> this time, which was indeed lighter than the tonkotsu broth. i think i preferred the tonkotsu but it was good to have tried them both.\n\nnext stop will definitely be the one near my parents house on eastern. thanks yelp for the recommendation!", 
            "one of the best ramen places in us. it definitely goes into top three of our ramen list. \nit's a bit crowded at dinner time and you might need to wait like 15 minutes. but once we had our food, all the waiting is worthwhile!\nit's a small place and we sat at counter. once you got seated, the service is pretty fast. my bf ordered tonkotsu soyu and i got tonkotsu.\nthe soup base if very thick and rich, very yummy, feels like a good stew from good pork. and the noodle is just right, not too soft and not too hard. try eat noodle dipped in soup in one bite, it's heaven. :) i almost finished the whole bowl. the bowl is cheap like 6.95 - 8.95. you can add extra topping if you want. it only comes with chashu and a bit veggie for my meal but the good taste makes me happy enough.\nthey don't have other sides or appetizers. as far as i remember, only gyozer and some <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. if i go lv later and want some asian food, that'll probably be the first item popped into my mind.", 
            "i like this place, but have come less over time because of the crowds you have to fight through to get a table here. if you come on a weekend, expect to wait 30-45 min to get a table since they don't have very many. enjoyed it a lot more the 1st few times i came here but have been less impressed lately. seems like as it's gotten more crowded, the food quality and service has gone downhill.\n\ni've had the ramen, <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, and <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> here and nearly any choice you get is pretty decent. sometimes you may get a bowl of ramen that's a little saltier than others...i'm sure this is directly related to how busy they've gotten. hopefully they will look into expanding or adding another location to alleviate the crowd issue here.",

            "we came here on a saturday afternoon around 1220 and it was super packed. we waited for an hourish but it's also because we had a party of 9. this place is right next to raku and a korean restaurant. \n\nwe ordered a bowl of tonkotsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with an extra order of egg, kimchee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, and gyoza. let's actually start with the ramen which was the most disappointing dish of the 3....however it was better than i expected. i have recently lost my hope for ramen so this place was actually better than i expected. the broth was a bit too salty for my taste but the chashu was really good. the noodles weren't bad. \n\nthe gyoza was really good. it was crispy and the inside of it was juicy and perfectly seasoned. the skin wasn't too thick so it had that perfect crispy to it when you bite into it. \n\nthe kimchee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was the shiitttt. no joke. i think i'm gonna have dreams about the kimchee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> to be honest. it was moist and tasty. so much seasoning to it and there's little kick to it from the kimchee. there are restaurants that makes it super dry but monta made it perfectly. obviously it is oily, but it is seriously bomb-diggity good. it was sooooo good that we ordered a to-go right before we left and we ate it at midnight. we ate it cold cause there was no microwave in the hotel but it was still so damnnn good.\n\ni would seriously come back only to get the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>...i'm really curious about the takana <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> too. service was actually really good and i actually gave monta a 4 just because of the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>...or else i would probably give it a two stars. \n\nthe lesson is...you come early to avoid the wait, you get the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, and be happy with life.",

            "during a foodie excursion to vegas, we wanted to eat something delicious, yet budget-friendly. after pouring over a few years' worth of vegas weekly magazines, authentic japanese ramen at monta ramen made the cut. the restaurant was crowded, but we scored seats! we split an order of kuro ramen and kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.  the slurp-worthy broth was full of flavor and quite excellent, and the noodles were chewy and delicious. it was my first time having kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and it was love at first bite. by now, i've probably eaten my weight in <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, but monta ramen's kimchi variation was kickass. monta ramen for the best ramen in vegas!", 
            "have to try: its very small so expect to wait but the service is very quick. the menu is very simple but very good. three to four ramens to choose from and a variety of extras to add into your ramen.\n\nrecommend the kimichi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>!!",

            "me and my friends actually ended up here because the line at oyster bar was too long and we were starving. i personally am a ramen fan in general so i like trying new places, my other friend and her hubby are not big ramen fans, but luckily, after coming to monta they have found a renewed interest in ramen.\n\nwe all started with a glass of beer, pretty cheap at about $3 but they are not pints, i think more like 10oz-ers? still it was a refreshing way to start the meal. \nshared the pickled greens <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and the pork belly rice bowl. <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was cooked well and flavorful, the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> was even better. the fatty pieces of pork were cooked perfectly tender with their greasy goodness seaping into the rice underneath. \n\nfor ramen i got the half pork half chicken broth and added an egg. the chicken broth is supposed to be a little less rich but mine was still a pretty thick broth. not that that's a bad thing, thick as in thick with flavor but sometimes i prefer a less rich broth because it can get very filling. so depending on what you like, the full tonkatsu broth would be richest and most flavorful and a the half and half would be a lighter version. noodles were cooked perfectly. \n\nthe place is typical small japanese style shop, they have a list for you to write your name on and wait. the waitresses do a nice job of clearing the tables and getting everyone seated as soon as possible so even though we had a few parties ahead of us the wait wasn't too bad for lunch hour. it does get a little hot inside though, so be warned for those coming in the summer months.",

            "monta is by far the most amazing ramen house in las vegas! i stumbled upon it and decided to take my wife and two kids (4 and 2) to give it a try. last week we tried another ramen house down the street from monta and it was nowhere near as good. we've had ramen in japan, hawaii and california and monta is the closest to what you can find on the streets of tokyo. \n\nwe started out with kimchee and the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. they were both amazing! the kimchee had an amazing taste and the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was probably the best i have had! i had the spicy <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>, my wife had the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> and my kids shared the cold noodles. all had amazing flavor with robust noodles and tender meat. the dishes were bursting with flavor! my kids pounded the cold noodles and the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.\n\noverall, monta is a must try when in las vegas. this is going to be a regular spot for us. oh, the place is really small... so don't expect to have a big party and get in right away. you'll wait 20-30 minutes before you get in. enjoy!", 
            "first and foremost i would like to say that the food here is absolutely incredible. the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and the tokontsu shoyu are a must with every visit. it's the service that makes them lack from a full 5 stars. i have been here multiple times and have never had any issues however tonight out server chizuru gave us some of the rudest service.. we ordered <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> to share and she basically threw it at our table without giving us an extra plate or silver wear and had some major attitude when i asked for what she lacked in giving us. not once after we got our food did she ask how we were doing, however the cute girl with the glasses and long ponytail who wasn't even our server made sure we were okay. i will ultimately return for more ramen because it is amazing i will just hope chizuru gets an attitude adjustment before then!", 
            "this place was such a good find. never had been here before and we just searched up a ramen place to try (since our favorite ramen joint closed down) and i would have to say that monta ramen is probably our new favorite. their menu is small and simple, which i like because then i don't have to sit there forever trying to decide which one i want to order. i was able to see what they have and decide what i wanted quickly. we ordered the tonkatu shoyu and added an egg (extra $1.00-$1.50) and it was soooooooooooooooooooo yummy! we also ordered their <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and gyoza. all was delicious. \n\nthe only downfall i have is that it is such a small restaurant that many people enjoy going to, so if you're there on a busy night.... most likely there will be a wait for a while and you'll be stuck waiting outside.

            "i'll make this short and sweet. hey, that's the perfect description of our waitress!\n\nwe arrived on friday night, between 6-7pm to a full parking lot, but a slow night over at monta ramen. we found street parking, got our name on the list and probably sat around 7 minutes after that. the bar top was packed while the main area had a steady flow of patrons ordering, dining, enjoying then leaving. seems like standard operating procedures, so let's do it.\n\ni ordered the spicy tonkutsu ramen and our table shared the <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark>. literally, our ramen showed up within minutes.. seems like they might have it sitting stove top somewhere. it took longer for our rice to show up, but it was definitely worth it. the rice was tasty, as are most fried foods. fluffy and moist with bits and pieces of meat, egg and dashes of spice. \n\nas far as the ramen goes, there was a taste i can't quite describe.. it wasn't necessarily bad nor was it good. what saved the bowl, in my opinion, was the fact that they include a little sriracha style chili sauce which blended well in the broth and masked that indescribable taste. that, along with garlic and a dab of soy totally turned this dish from a 3 to a 4. the spice level, out of 10, had to be in the 5 or 6 zone. almost had me, but it was more of a flavor than the actual kick. the ramen noodles were a little thin making it truly easy to finish this bowl off, which i find hard to do in the sgv area due to the portion sizes.\n\nthis wasn't necessarily the best ramen i've had to date, but having the wind gust hard outside along with winter like temps and an empty stomach, it definitely did the job.. we didn't have to wait in a dreaded line, super-friendly service, decent prices, prompt ticket turnaround times and the meal was quite fulfilling.",

            "it has been some time since i had good ramen.  san francisco is one of the best foodie towns but it fails miserably in terms of ramen offerings.\n\nwe stopped by monta on a recent trip to vegas.  it is located on spring mountain road like most of the other popular nearby offstrip spots and is located in the same strip as raku and kung fu tea.  the parking lot is a bit tight and can fill up pretty quickly on busy nights but there is street parking and we have used the lot opposite of the strip (store was closed).\n\nthere was a short wait at monta as expected but it was reasonable - only 3 other names on the clipboard.  the shop consisted of a long l shaped bar and 10 or so small tables.  not a huge place but not small either.  we all ordered the tonkatsu ramen and tanaka <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> as recommended.  the default toppings were a bit sparse (pork, bamboo, ginger, 'shrooms) but considering the price (under $7) i didn't mind.  i added a soft boiled egg to mine - other standard toppings were available (corn, more pork, butter, etc) we were pleasantly surprised at the turnaround for the ramen - within 5-10 minutes.\n\nthe broth carried plenty of flavor but was a bit thicker than the other ramen shops.  the noodles were thin and firm but not overly so.  the bowl only came with 2 slices of pork but it was expertly prepared - tender with a good combination of meat and fat.  there was a slight aftertaste (from msg?) but easily queched from the kung fu milk tea from next door.\n\nthe <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was solid but a bit salty.  it was more than likely from the <mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark> either being too abundant or just overly salty themselves.  not bad but i may go with the potstickers or simply stick with the ramen next time.\n\na definite stop for me in vegas the next time i am craving something soupy or noodles.", 
            "called here on a tuesday around 8p.m. and found out there's not wait. i was finally able to try this place that has lines every time i had passed by. \n\n<mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> - 3 star. it was good, salty, but nothing super extraordinary. i didn't find it to be amazing, and have definitely had better ramen elsewhere...in cali and tokyo. \n\nkuro ramen- 3.5 star. this was richer in flavor and had depth that was different compared to the tonkotsu, but i sure wasn't raving about it either. \n\nkimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>- 2.5. i was looking forward to this since people had mentioned that it's quite amazing. nah. i shoulda known better ordering kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> at a ramen shop for one, and a japanese restaurant. \n\noverall it's a 3 star. an a-ok for me. i don't think i'll be back here again. oh, but i am proud that the food here got me to drink two big glasses of water.", 
            "this place reminds me of men-oh in little tokyo in the settings.  walk in to a small entry way, stools greet you at the bar table and you turn in to a small room with tight seating.  it's packed and you will be fortunate if you are seated right away.  at the same time, both times we were there we only waited 5-10 minutes so they do turn them pretty quickly.  orders are taken promptly by pleasant wait staff, and your meal is turned around quickly as well, within 10 minutes.\n\ntheir ramen are overall the best i've had - not greasy, fresh, with nicely firm noodles - although from pure taste standpoint i probably prefer hiromaru (rip).  their <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> is really good, as is the chashu don.  these are more like side dishes from size standpoint, but probably too much for one person to have a ramen and one of these.  maybe 2 ramen dishes and one will work for two... i say that because they're really good and you should really try them.\n\ngreat atmosphere, bustling crowd, and great food all equal to the best ramen joint i have been to yet.  it's probably more like 4.5 stars, but i want to differentiate between this and other 4-star places i've rated so i'm giving it a 5.\n\ntable-for-1 factor:  yes, and there are many who partake.", 
            "i get a craving for monta nearly once a week...nah who am i kidding, it's more like a daily burn. if i lived closer to their chinatown location, i would seriously consider a 5x a week lunch adventure, transporting me back to japan with an enveloping nostalgia of aroma, atmosphere, personality, texture and umami. oh man, the umami. the wait (and there always is one) is well worth it. whether it's 10 minutes for lunch or a 30-60 minute wait for dinner, your olfactory glands, umami super sensors and full warm belly will thank you profusely. \n\ni am a massive fan of the basic tonkotsu, always with a nitamago (soft boiled, soy sauce-seasoned egg), with a spicy iteration thrown in the routine every so often. i am also slightly obsessed with their kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, on which i pile on pink pickled ginger. they should probably start charging me for the pickled ginger, as i definitely take advantage of the free-for-paying-customers-with-the-notion-it-will-be-used-sparingly jar of the condiment/dish enhancer. $2.95 asahi on tap?? give me a couple! \n\nmonta is incredibly well priced, intimate in a truly authentic japanese way, lively, wicked efficient (in the manner they move customers in and out), clean and so consistent. i will be back, in approximately 15 minutes! damn spring mountain traffic!", 
            "i love this place so very much. i'm not a big ramen fan, so i begrudgingly went along with some friends for my first visit. i now go willingly, without any hesitation. i don't get ramen, but i do get the pork <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, which is some of the best i have ever had in my life (and i have lived in the bay and la). it's flavorful and rich, and so amazingly priced (~$6?). i could eat it everyday. all my friends love the ramen, so they're obviously doing something right there. they also have pretty great appetizers as well.\n\nbe aware that the sitting room is really small. i think my parent's living room is about the size of the whole space. as a result, there can sometimes be a really long wait. the longest i'm ever willing to wait for cheap food is 30 minutes, and i've waited that long for monta. but there have been times where my wait has been less than ten minuted on a friday night. so it really depends on when you get there, and luck honestly. i will say that it is a terrible place for large parties though. it's always been such a hassle coming here with more than four people. if you want to try it out, i would recommend going with only one other person, maximum two, for your first visit. the shorter wait will make your experience much more enjoyable!", 
            "this place is very much... alright.\n\ncame here because a few friends raved about it and it looked like it had amazing reviews, came half an hour before opening time just to make sure we wouldn't have to wait too long. luckily my group of about 20 just barely fit behind a few other couples. very small place that seats less than 30?\n\nthe ramen wasn't bad but it definitely wasn't all that great. i'm from la so i guess i probably am lucky to have much more options but you would figure vegas has the best of all worlds. compare to anything else i've ever had around la, this was much more salty, portions were a tad bit smaller, other than the saltiness not that flavorful. menu here is small but some japanese restaurants tend to be so that wasn't too big of a surprise.\n\nyou definitely have to be a pork lover because that's pretty much all they have, if i remember right they have approximately four different ramen choices, and a few other side dishes like <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and gyoza.\n\nif you are a local i'm sure this may be as good as it gets? but if you're from out of town only try this place if there is no wait. totally not worth a wait.", 
            "awesome food but be prepared for a long wait. \n\ncame here based on the awesome reviews. showed up a little after 1pm on a weekday. we waited easily more than an hour. this place is super tiny, but the turnover seemed as speedy as it could be. it was cold outside and there was no shelter from the cold. i would never wait to eat at this place during the heat of summer!!! impossible!!! \n\nwhen we finally got seated, our orders were taken promptly. surprised to find a little cubby to stash my stuff under the bar!!! clever!!! i loved my sapporo on tap. sitting at the bar gave us a bird's eye view on how the food, especially the pork roasts were prepared. the logs of pork roasts were seared on something that looks like a huge george forman grill. oh!!!!! if you could only hear the sizzle of the hot grill & the smell the wonderful umami flavor of roast pork!!! the roasts are then placed into an oven and cooked until tender. this pork is then cut into nice generous slices to garnish the ramen or cut up into the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. i take the time to mention what i witnessed because you feast not only with your palate but also with your other senses as well. i love that they roasted the pork & didn't just boil or steam them to oblivion. this is probably what makes this ramen house so yummy...the care in how the pork is prepared. \n\nwhat we ordered...\n\nspicy <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>...the most popular ramen on yelp. also highly recommended by those drooling to get in. i hear that corn & butter add-ons are a must!! \nthe broth was delicious, the ramen noodles were cooked perfectly, and the ramen was garnished with nice big round slices of roast pork. in most ramen houses, the chasu is often half fat... although there is nothing wrong with some good fat. these slices were mostly meaty. yay!!! \n\n<mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>...also popular on yelp, but the pork in my bowl wasn't crispy at all. good, but not as good as the....\n\nkimchee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>....surprisingly very good!! i am usually skeptical to order \"korean\" items at japanese restaurants and vice versa, but it tasted so good!!! the big juicy pieces of pork made the rice so decadent!!! yum!!!!\n\ni didn't take off any stars for the wait...they can't help that they're a fabulous popular place!!! :d",

            "visited this small restaurant based on popular review. indeed, this restaurant is so popular that you will have to wait in the line. another reason why you'll have to wait is that the dining room can probably fit about 30 dining guests at each time, half of the guests will need to be on the bar table. me and my wife are lucky to get a table after about 45 minutes of wait with about 6 parties waiting in front of us for dinner (by the way, you will need to check yourself in as there are only 2 very busy waitresses). the menu was very simple - noodle, <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> or some small variety of specialty. there are flyers if 2 today's special pasted on the wall, which we ordered - spicy <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>. we also ordered a <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> bowl (basically some fish eggs with sesame over small bowl of rice). i would not say it is super delicious, but it is really worth the price. the ramen was very flavorful (can be a little salty). you also have the option to add another noodle if you still feel hungry after you finish the bowl - i think most people will do since there was actually not much noodle in it. for us, the bowl of rice does the job. the rice is nothing special and almost had no flavor. i just seasoned the rice with the broth of the ramen i had. overall, not bad, and it is definitely worth the price. but if you don't have much time in vegas, you can safely skip this place as it is not worth that much of wait, unless you really want to save money in your trip.", 
            "authentic ramen noodle, not those milky <mark>Butter</mark> broth that is overwhelming after two sips. their gyoza was amazzzinggg, filling is pork+veggie. does not smell or taste like old meat with tons of ingredients to mask it. \nkim chi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was so flavorful , not too salty either. however, it is a tad bit oily for me, but what's <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> without a little oil huh? \nthe place is small and have about five small tables and the rest of the seatings are located at the noodle bar( sits about 8 people) \nwe were so full and only paid 34 bucks!!(2\nramen noodles, <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, gyoza)\n\ni strongly suggest trying out this place asap!",

(i had the black garlic tonkotsu one). great <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. when i'm back in town, i'm coming back. this is the real thing. i shouldn't be surprised because it was recommended by someone i know to be a real food sophisticate.",

            "monta ramen serves \"kurume\" style <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> from fukuoka. it's a broth made from selected pork bones and special soy sauce imported from japan. nice!!\nsmall but clean ramen spot, monta always seems like there is a long wait out the door. \nthe kuro ramen was black & impressive, the tokotsu ramen was creamy and deep. both had thick and rich pork based broth with thin, unrisen noodles. the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was well mannered with excellent seasoning & the gyoza was surprisingly crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. \nservice was o-kay ....most likey because it was super busy with only two waitresses on the floor. the whole time, i felt rushed. the glares from the hungry customers waiting for a table to the right of us was piercing & hurting. \nother than that, yes! i'm a fan!!\n\ngood for kids: yes\nhighchair: yes", 
            "i'm giving three because i need to visit another few ramen stops before i say it's the tops. \nit's a bit small, but the service is quick once seated and the food is amazing! \ni had the spicy bowl with egg and\nkimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. \ni will say..... i've been thinking about having some more noodles\never since.\nnot only are they delicious, but they are cheap! we only spent $27 on our bill. \nvery impressed.", 
            "went on sunday 9-20-15 around 12:45 pm.  this is located on the <mark>Corn</mark> of spring mountain and decatur in the same shopping center as raku, kung-fu tea, big wong, and curry zen.  \n\nyou go inside and write your name on the list and they'll call you when a table's ready.  we put our name on the list and went over to kung-fu tea to wait.  when we went back over, they had called us and crossed our name off the list so we had to put our name on the list again and wait all over again.  oops.  but when they called my name they had a high chair ready for my boy and i thought that was pretty great.  \n\n$11.78 got me a bowl of <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> and a small order of <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.  the ramen was pretty great but dat <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> tho....dang it was awesome.  i absolutely loved it. when i go back (and i definitely will) i will just ask for a trough full of that <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.  i only got 4-5 bites before my baby stole it and stuffed it all in his face.  it is a strange type of rice and i think it has pork belly in it.  \n\ncheap, delicious, eats.  woohoo! as good as it gets!", 
            "came to vegas, cousin suggest that i come here .  ummm ummm good ..the soup was thick full of flavor,, pork melts in your mouth and oh that <mark>Kimchi</mark> <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> , say no more just chow!", 
            "came here for lunch and it was super packed! i wasn't aware there was a sign in sheet so i was kinda just standing there until someone came behind me and signed in. thankfully he said i could go before him anyways! wait was only about 5 minutes, but since there were no seats available i had to wait outside in the heat. definitely not a place where you have an intimate meal, but i spent 45 minutes there without feeling they were rushing me out the door.\n\nthe food was pretty good. i got the tonkotsu shoyu, <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, and <mark>Green Tea</mark>. the ramen soup and noodles were very good, although i didn't like the meat. it says it's pork but it tasted like turkey and a mix of something else so i didn't eat it. the rice was good too with soy sauce but was a bit too eggy for my liking. \n\nservice was good! was asked twice if i needed refills, check came quickly, and just about everyone said thank you as i left! i would definitely come back just not get the pork or whatever that meat was.", 
            "don't let the lines sway you this place is worth the wait!  the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> was an eye opening gastronomic experience. after years of ordering various phos and miso soups this broth blew every other out of the park. it's ruined us forever. with a creamy consistency that rivals milk or melted butter this stock made from pork bones, fat, and collagen is heaven in a bowl. add to that some amazing thin noodles (you can order thicker noodles if you desire) and throw in the basic toppings of <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, two slices of chashu, bamboo shoots and kikurage mushrooms. omg it was to die for!  there are many additional toppings you can order to customize and make it perfect for your tastes. \n\nwe also ordered the gyoza and the regular <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. after reading all the reviews we had to give them a try. the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was good, but not fabulous. perhaps there's a difference if you order the takana <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>?  the gyoza were great. thin pillows stuffed with vegatables and pork. hot and delish!  \n\nlucky for us, we're in town for a couple of weeks so we'll definitely be back!",

            "i scoped this place out before my husband and i went on vacation to las vegas and couldn't wait to try the ramen. i ordered the tonkontsu ramen and added the spicy sauce to the broth. i was a little disappointed that the sauce didn't make the broth super spicy, but it did add a little heat. my only complaint is that the broth was a little on the salty side, but it was still flavorful. the noodles were nice and chewy and the bamboo shoots were still crunchy, which i like! we also ordered the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and it was delicious! i wish we would have ordered the kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> because i'm sure that would have been yummy too! you have to sign in when you first get there, so they know who to serve next. we got there a little after they opened and they were packed! we didn't have to wait too long though and service was fast and friendly.", 
            "my family and i have been coming here for the last five years off and on. sometimes once a month and there have been gaps as big as 9 months. we always have a pleasant experience and always have quality food. while there have been some slight inconsistencies over the years, we have almost always been happy with the food and service. this place is tiny and always busy. my favorites are the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with corn, 2 eggs, and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> and also the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. my kids adore this place and are always accommodated. the service is fast and the food is very reasonably priced. while i'm sure there are arguments for best ramen in las vegas, monta is in the lead for me.", 
            "delicious <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. seems almost steamed not greasy and oily like some\nmy friends love the ramen. price is great\na cute and cozy joint", 
            "been coming here for years. no where else can compete with the broth. i've tried other ramen restaurants in the area. they are good but don't come close. best best best ramen. only drawback is the wait time. the gyoza and <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> are also amazing.", 
            "yes, there's always usually a wait. sometimes you'll get lucky and you'll just wait a few minutes and sometimes you'll wait till a group finishes their meal to get sat. it's a really small space. but oh man the ramen is delicious! i usually get the tonkotsu shoyu with additional egg and corn. yesterday i tried the kuro ramen which had black garlic oil and it didn't disappoint. the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> here is also a must. the service is usually fast and friendly. my only complaint is that once in a while, the broth is too salty. oh and yeah don't expect you're gonna sit around and chat with your group after your meal because you'll get some serious death stares from hungry customers waiting to get sat lol", 
            "asked a friend where to meet for lunch and they picked out this place. it was 4 of us and it took about a hour to be seated around 11am on a weekday. wouldn't recommend coming here during busy hours with a larger group because of limited seating. \n\nordered the special on the spicy ramen and it was very good but needed a bit more spice in my opinion,  also the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was really good. would come here again if they didnt have the wait.", 
            "i love their ramen. it is to die for. also, their beef belly <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> taste like heaven. get their tonkatsu ramen with the flavored egg topping. trust me.", 
            "first time going with my parents and ordered <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> along with shoyu and <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> and it was amazing! nice small mom and pop shop and seemed like it's always busy so expect to wait, but it's worth it!", 
            "first time here and man, that food was soooo good! perfect food for this cold weather! the only reason this place is short one star from 5 is because of the size of the restaurant. most ramen places are pretty small but because their food is awesome, they shouldn't shy away from expanding because the food itself sells. the staff is very quick and efficient, they try to get people in as fast as they can and they are pretty quick with the needs of the customers! we ordered the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>, <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>, gyoza, <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and kimchee. everything we had was tasty and the pricing is definitely reasonable!!! will be coming here again.. hopefully it won't be as busy and hopefully they can expand the restaurant size in the future.. but count on us as future regulars!", 
            "arrived at 11:20, still had to wait, there were big parties of 7, 6 ahead of us,  i think max seating about 25. got in after 30 minutes,\nfinished our food for 2 of us at 12:20 pm. i had the kim-chi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and the spicy tonkatsu ramen and wife have regular ramen. soup base taste was good, noodles were little over cooked for me. i been to a ramen place in orange county, ca. that will carter to the hardness of the noodles.", 
            "my wife and i stumbled upon monta ramen while visiting town. i love to get away from the strip where the price of food is reasonable. the restaurant is small and busy so prepare to wait a little. i has the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> which was excellent. my wife tried one of the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> dishes....superb.", 
            "hands down the best ramen in vegas. i've been coming here for years and keep meaning to write a review. everything on the menu is really good. in addition to the ramen try the kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>. you won't be disappointed.", 
            "my friend and i got here around 7:30 p.m. and were lucky to grab the last two seats at the counter.   we got the tonkotsu-<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> and it was quite good.  the egg was cooked just right, it was running and i loved how it was perfect with the soup..  the noodles had a good bounce to it , but the pork had too much fat.  i felt like my portion of the pork was small and didn't have much meat.  it had more fat than meat, which is why i lowered my rating.   however, when i come back here, i need to try their kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, the table next to me ordered it  and it looked soooo good!!  it takes a while for the food to come, so if you super hungry prepare to wait.  when i left this place, i saw there was a large crowded gathered outside.  i'll make note of that the next time i'm back", 
            "absolutely delicious. 30$ (including tip) tried the spicey tonkotsu. the chazu rice and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>. the pork gyoza was great and had some special <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.  the flavor of the soup was so good i was ready to go back for more the next day."

            "hakata style ramen originates in northern kyushu.  it is in my opinion the best ramen you can get, with maybe kurume being at the same level.\nstart with a thick pork broth made with boiled pork bones to release the collagen into the soup.  next, add some of the best noodles i've ever tasted.  throw on some basic toppings like roast pork, <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, mushrooms and bamboo, and that's your standard bowl.  they also have one with miso.\nthe menu here is very simple.  there are the two bowls of ramen, and additional toppings, then there are a few small rice dishes (mostly <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> with some topping), and pot stickers.\neverything is amazing, be it service, staff, taste, decor.  there is not a good enough rating to describe this place.\ncome on in today, and look for them next to raku, and say hello to your new favorite restaurant.", 
            "still going here every week if not more often.\nthey finally have a sign up so they're a bit easier to spot.\nanyway, i'm glad everyone else is liking this place.  i don't know why the bad reviews on the gyoza, because it's right up my alley.  and yes, they do use different noodles for the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> versus the others.  the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> is hakata style, and is known for the very thin, very delicious noodles.  they cook theirs a little more here than they do in hakata, but it's still great.\nanyway, having tried the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>, i'd say give this one a shot too.  it's their tonkotsu soup with miso added to give it a rich nutty flavor that really sticks to your ribs.\ni also have to recommend the chahan (<mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>), it is super peppery and delicious.  just the way i remember it from my highschool days in japan.\na second note.  anything you don't like on your ramen, let them know.  i keep going with picky eaters (1 vegan, others just picky), and they've made a vegan kimchi chahan, as well as bowls of ramen with extra this, no that, whatever you ask for.\nas always, they're eager to please, and definitely worth seeing, so help monta stay busy, and maybe even expand.  i would love to see more of these guys.", 
            "nice place!  they are always eager to please their customers.  the food is tasty.  i love the hiyashi chuka, kimchee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, and an iced <mark>Green Tea</mark>.  \n\ni feel like such a fatty after walking away each time, but it's damn good food.  will visit again and again.", 
            "after stumbling through various japanese restaurants that serve decent bowls of ramen, i've finally found a place that specializes at it. in fact, it's pretty much all they serve. their menu reminded me of an in-n-out menu: you either order a <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> or a <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>. if you don't want ramen, there's <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and some basic japanese apps. not much in terms of variety. but, if this is what you're in the mood for, they do it great.\n\ni started off with an order of gyoza for an app. simple stuff and what you'd expect. nothing to write home about. then, came the steamy bowl of <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>. the broth was a real winner here. a lot of places that i have tried never really got the broth quite right. this was one place where the flavor really hit the spot. even though it's a scorching 100+ degrees outside, a routine stop for a bowl of ramen here is worth having. next time i drop by, i will probably give their <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> a shot.\n\nmonta is a tiny, quaint little place, though not very crowded when i went. it started out empty when we walked in, but started filling up as we were slurping up our noodles. i wouldn't expect a wait for a table, but i could see it happening if this place picks up in popularity.", 
            "one saturday afternoon, i finally had a chance to try ramen @monta noodle house. right after i entered the noodle shop, all the employees were shouting loudly in japanese usual expression in turn: irasshaimase, irasshaimase! i felt so welcomed :p \n\nso, i decided to try the 'tonkotsu' with boiled egg since it was one of their special dishes & highly recommended by the server. she brought some of the minced garlic and pickled ginger with it.  without hesitation, i put a little bit of garlic in the soup just because i love garlic so much :)  i could totally taste of very rich and milky pork bone broth in my mouth. the noodle was very thin and straight. one of the toppings that really stands out was the sliced pork, the 'chashu'. it was very tender and soft. \noverall, i was happy with the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> but, i liked the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> with lots of bean sprouts @shuseki little better. if someone wants to try richness of the broth & the amount of oil they want, the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> is the one... \nnext time, i still want to try their kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> & cold(chilled) noodle(hiyashi-chuka). \n\non my way out, i heard, \" arigatoh gozaimashita!\" once again, they were thanking customers and i was pleased with the service @monta!!!", 
            "on my first visit to the monta (ellis) noodle house i had an inclination that it was worthy of four sexy stars. after eating here, i'm quite certain of that.\n\nyour not going to drive past it on spring mountain in case you think you missed it because it's all the way in the back of the plaza.  \n\nif your a rameniac like myself.  this place is the new kid on the block and a must-try.  we know las vegas isn't exactly a hot-bed for ramen but monta meets my needs.\n\nthe <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> was delicious, it's probably one of the best in town. we waited 15 minutes, but definitely worth the wait. although many have first timers have said it wasn't worth.  monta wouldn't stand a chance vs. some ramen spots i frequent in the bay area. but all of my friends and they were all asian said it couldn't be better.  the kikurage was yummy as well.  but stay away from the specials like the kim-chi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.  but who the hell goes to a ramen house for <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>?  duh!", 
            "allright, i went back for lunch today to monta. it was 3:45 in the afternoon, and it wasen't busy like last sunday. therefore, it wasen't as ungodly hot and stifling inside as it was last time.\n\ni ate the whole bowl of ramen again. i have begun to really grasp just what makes the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> so good. it's savory and not overly salty. in fact, it's un-ramen-like in that regard. (ok, i'll admit to normally eating a shoyu-based one many many times) the broth is actually a bit creamy (very addictive) and the stuff inside the bowl is tops.\n\ncan i tell you how much in love with the marinated boiled/almost soft egg in it, aka nitamago? it's so damn great! if you like hardboiled or softboiled egg, you'll love it i guarantee.\n\ni have to try the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and their gyoza. they smell very very good, but i have to have more people with me to get it all eaten! when the weather cools down, i'm going to be here lots!\n\nbtw, they have a very funky restroom!", 
            "yes. if you sit at the bar, there is a shelf underneath where you can stow your purse, baby, or other personal belongings. yes. \n\nalso the counter is made out of this beautiful hunk of nice solid wood. what is that? walnut? it's nice. \n\nso anyways. this place is located next a korean bbq and raku. makes me wonder if it's the same owner as raku? \n\nthe ramen is okay. anyone that has had the standard of ramen (daikokuya in la, hello?) will tell you that monta isn't as good, but for vegas, it'll do. \n\nmonta only does three kinds of ramen: tonkatsu, shoyu, and miso (around $7-8). all are decent. the menu has short descriptions of each for us gaijin. there is also a short list of accouterment like egg, butter, corn, and spring onions available for nominal additional costs. i recommend the butter. it is exquisite. \n\nthe very limited menu has gyoza, <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> (around $3), kim chi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> (not very good). sometimes they have specials written on the white board on the wall. \n\non the front of the menu, there's a short history of ramen. the reading lists the source: ramenlicious.com\n\nthey have a few beers including asahi and something domestic, maybe bud. my friend got a $3 glass of asahi. it was like a double shot of beer.  \n\nthey do not make their own noodles, at least not on the day we came. \n\nthe unisex bathroom is practical and has a weird interior design nonsensicalness to it. meh. \n\nthe joint is pretty small. a bar that accommodates eight and maybe five four-tops. \n\nall of the staff is japanese. one of the cooks looks hardcore prison cook with the burns all up and down his forearm. heck yeah. \n\nthe restaurant is small and will possibly never have air conditioning. but there is a plethora of fans running and the back door remains open on the hottest of days. when some one opens the front door to leave or enter, the joint turns into a wind tunnel. \n\nthey're only open til 11p. i'm sure they could stay open later and do just fine with the late night belligerent crowd. \"whoo, i'm so wasted! i need lots of calories in my system. whoo!\"\n\nwatch tampopo. \n\n\n* off the strip, non-casino", 
            "it's on my monthly must have menu.   <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> is the best out of the 3 ramen selections on the menu imo.   creamy savory broth, perfectly cooked noodle and the tender chashu (pork) make it very addictive.  this is not something you can cook at home.  the pork has the perfect amount of fat makes the ramen rich and flavorful without being greasy.  you can tell it takes a lot of time and effort to prepare the pork.  their other side dishes (<mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, gyoza, pork belly...) are all very delicious as well.  service was ok and bareable as most of the small scale asian restaurants. \n\nthe downside of the restaurant:\n--the broth is a bit saltier than i'd prefer.\n--i'd prefer more chashu (pork) pieces per ramen order for the price they're charging\n--sometimes they run out of extra chashu.\n--it's always hot in there.  they need to invest some money in ac.\n--i felt like i was being ripped off a little when i went there the first time because it seems a little overpriced for the portion and the ingredients.  however, now i'm totally addicted and have no choice cause it's very yummy and they don't have many competitions.", 
            "i saw that there was a new ramen shop in las vegas so i decided to check it out.  from the outside it doesnt look like much and the inside is no different.  you would say its just a hole in the wall place.  they have a very limited menu since the kitchen is so small and thats understandable.  \ni ordered the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>, gyoza and the small <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.  i was amazed by how delicious it was.  i am japanese so i like a good ramen from time to time.  the gyoza (potstickers) was home made.  trust me i have eaten enough store bought gyozas to know the difference.  oh! and the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was very tasty as well not mushy like other places.  each grain of rice perfectly seperated from eachother..  \nwith that being said the only 2 turn offs is the price.  althouggh a lot of the pricing is dead on correct.  there are few items on the menu that i feel is over priced for the amount they give.  another thing is the temperture inside the restaurant.  i guess they dont have any ac so they use a fan to cool down the room.  after eating hot soup i started sweating like a horse.  \noverall i am satisfied with the product and i will be going back to eat again... that's for sure...", 
            "yum yum yum! \n\nmy friend's cousin recommended this place to me. she has family in vegas and this is one of her favorite hole in the wall spots.\n\nwhen i first walked in, i wasn't too sure about the place. no air conditioning, just a fan. the place is super tiny. we ordered the <mark>Chashu Bowl</mark>, <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, and <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>. \n\nthe pork in the <mark>Chashu Bowl</mark> and <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> melts in you mouth. it is that delicious. both had very good flavor. the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> also was very good. all the food felt like it was home-made and in a very positive way. it brought back the comforts of home.\n\nwhen i am back in town, i will for sure do my best to visit this place.\n\n i really wish there was a place like this in san diego.", 
            "finally got around to visiting the latest addition to ramen houses in vegas - monta noodle house.  conveniently located on spring mountain, right next to the super busy raku.  (smart business choice i would say.)\n\nthis place is bare bones - as in minimal tables and a bar, so don't come with a large group.  their super simple menu gets you in and out fast!  (a couple who came in around the same time we did had ordered, gotten their food, finished, paid and left by the time we were eating ours.)\n\ni went for their most popular dish - <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> ($6.95).  the main component is the broth, which is made up of boiling pork bones, fat, and collagen for hours.  this results in a cloudy white broth and would usually have the consistency of a thin gravy.  it automatically comes with two slices of char sui, takenoko (bamboo sprouts), kikurage (type of mushroom), and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>.  their char siu (barbecued pork) definitely isn't like the chinese kind, but definitely tasty.\n\nthe husband went for the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> ($7.25), which is ultimately bean paste blended with the pork broth giving it a richer flavor.  this was also good, and quite filling.\n\nwe also shared a regular order of the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> ($5.75).  it sits on a bed of rice, with fresh scallions and pickled red ginger.  i adore pork belly and the next time i come here, i'm going to order a dish of this all to myself.  it's fatty and good.  \n\na side dish we added on was the <mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark> ($1.50).  you can have this on the side or in your broth.  it's pickled mustard greens that may or may not be to your liking.  it's adds a different texture and taste to your ramen.  other toppings you can add on included nitamago (seasoned hard boiled egg), corn, butter, kimchee, and more char siu or <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>.\n\nthere's only one other kind of ramen they offer here - shoyu, which means soy sauce based.  you can also add extra noodles for $2 more if you save your soup and ask for \"kaedama.\"  other dishes available are gyoza, <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, kim chee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, takana <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, cha siu bowl, and <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> (marinated polluck roe).\n\nservice was good.  with two waitresses, they keep the flow of business going great and refilled beverages as needed.  it's not the best place to loiter with the limited seating and all, but definitely a great place to grab a quick bite and go.\n\nupdate!  \ni returned the following month for my own bowl of the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>.  this time the pork belly was sliced thinner, which wasn't to my personal preference.  guess it depends on who is working the kitchen that day.", 
            "i just came back from japan and this is really close to being the real thing.    i've tried all broths (shoyu, miso, tonkotsu) and they're all very good.  <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and the bowls are all legit.  all japanese staff.  best thing thats happened to vegas since raku.", 
            "last week i ate at monta four nights out of seven. i don't think i'll ever get tired of their delicious ramen - only three different options, but with many toppings available. and if i do, i'll move onto the kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> or <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>. the gyoza are pretty meh though. i won't get those again. \n\ni'm so glad there's finally a simple, authentic japanese ramen spot in vegas. it's small, it's hot and it's usually crowded. like the best ramen places in l.a. i used to drive the five hours just to get a bowl, now i can hit up this place between trips. huzzah.", 
            "this charming restaurant offering the best ramen in vegas is located two doors down from raku in the seoul plaza on spring mountain, and could be one of the smallest restaurants in the city. monta is actually so pea-sized that if you come during peak times you'll almost certainly have to wait before you can sit down. don't let this be a deterrant, just keep it in mind before you go, and get there quickly before even more people find out about it.\n\nhalf of the restaurant is an open kitchen, so your dinner music consists of the clanking of woks and pans accompanied by the chatter of the waitresses, cooks, and other patrons. you can sit at the bar if you really want to be part of the action, or if none of the five tables are available. though the vibe is nice and busy, the waitresses are sweet and won't rush you through your meal.\n\nthere are three types of ramen to choose from; tonkatsu (rich, cloudy, almost creamy broth); shoyu (light and delicate soy sauce based broth); and miso (somewhere in the middle of the other consistencies and tastes like...miso). the shoyu and <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> come with chewy, thicker noodles which i much prefer in texture and taste to the thinner, less al dente noodles that come in the tonkatsu (you can sub if you like). all three varieties of the ramen cost around $7 and also come with chasu (tender, roasted, fatty pork), scallions, kikurage (mushroom), takenoko (bamboo shoots), and scallions. you can then customize your ramen with little extras that include perfectly coddled egg, butter, more pork, and my personal favorite, takana, or pickled <mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark>. these don't cost a lot, so customize away. also, be sure to add some of the fantastic accoutrement residing in your condiment tray such as pickled ginger strips and minced garlic.\n\nyou won't find much other than ramen on the menu, just a handful of appetizers and sides. of these i've had the gyoza ($5.95), which were excellent one time but not cooked correctly another, and <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> with takana. the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> is almost as good as the ramen, so if you aren't in the mood for soup get this instead. another plus is cheap beer ($2.50 for domestic).\n\ni can't think of any other meal i'd rather enjoy on a cold day than a steaming bowl of hearty home-made soup, so i plan on going to monta frequently this winter. if it continues to get even busier, however, i may be taking it to go in a perfectly packed parcel. i brought ramen home for my husband once and was amazed at the care put into ensuring the soup would be just as good at home as it is in the restaurant. the noodles were wrapped in their own little pouch, waiting to be cooked until they reached our stove, and all the other ingredients were individually wrapped to keep them in their peak state. attention to detail really separates the boys from the (ra)men.", 
            "if anyone read my review on the ramen restaurant in anaheim recently, i am so happy to announce that the wonderful ramen experience there has been found at monta!\n\nthe one thing that made me fall in love with the other restaurant's ramen was the melt-in-your-mouth chasu.  monta has just that.  their ramen is delicious, the meat is wonderfully soft and flavorful, and their <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> is do darn good.  i could eat four orders of their <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> in one sitting!  \n\ni'm glad that i found more traditional ramen in vegas--finally!  monta is one hell of a ramen restaurant.  i believe that i'm retiring from the other ramen places in vegas and sticking with monta from now on.  if you haven't tried it and were looking on yelp for some assistance as to whether or not you should--you should.\n\ni fall for noodles made with love, and monta serves a bowl of it every order they fill.  if i could serenade food, i'd ask monta's ramen and chasu to marry me.", 
            "my wife and i finally got to try this restaurant last night.  from all the reviews, we were excited to try this place out.  wow!!  we are fans.  the tonkotsu and <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> were excellent.  the thick noodle was cooked to perfection. the broth, in my opinion even tastes better than some of the restaurants in tokyo.  also the char siu is very flavourful, but a little too thinly sliced.  the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was also very good.  i am so happy that we finally have an authentic ramen noodle house in my backyard.  will definitely be back for more delicious ramen and broth.   i want to give 4.5 stars but i can't.  1/2 star off for those thin sliced char siu.", 
            "man, oh man!  the tonkatsu ramen was sooooo goood!  it was a cool day in las vegas and what better way to warm up than with a big bowl of ramen.  very tasty rich broth.  the ramen noodles was cooked al dente.  the pork slices were actually slices of belly pork and when you touched it, it kind of melts into the broth!  oooooh, delicious!  i had my ramen with the boiled egg.  there were condiments on the table and i put some of that pureed garlic into my soup to give it an extra garlic kick!  \n\nwe also ordered one <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and a gyoza appetizer.  yummy!  all items gold stars!  \n\nthe restaurant is tiny with 4 tables of 4 and 1 table of 2 and a l-shaped  bar counter, facing the open kitchen.  you can watch the cooks make the ramen in front of you.  the wait staff are all very polite.  turnover is fast as people come and go all the time we were at the restaurant for lunch today.\n\ndefinitely will come back to monta noodle house!", 
            "overall, i'm giving this place 4 stars but the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> deserves 5 stars by itself.  i loved the flavor of the soup and how the noodles were cooked just right.  my brother and bf were hesitant to go because they've had not so good ramen before but both of them loved the ramen they ordered (tonkotsu and shoyu).  my brother loved it so much, he went again 2 days later.  i'll definitely be going back again and again for the ramen!  and next time, i'll try the extra toppings..but it says a lot about the flavor of the soup when i loved it plain the way it came.\n\nso why the 4 stars?  we also ordered kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and the dumplings.  the dumplings were ok, nothing special about it.  it came slightly burnt and were all stuck together.  the kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was ok too, but more sour than the normal ones i've had.  \n\nstick to the ramen and you'll love this place!", 
            "thank the gods las vegas has a place like this.  i was addicted to the pork at gomen in anaheim until i came here.  \n\nthe order consisted of:\ngyoza\n<mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>\n<mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>\n<mark>Chashu Bowl</mark>\n\ni found myself anticipating each round of umami goodness because each dish was devoured so quickly.  those gyoza were nice and crispy and tasted great.  the definite star was the pork.  i found myself assuring i got a piece in every bit of the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.  the chashu in the ramen was a perfect combination and that <mark>Chashu Bowl</mark> was just pure pork indulgence.  we even ordered some <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and extra chashu to go because i was sure to be craving that pork later in the night, and sure enough i did.  i'm craving\n\nthis place is an easy choice.  it's a small menu but everything is done so well.  great prices for the quaity of food you get.  you can't go wrong with anything here imo.", 
            "we ordered the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> and <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.  i did enjoy the soup but i felt the noodles were a bit al dente.  i've had better <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, it just had tons of chunky onions in it.  \n\na quick fix to my ramen craving in vegas.", 
            "finally! a very good ramen joint in vegas. this place is much more the real japanese ramen joint than the (now defunct) togoshi ramen.\n\nmonta is in a small strip mall on sprint mountain rd, just west of decatur. it is very easy to miss as you go by. and the shop is very small, with only four 4 place table, 1 2 place table, and about 10 counter seats. they only accept cash so beware.\n\ni recently learned of this place right here on yelp and had to give it a try. like others on this forum, i grew up eating fantastic ramen all over japan. and have long been searching... i was elated when santouka came to the states and even more ecstatic when local joints like orenchi (cupertino, ca) that are very much like the ramen i used to know in japan... started to pop up.\n\ni'd like to preface this review with the fact that i like tonkotsu, thick chijirimen (wavy noodles) usually, so i am usually biased towards that. monta has 4 basic types of ramen flavors: tonkotsu, shoyu, miso, and new (at least it said new today) tonkotsu shoyu which is a combination of the tonkotsu and shoyu broths.\n\ntonkotsu, of course, is pork based broth. the shoyu uses chicken broth (according to monta), but i also detected some dashi (fish based) in there as well. tonkotsu, and tonkotsu shoyu uses thin straight noodles. shoyu and miso uses the thick wavy noodles. each ramen @  $6.95 comes with 2 slices of char shu, kikurage (woodear mushrooms), memma (seasoned bamboo shoots), and chopped <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>. there are other toppings available as mentioned in other reviews, along with kaedama (literally means \"replacement ball\") extra noodles.\n\nkaedama is usually ordered as you go, not in the beginning. this is because if get it at the same time as your ramen, then the noodles either go cold, or get overcooked. this is one of the reasons why i do not like places that have a \"large\" size. by the time you're half way through, the noodles are too overcooked. i commend monta for doing the kaedama the right way.\n\nanyway, i was @ monta today, thu, at 2 pm, and the place had a waiting list 8 deep! it took us abobut 20 minutes to get seated, and as we got seated, the wait line even got longer. ok... my expectations are way high... but be cautious... this, after all, is the only ramen only joint in vegas....\n\ni ordered the tonkotsu shoyu with nitamago and extra char shu. my wife had the shoyu with nitamago. we also had gyoza. in the kitchen, there are basically 2 guys preparing the dishes. one guy that does the ramen, another that does the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and others. and with the packed house, the service was slow.\n\nbut when the ramen finally came, i was not disappointed. despite my doubts, the tonkotsu shoyu had a wonderful balance and marriage of pork and chicken broth. my wife's shoyu, i believe due to the chicken stock, had a very mellow aspect to it which also gave the tonkotsu a very mellow and non-overpowering flavor. i finished the broth to the last drop, including my wife's shoyu/chicken broth.\n\nthe noodles... my thin noodles were not overcooked, and about just right when my ramen came out. but because of its thinness, by the time i got half way through my ramen (and i'm a relatively quick ramen eater, beating my wife by a good 10 minutes :-)) was way overcooked and mushy soft. next time, i will see if they will cook it less (katame, or as i do at kyushu jyangara in tokyo, bari-kata... crispy as in ironed with starch). my wife's chijirimen was very good with good amount of al dente,a and the chewiness one expects in good ramen.  if i can't get them to cook the thin noodles to super al dente, then my backup plan is to have them use the thick noodles in the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>.\n\nthe boiled egg is soft boiled, but the yolk does not run. i like my soft boiled egg a with a bit more runny yolk. but nevertheless it was still good. the char shu was one the the better ones i had in the states. very tender, melts in your mouth, with good flavor... not too over powering, not too bland. the slices were on the thin side, but i got a total of 8 slices by ordering the extra char shu topping ($2.50). \n\nin summary both the tonkotsu shoyu and <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> were done very well, with a good balance of broth, noodles, and toppings in a dish that came together very very well. too many times, i have been to ramen places in the states where the broth may be good, but noodles lack, or vice versa, or even where all the individual ingredients are good, but the finished product just doesn't cut it.\n\nthe gyoza, unlike one reviewer here, i though were also very good. i would beg to differ that this is not like store bought gyoza as it is stuffed with pork whereas the store bought ones are more heavy on the nappa cabbage and not stuffed. the flavor is also very good, however, i like my gyoza wet...that is with a bit more juice as you bite into them.\n\nin the end though, i give monta 5 stars even with the few deficiencies. monta, in my book, share the top honors with orenchi in cupertino,", 
            "i admit that monta has the best ramen anywhere in vegas.  the stuff they serve at ichiza and shuseki has nothing on them!  the noodles are fresh and the broth, whether tonkatsu, miso, or shoyu, is always steaming hot and extremely flavorful.  i appreciate that it's the real stuff and not the packaged, powder crap other places use.  \n\nyes, monta is a noodle house but their <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> is just as good, if not better.  for someone who doesn't really like <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, i would come just for that.  their gyoza was just okay.  i've had better.   \n\neven though the place is (extremely) small, i like that it's cozy.  there was only one time when i actually had to wait for a table, but as always, the wait was worth it.  \n\na basic bowl of ramen will cost you almost $8.  that's kind of steep, especially in the economy that we're in now.  an extra $1.50 for a hard boiled egg also seems a bit much, don't you think?  i guess it's really quality over quantity with this place. \n\nfour out of five stars because food quality is good, service is good, but pricing isn't the best.  this place is always a pleasure though.  if you haven't been, you probably should soon.", 
            "best. ramen. ever. i suggest the tonkatsu ramen and the kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. soooo delicious.", 
            "rick moonen (top chef master's contestant and owner of rm seafood in mandalay bay) was spotted in this hole of a wall.\ndespite how low his restaurant ratings are, the fact that he chose to eat at this specific noodle house says a little something something about their food. \n\nto keep this short and sweet: \n- friendly service\n- was a wait around 12:30 (prime lunch time) but still got seated and served within 30 min\n- tonkatsu ramen= perfect portions. i ended up slurping up more of the broth than the noodles which was very surprising (i never drink the broth)\n- small <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> seemed small at first for the four of us but was just the right amount with the ramen. \n- lots of ginger and garlic sauces for unlimited consumption\n- parking lot big in plaza\n \ni want more!!!", 
            "monta is definitely one of the better ramen shops in las vegas. its in the same strip mall as raku on decatur/ spring mtn. \n\nmonta reminds us of japan's ramen shops...its all about order your food, eat your food, and get out, so the next group can eat. it's not a posh restaurant, minimal tables/ seats. the restaurant holds at most 30 people (5 tables of 4 seats and about 10 seats on the counter), so if you go with a large party, just sit wherever you can and when you can or you might be waiting for awhile.\n\nthe menu is simple. miso, tonkatsu, or <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>. my favorite is...all of them. huge stock pots in the back have been boiling bones and veg for hours to create the backbone of their heavenly broth.  i seem to be on a tonkatsu ramen kick lately with its hearty broth... you could add some thickener to the broth and you would have a damn good gravy. they give you a good amount of ramen, a few slices of tender charsiu, bamboo, takenoko, <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, half boiled egg, and kikurage. its a solid meal for a cheap price, $7-8 and you can add other extras for a small price.\n\nanother favorite is their <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>. its cheap and filling...not to mention very tasty. you get the thinly sliced pork served over rice in a small bowl garnished with beni shoga. its tasty, fatty, and better when you get eat a little beni shoga (red pickled ginger) with it.. we always get a small bowl and share it.\n\ntheir gyoza is good as is the kim chee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. we need to try more of the items on their menu but we are creatures of habit and sometimes its hard to stray away from the  dishes that monta is known for.\n\nits easy to over order food at monta. because the ramen bowls are big...resist ordering other dishes unless you have a big party and you want to share. \n\nmonta is great on a hot day and better on a cold day!! \n\narooha!!!!!", 
            "before i get flamed on giving this place only two starts let me explain why to me it deserves three stars.\n\ni was a us marine stationed overseas on mainland japan for three years. during those three years i've had the opportunity to eat sushi, ramen, bento bowls, curries, udon, miso soups, and other foods of japanese origins they way they make it and the way they eat it.\n\nthe ramen that is offered here is a step above instant ramen but is far from authentic. \n\nthe broths are noticeably lighter and less flavorful from authentic, the noodles are in the middle, they're close but dont have the right texture, sides such as meats are too fatty but seasoned better then authentic ramen.\n\nthe biggest difference is the price. here a bowl of ramen runs from 6.25 to 7.something which isnt bad but it's the sides that get you back. 1.50 for a hard boiled egg? 1.50 for a spoon full of pickled mustard greens? 2.50 for extra noodles?\n\nback in downtown iwakuni a bowl of ramen, a side of goyza, and a plate of kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was only about 700ish yen back in 2006ish. who would have figured five years later i'd pay double the cash to have a sixteenth a meal...", 
            "great hangover food. awesome ramen broth. must also get pork belly rice when you're here. it's tasty, fatty, and simply the best. their pork belly rice is even better than daikokuya's! planning to try their kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> next time i'm back in town.",

            "i love my noodle soup and so glad we tried monta.  we tried various dishes like tonkatsu ramen, <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>, pork belly with rice and kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.  everything was delicious.  like many reviewer commented, adding an egg in your ramen soup is greatly suggested.  the menu is fairly small, but i can go there numerous times a week if i live in vegas.  delicious food that won't break your bank.  what's not to love!", 
            "so i was nursing a las vegas hangover (you know, still drunk at 9 am kinda hangover) by lying in fetal position in the back of the car, clutching a gigantic bottle of powerade, and damning myself for my excessive behavior (hey, only in vegas!)\nmy cousin said she that she had the perfect hang over cure.\n\"jamba juice?\" i groaned painfully.\n\"no, we're going to monta.\"\nthe thought of food made my stomach churn.\nwe walked in and were seated at one of the bigger tables. i made it a point to sit next to the wall so i can rest my head. i asked for a hot tea, and alas they serve no hot drinks. sorry, one star off for that one.\ni ordered the tonkatsu ramen. even just the smell of the broth was oh so soothing - i felt my headache fade away with every slurp of the soup and ramen. from my understanding, they put great care into their broth by letting it boil down for hours. it is creamy, salty, and hot. essentially, a perfect cap to a crazy night. the noodles were quite delicious too - it was slightly crispy and went very well with the soup. tonkatsu comes with two pork pieces. you can order extra sides to put in your ramen (i felt like corn that day), but they do charge you.\ni also had a side order of <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, which i thought was very salty. it is good, but it needs something to offset the saltiness.\nthe service was also prompt, and our server was quite cheery and polite.  the boys at our table kept mentioning how cute she was too.", 
            "i love this place, great lunch spot and for dinner too.  for lunch you can keep it light with just a soup so you don't pass out later in the day.  for dinner you can get soup plus some gyoza or <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> (which is the bomb, i love it here)\n\na new thing which is not on the menu is that you can get a mix of the tonkatsu and the shoyu broth, that's what i get.  in addition, i always add corn and chopped onion, and an egg if i'm in the mood.\n\nserver's are very friendly, and they work very fast and efficient. it's not a place where you're gonna chill for 3 hours and hang out, the place is small so people are in and out pretty fast.\n\na little side note:  they have cans of japanese iced tea which i had in japan and never had in the us until coming here.  i love that!", 
            "monta is an authentic japanese ramen restaurant. from the moment you enter its cramped, busy little space with a cheerful greeting from the staff to the satisfied feeling of a bellyful of delicious ramen it's a wonderful experience. the ramen is on-par with the real stuff in japan, and the tonkotsu and miso varieties are especially good. the gyoza and <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> leave a bit to be desired but as this is primarily a ramen restaurant that can be forgiven. the beer is cheap too, with asahi on tap for about $2.95 a glass. all in all it's a wonderful experience and if you are looking for authentic ramen in las vegas this is your best bet.",

            "i love their ramen! came with a couple of friends and my sister. i tried the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> for 6.95 and added a side of kimchee (because me loves some kimchee. yes i do!). i also ordered the kimchee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> as well for $6.95. \n\nawesome execution for both i may say! i loved the texture of the noodle. it was soft, but it still had that firm bite that you take into it. that's how i like my ramen! it also hd a very tender slice of pork in it and a few other garnishes. i loved the shoyu broth. i don't know what else to say! it wasn't salty or overpowering. it was just right. not too salty, and the broth was very nice with the mixture of the meat in it. yay brothiness!\n\nkimchee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> is also of a+ quality. you can taste that nice grill taste to it. the cut o the kimchee was small and so were the small bits of egg which is how i like it too be. so yay kimchee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>! \n\nit's such a good price too so i felt like i got more than what i payed for. the service was awesome. the server was very cheery and upbeat and attentive which i loved. so...yay service! thumbs up for such personal service in such a little place. i just love how authentic japanese restaurants like to keep things small, simple, and intimate. yay japan!", 
            "solid place for good ramen. and the kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> is delicious too!\n\nthere is usually a wait during lunch hours as the restaurant is very small. the service is always friendly and prompt. the prices are a little high for the portion sizes, but it is still a good lunch spot.", 
            "asian people love noodles. i am asian, therefore i love noodles.\n\ni was saddened by our earlier trip to monta where the waitress told us the wait would be close to an hour.  my growling stomach couldn't bear to wait so we settled for someplace else, cough swish shabu shabu cough, and was very unsatisfied. so we decided to give it one more try on my last night in vegas.\n\nthey won't seat you until your whole party is there and luckily the other two people made it just in time.  this is a cozy restaurant which just adds to the ambiance a japanese noodle house.  \n\nmenu: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/upiyurazvkninod1w8kqrq?select=0ivynxxhiyabnfoadj1era\n\ni ordered the tonkotsu- <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/upiyurazvkninod1w8kqrq?select=7-ni-npnmemyeojbnzksug\n\ni thought the ramen was delicious.  you could tell the noodles were \"wendy's\", fresh not frozen, and the garnish were all nicely cooked.  the pork was so tender and fatty and delicious.  you could eat that all day fa sho. \n\nwe also tried the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and the gyoza.  gyoza is top notch, some of the best i've ever had and i had some godly ones in japan..  the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was pretty delicious as well.\n\ni really liked my experience here.  the waitresses seemed to be imported straight from japan, very hospitable and nice.  the food was excellent.  and it didn't break our wallets either.\n\nso if you're asian or not, and you're craving ramen in las vegas, monta is definitely a \"safe bet\".. vegas pun intended.", 
            "went here for a quick afternoon snack before dinner.  beat the crowd, authentic japanese ramen place.  the staff from the all you can eat sushi place at the outlets even stopped by for lunch.  great flavors from the broth and the ramen noodles were very tasty.  we hear the kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> is a must.  didn't want to eat too much as we had dinner at mesa grill.  would definitely go back.", 
            "what a great find in las vegas! initially, i didn't come here with much expectations because no other ramen places i've been to have impressed me as much as ramen dojo in norcal. knowing that the capacity of monta noodle house fit around 20 or so customers, i anticipated a wait so arrived 30 minutes before opening on a friday afternoon. arriving early got me a table right at opening...yay to that! so come early to avoid waiting. \n\nmonta noodle house offers three different kinds of broth but i got a recommendation from one of their regular customers to order the tonkatsu-shoyu combo broth! the standard bowl comes with noodles, bamboo shoots, onions, and two pieces of pork. i wanted the ultimate ramen experience so i added on some extra stuff to spice up my bowl - i added the soft boiled egg (a must for every ramen bowl!), sweet yellow corn and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> (must add - gives great flavoring to the whole bowl). i also garnished my ramen bowl with the togarashi chili powder and sesame seeds! the addition of sesame seeds in the bowl was just perfect =) i have to say the best part about this place is the ramen that they used - the noodles were so soft & the thickness was about the size of egg noodles but with a softer texture. i definitely enjoyed this.they also give you plenty of noodles to fill you up real good! \n\nif you're ever craving ramen in las vegas and can wake up early enough after a night of partying..remember to check this place out! it's located in chinatown so having a rental car is convenient. solid 4 stars for satisfaction and it's location in vegas!!\n\nfyi: i also heard that the kimchee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was also good to try. \n\nhappy eating =)", 
            "before my friends tricked me into going to monta, i thought the only kind of ramen available were the packs for 19 cents, how naive. as i'm sure you've heard the place only seats about 20 people at a time and there is often times a wait, but it's very much worth it. their menu is quite small but everything on there is a knock out. feeling like you can't go wrong when you order is an awesome feeling. i personally order the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with corn and <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, the first time i tired this i knew there was a heaven. it's so savory and authentic, if you ever go, take a spoonful of the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> dip it in the broth and i guarantee your taste buds will be enraptured with a euphoric taste. the price is fairly cheap as well around $15 a person. the waitresses are very friendly as well and always take time to teach me some new japanese every time i go. i definitely recommend this place for anyone looking for something different within a reasonable prince range.", 
            "suffice to say monta has become the next best thing to hit vegas since <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, but why you may wonder did i only give it a 4 star? as you may all have read the rest of the 400+reviews & counting, everyone is raving about the food at monta & the prices, and i definitely agree with all the positive reviews, i mean c'mon you have a menu that would fit in one sheet of paper, how can you mess that one up? they have followed the in n out burger's mantra...kisss (keep it simple st*p*d) less is more, no frills, no guess work, in fact i love everything on their menu so much it is so hard for me to pick just one item! the only disadvantage to the \"if it ain't broke don't fix it\" attitude is that it gets boring, and you might get monta'd out (especially if you are eating there almost every week sometimes two) i guess some good things must come to an end, and as the law of gravity dictates, what comes up, must come down, even if it is the best noodle & chiar su pork in town. with this popularity also comes one downfall....be prepared to wait for a table! especially during the peak hours of lunch & dinner. they open at 11 am and trust me there is a line already forming outside waiting for them to open. this is a sure way to tell that a place is sure to be good especially when it's packed, but what if you are really hungry already??? hmmm bring some crackers with you. keep in mind also that at monta it is first come first serve, you can not make reservations, nor will they seat you if your whole party is not there yet (they frown upon this) monta is suitable for parties of a maximum of 4 if your party is more than that you probably won't sit together or even eat at the same time. the waiting time is often discouraging, hungry people are angry people! it has happened on more than one occasion that we had to go somewhere else because we got discouraged by the slew of people waiting to be seated anplay how pressed for time we already are. so by now you probably figured out why it is missing that 1 more star, me & monta definitely have a love-hate relationship. like in any other relationship, if you fall too quickly, you will fall out as quickly as you fell. so for now or until i crave you again, sayunara monta-san.", 
            "i never considered any other reason to visit las vegas aside from the strip, but visitors rejoice! there is another reason..it's in the form of a little ramen restaurant called monta! fellow yelper vicky l. recommended it to me and i made it my first stop in vegas, right after picking up the rental car.\n\nwe arrived at around 11:45 and got extremely lucky with seats at the counter, because the place filled up quickly by noon with the lunch crowd.\n\ni had the tonkotsu-shoyu and the husband had the tonkotsu. the broth for both were extremely creamy and delicious. if you like things with a bit more flavor, i suggest the tonkotsu-shoyu. the ramen noodles are the thin, angel-hair type which is a nice change from the usual ones we get in sf. \n\nthe egg..how could i forget to order the soft-boiled egg? i'm actually still bitter about that. so please do me (and yourself) a favor and add a soft-boiled egg to your ramen. \n\nwe also smelled the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> aroma from our neighbor and couldn't help but get a small order to share ourselves. it was the perfect portion and hit the spot.", 
            "upon a friend's recommendation, i decided to head over to try monta one night. it was 10 pm and dining options were starting to get scarce. the place was tucked away in a little mini mall. plenty of parking in the lot, but it can be a tight fit.\n\nat this time, the place was still relatively full. we were able to get the last open table. the menu is short and to the point. you can choose from four types of ramen broths, add your toppings, or even add extra noodles. as for other menu items, there was some <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> options and handmade gyozas. we ordered the tonkatsu ramen with charsui, egg, and nori; the tonkatsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> (a bit less rich than the regular tonkatsu ramen) with same toppings; pork belly rice bowl; kimchee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and an order of gyoza. all tasted great, especially the charsui topping. it had more flavor than in other ramen spots i've eaten at. i could've ordered another order of gyoza. \n\nall in all, a surprisingly good spot that i'll visit again. keep in mind, they open till 1:00 pm on friday and saturday, but they only have about 7 tables and another 7 seats at the counter.", 
            "by far only place too go for ramen! growing up in hawaii ramen just about stable food as spam musubi. so too finally find ramen place same style food excited. it has all the same character small place holds less then fifty people, bar area (cool get see them make the ramen), and when the place gets packed line out the door. it soo worth the wait. the timing is hit or miss. they first open in the morning for lunch that time always count on line. the whole small hole in the wall love because look where the restaurant located understand.\n\nthe food all the ramen is good. <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> i die for!! the flavor is spot on the depth nice light broth and depending if order additional topping can be hearty noodle dish. i prefer couple extras. other thing find must really perfect compliment too big bowl of ramen is gyoza. it steamed perfectly then seared off on flat top too perfection and the filling is tasty. the gyoza sauce optional but must only way too have it combine together is divine. \n\nthey other sides i order the kim chee good but stand out is kim chee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. it could ordered big bowl of that if they had it on the menu. =( it not over spicy but just the right amount of balance. they even have one beer offer on tap never think see small the place is never been good one too. i not remember name of it. sorry.\n\nthe service is excellent. all the servers are very friendly and attentive. the prices are really reasonable. it light healthy tasty any time meal! =))) if never been say give it try!!!",

            "as an avid lover of all asian styles of food i was excited to finally try monta ramen since i had heard good things. at first glance it looked like this little noodle shop was going to have a very long wait. however, we did not have to wait too long even with people waiting outside. there are not many seats, but this is not really the place to linger for long. most people seem to leave fairly quickly once they are done. my friend and i sat at the counter and had fun watching the bustling kitchen while we waited for our ramen. the seating may feel cramped for some people, but i really liked the busy, controlled chaos feel of it. \n\non to the good stuff. i ordered the tonkotsu-<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with the regular house fixings and my friend had the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with thin noodles. i was instantly impressed with my choice as soon as i tried it. the broth was slightly creamy and full of flavor, the thin noodles cooked to the perfect point so they were not mushy at all. i found the soup very flavorful, but i had to add a liberal amount of chili oil since i like my ramen spicy. the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> was also very tasty, the clear beef broth had just as deep a flavor as my selection. we both had a can of <mark>Green Tea</mark> to drink, which was a refreshing counter to my spicy soup. my only gripe was the fact that i was not completely full when i left, which is mostly my own fault. they offer the option of extra noodles, which i will surely do next time. the gyoza and <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> are also on the list to try in the future. \n\nanother great aspect is the price. the total bill for two bowls of ramen and two drinks was $18 and change. a great deal for any sit down place. bottom line is that this place is a great option for a fun, cheap meal. i will definitely be going back.", 
            "i'm not a big fan of ramen and this place didn't help change my opinion about it.. monta is a tiny restaurant tucked in a strip mall that seats about 25-30 people.. they serve ramen with a choice between 4 different broths and every bowl comes with char-su, mushroom, and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>.. there are other options that you can add to your noodles for an additional cost too.. the broth was thick and a yellow-milky color which wasn't the best for drinking and the noodles didn't have any distinction that would make them \"the best\" ramen.. we also tried their regular <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and that was probably the only thing everyone enjoyed and would come back for again.. but as for the ramen i think i'll pass!",

            "now that i've come here enough to practically remember the whole menu, i think it's ready for a review. \n\nwhen i found this place (through yelp of course) i thought to myself, \"could it be? a true authentic ramen place that the city i originally resided in devastatingly lacked of? my own little nyc momofuku only a 15 minute drive away?\" oh, sweet baby jesus it could! \n\nbefore making the trip to your next lunch or dinner date here, you should probably consider what day you're going and at what time. this place is small, like 5 tables (2 4-tops, 3 2-tops) small with a couple seats at the bar, and it gets crazy packed! the first time i came here i literally drove by and was like, \"awh hailll noo,\" and drove away. however i will say that if there's just a couple of people before you, just be patient and wait. the tables turn over rather quickly.\n\nwhich leads me to the menu. it's very simple and quick to prepare. if you're going with ramen, they have 4 different broth options: shoyu (chicken), tonkotsu (pork), tonkotsu-shoyu (chicken & pork) and miso. all are priced around 6.95 a bowl. just forget the rest and go with the tonkotsu-shoyu. all ramens are prepared with two slices of pork, bamboo, and chopped <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>. don't forget to add extra ingredients like an egg and <mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark>! if you've never tried <mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark>, it really compliments the broth and makes it extra delicious...order it on the side and try it out! adding in the ingredients is what really gets the meal to be pricier than expected. just 1 egg is an extra $1.75, but it's okay to indulge a little every now  and then, so just go all out with you bad ramen self! \n\nthey have other items as well such as <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, small plates, and cold ramen! i still have yet to try them.. will do an update after my next visit! \n\nthe only negative thing i'd have to say about the ramen is it can get pretty salty, of course you can mention to them less sodium, but i'm pretty sure all they're going to do is dilute it with hot water. to leave it on a positive note, aside from the saltiness the broth is perfection. extremely murky, so you know its packed with flavor and takes overnight cooking to prepare.", 
            "delicious <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. quite possibly the best <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> i've had here in las vegas. as for the ramen, we tried both the pork and chicken broth and while the chicken ramen was very tasty, the pork ramen was a bit too salty for our taste. also, i don't think i'm a big fan of ramen noodle but i will absolutely come back here for the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.", 
            "this is my favorite ramen in town.\n\ni prefer the \"tonkotsu-shoyu\" mix over the other two separate and the miso.  so much flavor...i have no idea how they do it.\n\ni usually add in the egg and a little extra pork to go crazy, and this would be plenty for the avg joe to fill up on.\n\notherwise, i order the kim chi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>...amazing!  this is one of my favorite <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> dishes of all time.  very very good.  if i order this, i tend not to get the extras inside the ramen otherwise i will burst at the seams.\n\nservice is fast...this is a quick bite and go kind of place, so don't expect to stay and converse for an hour after dinner.  they don't rush you, but there are typically others waiting to eat, and the place is tiny, you will feel guilty staying much later than the meal lol.\n\ndo it!", 
            "i didn't realize how hard it would be to find a really good ramen restaurant after moving out of hawaii.  however, monta comes close to filling the void.  monta is a small japanese noodle house in a strip mall in china town.  if you don't like waiting to sit down, get there early as the line usually begins to form before the restaurant opens at 11:30am.  there are a few scattered tables, but i prefer to sit at the bar and watch the cooks prepare the dishes in the open kitchen.\n\nmonta makes tonkotsu ($6.95), shoyu ($6.95) and miso ($7.25) ramen broths.  while all three of the broths are very good, the milky white colored tonkotsu (stewed pork bone broth) has an especially savory meaty flavor.  my favorite is the combination tonkotsu-<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> ($6.95) which tempers the intense meaty taste of the tonkotsu with the salty shoyu broth.  the thin yellow ramen noodles have always been consistently cooked to the just right texture, neither too limp nor too firm and underdone.  the ramen comes with basic toppings (<mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, bamboo shoots, kikurage mushrooms and two thin slices of marinated <mark>Chashu Pork</mark>) however, like all good ramen joints, they have a whole list of additional toppings you can add (for a little extra cash) to make the dish your own.  the combination of flavors and textures soaking in the hot broth goes down well on a cold day.\n\nwe also usually order the pan fried pork gyozas ($5.15 for 6) and a small kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> ($6.95).  the gyozas are excellent and the moist rice has a good flavor.  each table has an array of sauces and condiments that you can add to your meal (rice vinegar, soy sauce, chili oil, sesame seeds, and chili pepper) as well as little jars of crushed garlic and red pickled ginger.  they also serve beer to wash it all down with.\n\nthe service is fast and the food comes out quickly.  so even if you do get stuck waiting in line, it usually moves fast.  and if you are in the mood for good ramen, it is worth the wait.", 
            "my friends and i found this place in one of the las vegas magazines. we opted to try it out. i have been addicted ever since. i have not wanted to write this review because this place is like y secret treasure and very small. there is almost always await. the food comes out very fast it has a limited menu of ramen noodles.  it is awesome. the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> is out of the park good.  the bowls of noodles are quite big and you pay like $7 bucks. you can't go wrong with that.  the wait staff is nice and fast.  i can eat here everyday since ramen noodles are one of my favorite.  it is a bit out of the way for me plus its small and often packed. definitely worth going and checking it out and even if you have never had ramen (the pack for .25 cents in the grocery store does not count) for less then ten bucks its worth it try.", 
            "great ramen place!  been here twice and have been thoroughly satisfied each time.  with how small this place is, i'm not surprised at the wait...even at 10pm at night.  \n\nthe service, though brisk, is also very helpful and friendly.  no one has time to stand around to chat and explain things to you but they try very hard to seat everyone as quickly as possible and they manage to bring you your food quickly and correctly.\n\nhubby and i are purists...we stay with the tonkotsu broth.  the broth was rich and sticky...didn't taste like it was brewed only from pork bones but also from pork feet/hock.  very tasty and comforting.  on our second visit, i got extra char siu.  when the fat from the char siu melted into my broth, it got even thicker and richer.  hey, you say greasy, i say yummy!!\n\nother standouts - takana <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>...all very good!!  definitely going to be a staple for us when we're in lv.",

            "food here is pretty solid.  i've had ramen in la (which is much better back home, and i'm not trying to sound snobby, rather it's just something i can compare to), and the food here is a decent.  \n\n<mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> $(7) and +$2 for egg- slightly above average-the broth is pretty good.  it comes w/ 2 pieces of meat (which is detailed on the menu).  the pork base is pretty thick, so if you are into thick broths this is the place to go.  \n\nmy gripe is they don't give you complimentary egg w/ the broth, so you gotta pay $2 extra (which is pretty steep if you ask me).  i mean, who eats ramen w/o egg?  it's almost required!!!  i also would've preferred my egg to be a little more runny.  part of the egg yoke should seep into the soup (but still retain it's shape).  the egg i got was slightly hard when i got it.\n\npork belly rice ($5.50 for a large, $3.50 for small) - average.  the pork belly is extremely sweet!  i think they use too much sauce or something. the sauce almost over-powers the taste of the meat.  i'd pass on this next time.\n\ni was able to try my friends takana <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and it's delicious.  10x better than the pork belly.\n\ntips:\n-not good for groups.  restaurant is small, maybe seats 20 people inside.   parties of 4 or larger might have trouble sitting.\n-egg isn't complimentary w/ the ramen, so you gotta spend $2 extra =(\n-no garlic press available", 
            "every bowl of ramen comes with two slices of pork chashu, <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, kikurage (black mushroom), and bamboo shoots. there are four different types of broths:\n\n1. shoyu- soy sauce-based broth, pretty salty and nothing spectacular, average\n\n2. miso- miso-based broth, salty but not overwhelmingly so, pretty run-of-the-mill <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>\n\n3. tonkotsu- pork flavored broth, savory, and has a creamy texture. the soup's thick consistency is due to boiling pork bones, collagen, and fat for a long period of time. some people find the thickness of the savory broth distasteful and unsettling. if you're not a fan of a thick soup, i would skip this one. definitely one of my favorite broths to get here.\n\n4. tonkotsu-shoyu- best of both worlds, the tonkotsu and shoyu work well to balance each other out. the shoyu waters down the tonkotsu so it's not as thick and the tonkotsu adds a bold, fuller flavor to the shoyu. this is definitely monta's signature ramen and a must try.\n\nadditional toppings: some of the toppings are noticeably more expensive compared to other local ramen joints that already include these toppings in their ramen.\n\nadditional notes: \n*if you order extra noodles (kaedama), it comes in a separate bowl usually in the middle of the meal. it's been heated up so your noodles are still delicious even if your broth is not as hot as in the beginning. \n* there are two types of noodles to choose from: thick cup ramen style noodles (that definitely taste nothing like those horrible cup noodles) or a thinner noodle similar to chinese egg noodles (not the noodle that usually comes with wonton noodle soup). i definitely prefer the thicker noodles; the thinner ones tend to be overcooked easily and soggy. \n*there is a $10 minimum on credit cards. bring cash if you don't plan to spend more than that.\n*they will not sit you at a table unless your whole party is present.\n\noverall:\n\nso far, monta has the best ramen in vegas. (still need to try anime ramen, and fukumimi though.) it's just the thing that hits the spot on a cold chilly night when you need some warming up. \n\nservice varies depending on how busy they are. bar seating may get uncomfortable for some but that's how traditional ramen houses are: small and cramped. seating is very limited so anticipate a wait if you're coming during peak hours. \n\nthe consistency of the ramen sometimes varies as well. sometimes the chashu is over done, resulting in a dry piece of meat that doesn't have that heavenly gelatinous soft layer of fat that melts in your mouth. also, the noodles sometimes come out too soft if they've been sitting there for a while. once in a while, the yolk of the hard boiled egg will be completely solid, with none of that ooey gooey goodness. these hiccups happen rarely, only when they're extremely busy and it's during peak hours. portions are decent sized for a regular person. if you're a gluttonous fatty like me, it's better to share <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> (which is quite delicious) with a buddy.\n\noverall, despite the ridiculous wait sometimes and food consistency issues, monta is definitely a must try for locals and tourists.",

'cause i like to scrape off the fat under the pork skin. lol. another thumbs up!\n\nthe last dish which was the kimchee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> ($6.95) was yum, though i still think it could be done with slightly less oil.  unlike the rice bowl-sized portion that it often comes in, this <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> came in a rounded square plate of the size that could've been a meal by itself.\n\nservice\nservice was friendly, efficient and brisk without making us feel rushed. but we did devoured our meal super fast and left quickly as a courtesy to the long lines of people waiting.\n\ntwo thumbs up for this place.\n\nanecdotal comments & observations (mostly rhetorical)\nwhy is it that most ramen house has the most 'house rules' posted on their outside window? no outside food. no outside drink. no tacos?

            "i never liked going to eat ramen, but the more places i try, the more i love and appreciate monta. \n\nthis place is very small, and sometimes the wait can be a while, but the service is actually really quick. i've tried every flavor, but my favorite would have to be the tonkatsu with corn. the corn just puts it over the top! my boyfriend is usually a die hard miso fan, it's pretty good, i don't love it, but so far he likes monta's the best. \n\ni don't ever order <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> at restaurants, but this one time i did and it was actually pretty good! it had a lot of flavor, it reminded me of my mom's. the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> is delicious too, but i wouldn't go there for that. overall, monta would have to be my favorite ramen spot!", 
            "ramen house. that's exactly what this place is, no frills just ramen with a few sides (<mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>/gyoza items on the menu) monta is truly a place that focuses on the ramen.  tonight i had the shoyu basic ramen and didn't need to add anything to it.  i'm still a ramen newb so hearing tables next to me adding extra pork, extra noodles etc made me realize you can customize your own ramen bowls, but just the basic ramen as is is just fine.  this is good comfort food and beats your top ramen like during your college years. *there will be a wait and this place is small, but definitely worth it! **the hot tea comes in cans cold or hot.",

            "i'm not sure what else i can add that won't echo the other 700+ reviews listed for monta, but the legitimacy of the food here can be proven by the 30+ minute wait in the dead heat of a vegas summer.\n\nmonta is tiny and maybe seats about 50 people-pretty sure the max occupancy sign inside the restaurant said 70, but they'd be pushing it. the service is quick and no frills but friendly. the menu is simple-there are four types of ramen and a variety of appetizers and alternative dishes like kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, gyoza, cold noodles and a <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>. ramen comes with add ons like seasoned egg (so good), mustard greens, scallions, extra pork belly, corn and butter. \n\nthe broths are rich and flavorful and it's hard for me to pinpoint a favorite, but if i had to pick the tonkotsu-shoyu would probably be it. the noodles have that perfect ramen texture-chewy and slurpy, in a good way!\n\nbecause of the size of the space, it can be an intimate dining experience with complete strangers particularly if you sit at the bar. but it's also one of those places that solo dining isn't awkward and can actually be to your benefit when there is a line out the door.\n\nmonta is your spot for legit ramen with no pretense!",

            "hey monta, you make some good ramen, just saying.\n\nit took me some time to finally try this place. for one, i didn't know of its existence until after it was open for some time, and i had a hard time finding it. it is inside of a plaza where i had a hard time locating it, but you just have to make sure you make the turn into the plaza or the little street next to the plaza.\n\nmy friends that have tried monta beforehand liked it enough where i had some expectations for this place. it didn't have to be rated g-a-f, but it had to be tasty. the first time i came, i just got a bowl of their tonkatsu ramen and i must say, i was one happy guy afterwards. the noodles were pretty good, their egg made me happy, their pork melted in my mouth, but the broth is what impressed me. the broth was probably my favorite part about the meal. needless to say, i finished the whole bowl, soup and all! i was really happy. \n\nthe next few times i came, i started customizing and ordering different things on the menu. i added more noodles the next few times, got some of their <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, gyoza, added some corn to my soup, just customizing things to the point where i was happy! their <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was pretty tasty. the kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> may not be for everyone, because unless you like kimchi, you may not like it. adding various things to your ramen makes it takes a lot better and funner to eat since it has more color and just the feeling of being able to customize your food just makes it that much better. \n\nif you want to try some ramen and you're in the area, i highly recommend monta. the only downside is that the restaurant is fairly small and during peak hours, you should expect a wait. people get turned away from places that have waits, but if you think about it, why do they have waits? it is small, but people keep going back because the food is delicious, it's as simple as that.", 
            "while visiting las vegas i was doing research on ramen restaurants on yelp and kept reading about everyone who had a positive and delicious experience at monta ramen.  today i made the trip with my brother.  we got here about 10 minutes after they opened and found the last remaining table.  the place was already packed.  after looking at the menu i ordered the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> which is a rich pork broth with two slices of melt in your mouth pork with wood-ear mushrooms and scallions.  i added the nitamago which is a seasoned hard-boiled egg.  this meal did not disappoint.  it came to the table within 10 minutes and was a great looking bowl of ramen.  very savory and fresh.  we also had the gyoza  which is a pan-fried pork and vegetable dumpling.  my brother ordered the takana pork-<mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.  this rice was a nice addition to our ramen bowls.  \n\njust a note:  as our ramen bowls were delivered i looked up and noticed that monta ramen must have a lot of fans because the little doorway was filled with people waiting to eat but the line also went out the door.   knowing what i do now about how delicious this ramen is i would have gladly waited outside for my turn to enjoy this bowl.  \n\nmonta ramen will definitely be on my list to visit the next time i come to las vegas.  can't wait to bring my wife here.  very affordable.  i recommend.", 
            "quick cheap and good.  just the way i ilkes it.  this place is tiny; the seating is limited, so they can't seat you until your entire party has arrived.  once seated, however, i had a surprisingly generous amount of space -- didn't feel crowded like i do at some places.  on the recommendation of a friend, i had the kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and pot-stickers.  i liked them both.   i was a bit leery at first because the odor from kimchi made just about every other way is a real turn-off for me, but i had no problem with it in this case.", 
            "yummy! ramen noodles! the broth is sup@ delicious. if you like minchin, the have an awesome dish of kmchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>!\nif you have small children they welcome the challenge to win them over with their house specialties. ask the wait svc for the winning dishes...some clippings of news articles are hung up by the door which also informs you of what's good!\none important tip...if you see that it's packed you must go to the podium and sign in. \nand fyi it is a very quaint place (small) seats are limited. and prepare to be face down in a bowl of something wonderful!", 
            "first time trying ramen in las vegas and came to this highly recommended hole in the wall spot. but to my husband and my disappointment the ramen was mediocore. he had the tonkotsu and i had miso. we both thought it was too salty. however we shared a kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and it was delicious! \nwe have much better ramen spots here in california.", 
            "as soon as you walk in - sign in! haha there's always a wait for this place.  (but if you're in a hurry to get back to work or wherever there are multiple of good restaurants you can go to in that same complex). so with that statement, it's the type of place you order--- eat--- and leave... you don't want to be the jerk holding up the wait :p \n\none thing that really caught my attention was how the chefs were dipping the bowl into hot boiling water before making your order to keep your food hot even longer.  i like to enjoy every bite of my food so by the end of my last bite my soup was still warm :p ( but i'll have to admit the last time i went they didn't dip my bowl ) \n\ni've tried all three <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> on different occasions and all were good :) i think the kimchi is my favorite.  as for the  gyoza, it's pretty delicious and crispy.  \n\ni've tried all soups and i'll have to say i'll stick to the pork broth with thin noodles and of course adding some <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> and egg to that - call it my usual order :)",

            "came to vegas for vacation and my friend kept telling me that i must try this place out.  i am from out of town so i cant really tell you where this place is at since i took a taxi but it seems like the chinatown of vegas.  it seems to be sorta hidden in the back of the shopping center but just look for the white sign.\n\ngot here around 12pm and there was a slight wait (nothing compared the wait when we were leaving).  sat down and the friendly waitress took my order: <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with corn and also the small <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> (my friend said i had to get it no matter what) and yes i know thats a lot of carbs.\n\n<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>:  my ramen came out with extra chasu and with no corn.  the waitress quickly realized this and immediatly gave me some corn on the side and didnt charge me for the extra chasu (kudos to her to rectify the situation).  the broth was very good and not overly salty.  i consider this one of the better ramens that i have eaten.  but the thing that stood out the most to me are the noodles.  wow! this has got to be one of the best noodles ive eaten at any ramen joint and i have been to many in ny, ca and hawaii.  many places forsake the noodles and focus too much on the broth and chasu but very very good noodles.\n\n<mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>: this was the dish my friend kept raving about and keep telling me to order.  i am not a huge <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> person but it was pretty darn good! i devoured it within minutes of it coming out and didnt even leave a spec for my friend.\n\nvery good place i will definitely come again when i go to vegas.", 
            "the cure for a las vegas hangover is ramen. and with all the raves and reviews monta ramen was worth a visit. upon arriving, there was already a crowd outside (it opens at 11:30). luckily, the bar had two open seats for my friend and i.\n\nthinking with our appetites, we began the order:\n\n2 <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> (this is what they're known for)\n1 gyoza (it's gyoza and i was hungover, so give me a break)\n1 kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> (once again, we were hungover!)\n\nafter taking the last bite and having to unbutton my pants, i looked at my friend and gave him the approving nod, which summed up our experience.", 
            "i went to the one on spring mt & decatur location and man.. that place is so small! so many people were lining up and i felt so clusterphobic! i still stayed and waited because i wanted to see why this place is so popular! anyway, after 20 minutes of waiting, me and my party were finally sat. customer service could be better. i understand its busy, but if you work there, that's just something you know you have to deal with especially if its a popular place. the food was good. ramen.. delicious. <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.. delicious as well!  overall, it was a good experience!", 
            "got here a little before opening and already a line had formed (at least 15 people deep).  pretty cramped inside, with about 6-7 tables and counter seating for 10.  food took a while to come out, and a big reason why was there was only one person cooking the noodles, prepping the bowls, and plating/garnishing (with one person taking care of the rice items).  the waitstaff would just stand and wait for the food to be ready.  it could have been more efficient (and thus quicker), but maybe they were limited by the size of the kitchen.  oh well...\n\nthe ramen itself was just okay, with average-tasting broth and average noodles.  i ordered the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> with the wavy noodles, and some <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> and <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> for the kids.  not bad overall, and service was good, but i prefer fukumimi ramen to this place.  but mad props to that multi-tasking cook, he sure was fun to watch!", 
            "big drop-off since the last time i dined here, which was probably a year ago when i came here with some friends and let me say that my friends and i  liked this place so much that we literally came here 3 days straight!!! i raved about this place so much to my girlfriend back home in austin, so the expectations from us were pretty high coming in on a monday evening around 7 o'clock. the wait time was about 20 min., so it wasn't too bad and the restaurant was pretty full. so i ordered 3 of my fav dishes i had last time to share with my girlfriend. we had <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> w/ ajitama (seasoned egg) and corn, kim chi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, and cold noodles with sesame sauce...so\n\n<mark>Miso Ramen</mark>- broth was a lil salty and luke  warm, cold corn (which prob made the broth luke warm), the noodles were stuck together in a ball shape, so that was obvious it wasn't boiled long enough. \n\nkim chi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>- was very wet and was obvious drenched with a lot of oil\n\ncold noodles- were a bit sour and visibly covered with way too much sesame sauce.\n\ni really don't understand the big drop off in the quality of taste and food and it saddens me to just give monta 1 star ( star for good service) which seems harsh, but when you get food poisoning that causes your stomach to ache and many trips to the restrooms. how could you consider to go back...", 
            "we ate here twice in 3 days! the first time we actually came to eat at the snowflake shavery for dessert, but noticed the crowd milling around monta and decided to throw our name on the waiting list. since we had our baby in tow, we weren't exactly expecting to wait it out. however, the woman working at monta was so incredibly nice, she save us a table and made it as comfortable as possible for the baby, even helping us store the stroller in the back! now to be honest we weren't incredibly hungry after the wonderful shavery but we managed to still enjoy my tonkotsu and <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with the egg and my wife the black garlic oil flavored kuro ramen. i've definitely had better egg in my time so next time i'd try some other add on.\n\nwhile the food was good, the service was what stuck in our minds that first night. nicest wait staff ever! we also vowed to take my noodle loving 10 year old nephew and my sister when they rolled into town the next day.  \n\nso today we went around lunch time, and longer line so again we hit the snowflake shavery first! while waiting, we saw the flyer that they opened a monta in henderson! we'll definitely try that next. this time the wait was longer and we worked up our post-snow appetites...and score! the nephew and sister loved it! also i tried the takana <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> this time which i thought was great. just the right amount of spiciness and with the mustard green, unique from chinese <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. my better half had the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> this time, which was indeed lighter than the tonkotsu broth. i think i preferred the tonkotsu but it was good to have tried them both.\n\nnext stop will definitely be the one near my parents house on eastern. thanks yelp for the recommendation!", 
            "one of the best ramen places in us. it definitely goes into top three of our ramen list. \nit's a bit crowded at dinner time and you might need to wait like 15 minutes. but once we had our food, all the waiting is worthwhile!\nit's a small place and we sat at counter. once you got seated, the service is pretty fast. my bf ordered tonkotsu soyu and i got tonkotsu.\nthe soup base if very thick and rich, very yummy, feels like a good stew from good pork. and the noodle is just right, not too soft and not too hard. try eat noodle dipped in soup in one bite, it's heaven. :) i almost finished the whole bowl. the bowl is cheap like 6.95 - 8.95. you can add extra topping if you want. it only comes with chashu and a bit veggie for my meal but the good taste makes me happy enough.\nthey don't have other sides or appetizers. as far as i remember, only gyozer and some <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. if i go lv later and want some asian food, that'll probably be the first item popped into my mind.", 
            "i like this place, but have come less over time because of the crowds you have to fight through to get a table here. if you come on a weekend, expect to wait 30-45 min to get a table since they don't have very many. enjoyed it a lot more the 1st few times i came here but have been less impressed lately. seems like as it's gotten more crowded, the food quality and service has gone downhill.\n\ni've had the ramen, <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, and <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> here and nearly any choice you get is pretty decent. sometimes you may get a bowl of ramen that's a little saltier than others...i'm sure this is directly related to how busy they've gotten. hopefully they will look into expanding or adding another location to alleviate the crowd issue here.",

            "we came here on a saturday afternoon around 1220 and it was super packed. we waited for an hourish but it's also because we had a party of 9. this place is right next to raku and a korean restaurant. \n\nwe ordered a bowl of tonkotsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with an extra order of egg, kimchee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, and gyoza. let's actually start with the ramen which was the most disappointing dish of the 3....however it was better than i expected. i have recently lost my hope for ramen so this place was actually better than i expected. the broth was a bit too salty for my taste but the chashu was really good. the noodles weren't bad. \n\nthe gyoza was really good. it was crispy and the inside of it was juicy and perfectly seasoned. the skin wasn't too thick so it had that perfect crispy to it when you bite into it. \n\nthe kimchee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was the shiitttt. no joke. i think i'm gonna have dreams about the kimchee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> to be honest. it was moist and tasty. so much seasoning to it and there's little kick to it from the kimchee. there are restaurants that makes it super dry but monta made it perfectly. obviously it is oily, but it is seriously bomb-diggity good. it was sooooo good that we ordered a to-go right before we left and we ate it at midnight. we ate it cold cause there was no microwave in the hotel but it was still so damnnn good.\n\ni would seriously come back only to get the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>...i'm really curious about the takana <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> too. service was actually really good and i actually gave monta a 4 just because of the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>...or else i would probably give it a two stars. \n\nthe lesson is...you come early to avoid the wait, you get the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, and be happy with life.",

            "during a foodie excursion to vegas, we wanted to eat something delicious, yet budget-friendly. after pouring over a few years' worth of vegas weekly magazines, authentic japanese ramen at monta ramen made the cut. the restaurant was crowded, but we scored seats! we split an order of kuro ramen and kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.  the slurp-worthy broth was full of flavor and quite excellent, and the noodles were chewy and delicious. it was my first time having kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and it was love at first bite. by now, i've probably eaten my weight in <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, but monta ramen's kimchi variation was kickass. monta ramen for the best ramen in vegas!", 
            "have to try: its very small so expect to wait but the service is very quick. the menu is very simple but very good. three to four ramens to choose from and a variety of extras to add into your ramen.\n\nrecommend the kimichi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>!!",

            "me and my friends actually ended up here because the line at oyster bar was too long and we were starving. i personally am a ramen fan in general so i like trying new places, my other friend and her hubby are not big ramen fans, but luckily, after coming to monta they have found a renewed interest in ramen.\n\nwe all started with a glass of beer, pretty cheap at about $3 but they are not pints, i think more like 10oz-ers? still it was a refreshing way to start the meal. \nshared the pickled greens <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and the pork belly rice bowl. <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was cooked well and flavorful, the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> was even better. the fatty pieces of pork were cooked perfectly tender with their greasy goodness seaping into the rice underneath. \n\nfor ramen i got the half pork half chicken broth and added an egg. the chicken broth is supposed to be a little less rich but mine was still a pretty thick broth. not that that's a bad thing, thick as in thick with flavor but sometimes i prefer a less rich broth because it can get very filling. so depending on what you like, the full tonkatsu broth would be richest and most flavorful and a the half and half would be a lighter version. noodles were cooked perfectly. \n\nthe place is typical small japanese style shop, they have a list for you to write your name on and wait. the waitresses do a nice job of clearing the tables and getting everyone seated as soon as possible so even though we had a few parties ahead of us the wait wasn't too bad for lunch hour. it does get a little hot inside though, so be warned for those coming in the summer months.",

            "monta is by far the most amazing ramen house in las vegas! i stumbled upon it and decided to take my wife and two kids (4 and 2) to give it a try. last week we tried another ramen house down the street from monta and it was nowhere near as good. we've had ramen in japan, hawaii and california and monta is the closest to what you can find on the streets of tokyo. \n\nwe started out with kimchee and the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. they were both amazing! the kimchee had an amazing taste and the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was probably the best i have had! i had the spicy <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>, my wife had the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> and my kids shared the cold noodles. all had amazing flavor with robust noodles and tender meat. the dishes were bursting with flavor! my kids pounded the cold noodles and the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.\n\noverall, monta is a must try when in las vegas. this is going to be a regular spot for us. oh, the place is really small... so don't expect to have a big party and get in right away. you'll wait 20-30 minutes before you get in. enjoy!", 
            "first and foremost i would like to say that the food here is absolutely incredible. the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and the tokontsu shoyu are a must with every visit. it's the service that makes them lack from a full 5 stars. i have been here multiple times and have never had any issues however tonight out server chizuru gave us some of the rudest service.. we ordered <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> to share and she basically threw it at our table without giving us an extra plate or silver wear and had some major attitude when i asked for what she lacked in giving us. not once after we got our food did she ask how we were doing, however the cute girl with the glasses and long ponytail who wasn't even our server made sure we were okay. i will ultimately return for more ramen because it is amazing i will just hope chizuru gets an attitude adjustment before then!", 
            "this place was such a good find. never had been here before and we just searched up a ramen place to try (since our favorite ramen joint closed down) and i would have to say that monta ramen is probably our new favorite. their menu is small and simple, which i like because then i don't have to sit there forever trying to decide which one i want to order. i was able to see what they have and decide what i wanted quickly. we ordered the tonkatu shoyu and added an egg (extra $1.00-$1.50) and it was soooooooooooooooooooo yummy! we also ordered their <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and gyoza. all was delicious. \n\nthe only downfall i have is that it is such a small restaurant that many people enjoy going to, so if you're there on a busy night.... most likely there will be a wait for a while and you'll be stuck waiting outside.

            "i'll make this short and sweet. hey, that's the perfect description of our waitress!\n\nwe arrived on friday night, between 6-7pm to a full parking lot, but a slow night over at monta ramen. we found street parking, got our name on the list and probably sat around 7 minutes after that. the bar top was packed while the main area had a steady flow of patrons ordering, dining, enjoying then leaving. seems like standard operating procedures, so let's do it.\n\ni ordered the spicy tonkutsu ramen and our table shared the <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark>. literally, our ramen showed up within minutes.. seems like they might have it sitting stove top somewhere. it took longer for our rice to show up, but it was definitely worth it. the rice was tasty, as are most fried foods. fluffy and moist with bits and pieces of meat, egg and dashes of spice. \n\nas far as the ramen goes, there was a taste i can't quite describe.. it wasn't necessarily bad nor was it good. what saved the bowl, in my opinion, was the fact that they include a little sriracha style chili sauce which blended well in the broth and masked that indescribable taste. that, along with garlic and a dab of soy totally turned this dish from a 3 to a 4. the spice level, out of 10, had to be in the 5 or 6 zone. almost had me, but it was more of a flavor than the actual kick. the ramen noodles were a little thin making it truly easy to finish this bowl off, which i find hard to do in the sgv area due to the portion sizes.\n\nthis wasn't necessarily the best ramen i've had to date, but having the wind gust hard outside along with winter like temps and an empty stomach, it definitely did the job.. we didn't have to wait in a dreaded line, super-friendly service, decent prices, prompt ticket turnaround times and the meal was quite fulfilling.",

            "it has been some time since i had good ramen.  san francisco is one of the best foodie towns but it fails miserably in terms of ramen offerings.\n\nwe stopped by monta on a recent trip to vegas.  it is located on spring mountain road like most of the other popular nearby offstrip spots and is located in the same strip as raku and kung fu tea.  the parking lot is a bit tight and can fill up pretty quickly on busy nights but there is street parking and we have used the lot opposite of the strip (store was closed).\n\nthere was a short wait at monta as expected but it was reasonable - only 3 other names on the clipboard.  the shop consisted of a long l shaped bar and 10 or so small tables.  not a huge place but not small either.  we all ordered the tonkatsu ramen and tanaka <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> as recommended.  the default toppings were a bit sparse (pork, bamboo, ginger, 'shrooms) but considering the price (under $7) i didn't mind.  i added a soft boiled egg to mine - other standard toppings were available (corn, more pork, butter, etc) we were pleasantly surprised at the turnaround for the ramen - within 5-10 minutes.\n\nthe broth carried plenty of flavor but was a bit thicker than the other ramen shops.  the noodles were thin and firm but not overly so.  the bowl only came with 2 slices of pork but it was expertly prepared - tender with a good combination of meat and fat.  there was a slight aftertaste (from msg?) but easily queched from the kung fu milk tea from next door.\n\nthe <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was solid but a bit salty.  it was more than likely from the <mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark> either being too abundant or just overly salty themselves.  not bad but i may go with the potstickers or simply stick with the ramen next time.\n\na definite stop for me in vegas the next time i am craving something soupy or noodles.", 
            "called here on a tuesday around 8p.m. and found out there's not wait. i was finally able to try this place that has lines every time i had passed by. \n\n<mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> - 3 star. it was good, salty, but nothing super extraordinary. i didn't find it to be amazing, and have definitely had better ramen elsewhere...in cali and tokyo. \n\nkuro ramen- 3.5 star. this was richer in flavor and had depth that was different compared to the tonkotsu, but i sure wasn't raving about it either. \n\nkimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>- 2.5. i was looking forward to this since people had mentioned that it's quite amazing. nah. i shoulda known better ordering kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> at a ramen shop for one, and a japanese restaurant. \n\noverall it's a 3 star. an a-ok for me. i don't think i'll be back here again. oh, but i am proud that the food here got me to drink two big glasses of water.", 
            "this place reminds me of men-oh in little tokyo in the settings.  walk in to a small entry way, stools greet you at the bar table and you turn in to a small room with tight seating.  it's packed and you will be fortunate if you are seated right away.  at the same time, both times we were there we only waited 5-10 minutes so they do turn them pretty quickly.  orders are taken promptly by pleasant wait staff, and your meal is turned around quickly as well, within 10 minutes.\n\ntheir ramen are overall the best i've had - not greasy, fresh, with nicely firm noodles - although from pure taste standpoint i probably prefer hiromaru (rip).  their <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> is really good, as is the chashu don.  these are more like side dishes from size standpoint, but probably too much for one person to have a ramen and one of these.  maybe 2 ramen dishes and one will work for two... i say that because they're really good and you should really try them.\n\ngreat atmosphere, bustling crowd, and great food all equal to the best ramen joint i have been to yet.  it's probably more like 4.5 stars, but i want to differentiate between this and other 4-star places i've rated so i'm giving it a 5.\n\ntable-for-1 factor:  yes, and there are many who partake.", 
            "i get a craving for monta nearly once a week...nah who am i kidding, it's more like a daily burn. if i lived closer to their chinatown location, i would seriously consider a 5x a week lunch adventure, transporting me back to japan with an enveloping nostalgia of aroma, atmosphere, personality, texture and umami. oh man, the umami. the wait (and there always is one) is well worth it. whether it's 10 minutes for lunch or a 30-60 minute wait for dinner, your olfactory glands, umami super sensors and full warm belly will thank you profusely. \n\ni am a massive fan of the basic tonkotsu, always with a nitamago (soft boiled, soy sauce-seasoned egg), with a spicy iteration thrown in the routine every so often. i am also slightly obsessed with their kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, on which i pile on pink pickled ginger. they should probably start charging me for the pickled ginger, as i definitely take advantage of the free-for-paying-customers-with-the-notion-it-will-be-used-sparingly jar of the condiment/dish enhancer. $2.95 asahi on tap?? give me a couple! \n\nmonta is incredibly well priced, intimate in a truly authentic japanese way, lively, wicked efficient (in the manner they move customers in and out), clean and so consistent. i will be back, in approximately 15 minutes! damn spring mountain traffic!", 
            "i love this place so very much. i'm not a big ramen fan, so i begrudgingly went along with some friends for my first visit. i now go willingly, without any hesitation. i don't get ramen, but i do get the pork <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, which is some of the best i have ever had in my life (and i have lived in the bay and la). it's flavorful and rich, and so amazingly priced (~$6?). i could eat it everyday. all my friends love the ramen, so they're obviously doing something right there. they also have pretty great appetizers as well.\n\nbe aware that the sitting room is really small. i think my parent's living room is about the size of the whole space. as a result, there can sometimes be a really long wait. the longest i'm ever willing to wait for cheap food is 30 minutes, and i've waited that long for monta. but there have been times where my wait has been less than ten minuted on a friday night. so it really depends on when you get there, and luck honestly. i will say that it is a terrible place for large parties though. it's always been such a hassle coming here with more than four people. if you want to try it out, i would recommend going with only one other person, maximum two, for your first visit. the shorter wait will make your experience much more enjoyable!", 
            "this place is very much... alright.\n\ncame here because a few friends raved about it and it looked like it had amazing reviews, came half an hour before opening time just to make sure we wouldn't have to wait too long. luckily my group of about 20 just barely fit behind a few other couples. very small place that seats less than 30?\n\nthe ramen wasn't bad but it definitely wasn't all that great. i'm from la so i guess i probably am lucky to have much more options but you would figure vegas has the best of all worlds. compare to anything else i've ever had around la, this was much more salty, portions were a tad bit smaller, other than the saltiness not that flavorful. menu here is small but some japanese restaurants tend to be so that wasn't too big of a surprise.\n\nyou definitely have to be a pork lover because that's pretty much all they have, if i remember right they have approximately four different ramen choices, and a few other side dishes like <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and gyoza.\n\nif you are a local i'm sure this may be as good as it gets? but if you're from out of town only try this place if there is no wait. totally not worth a wait.", 
            "awesome food but be prepared for a long wait. \n\ncame here based on the awesome reviews. showed up a little after 1pm on a weekday. we waited easily more than an hour. this place is super tiny, but the turnover seemed as speedy as it could be. it was cold outside and there was no shelter from the cold. i would never wait to eat at this place during the heat of summer!!! impossible!!! \n\nwhen we finally got seated, our orders were taken promptly. surprised to find a little cubby to stash my stuff under the bar!!! clever!!! i loved my sapporo on tap. sitting at the bar gave us a bird's eye view on how the food, especially the pork roasts were prepared. the logs of pork roasts were seared on something that looks like a huge george forman grill. oh!!!!! if you could only hear the sizzle of the hot grill & the smell the wonderful umami flavor of roast pork!!! the roasts are then placed into an oven and cooked until tender. this pork is then cut into nice generous slices to garnish the ramen or cut up into the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. i take the time to mention what i witnessed because you feast not only with your palate but also with your other senses as well. i love that they roasted the pork & didn't just boil or steam them to oblivion. this is probably what makes this ramen house so yummy...the care in how the pork is prepared. \n\nwhat we ordered...\n\nspicy <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>...the most popular ramen on yelp. also highly recommended by those drooling to get in. i hear that corn & butter add-ons are a must!! \nthe broth was delicious, the ramen noodles were cooked perfectly, and the ramen was garnished with nice big round slices of roast pork. in most ramen houses, the chasu is often half fat... although there is nothing wrong with some good fat. these slices were mostly meaty. yay!!! \n\n<mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>...also popular on yelp, but the pork in my bowl wasn't crispy at all. good, but not as good as the....\n\nkimchee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>....surprisingly very good!! i am usually skeptical to order \"korean\" items at japanese restaurants and vice versa, but it tasted so good!!! the big juicy pieces of pork made the rice so decadent!!! yum!!!!\n\ni didn't take off any stars for the wait...they can't help that they're a fabulous popular place!!! :d",

            "visited this small restaurant based on popular review. indeed, this restaurant is so popular that you will have to wait in the line. another reason why you'll have to wait is that the dining room can probably fit about 30 dining guests at each time, half of the guests will need to be on the bar table. me and my wife are lucky to get a table after about 45 minutes of wait with about 6 parties waiting in front of us for dinner (by the way, you will need to check yourself in as there are only 2 very busy waitresses). the menu was very simple - noodle, <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> or some small variety of specialty. there are flyers if 2 today's special pasted on the wall, which we ordered - spicy <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>. we also ordered a <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> bowl (basically some fish eggs with sesame over small bowl of rice). i would not say it is super delicious, but it is really worth the price. the ramen was very flavorful (can be a little salty). you also have the option to add another noodle if you still feel hungry after you finish the bowl - i think most people will do since there was actually not much noodle in it. for us, the bowl of rice does the job. the rice is nothing special and almost had no flavor. i just seasoned the rice with the broth of the ramen i had. overall, not bad, and it is definitely worth the price. but if you don't have much time in vegas, you can safely skip this place as it is not worth that much of wait, unless you really want to save money in your trip.", 
            "authentic ramen noodle, not those milky <mark>Butter</mark> broth that is overwhelming after two sips. their gyoza was amazzzinggg, filling is pork+veggie. does not smell or taste like old meat with tons of ingredients to mask it. \nkim chi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was so flavorful , not too salty either. however, it is a tad bit oily for me, but what's <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> without a little oil huh? \nthe place is small and have about five small tables and the rest of the seatings are located at the noodle bar( sits about 8 people) \nwe were so full and only paid 34 bucks!!(2\nramen noodles, <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, gyoza)\n\ni strongly suggest trying out this place asap!",

(i had the black garlic tonkotsu one). great <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. when i'm back in town, i'm coming back. this is the real thing. i shouldn't be surprised because it was recommended by someone i know to be a real food sophisticate.",

            "monta ramen serves \"kurume\" style <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> from fukuoka. it's a broth made from selected pork bones and special soy sauce imported from japan. nice!!\nsmall but clean ramen spot, monta always seems like there is a long wait out the door. \nthe kuro ramen was black & impressive, the tokotsu ramen was creamy and deep. both had thick and rich pork based broth with thin, unrisen noodles. the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was well mannered with excellent seasoning & the gyoza was surprisingly crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. \nservice was o-kay ....most likey because it was super busy with only two waitresses on the floor. the whole time, i felt rushed. the glares from the hungry customers waiting for a table to the right of us was piercing & hurting. \nother than that, yes! i'm a fan!!\n\ngood for kids: yes\nhighchair: yes", 
            "i'm giving three because i need to visit another few ramen stops before i say it's the tops. \nit's a bit small, but the service is quick once seated and the food is amazing! \ni had the spicy bowl with egg and\nkimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. \ni will say..... i've been thinking about having some more noodles\never since.\nnot only are they delicious, but they are cheap! we only spent $27 on our bill. \nvery impressed.", 
            "went on sunday 9-20-15 around 12:45 pm.  this is located on the <mark>Corn</mark> of spring mountain and decatur in the same shopping center as raku, kung-fu tea, big wong, and curry zen.  \n\nyou go inside and write your name on the list and they'll call you when a table's ready.  we put our name on the list and went over to kung-fu tea to wait.  when we went back over, they had called us and crossed our name off the list so we had to put our name on the list again and wait all over again.  oops.  but when they called my name they had a high chair ready for my boy and i thought that was pretty great.  \n\n$11.78 got me a bowl of <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> and a small order of <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.  the ramen was pretty great but dat <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> tho....dang it was awesome.  i absolutely loved it. when i go back (and i definitely will) i will just ask for a trough full of that <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.  i only got 4-5 bites before my baby stole it and stuffed it all in his face.  it is a strange type of rice and i think it has pork belly in it.  \n\ncheap, delicious, eats.  woohoo! as good as it gets!", 
            "came to vegas, cousin suggest that i come here .  ummm ummm good ..the soup was thick full of flavor,, pork melts in your mouth and oh that <mark>Kimchi</mark> <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> , say no more just chow!", 
            "came here for lunch and it was super packed! i wasn't aware there was a sign in sheet so i was kinda just standing there until someone came behind me and signed in. thankfully he said i could go before him anyways! wait was only about 5 minutes, but since there were no seats available i had to wait outside in the heat. definitely not a place where you have an intimate meal, but i spent 45 minutes there without feeling they were rushing me out the door.\n\nthe food was pretty good. i got the tonkotsu shoyu, <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, and <mark>Green Tea</mark>. the ramen soup and noodles were very good, although i didn't like the meat. it says it's pork but it tasted like turkey and a mix of something else so i didn't eat it. the rice was good too with soy sauce but was a bit too eggy for my liking. \n\nservice was good! was asked twice if i needed refills, check came quickly, and just about everyone said thank you as i left! i would definitely come back just not get the pork or whatever that meat was.", 
            "don't let the lines sway you this place is worth the wait!  the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> was an eye opening gastronomic experience. after years of ordering various phos and miso soups this broth blew every other out of the park. it's ruined us forever. with a creamy consistency that rivals milk or melted butter this stock made from pork bones, fat, and collagen is heaven in a bowl. add to that some amazing thin noodles (you can order thicker noodles if you desire) and throw in the basic toppings of <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, two slices of chashu, bamboo shoots and kikurage mushrooms. omg it was to die for!  there are many additional toppings you can order to customize and make it perfect for your tastes. \n\nwe also ordered the gyoza and the regular <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. after reading all the reviews we had to give them a try. the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was good, but not fabulous. perhaps there's a difference if you order the takana <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>?  the gyoza were great. thin pillows stuffed with vegatables and pork. hot and delish!  \n\nlucky for us, we're in town for a couple of weeks so we'll definitely be back!",

            "i scoped this place out before my husband and i went on vacation to las vegas and couldn't wait to try the ramen. i ordered the tonkontsu ramen and added the spicy sauce to the broth. i was a little disappointed that the sauce didn't make the broth super spicy, but it did add a little heat. my only complaint is that the broth was a little on the salty side, but it was still flavorful. the noodles were nice and chewy and the bamboo shoots were still crunchy, which i like! we also ordered the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and it was delicious! i wish we would have ordered the kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> because i'm sure that would have been yummy too! you have to sign in when you first get there, so they know who to serve next. we got there a little after they opened and they were packed! we didn't have to wait too long though and service was fast and friendly.", 
            "my family and i have been coming here for the last five years off and on. sometimes once a month and there have been gaps as big as 9 months. we always have a pleasant experience and always have quality food. while there have been some slight inconsistencies over the years, we have almost always been happy with the food and service. this place is tiny and always busy. my favorites are the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with corn, 2 eggs, and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> and also the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. my kids adore this place and are always accommodated. the service is fast and the food is very reasonably priced. while i'm sure there are arguments for best ramen in las vegas, monta is in the lead for me.",

            "been coming here for years. no where else can compete with the broth. i've tried other ramen restaurants in the area. they are good but don't come close. best best best ramen. only drawback is the wait time. the gyoza and <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> are also amazing.", 
            "yes, there's always usually a wait. sometimes you'll get lucky and you'll just wait a few minutes and sometimes you'll wait till a group finishes their meal to get sat. it's a really small space. but oh man the ramen is delicious! i usually get the tonkotsu shoyu with additional egg and corn. yesterday i tried the kuro ramen which had black garlic oil and it didn't disappoint. the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> here is also a must. the service is usually fast and friendly. my only complaint is that once in a while, the broth is too salty. oh and yeah don't expect you're gonna sit around and chat with your group after your meal because you'll get some serious death stares from hungry customers waiting to get sat lol", 
            "asked a friend where to meet for lunch and they picked out this place. it was 4 of us and it took about a hour to be seated around 11am on a weekday. wouldn't recommend coming here during busy hours with a larger group because of limited seating. \n\nordered the special on the spicy ramen and it was very good but needed a bit more spice in my opinion,  also the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was really good. would come here again if they didnt have the wait.", 
            "i love their ramen. it is to die for. also, their beef belly <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> taste like heaven. get their tonkatsu ramen with the flavored egg topping. trust me.",

            "first time here and man, that food was soooo good! perfect food for this cold weather! the only reason this place is short one star from 5 is because of the size of the restaurant. most ramen places are pretty small but because their food is awesome, they shouldn't shy away from expanding because the food itself sells. the staff is very quick and efficient, they try to get people in as fast as they can and they are pretty quick with the needs of the customers! we ordered the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>, <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>, gyoza, <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and kimchee. everything we had was tasty and the pricing is definitely reasonable!!! will be coming here again.. hopefully it won't be as busy and hopefully they can expand the restaurant size in the future.. but count on us as future regulars!",

            "my wife and i stumbled upon monta ramen while visiting town. i love to get away from the strip where the price of food is reasonable. the restaurant is small and busy so prepare to wait a little. i has the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> which was excellent. my wife tried one of the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> dishes....superb.",

            "my friend and i got here around 7:30 p.m. and were lucky to grab the last two seats at the counter.   we got the tonkotsu-<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> and it was quite good.  the egg was cooked just right, it was running and i loved how it was perfect with the soup..  the noodles had a good bounce to it , but the pork had too much fat.  i felt like my portion of the pork was small and didn't have much meat.  it had more fat than meat, which is why i lowered my rating.   however, when i come back here, i need to try their kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, the table next to me ordered it  and it looked soooo good!!  it takes a while for the food to come, so if you super hungry prepare to wait.  when i left this place, i saw there was a large crowded gathered outside.  i'll make note of that the next time i'm back",

            "finally.  a shop in las vegas specializing in japanese ramen and monta does it quite well.  \n\ngreat space, simple and clean with a counter overlooking the kitchen.\n\nthe menu is straightforward.. two types of ramen, <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> and <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>.  then there are a few extra topping options such as a flavored soft boiled egg, and cha-shu.  in addition, they have a few rice dishes like the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>, <mark>Chashu Bowl</mark> and a mentaiko bowl. \n\nthe <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> is really good.  the pork broth/soup has great flavor... dense, rich , almost creamy.  \"umai\" would be the japanese expression to describe this taste.  the \"men\"  (noodles) were thin, typical of this style of ramen.. but i would've liked them to be a bit more hard or al dente as the italians would call it.  the cha-shu was good too.  \n\nhope everyone is excited to welcome this great new ramen shop to this city as much as i am..", 
            "i'm new to the world of authentic ramen. ever since my cousin suggested i watch a silly little film called ramen girl, i've been wanting to give it a try. i thought i would have to go to nyc or la to get my ramen fix, so i was completely stoked when i heard about this place through a friend.\n\nfrom the existing reviews, it sounded like i needed to try the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>. i'm glad i did because it was absolutely delicious. the broth is amazing and all the ingredients worked together to provide a satisfying ramen experience. of course, i had to add egg because that's just my thing.\n\nmy cousin also ordered a mini <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>. the pieces of meat looked like bacon, but they were soft and tender. it's a delicious side dish that complemented the hot bowl of soup. i will definitely return.", 
            "forget pho - ramen is chinatown's best hangover cure (particularly perfect for the day after an elite event). this is a place that really does live up to the hype. \n\nmy coworker tried the gyoza and a <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> and was very pleased with both. i stuck with the tonkatsu ramen ($6.95) with extra pork added ($2.50). the broth was silky, creamy, and perfect! pho broth seems so blah after eating this. the 6 slices of pork in my bowl were just fatty enough and so delicious! \n\na pleasant surprise was canned, cold <mark>Oolong Tea</mark> for $1.75. it was delicious and really hit the spot. when you're eating soup in 105 degree weather, a cold drink seems more appropriate than hot tea. \n\nservice was friendly and accomodating and the broth can't be beat ! i'll be back - but next time i'll be going noodle-less. the noodles are a waste of space ! more yummy broth and meat please.", 
            "love this ramen joint! had the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> and <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>, both very tasty, not too salty either. definitely better than ichiza's and shuseki. the only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is becuz they don't have a freaking ac running and it gets freaking hot, even at nite after just a few mins in the restaurant...but i guess it's worth the sacrifice for some good ramen",

            "the 5 star bump up is courtesy of my mom and grandma in law loving this place. my mom in law doesn't like asian foods, but grandma does since she grew up in indonesia. bf and i are food adventurous- them not so much. it's sometimes a struggle sometimes finding new places to please everyone so when they're happy with something, it makes me very happy. \n\nwe like to bring them out of their comfort zone and let them explore a bit. they shared a tonkatsu ramen and a <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>. they said it was the best soup and best pork they ever had. \n\nbf tried the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>- it is similar in profile that it is still the creamy brother like the tonkatsu but the added miso paste just add some sweetness. it's good but just whatever you're more into will determine the best soup: tonkatsu- savory/saltier, miso- sweeter and cuts the saltiness down a bit. they are very similar though. \n\ni went a different route and got the hiyashi chuka which is listed on a white board (not on the menu) as \"cold noodle salad\". the cold noodles come with julienned cucumbers, tomato, kikurage mushrooms, pork slices, half a egg. it has a ponzu sauce and has a smudge of karachi mustard on the side of the bowl to add as you wish (a little adds a perfect kick to everything). i also got a small chasu bowl too which is topped with some <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> and nori. \n\nthe service is friendly and attentive. i always appreciate places that have very nice servers. i have a habit of talking about the service and i think maybe i should start actually naming good servers so that maybe businesses can pay attention to who in their staff is doing things right. miki ( pulled these off receipts) just happened to be our server each time. :-)\n\nupdate 9/13\nbrought my mom in law and grandma for lunch. they didn't hesitate to say to eat here since they love the tonkatsu ramen and the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>. i got hiyashi chuka again since i love that dish and they do it well here. i also got a <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> bowl. not for everyone, but i like spicy roe and rice.\n\nupdate 10/26\nnothing better than soup on a crappy day. <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> this time. it's good. i think tonkatsu is my favorite, but i'll order this again. sometimes i feel a bit of variety. i always get a <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> though :-) it's noms.\n\nupdate 11/07 \ntried doing half shoyu and half tonkatsu broth. you can now order it as such. keep in mind this has the skinny noodles and not the curly ones incase you prefer one or the other. i think this is my favorite broth. tonkatsu is delicious- but it's rich. shoyu is good- but it's a bit lighter than i want. marry the two together and it's a really nice inbetween flavor and consistency. this is what i'll be ordering from now on. i will try to ask if i can do a shoyu miso as well since i think that would be a good, more delicate balance. \n\nupdate 11/16\ngot a <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>, but also tried their gyoza. it's pan fried, nothing too exciting about them, just what you'd expect a gyoza to be like. i was in the mood for them, but not something i'd get often i think.", 
            "finally got around to visiting the latest addition to ramen houses in vegas - monta noodle house.  conveniently located on spring mountain, right next to the super busy raku.  (smart business choice i would say.)\n\nthis place is bare bones - as in minimal tables and a bar, so don't come with a large group.  their super simple menu gets you in and out fast!  (a couple who came in around the same time we did had ordered, gotten their food, finished, paid and left by the time we were eating ours.)\n\ni went for their most popular dish - <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> ($6.95).  the main component is the broth, which is made up of boiling pork bones, fat, and collagen for hours.  this results in a cloudy white broth and would usually have the consistency of a thin gravy.  it automatically comes with two slices of char sui, takenoko (bamboo sprouts), kikurage (type of mushroom), and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>.  their char siu (barbecued pork) definitely isn't like the chinese kind, but definitely tasty.\n\nthe husband went for the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> ($7.25), which is ultimately bean paste blended with the pork broth giving it a richer flavor.  this was also good, and quite filling.\n\nwe also shared a regular order of the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> ($5.75).  it sits on a bed of rice, with fresh scallions and pickled red ginger.  i adore pork belly and the next time i come here, i'm going to order a dish of this all to myself.  it's fatty and good.  \n\na side dish we added on was the <mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark> ($1.50).  you can have this on the side or in your broth.  it's pickled mustard greens that may or may not be to your liking.  it's adds a different texture and taste to your ramen.  other toppings you can add on included nitamago (seasoned hard boiled egg), corn, butter, kimchee, and more char siu or <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>.\n\nthere's only one other kind of ramen they offer here - shoyu, which means soy sauce based.  you can also add extra noodles for $2 more if you save your soup and ask for \"kaedama.\"  other dishes available are gyoza, <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, kim chee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, takana <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, cha siu bowl, and <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> (marinated polluck roe).\n\nservice was good.  with two waitresses, they keep the flow of business going great and refilled beverages as needed.  it's not the best place to loiter with the limited seating and all, but definitely a great place to grab a quick bite and go.\n\nupdate!  \ni returned the following month for my own bowl of the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>.  this time the pork belly was sliced thinner, which wasn't to my personal preference.  guess it depends on who is working the kitchen that day.", 
            "last week i ate at monta four nights out of seven. i don't think i'll ever get tired of their delicious ramen - only three different options, but with many toppings available. and if i do, i'll move onto the kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> or <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>. the gyoza are pretty meh though. i won't get those again. \n\ni'm so glad there's finally a simple, authentic japanese ramen spot in vegas. it's small, it's hot and it's usually crowded. like the best ramen places in l.a. i used to drive the five hours just to get a bowl, now i can hit up this place between trips. huzzah.", 
            "this review is long overdue, as this is one of those places that i keep forgetting to review even though i eat there quite often.  monta is my favorite ramen house in town, and is the best that i have tried.  the broth is deep, full-bodied, creamy, and very meaty.  this broth is what is missing from many ramen places.  the noodles have very nice texture, which is what i mainly look for in the noodles.  \n\ni usually get the tonkastu ramen with a little extra roasted pork, but i like the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>, too.  the miso is also very good, but just different.  i would characterize the miso as sweeter, and i usually prefer the meatier broth to the sweet broth, but that's just me.  i also love that all the ramen's are below $7, i believe.  i think i usually pay around 6.95 for the ramen, so it's a great deal.  \ni have also tried the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>, which i really like.  i always try to order pork belly wherever i see it, and monta's did not disappoint.  \ni also like to get their canned, chilled <mark>Oolong Tea</mark>.  i think they have a couple other types, but i usually just get the oolong.  \n\nif you like ramen, you should definitely check out monta.  but if you don't like soup, noodles, or any combination of these, i wouldn't come because most of their menu is ramen.", 
            "its been years since i've tried a good ramen spot.. thanks to the fellow yelpers i got another go to spot for some great hot soup (other than pho) for those cold/chilly nights..\n\ni went here a couple days ago and decided to go for the suggested:\n\ntonkatsu - broth was tasty and creamy, resembled a miso type soup. noodles were great. the pork was awesome, it was extremely tender!\n\nshoyu - broth was much darker than the tonkatsu and had a slight soy sauce type flavor but a bit salty for my taste. noodles great as well. the pork definitely the highlight!\n\n<mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> (regular size) - first of, i'm so glad i ordered the full size than the small. i love yoshinoya beef bowls and this was a glorified version of it! this is a 100% must try\n\ngyoza - great starter, just dip it in a bit of soy sauce and enjoy..", 
            "did you ever think there would be such a restaurant here in an \"all-nighter city\" that cooks and serves ramen noodles? yes, there is tucked in-between small shops along spring mountain road or otherwise known as \"chinatown\" in vegas.\n\nas you may or may not know it', \"ramen\" noodles is one of japanese noodles invented in 1958 by japan's nissin foods. these are thin, ribbon-like, lightweight, calorie-rich, tasty, and cheap that can be bought in packs of 1 or 10 (you can find them in your asian or oriental grocery near you or in any of your college friend's pantry). it's one of those quick cook-it-up soups.\n\nit's rather an eccentric choice of mine to dine in this place with my mom last night around 6 p.m. on a very rainy night in vegas. soup is the answer to the cold, wet rain! ramen is kind-of over-the-top in this restaurant!\n\nwith a sweet, smiling greeting from the waitress, \"moshi, moshi!\" in japanese, which translates to \"hello\" or rather \"welcome!\" (i have learned a few japanese greetings in high school and  having been to tokyo before, the greeting didn't sound \"foreign\"). it brought a smile to my lips, i knew i would have a good dining experience. \n\nthe restaurant is small and cozy but cheerful with minimalist japanese style decor including the bathroom's interior design was contemporary japanese. there are table seatings and bar-like seating available. menu is simple. three choices of ramen noodle soups in \"<mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>\" (pork bone), \"<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>\" (soy paste), and \"<mark>Miso Ramen</mark>\" (bean paste). nothing else to confuse any soup-hungry soup-lover. a list of toppings for the noodles soup for an extra charge, 8 \"other dishes\", 4 kinds of cold beverages, 2 kinds of beer choices, but no dessert and no hot beverages on the menu.\n\ni ordered the house specialty soup which is the \"tonkatsu ramen\" soup. it's very hearty soup in a thick, cloudy milk-like tasty broth. topped with <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, 3 slices of pork, bamboo shoots, and with kikurage (dried black mushrooms), i drizzled it with sesame seeds and hot spice powder. oh, wow, there was no need for chewing the roast pork that melted in my mouth. surely, the pork melts! another dish i ordered was the \"mimi mentaiko\" which consists of fish cod roe (or fish eggs which are red-orange in color is otherwise, caviar) with strips of nori seaweed and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> topped on a bowl of steamed japanese rice. very appetizing, a sure favorite! the \"<mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>\" is also one dish you ought to try; delicious. as usual <mark>Green Tea</mark> on ice was my beverage pairing for these meals.\n\nfunny thing...the cheerful smiling waitress who served us went to show her colleagues in the kitchen my soup bowl which made her shyly squeal in delight to show them all it was empty!! i caught a glimpse of the cook's smile.\n\nyes, i left nothing in the bowl, not even a drop of soup!\nit must have been that i really love soup, or it was cold and wet outside or just that i needed to fill my belly...how can you go wrong in making such a choice to eat for the night. for a price that's easy on your pocket, aahemm! wallet...an excellent deal! \"arigato gozaimas!\" (english translation is \"thank you!\"), as we left the restaurant in good spirit!", 
            "whenever a craving for ramen hits , i usually went to togashi ramen. since it closed been eating pho instead , not the same. while searching in yelp ran across monta noodle, with all the great reviews and the cool weather decided to give it a try .  god i wanted this to b good . i ordered the tonkutso ramen .  not impressed the soup was dull, the pork flavor did not jump out , kinda muddled flavors. did not care for the noodles , don't know what type it was , but wife had the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> and those noodles were the ones i'm used to eating little more rubbery bite(chewy). even the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> flavors were weak.  also had the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> , i liked the flavors of this dish jus wish the pork was sliced a little thicker.   the one good thing was the bill was only $21 . service was good.\n        i miss togashi ramen and their mabo tofu ramen :( , well the search goes on for ramen....", 
            "strange - i thought for sure i wrote a review on monta.\n\ni have to rate their tonkatsu ramen my fav dish for 2010 and trust me, considering i eat out at least 7 meals/ week, it takes a lot to rate so high.  it ain't the fanciest , it ain't the cheapest but it's simply, just right.  add the roast pork, the egg and corn to the ramen and it's all good  !!!\n\nbase price is $7 but adding the extras puts it over $10.  i always share the bowl with the gf, along with either get the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> or the gyoza but  the star of the show is the ramen.  \n\nraku and monta in the same shopping center ...nice !", 
            "monta is definitely one of the better ramen shops in las vegas. its in the same strip mall as raku on decatur/ spring mtn. \n\nmonta reminds us of japan's ramen shops...its all about order your food, eat your food, and get out, so the next group can eat. it's not a posh restaurant, minimal tables/ seats. the restaurant holds at most 30 people (5 tables of 4 seats and about 10 seats on the counter), so if you go with a large party, just sit wherever you can and when you can or you might be waiting for awhile.\n\nthe menu is simple. miso, tonkatsu, or <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>. my favorite is...all of them. huge stock pots in the back have been boiling bones and veg for hours to create the backbone of their heavenly broth.  i seem to be on a tonkatsu ramen kick lately with its hearty broth... you could add some thickener to the broth and you would have a damn good gravy. they give you a good amount of ramen, a few slices of tender charsiu, bamboo, takenoko, <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, half boiled egg, and kikurage. its a solid meal for a cheap price, $7-8 and you can add other extras for a small price.\n\nanother favorite is their <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>. its cheap and filling...not to mention very tasty. you get the thinly sliced pork served over rice in a small bowl garnished with beni shoga. its tasty, fatty, and better when you get eat a little beni shoga (red pickled ginger) with it.. we always get a small bowl and share it.\n\ntheir gyoza is good as is the kim chee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. we need to try more of the items on their menu but we are creatures of habit and sometimes its hard to stray away from the  dishes that monta is known for.\n\nits easy to over order food at monta. because the ramen bowls are big...resist ordering other dishes unless you have a big party and you want to share. \n\nmonta is great on a hot day and better on a cold day!! \n\narooha!!!!!", 
            "it was a pretty good place  and really authentic, i was just a little skeptical at first because i've never been to that plaza before...\n\nbut that's not gonna stop me from going back:]\ni ordered the tonkatsu ramen, seemed like it's a favorite from the other yelp reviews, and a small <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> yum! the ramen was very flavorful and i loved all the condiments that were on the table and im pretty sure we used up all the ginger! the only thing that kept from giving this place 5 stars is that i wanted more broth in my bowl lol. \nthe place is tiny and there was a wait to go in during lunch time. service was friendly and you could tell from the atmosphere of this place that it is run by japanese people. yum! cant wait to experience ramenny goodness again.", 
            "so, i checked out this place for lunch today after reading what other yelpers had to say.  it opened at 11:30am and, according to my friend who arrived at that time, there was already a line of customers waiting--thank goodness she was there to snag us a table!  it's a small place with a counter and some tables, so be prepared to wait a little if it's busy.  i had the tonkatsu with some charshu added and a small <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>--i was starving since i just came from a bikram yoga class.  my friend had the shoyu.  after much slurping and a little conversation in between, we were both happily satisfied with our ramen dishes.  i couldn't finish all my food, but it was tasty and i will definitely be back to try the gyoza and the other two ramen dishes.  note that this is not a place to really linger after you eat, unless you want to be rude and make the people waiting around for your table angry, but who needs that kind of bad karma?!  arigato!", 
            "ordered the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>. great tasting ramen! i loved the broth, had a rich flavor. the portion was generous and quite affordable considering how much you're getting. although i don't really would want to get their bowls, my friend ordered the beef <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>, expecting it to be as big as the ramen bowl but alas it was really small. \n\nnote: this place is small and gets crowded real quick. don't come here with a group no bigger than 5-6. you're going to find it real difficult to get a table.", 
            "service here is hit or miss. sometimes excellent, sometimes not so attentive. i've eaten here about 9 or 10 times, and i noticed that it is server dependent. there are 2 servers that seem to consistently let me down, where as the other 2 are always great and work together well to make sure they always check up on us.\n\nthe chasu (bbq pork) here is quite good, imo it is better than the chasu at the well known daikokuya in los angeles. oddly, they have 2 different types of ramen noodles here that are assigned to the type of broth you choose and they will not let you choose the other noodles with a different broth. i prefer the noodles they use in the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>, but normally prefer a combination of tonkatsu and shoyu broth. the lack of flexibility is a bit upsetting and leaves the foodie in me yearning for food my way. \n\nfortunately, i tried all of their <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and rice bowls and have been pretty happy with all of them. my favorite is the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>. yum!!! i add a bit of the crushed garlic, chili oil, and japanese chili flakes to make it absolutely scrumptious. if you like pork (who doesn't), you must try this.", 
            "we went yesterday for lunch and the hubs wants to go back today. that pretty much sums it up. it was that good. we went with our two daughters, which enabled us to try most of the noodle offerings. \n\ni had the tonkotsu (not to be confused with tonkatsu), my husband had the tonkotsu-shoyu and the girls both had the miso. we also shared a <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>. everything was spot on delish. the tonkotsu is the heaviest, richest broth...delicious, but i think i'll wait until the weather cools before ordering it again. the tonkotsu-shoyu is a combo of the richer tonkotsu and the lighter, clearer shoyu broth. it had the richness from the tonkotsu, but the shoyu gave it a delicious brightness. we did not get to try the plain shoyu as both girls insisted on miso. the misi was also very good, but did not out-shine the tonkotsu-shoyu. the toppings were perfect...thin slices of ultra tender chasu (pork), strips of mushroom and pickled red ginger (nothing like sushi ginger).\n\nthe <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> was everything the name suggests. tender, well seasoned pork belly atop sticky rice. so good. we like to sprinkle the toasted sesame seeds on top.\n\nthe service was fast, friendly and very welcoming. the place is tiny as are most noodle houses you find in japan. we went at 2:30 in the afternoon and were able to get a table right away. (was almost hoping they'd be packed...forcing us to go to raku *sigh* my fav, lol)\n\nheads up! as of june 1st they are offering hayashi chuka which is a cold japanese noodle dish. perfect for summer. we didn't order it this visit, but will definitely be headed back soon. it is a favorite of ours, but we've only had it in friends' kitchens. they serve canned soft drinks, and our whole family highly recommends you give the calpico a go. it's tangy, almost reminiscent of the original tangy flavor yogurt at red mango or pinkberry. very refreshing :)", 
            "thank you yelp!!! after a disasterous meal at ichiza the night before, monta was a refreshing change.\n\nthe ramen bowls aren't super huge but the food is delicious! i ordered the hiyashi chuka special on the board (cold noodles) with ponzu sauce and no mustard. the noodles were deliciously chewy and the dressing hit the spot. it came with a large portion of shredded egg omelette, cucumbers, tomatoes, and their awesome chasu.\n\nwe also had the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> to share and it was awesome! the pork was tender and juicy. \n\n<mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> had broth that had good depth.\n\ncome here early or you'll have to wait since the tables and seats are very limited!", 
            "im in love! tonkatsu ramen mmmmm and <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>! i'm sad when there's a wait!", 
            "small ramen house - max occupancy is 26 people. thus there is going to be a wait for a table or a seat at the bar. as most people mention, it is worth the wait. the waitresses are friendly and efficient. we ordered ramen but also gyoza and <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. i liked the fact that everything came out at the same time, which is not the case at some restaurants. \n\nthe tonkatzu broth is richer and hearty, while the shoyu (soy sauce based) broth is clearer. comes with basic toppings and if you want more (noodles, pork) or additions like corn and kim chee, it's an add-on.\n\noverall, great bowl of ramen with good texture noodles (not overcooked) with friendly, efficient service. i'll have to try the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> next time.", 
            "when you think of ramen you would think cup 'o' noodles but after coming here for the first time i will never think of ramen the same way again. the place is pretty small and seats about about 30 people, but from what i've heard from people that have been to japan the look and feel of the place would be your typical ramen house. the first time i visited monta was with a group of 6 and the wait wasn't that bad considering it was during lunch and the place was pretty packed. i also liked the fact that you can sit at the counter in front of the cooks so you can see all the action going on in the kitchen.\n\nthe food here is awesome, from the ramen to the gyoza to the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> all are simple dishes with outstanding flavor. i've tried both the shoyu and the tonkotsu-<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> the only difference was the broth where the tonkotsu was a pork bone flavored broth. in both they put slices of pork which have been slowly braised to the point it melts in your mouth. so if you're a pork lover this is the place to come check out. the noodles are cooked to perfection and by watching the cooks they use a fresh noodles in which they cook to order. the texture combination of the soft pork and the chewy noodles makes you want more and more.\n\ni guarantee you will never pick up the package ramen ever again after you've visited monta. so if your looking for a quick bite and want quality japanese ramen come check out monta it will make you say \"cup 'o' what???\"", 
            "and i still....love monta! \n\ncold noodles on a 110 degree day...perfect! i love their cold noodles! it is filled with yummy things like cucumbers, eggs, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts \"mushroom/fungi\" and of course the fatty pork. since i tried it a couple of weeks ago, i haven't strayed from the cold to the hot. the mustard is a bit spicy for my taste so i always have them leave it off.  i've only tried the sesame sauce thus far, but i am pretty content with it. for the price you pay, you definitely get your money's worth. i've always had to take half of it home to eat it for later which works out for me since i love leftovers! \n\ni also ordered the small <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>.... that sauce with rice is heaven! i love monta and i love how efficient and fast the food comes out. if you are coming for lunch, it's packed at 11:30 when they first open, so come later if you can.",

            "ode to monta's <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>\n\ncue violin\n\nhey, i just ate you, and this is crazy... but here's my hunger , so feed me maybe?   all of the ramen bowls, try to tempt me, but here's my chopsticks, so feed me maybe?  \n\nyeah this will probably be out of date by the time i hit submit review, but i'll deal with it.   i've been to monta several times since it opened, and the first 8 or 9 times i stuck with getting various ramen.  of those my favorite quickly became the tonkotsu as i really enjoyed the creaminess of it.  i did like the other two as well, but always found myself going back to tonkotsu.  as a quick aside, i actually found the tonkotsu-shoyu to be my least favorite.  the pork was always tender and tasty, and i would almost always get an egg added and i tried most of the other additions as well.   i personally didn't find many of them to be worth the extra cost to add, though i did like the <mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark> on occasion.  \n\nfor an appetizer i had the gyoza a few times and found them to be very good examples, but not extraordinary at the same time.   then one day i decided to split a <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> with a friend as an appetizer.  game change.   it's seriously all i think about when i think of monta now.  as much as i enjoyed the ramen whenever i'd had it, it took a backseat to this dish in my heart and stomach.  currently saving up for an engagement ring.  <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> will make a lovely bride.\n\nservice is always friendly if a little rushed, and i always thought the overall price was decent.\n\nstill need to try anime and sora so no comparison on ramens unfortunately, but unless they have <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> on their menu, it might not matter.", 
            "probably the best ramen in vegas, i got the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> and it was great, can't wait to try the rest of them. but the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was the worst i ever had, then again why come to a japanese ramen house and order <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> right. i will be back to try the rest of the ramen and the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>.", 
            "you can tell food is good when people are willing to stand in line (which is often out the door) to wait through our blistering summers and biting winters.  luckily, service and cook time are quick, so i have never had to wait more than fifteen minutes or so for a table or spot even when it's crowded.  \n\nmonta is a small, hole in the wall ramen place.  there are three kinds of seating: booth, table and bar stools.  if you're eating solo or you have a small party, you'll probably get seated more quickly because the individual bar stools will open up.  additionally, so they can keep the flow going and keep wait times down, you'll have to sign in on a sheet, and they won't seat you until your entire party is present.  from the bar, you can see the crew in the kitchen cooking the meals.\n\non to the food.  i normally order the tonkot-shoyu (mixed broth of the tonkotsu and shoyu) with corn and nori (dried seaweed), and add in some chili oil and spices from the table set.  the soup itself comes with <mark>Chashu Pork</mark>, bamboo shoots, kikarage (black mushrooms) and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>.  i've tried ramen at two other locations (one in the galleria mall in henderson, and the other was anime ramen) and this is definitely my favorite spot to go.  the noodles have just the right amount of chewiness, the broth is flavorful but not overpowering, and the chashu is tender, melt in your mouth goodness.  \n\ni have also tried the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> and gyoza, and both are pretty good.  i wish they had a different sauce for the gyoza, but soy sauce mixed with vinegar and a little chili oil works just fine.  i've only discovered this place in the last year, but i can honestly say it's become one of my go-to restaurants and it's definitely a comfort food.  prices are more expensive than your fifty cent package of top ramen, but it's still cheap for a restaurant at under ten dollars an entree.  \n\nmy only bone to pick is that their <mark>Green Tea</mark> is only chilled and it comes in a can, though as far as canned <mark>Green Tea</mark> goes, it's not bad.", 
            "next to my favorite japanese restaurant (raku) lies monta, the best japanese ramen house i've been to so far.\n\nit's a small and busy restaurant, and i recommend that you time yourself wisely...otherwise, you'll be stuck waiting outside under the las vegas sun. \n\nthe wait was over and my cousins and i were finally able to sit in the well air conditioned room. let the ramen begin.\n\ni ordered their special- cold noodle with the mushroom, tomatoes, pork. the words 'cold' and 'noodle' shouldn't be in the same sentence, i know...but this is different. it was a refreshing blend of meats and veggies for the hot weather.\nmy cousins ordered the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>, which is served with rice. to attempt..to even try to get close on its description..it's like yoshinoya but 100 times better!\nthe other cousin got the miso based soup with an additional corn. it's so creamy and filled with flavor. \n\ni rarely head to the strip for food, instead take on adventures to find the best asian places here in the desert. \n\n4 stars for their awesome food. but if i could, i'll give them a 3 for the seating capacity. i just don't like waiting.", 
            "every time i hear monta, my mouth starts watering, my heart starts beating faster and i suddenly need to get that delicious miso broth in my mouth, a nitamago and some chasu pork. oh yeah. monta is simply delicious. sadly it is very small and sometimes the wait time can be a little long and frustrating , specially when you are super hungry and that big o window lets u see people eating their awesome noodles\n\nnow, let me say , that ive tried ramen in various places and i keep coming back to monta. their freshly made gyoza and their <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> are amazing as well.\n\na must try if you are in vegas", 
            "we love us some good ramen and monta ramen was that!  a couple of weeks ago we spent the weekend out in vegas and this was our top destination :)\n\nwe ordered the tradition <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> ($6.95) as well as the tonkotsu-<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> ($6.95).  both were good but the tradition tonkotsu was what really caught our attention. the broth was really good. smooth, creamy and a tad salty.  \n\nthe noodles were perfectly cooked and tasted great.\n\nthe meat was also above average. tender with a good amount of fat.  \n\nwe also added an egg to our bowls and we were so glad we did. it was cooked correctly with the right amount of creaminess to it.\n\nit's the best ramen we've had since our trip back from japan.\n\nin addition to the ramen bowls, we ordered a mini <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> which was good enough to steal our attention from the ramen. the pork belly was thinly cut, which makes it a lot easier to eat with the rice. it's a great side to order if you visit.\n\nas for the staff they were friendly, maybe a little bit overwhelmed. the cook didn't look happy at all for some reason but he was still churning out some great food so we can't complain!\n\noverall we would recommend trying this place out. even in 110 degree weather, it's was oishii! (delicious in japanese)", 
            "wow!  excellent!  best ramen in vegas.  seating is limited and you should expect to wait.  parking is not great, but we always find a spot.  if your ramen experience is limited to the walmart variety, then do yourself a favor and try this place.  the broth is more than an over salted packet and the noodles seem fresh made.  my favorite is the tonkotsu bowl.  the kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was okay and the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> is amazing.", 
            "this was definitely a great find!  if you like soup noodles, soups that takes hours to make, or melt in your mouth pork belly...then this is a must try. \n\nthis place is very small with minimum seating area and a limited menu.  their main focus is their ramen and <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>, so if you do decide to make the trip out from the strip of las vegas (about a 10 min taxi ride), then you have to try their ramen and <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>.  tip:  anticipate a wait due to the limited seating area.  fortunately, we were in luck...no wait!  score!!!  the prices here are very reasonable for the portion and the flavor you receive.  you are definitely getting your money worth.\n\nwe ordered the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> and a small <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>.\n\nthe <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> was a small size, but it was plenty for us since we totally devoured ourselves with tons of fantastic food on our trip to vegas.  the bowl was pretty when it arrived!  the bowl was decorated with pickled ginger to cut the fattiness of the pork belly and an abundant amount of scallions to give the bowl a fresh green flavor.  below the green and the red, was a pile of juicy, tender, and fatty pork belly gleaming at you. \n\nthen our star...<mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>.  we added extra <mark>Chashu Pork</mark>, corn, butter, and egg (this is a definite must add...super soft and melt in your mouth!) to our bowl of ramen.  i have to say, this was a delight to the eye.  the portion was a good size, about the equivalent of a large bowl of pho.  the flavor of the soup was deep and meaty, the noodles had a good bite to it and every bite had the yummy soup flavoring (we saw them cook the noodles in the slow cooked broth), the pork was drool worthy, the crisp sweet corn added an additional tastiness to the bowl, and the black fungus and bamboos added earthiness.\n\noverall a delicious experience...simple yet still makes us think about it all the time.  of course not as good as the ramen you can get in japan, but definitely pretty good for usa.  we would rate this place a 7 for flavor, price, and quality of ingredients.", 
            "great ramen place!  been here twice and have been thoroughly satisfied each time.  with how small this place is, i'm not surprised at the wait...even at 10pm at night.  \n\nthe service, though brisk, is also very helpful and friendly.  no one has time to stand around to chat and explain things to you but they try very hard to seat everyone as quickly as possible and they manage to bring you your food quickly and correctly.\n\nhubby and i are purists...we stay with the tonkotsu broth.  the broth was rich and sticky...didn't taste like it was brewed only from pork bones but also from pork feet/hock.  very tasty and comforting.  on our second visit, i got extra char siu.  when the fat from the char siu melted into my broth, it got even thicker and richer.  hey, you say greasy, i say yummy!!\n\nother standouts - takana <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>...all very good!!  definitely going to be a staple for us when we're in lv.", 
            "this tiny little ramen place was everything it was cracked up to be.  my parents live locally and they'd heard from several sources about how great this place was, so when we were visiting, we took them out to monta.\n\nwe managed to get there at the perfect time because only 1 table was occupied, so getting my dad in was quick and easy (he is in a wheelchair).  they don't have hot drinks, so enjoy some ucc oolong or <mark>Green Tea</mark> or a can of calpico (i wish they had ucc iced coffee!!)  we placed our order and watched as the crowd built up very quickly.  food arrived fast and piping hot.\n\nthe gyoza was fine - crunchy on one side, steamed on the other, hot all the way through.  my mom and hubs got the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> and my dad and i got the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> (i got mine with corn)\n\nthe charsiu/chashu/chasyu (how ever you want to spell it) was so amazing - i do not use this phrase lightly.  it was literally melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  the pork fat was flavorful and rich and just melted away when it hit your tongue.  so amazing!  i am sad that i didn't stop and order a side of it immediately.\n\nthe ramen noodles had a great chewy texture and the miso broth was delicious.  my mom was very pleased with the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>, as well.\n\nthe only thing that didn't live up to everything else was the mentaiko bowl.  i got it because i love hot rice and tarako (and my mom had made some for me the night before and i was still jonesing for it).  unfortunately, the rice was not very hot and a little on the dry side, so the bowl was disappointing.  i ladeled some of the miso broth into the bowl and that made the rice more palatable, but it messed with the flavor of the mentaiko.\n\nall in all, it was a great experience and i can't wait to go to vegas again so i can go to monta again! \n\n**accessibility note - the parking lot is not very wheelchair friendly and monta itself can be a little tight to try to get a wheelchair in and out.  the only wheelchair ramp up from the parking lot is blocked by the car when you park in the handicapped space, so once you get the person into their chair, you have to move the car to get them up to the sidewalk level where the restaurants are.", 
            "i've been to this place for a while. no matter when i go (11 am, 2 pm, 4 pm or 9 pm), it's always crowded. therefore, it's not a good restaurant for a big group celebration (because of the size of restaurant), but if you are looking for an authentic and delicious ramen, cold noodle or <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>, this is the place you shouldn't miss when you visit vegas.\n\nmy favorite is <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> and <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>. some of my friends claimed the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> was slightly salty, but i disagree with them. the fat of <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> created this awesome aroma and chewy texture from this simple dish. no matter what i ordered that day, i can't help but always order an extra small <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> every time i visited.", 
            "i always have good dining experience here when i stop by. i am always prepared to wait a bit because the place is small, but i usually get lucky to snatch a bar seat. a and i are creatures of habit; so far we've ordered their <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> and tonkatsu ramen with all the trimmings. the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> is delicious, perfect amount of meat for the rice, yet sometimes i find it a little bit on the greasy side. the tonkatsu ramen is good too. fresh thin noodles with tasty broth. i think it's one of the best ramen houses in lv, but i've had better ramen when i used to live in the bay area. i am still fan though, because the servers are quick and efficient. the prices are more than fair too so what's not to love?",

            "i'm not sure what else i can add that won't echo the other 700+ reviews listed for monta, but the legitimacy of the food here can be proven by the 30+ minute wait in the dead heat of a vegas summer.\n\nmonta is tiny and maybe seats about 50 people-pretty sure the max occupancy sign inside the restaurant said 70, but they'd be pushing it. the service is quick and no frills but friendly. the menu is simple-there are four types of ramen and a variety of appetizers and alternative dishes like kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, gyoza, cold noodles and a <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>. ramen comes with add ons like seasoned egg (so good), mustard greens, scallions, extra pork belly, corn and butter. \n\nthe broths are rich and flavorful and it's hard for me to pinpoint a favorite, but if i had to pick the tonkotsu-shoyu would probably be it. the noodles have that perfect ramen texture-chewy and slurpy, in a good way!\n\nbecause of the size of the space, it can be an intimate dining experience with complete strangers particularly if you sit at the bar. but it's also one of those places that solo dining isn't awkward and can actually be to your benefit when there is a line out the door.\n\nmonta is your spot for legit ramen with no pretense!",

            "i like this place, but have come less over time because of the crowds you have to fight through to get a table here. if you come on a weekend, expect to wait 30-45 min to get a table since they don't have very many. enjoyed it a lot more the 1st few times i came here but have been less impressed lately. seems like as it's gotten more crowded, the food quality and service has gone downhill.\n\ni've had the ramen, <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, and <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> here and nearly any choice you get is pretty decent. sometimes you may get a bowl of ramen that's a little saltier than others...i'm sure this is directly related to how busy they've gotten. hopefully they will look into expanding or adding another location to alleviate the crowd issue here.", 
            "i crave monta ramen. it's a staple example of decently priced, quality, authentic food that's worth the comeback visit(s). although fair warning, beware the wait times and lines for this anticipated and sought out food.    \n\ni have had most variations here and there, but i am a die hard miso fan and prefer to try the miso anywhere. there is only 4 broth bases to choose from along with the occasional special, as well as a nice side menu with a lot of other small dishes to choose from. \n\nas for the miso. the salty creaminess with those thick bodied noodles always fulfills the appetite and keeps the taste buds impatient to scoff down more. simply comes with 2 pieces of chatsu pork, bamboo shoots, scallions, and mushroom.\n\na little skimpy with pork in my opinion, but it temps me to order extra because it really is the best i've ever had. so rich and flavorful and tender. fat and all should absolutely be savored. you must also pay for additional toppings such as butter, nori, etc. i either get a side of kimchi or the small <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> which is equally delicious and abundantly layered in a rice bowl.\n\ni applaud the waitresses for their patience and kindness. the place is almost always beyond busy and full, yet they still handle and attend to customers quickly and with a good attitude. \n\ni always recommend to friends, but this is a fairly fairly small venue for such popularity (they have also recently opened another one in henderson) so either have a treat for adventurous self, or go with a few friends, but not very accommodating for very large parties.",

            "of all things ramen,japanese, and delicious, monta ramen on spring mountain blvd falls right in the middle. it's nothing mind blowing, nor is it terrible, hence the 3stars. \n\nfirst off... place is super tiny. so expect a wait and make sure to write your name down. even when it's not packed, it get packed pretty quickly... and because it's so tiny, it tends to get uncomfortable when it's packed... and that's uncomfortable on both the eating and waiting end. eating coz all the tables are close, even the bar area is hardly comfortable elbow room for the seats next to each other. and also when it's a long wait and you're eating, you seriously feel like everyone waiting is watching you eat to see how much longer you will be sitting down. uncomfortable on the waiting end coz there's not much of a waiting area at all. if you have issue with confined spaces... not the place for you my friend. \n\nthe decor and seating does follow the more traditional japanese ramen house with it being a small narrow restaurant, with wood tables and seatings. i noticed most if not all servers are japanese so it keeps to the authenticity. minus the hispanic cooks lol \n\nthe food is good. price is definitely what keeps me coming back and dealing with the wait and tight space tho. the taste and flavors aren't mind blowing and it's nothing to rave about to your friends.  but it's definitely somewhere i can easily say \"i got the bill tonight\" without regretting it and feeling like i broke my wallet over a filling meal. i will say the portions are great for the cheap prices. \n\nmy favorite actually is not the ramen here but the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>. the pork belly is cooked just right; not over or under cooked and just the right amount of sauce in the right to compliment the flavors of the pork belly. for me... that's the ticket item that has me returning. plus another good point is service is fairly quick... but they have to be... they need their customers revolving in and out to accommodate for lack of space. \n\ntbh the location in henderson is better. just this area is closer to my house than henderson. the ramen can tend to be too salty for my palate... but again like i said it's not amazing but it's not terrible. but definitely worth going for the prices and the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>! nom nom nom", 
            "date & time: sunday, 2/15/15 @ 830pm\n\ni came here after work with a few coworkers, expecting since it's still the weekend it would be pretty busy (said a co-worker who was raving about this place).\n\nthe wait was about 30 mins, then the line grew as we were waiting for our table. we ordered:\n- soyu ramen (extra chasiu)\n- 2 tonkatsu ramen (extra chasiu and egg)\n- 1 <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>\n- 4 drinks\ntotal is around $50\n\nsince this was the first time trying a ramen spot besides my own mothers, i decided why not, since one of my co-workers have been asking all of us to go everyday at work. we entered the restaurant after the wait and the table are really packed close together (so it's like we're eating the table next to us). the people in line are watching other people eat, it's kind of awkward.\n\ni tried my ramen, it was good but not the greatest (i told him, the hype he was giving this restaurant was not necessary anymore). the chasiu was weird, it was disintegrating in my soup. it was mostly melty, fatty, and i found it pointless to get extra. \n\nmy love got so sick from this place, he was perfectly fine, until that night. he was sweating and grabbing a fever, everything came out from both ends for a couple of days. he's afraid to try ramen again :(", 
            "we order regular <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> and <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> for supper...\n\nthe <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> is a bit too salty for me... however it does have great flavors and tender pork belly.\n\nas for the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>, the noodle was cooked accordingly. the rich broth is complementing the tender pork in the noodle. the taste of bamboo shoot was a bit too strong for me and it does not served with eggs which was diaappointing...\n\nanyway, it is a decent japanese restaurant...", 
            "awesome food but be prepared for a long wait. \n\ncame here based on the awesome reviews. showed up a little after 1pm on a weekday. we waited easily more than an hour. this place is super tiny, but the turnover seemed as speedy as it could be. it was cold outside and there was no shelter from the cold. i would never wait to eat at this place during the heat of summer!!! impossible!!! \n\nwhen we finally got seated, our orders were taken promptly. surprised to find a little cubby to stash my stuff under the bar!!! clever!!! i loved my sapporo on tap. sitting at the bar gave us a bird's eye view on how the food, especially the pork roasts were prepared. the logs of pork roasts were seared on something that looks like a huge george forman grill. oh!!!!! if you could only hear the sizzle of the hot grill & the smell the wonderful umami flavor of roast pork!!! the roasts are then placed into an oven and cooked until tender. this pork is then cut into nice generous slices to garnish the ramen or cut up into the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. i take the time to mention what i witnessed because you feast not only with your palate but also with your other senses as well. i love that they roasted the pork & didn't just boil or steam them to oblivion. this is probably what makes this ramen house so yummy...the care in how the pork is prepared. \n\nwhat we ordered...\n\nspicy <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>...the most popular ramen on yelp. also highly recommended by those drooling to get in. i hear that corn & butter add-ons are a must!! \nthe broth was delicious, the ramen noodles were cooked perfectly, and the ramen was garnished with nice big round slices of roast pork. in most ramen houses, the chasu is often half fat... although there is nothing wrong with some good fat. these slices were mostly meaty. yay!!! \n\n<mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>...also popular on yelp, but the pork in my bowl wasn't crispy at all. good, but not as good as the....\n\nkimchee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>....surprisingly very good!! i am usually skeptical to order \"korean\" items at japanese restaurants and vice versa, but it tasted so good!!! the big juicy pieces of pork made the rice so decadent!!! yum!!!!\n\ni didn't take off any stars for the wait...they can't help that they're a fabulous popular place!!! :d", 
            "im not sure but for me the ramen i ordered is really salty.. i also tried the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> which is really good. but the place is small and waiting time  is long.", 
            "everything we ordered was excellent. the kuro ramen was garlic heaven. <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> was  excellent. the kids loved the <mark>Chashu Pork</mark> bowl and the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>.  will be back here definitely. the price is very affordable as well.", 
            "when i found out this place was in one my favorite areas of town i was very excited to check it out.\n\nthere are several restaurants and even the snow shavery in this parking lot so sometimes parking can be a little difficult, but it's worth it. \n\nmonta was smaller than expected inside...large parties may have a hard time here. there is bar seating much like a sushi bar and 4-5 tables. that's it! we came on a friday evening at 6pm and were in and out by 7! service was fast and easy. \n\nthe menu is simple, basically it's a choice of a ramen noodle bowl or rice to include a <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> which is soooo fantastically good!   you can get a side of kimchi, flavored boiled egg, <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, butter, etc. they have plenty of table top items to add extra flavors to your meal which i loved...chili oil, soy sauce, garlic butter, vinegar and a blend of awesome seasonings. \n\ndrinks come in a can (except water) and i think there was a choice of one beer (asahi). \n\nwe had a great experience and will likely return for another round.",

            "very impressed and certainly will be back.  there are so many asian restaurants in the area, if you aren't local or know someone here, you could easily overlook this place.  while it is small, it seats more than you'd expect and they also have an l-shaped counter with additional seating when you come in.  always a good sign when you are greeted warmly, there's a sign-up sheet for waiting, there are kids with their folks, and regulars since the waitresses knew some of them by name. \n\nwe had the tonkatsu ramen and the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>, with corn and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>.  the noodles were perfect, chewy, and the broth was top notch.  we also had the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>.  don't miss these!  and the food does come out fast from the kitchen.  compared to the bay area, their prices are pretty reasonable and you get plenty to eat.\n\nservice was excellent.  if you don't like to wait or are a true vegetarian, probably not the place for you.  we got there at 5:30pm on a sunday and the place was just 1/2 full.  by 6:00pm, it was packed and they had more than a dozen people waiting.  i'm guessing if there's a line somewhere, it's usually a good bet the place is worth the wait.  it is located in a strip mall so there is parking, but there are also many restaurants as well.  they also called a taxi for us when we were done which was awesome.  i'll be back for sure.", 
            "i came for the ramen, but i will remember the pork belly!  \n\nthis little ramen shop was located in the china town area of vegas.  there are actually a few other asian things in this plaza.  i was happy we found this spot.  it's a legit japanese ramen place, we tried the kuru ramen which was black and garlicy. i thought it was good, not amazing, but something different.  you don't get to select how firm you want your noodles, i felt they were on the firm side so if you like that.  price is good, i think about $6.75 for a bowl of ramen and you can get refills on noodles if you wish.  you can also add additional toppings like egg, etc.  \n\nwhat was a must-do was getting a side of the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>.  think of it as an upgraded yoshinoya beef bowl.  instead, it's pork belly, the taste is strong juicy.  it is a little much to get ramen and a small side of <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> but i wouldn't have it any other way.\n\ni want to come back and try <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> with my ramen but i don't know if i'll be able to not get the pork belly again.  i would try a different ramen next time to see how they do on the traditional items.  solid place for authentic japanese ramen and sides.",

            "this was my first meal in vegas and it was really good! finding parking here was kinda annoying since the parking lot for this shopping center was small. we were actually surprised that we were able to be seated right away as a party of 5. when we left there was a line going outside the door, so i'd either come early or expect a wait because this place is super tiny inside (there's a few tables and then bar style seating). \n\nlooking over the menu, i was shocked at how cheap the ramen was. but then i realized that the ramen is very basic -- broth, 2 slices of pork, <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, ramen and bamboo shoots. if you want extras like egg, extra pork, corn, kimchi, etc. you'll have to pay extra. but even after adding toppings my food still came out to be like $10. \n\nwe started off sharing a <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> as a table. it was pretty good! as for my meal, i ordered the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> and asked for spicy paste on the side. i also opted to add the egg and corn.  after adding the spicy paste in my <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> it tasted great and was full of flavor! the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> also had the thick wavy noodles that i love. \n\nservice was quick and efficient. i kind of got the vibe that they wanted us to leave quickly after paying the bill, but i can't really blame them with a line out of the door! if you're looking for an inexpensive meal that will fill you up then you should check out monta ramen!", 
            "probably the best ramen place in vegas and the price is right!  we ordered one <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>, one tonkatsu ramen, and one shoyu tonkatsu ramen. also got the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>. all were pretty good. the kids, who are avid ramen fans couldn't decide between giving this a 3 or 4, so we agreed on a 3.5 star. my broth was a little salty - i think i'll be drinking a lot of water later!  the pork belly was very flavorful and was perfect over the bed of rice. service was friendly and fast! it's a small place, but we lucked out cuz it wasn't that busy at about 7pm on a tuesday. i would definitely come back when i'm craving ramen in vegas!",

            "first time here and man, that food was soooo good! perfect food for this cold weather! the only reason this place is short one star from 5 is because of the size of the restaurant. most ramen places are pretty small but because their food is awesome, they shouldn't shy away from expanding because the food itself sells. the staff is very quick and efficient, they try to get people in as fast as they can and they are pretty quick with the needs of the customers! we ordered the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>, <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>, gyoza, <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and kimchee. everything we had was tasty and the pricing is definitely reasonable!!! will be coming here again.. hopefully it won't be as busy and hopefully they can expand the restaurant size in the future.. but count on us as future regulars!",

            "i really like this place a lot. the food is awesome, i always get the tonkatsu shuyo which has the chicken and port broth. it's a pretty good portion for the price. a side of kimchi could be a hit or miss because sometimes the they you like 2 pieces of kimchi and other times there'll be a lot. the ramen itself comes with the noodle, broth, mushroom, bamboo and two pieces of the pork slice. it's has a pretty awesome flavor. my friend and i always share the a big <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> as well. which when you add a lot of pickled ginger, it is to die for. so when it comes to food, they're pretty awesome. but the service is a bit crappy. \nthey're really poor with service. \ni think we saw them twice in our visit. taking our order and giving us the check. not that i need them to baby sit me but a water refill would be appreciated. \nalso they can't use your card unless it's $10+ so bring cash when you can.",

            "tiny restaurant, but the food is really good!  prices are affordable too.  i went with my bff last night close to closing time.  she ordered the tonkatsu ramen and i ordered the <mark>Chashu Bowl</mark>.  the <mark>Chashu Bowl</mark> comes topped with nori, and the next day when i ordered takeout i definitely asked for it to be left off.  but the chashu is almost perfect - melty and tender on your tongue with the sweet soy-laced warm rice.  the only places i've had better chashu was in japan and at a specific restaurant in the bay area, ca.  i tried the ramen, and it's good though too salty for my tastes.  the <mark>Chashu Bowl</mark> was worth driving out for though, and the next time we are in vegas we will definitely stop by.", 
            "had the ramen a while back, when they first open. it was very busy and we sat at the counter. \n\nit was the same today, very busy for late lunch. i didn't expect a wait list but we put our name down and waited, no too long around 10 minutes. we sat at the counter!\n\nwe ordered the gyoza, the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>, the <mark>Chashu Bowl</mark>, spicy <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> and the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>. it was all very good, the broth was perfectly blended, warming the noodles through and the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> is worth a repeat, it was top of my favorites list! \n\nservice was great, food was great, now that cold weather is upon us, this may become a welcome spot!",

            "this is still my favorite spot for ramen. you just have to come early or later. you'll wait for a while if you come between 630p to 930p. \n\nitems ordered:\ngyoza- \nalways a winner, crispy and chewy wonton wrap with tasty meat fillings. make your own dipping sauce with condiments on table.\ncold ramen with yuzu-\ngreat noodle chew with different varieties of veggies, egg and <mark>Chashu Pork</mark> dressed in yuzu dressing. very refreshing\nshoyu tonkatsu-\na mix of both broth and those delicious noodles. the broth makes your lips stick, yum\n<mark>Chashu Bowl</mark>-\nexactly that thinly sliced chashu on top of rice\n<mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>-\nsweet soy sauce cooked with the pork belly until super tender. \n\ni always recommend this place to everyone, it's a small spot that probably seats about 45 including the counter. constantly busy and consistent with quality of their food."

            "there's an authentic ramen place in las vegas! i was really impressed with monta noodle house. their menu is very simple and short. i tried the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> and it was delicious! all this pork fatty goodness in the broth and the noodles were perfectly cooked not too soggy not too hard. you can add an egg, pork, corn, more noodles or <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> for a couple more bucks. it's a small place which only fits about 26 people max, but it definitely is the best place for ramen. the broth is not from a package and i think this is what makes it oh so delicious. we added eggs to ours, but i wasn't that huge of a fan. the egg was too \"raw\" for me, but the bf loved it.  the bf also ordered the <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> bowl, which is rice with cod roe. i didn't try it, but he liked it and the eggs are a lil more fishy than masago. definitely coming back for more and be prepared to be a lil sweaty when you eat!", 
            "dropped by today after googling ramen in las vegas and eventually found this new ramen-ya on spring mountain (it is in the same plaza as raku).  read the raving positive reviews posted on google and also by rod m., and i decided that i will resume my thus far unsuccessful search for a decent or better ramen place in las vegas.\n\nafter driving in the still very warm heat to the restaurant, i saw about 6 asians standing or sitting outside the restaurant.  i was thinking, damn word sure got out fast for these vegas yelpers, but it turns out that they weren't waiting for this particular eatery.\n\nanyway, i went in and immediately saw that it is a very cozy and nicely decorated (i would describe it as very modern japanese minimalist) restaurant with seating for 18 at the tables, and another 10 at the bar.  there is a small board hanging on the wall, on the right as you enter the restaurant, listing a few specials items not on their very simple menu (see the photo that i have uploaded).\n\ni decided to order their tonkotsu \"pork bone\" ramen and add a side of nitamago (hard boiled egg seasoned with soyu).  the ramen was prepared in a very clean and small kitchen, which you can clearly see if you are seated at the bar.  the ramen was served in an average size bowl, not small but definitely not large and probably just right for most people.  the broth was piping hot, the noodle cooked just right, and garnished with a small mound of <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> and two thin slices of their melt in your mouth chashu. i first tried the broth, which has a good depth of pork flavor and not too salty or greasy or water down like at some of the other local ramen places that i have tried on the east side of town.  the noodle was the thin variety, which is not my preference, but it was cooked just right.  overall, it was a good bowl of ramen and definitely the best i have had in las vegas. but to jeff and my other ramen connoisseur friends, it is not as good as the really awesome and highly regarded ramen served at santouka ramen (torrance, california) or santa ramen (san mateo, ca), but still worth a try when you guys are in town.\n\ni also ordered a <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> bowl, which was served with a decent amount of rice.  mentaiko rice bowl is nothing special, and not difficult to prepared, but it was delicious because it was made with fresh and quality ingredients.\n\nthe staff were very friendly and the waitress, megumi, was very attentive.  it wasn't busy at the time of my visit (just one other customer who was already there before i arrived), but i can see that this place starts to get more crowded as word spread of their good quality soupy goodness for a reasonable price.\n\n<mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> $6.95\n+ nitamago           $1.50\n<mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> bowl  $2.95\n\nto the owner(s):  i recommend that you consider adding chicken karaage to the menu or as a special.", 
            "yes. if you sit at the bar, there is a shelf underneath where you can stow your purse, baby, or other personal belongings. yes. \n\nalso the counter is made out of this beautiful hunk of nice solid wood. what is that? walnut? it's nice. \n\nso anyways. this place is located next a korean bbq and raku. makes me wonder if it's the same owner as raku? \n\nthe ramen is okay. anyone that has had the standard of ramen (daikokuya in la, hello?) will tell you that monta isn't as good, but for vegas, it'll do. \n\nmonta only does three kinds of ramen: tonkatsu, shoyu, and miso (around $7-8). all are decent. the menu has short descriptions of each for us gaijin. there is also a short list of accouterment like egg, butter, corn, and spring onions available for nominal additional costs. i recommend the butter. it is exquisite. \n\nthe very limited menu has gyoza, <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> (around $3), kim chi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> (not very good). sometimes they have specials written on the white board on the wall. \n\non the front of the menu, there's a short history of ramen. the reading lists the source: ramenlicious.com\n\nthey have a few beers including asahi and something domestic, maybe bud. my friend got a $3 glass of asahi. it was like a double shot of beer.  \n\nthey do not make their own noodles, at least not on the day we came. \n\nthe unisex bathroom is practical and has a weird interior design nonsensicalness to it. meh. \n\nthe joint is pretty small. a bar that accommodates eight and maybe five four-tops. \n\nall of the staff is japanese. one of the cooks looks hardcore prison cook with the burns all up and down his forearm. heck yeah. \n\nthe restaurant is small and will possibly never have air conditioning. but there is a plethora of fans running and the back door remains open on the hottest of days. when some one opens the front door to leave or enter, the joint turns into a wind tunnel. \n\nthey're only open til 11p. i'm sure they could stay open later and do just fine with the late night belligerent crowd. \"whoo, i'm so wasted! i need lots of calories in my system. whoo!\"\n\nwatch tampopo. \n\n\n* off the strip, non-casino", 
            "the 5 star bump up is courtesy of my mom and grandma in law loving this place. my mom in law doesn't like asian foods, but grandma does since she grew up in indonesia. bf and i are food adventurous- them not so much. it's sometimes a struggle sometimes finding new places to please everyone so when they're happy with something, it makes me very happy. \n\nwe like to bring them out of their comfort zone and let them explore a bit. they shared a tonkatsu ramen and a <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>. they said it was the best soup and best pork they ever had. \n\nbf tried the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>- it is similar in profile that it is still the creamy brother like the tonkatsu but the added miso paste just add some sweetness. it's good but just whatever you're more into will determine the best soup: tonkatsu- savory/saltier, miso- sweeter and cuts the saltiness down a bit. they are very similar though. \n\ni went a different route and got the hiyashi chuka which is listed on a white board (not on the menu) as \"cold noodle salad\". the cold noodles come with julienned cucumbers, tomato, kikurage mushrooms, pork slices, half a egg. it has a ponzu sauce and has a smudge of karachi mustard on the side of the bowl to add as you wish (a little adds a perfect kick to everything). i also got a small chasu bowl too which is topped with some <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> and nori. \n\nthe service is friendly and attentive. i always appreciate places that have very nice servers. i have a habit of talking about the service and i think maybe i should start actually naming good servers so that maybe businesses can pay attention to who in their staff is doing things right. miki ( pulled these off receipts) just happened to be our server each time. :-)\n\nupdate 9/13\nbrought my mom in law and grandma for lunch. they didn't hesitate to say to eat here since they love the tonkatsu ramen and the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>. i got hiyashi chuka again since i love that dish and they do it well here. i also got a <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> bowl. not for everyone, but i like spicy roe and rice.\n\nupdate 10/26\nnothing better than soup on a crappy day. <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> this time. it's good. i think tonkatsu is my favorite, but i'll order this again. sometimes i feel a bit of variety. i always get a <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> though :-) it's noms.\n\nupdate 11/07 \ntried doing half shoyu and half tonkatsu broth. you can now order it as such. keep in mind this has the skinny noodles and not the curly ones incase you prefer one or the other. i think this is my favorite broth. tonkatsu is delicious- but it's rich. shoyu is good- but it's a bit lighter than i want. marry the two together and it's a really nice inbetween flavor and consistency. this is what i'll be ordering from now on. i will try to ask if i can do a shoyu miso as well since i think that would be a good, more delicate balance. \n\nupdate 11/16\ngot a <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>, but also tried their gyoza. it's pan fried, nothing too exciting about them, just what you'd expect a gyoza to be like. i was in the mood for them, but not something i'd get often i think.", 
            "finally got around to visiting the latest addition to ramen houses in vegas - monta noodle house.  conveniently located on spring mountain, right next to the super busy raku.  (smart business choice i would say.)\n\nthis place is bare bones - as in minimal tables and a bar, so don't come with a large group.  their super simple menu gets you in and out fast!  (a couple who came in around the same time we did had ordered, gotten their food, finished, paid and left by the time we were eating ours.)\n\ni went for their most popular dish - <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> ($6.95).  the main component is the broth, which is made up of boiling pork bones, fat, and collagen for hours.  this results in a cloudy white broth and would usually have the consistency of a thin gravy.  it automatically comes with two slices of char sui, takenoko (bamboo sprouts), kikurage (type of mushroom), and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>.  their char siu (barbecued pork) definitely isn't like the chinese kind, but definitely tasty.\n\nthe husband went for the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> ($7.25), which is ultimately bean paste blended with the pork broth giving it a richer flavor.  this was also good, and quite filling.\n\nwe also shared a regular order of the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> ($5.75).  it sits on a bed of rice, with fresh scallions and pickled red ginger.  i adore pork belly and the next time i come here, i'm going to order a dish of this all to myself.  it's fatty and good.  \n\na side dish we added on was the <mark>Takana Mustard Leaf</mark> ($1.50).  you can have this on the side or in your broth.  it's pickled mustard greens that may or may not be to your liking.  it's adds a different texture and taste to your ramen.  other toppings you can add on included nitamago (seasoned hard boiled egg), corn, butter, kimchee, and more char siu or <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>.\n\nthere's only one other kind of ramen they offer here - shoyu, which means soy sauce based.  you can also add extra noodles for $2 more if you save your soup and ask for \"kaedama.\"  other dishes available are gyoza, <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, kim chee <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, takana <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, cha siu bowl, and <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> (marinated polluck roe).\n\nservice was good.  with two waitresses, they keep the flow of business going great and refilled beverages as needed.  it's not the best place to loiter with the limited seating and all, but definitely a great place to grab a quick bite and go.\n\nupdate!  \ni returned the following month for my own bowl of the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>.  this time the pork belly was sliced thinner, which wasn't to my personal preference.  guess it depends on who is working the kitchen that day.", 
            "my first experience with authentic japanese ramen, and i was not disappointed. prior to monta, the only types of ramen i ate were in packages, cups and bowls, usually korean in descent and instant in nature. so i was surprised, in a good way, when i discovered that japanese ramen is nothing like the ramen i've eaten before. \n\nmy boyfriend was craving ramen for dinner, so i immediately suggested monta noodle house after remembering all the positive reviews on yelp. we entered the restaurant and, thankfully, they had a table for two available. the restaurant itself is small, reminiscent of an authentic ramen house in japan (at least in my mind). service was friendly and quick given the ratio of servers to customers. \n\nafter reading over the menu, he ordered the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> with extra char siu and a <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> while i ordered the tonkotsu/<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> and an order of gyoza. here is the breakdown of the food:\n\ngyoza- hot pan-fried pork and vegetable dumplings with just the right amount of crisp from the charred skin which contrasted well with the soft and juicy meat filling. overall, very good and savory. \n\n<mark>Miso Ramen</mark>- he enjoyed his ramen, saying that it tasted very authentic. i tried some of his ramen, and while i preferred the broth of his ramen, i liked the thinner noodles from my ramen more. \n\n<mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark>- he enjoyed this as well. i think it was the perfect light contrast to the heavy ramen. \n\ntonkotsu/<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>- delicious! the noodles were perfectly cooked, and the vegetables added texture and mildness to the rich broth. my only complaints are that the broth was just a tad too salty for my taste and the char siu lacked the meatiness i wanted. \n\noverall, we enjoyed dinner that night. i enjoyed my experience there so much that two days after my initiation into the japanese ramen world i went again with my mom.", 
            "monta neighbors nakamura-ya, & raku. with an authentic sushi place to join the strip mall, this is the spot to get some kick-butt japanese food. monta is a ramen-specialty restaurant that is not to be skipped!\n\nramen: their menu is small but mighty. what kind of ramen you like? miso, shoyu, or tonkatsu? they come with thin slices of char-siu pork. ichiza actually has my favorite char-siu.... but monta's is a solid second. overall, the ramen here is far superior anyway. there's also a variety of toppings you can add for an additional cost. generally, i order the same thing every time: <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> w/ egg & nori. yum! i've sampled every type of soup but miso is my favorite. the broth is rich & flavorful and i can't find it as good anywhere else.\n\nappetizers: if fish eggs are your thing, monta has the freshest mentaiko in las vegas. order a <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> bowl (rice, mentaiko, scallion)--throw some soy sauce & togarashi on it as a delicious starter. gyoza here are good too but nothing to get excited over.\n\nother: there's a board on the wall that has the other entree items. on different occasions i've seen some type of cold noodles, rice bowls, and <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. my memory fails to remember the rest but so far none of them interested me enough to try. a client of mine recommended to try the cold noodles.... maybe next time.\n\ncome for the ramen, stay for the ramen, come back for the ramen--good eats.", 
            "we had two calpico drinks,a <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark>, an order of gyoza and two <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with <mark>Chashu Pork</mark> and nitamago.  delicious!!! one of our favorite spots in vegas.", 
            "google maps will lead you past this tiny restaurant if you're heading west on spring mountain road. the icon will show that you need to pass hauck street. don't make that mistake, monta ramen is actually in the plaza before that street. google map takes you to this empty plaza with nothing but a sleazy looking massage parlor. hmmm....? \n\nthis small hole in the wall restaurant interior reminds me of daikokuya jtown la but even smaller! they had an l shaped bar which probably sits 10-12 people max. there were about 5-6 regular tables, some made for two people & some made for four. what happens in a place like this? a number of overflowing people waiting out the door. i recommend you coming early or during non-peaked hours. we got lucky because there was only one party ahead of us when we got in but that quickly changed. by the time we got out, there were at least 10 parties on that waiting list.\n\nfirst thing i noticed was the array of condiments in front of us. shredded pink ginger, purified garlic, white pepper, japanese chili powder, spicy a$$ hot chili oil, vinegar, soy sauce just to name a few. love restaurants that aren't all hipster tight up the butt about their condiments.\n\nhad the tonkotsu-<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>, a mixed blend of pork bone and soy sauce type soup based. the first one i've ever had actually since i'm typically accustomed to just tonkotsu base. it was a little less rich and thick then the tonkotsu base but still had that cloudy and strong taste. i added an egg and kimchi for a little more. for you carb lovers, you can add extra noodles for a minimal fee. i was quite satisfied with my ramen. my expectations were met even though they weren't that high since we were in vegas and we know la is crawling with bomb ramen houses. the <mark>Chashu Pork</mark> was quite fatty and the slices were on a smaller scale. the bowl of ramen itself was enough to make you full but not overly stuffed.\n\nalso ordered the <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> bowl - cod fish row, seaweed, <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, over rice. nothing significant to report. the fried gyozas (pork and vegetable filling) were decent.\n\nthe ramen is nothing to die for but it really wasn't too bad. if you have a mad craving for ramen or just want to get something other than pho on spring mountain road aka chinatown, then monta ramen is there for you. just be ready for a wait time. the ramen met my simple standards and the price was very affordable. the hard working staff are efficient and all \"peace sign\" fobby smiles.", 
            "seriously, im getting addicted to this place. noodles are perfect, broth is always creamy and perfectly seasoned, sides are delicious. service is quick and friendly. what more can i ask!!??\n\nso far my favorite is <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> with nitamago and nori. last time, i ordered the  <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> (with spicy cod row) and was blown away by how great everything tasted. \n\none of the best meals under $10 in a city of great restaurants.", 
            "i still think monta is tasty, but it's just not as tasty as i used to think it was.\n\nwhile monta isn't my first choice anymore, i don't have any qualms on eating here. my best friend tida c. is still a die-hard monta lover so i'm sure they'll still be in my regular rotation of restaurants.\n\nthe miso broth isn't as rich and a little more salty than i remembered. and the flavors are more subtle than comparable broths i've had at other ramen places. between shoyu, tonkatsu, and miso, i consider miso to be the tastiest of all of them.\n\na couple of the reasons i still think monta is awesome is their togarashi (the red chili/pepper flakes on the table). i don't know how they make it or where they get it from, but no other togarashi is equal to that of monta's. the blend of chili and other seasonings make it incredibly addicting and it has more spice (heat level) than others i've tried.\n\nand of course, they still hold true to carrying the freshest mentaiko in town. that <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> bowl is still my favorite app / side dish to a hot bowl of noodles.", 
            "short: everyone in vegas, local or traveler, should go here. best ramen i've ever had (and i've had a lot).\n\nlong: i'm a very critical person who isn't impressed very easily. most of my reviews on yelp have 3, and the rare 4 stars. this is worth 5 stars. \ni went here with a friend, were a couple minutes late and had to wait. it's not in the best place in the shopping center, but doesn't matter much. get here when they open if you don't want to wait.\nwe ordered their specialty tankatsu ramen, and was served within 10 minutes (very quick). noodles were packaged, but very good. the roasted pork on top was thin, but tender and flavorful. the rest of the toppings; mushrooms and bamboo shoots and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> helped the ramen nicely. what makes it all go together was the soup stock. amazing. \non top of that, for $7 the price is totally right. not too cheap, not too expensive. and worth every penny.\n\nlike other reviews compare, the only contender to monta ramen is sora ramen. i suggest monta first, definitely. i believe it's on an entire different level than sora. but, sora's extra cost does get you more: thicker meat, more soup, a tad bit better topping, but the noodles and soup stock isn't as good.\n\nsecond visit: still amazing. had the <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> bowl. it was good, and a nice side.\nthird visit: still amazing.\nfourth, fifth, sixth... seventh... i forgot how many times i've been here, but it still blows me away. i had the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> and that was very good as well.", 
            "went here with my dad and cousin. we waited 30 minutes outside. i thought to myself, \"heck yeah, this wait is going to be worth it because i've heard a lot of good things about this place!\" tried the food. wasn't impressed. i ordered a <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> and a <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> bowl. i expected the mentaiko bowl to be delicious, and it was--but trust me, after a few bites that sodium content will turn you off. a few minutes later, the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> came. too salty for my tastes. \nmy cousin ordered a <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> and i tried it. i wish i ordered the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> instead because it wasn't as salty, but still pretty salty. my dad ordered a <mark>Miso Ramen</mark>. again, it was salty.\n you get the gist.\n\naside from the salty dishes, we ordered gyoza and <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was pretty standard and the gyoza was just a bit better from the frozen ones you can get at the store. neato.\nmaybe i'll come back when i'm low on sodium intake. \n\nthe only good thing was the service. i wouldn't recommend this for big groups because the place is pretty small and it's usually packed whenever i'm around the area.", 
            "visited this small restaurant based on popular review. indeed, this restaurant is so popular that you will have to wait in the line. another reason why you'll have to wait is that the dining room can probably fit about 30 dining guests at each time, half of the guests will need to be on the bar table. me and my wife are lucky to get a table after about 45 minutes of wait with about 6 parties waiting in front of us for dinner (by the way, you will need to check yourself in as there are only 2 very busy waitresses). the menu was very simple - noodle, <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> or some small variety of specialty. there are flyers if 2 today's special pasted on the wall, which we ordered - spicy <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>. we also ordered a <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> bowl (basically some fish eggs with sesame over small bowl of rice). i would not say it is super delicious, but it is really worth the price. the ramen was very flavorful (can be a little salty). you also have the option to add another noodle if you still feel hungry after you finish the bowl - i think most people will do since there was actually not much noodle in it. for us, the bowl of rice does the job. the rice is nothing special and almost had no flavor. i just seasoned the rice with the broth of the ramen i had. overall, not bad, and it is definitely worth the price. but if you don't have much time in vegas, you can safely skip this place as it is not worth that much of wait, unless you really want to save money in your trip.", 
            "first off, i'm a huge ramen eater.\n\ni came on a saturday with two other people for dinner at around 6pm.  we had to wait about 20 minutes to get seated.  once seated, i went for their miso based ramen with added garlic oil, chili, egg, and corn.  it was delicious!  my only complaint was it was very salty.  not overwhelmingly salty, but salty.  the ramen was the perfect texture.  the meat was good and everything went together really well.  my sister went for their <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>, which is soy sauce based.  i had a sip of the broth and it was pretty good.  if you want a healthier choice, the shoyu would be the one to go with.  we also ordered one <mark>Mini Mentaiko</mark> bowl but didn't even touch it because we were so full.  but later tried it and the eggs were way too salty.  \n\nfor 3 bowls of ramen and the mentaiko, our total was about $24 without tip.  it was very reasonable.  the service was very fast.  our food came out super fast.  the inside of this place is teeny tiny.  there's about 5 small tables and the bar that's it.  prepare to wait on the weekends.\n\nps... if you have a crying baby/child, this is not the place to bring him or her."

            "i'm so glad my gf found this place on yelp for our final lunch at vegas!\n\nwe ordered:\n- tonkatsu ramen: absolutely wonderful smooth & milky pork-based broth. my favorite ramen is at shin sen gumi, and this bowl of ramen was very comparable, if not better. i also added toppings of a hard boiled egg and extra slices of pork - they gave 6 extra slices in addition to the two slices of pork that came with the bowl by default. i decided to avoid the kimchi because i didn't want the korean toppings to dominate the japanese broth. noodles were cooked perfect, and you can order extra noodles for $1.50.\n- <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>: this is the darker one, i believe it's miso/soy based. my gf had this, and i tried the broth and it seemed equally as delicious.\n- gyoza: it's like lightly grilled potstickers\n- <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>: typical <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> as expected - not something to die for, but good.\n- kimchi <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>: pretty much exactly like the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, except that it had a bit of the tangy flavor that the kimchi added\n- pork bellow bowl: this was my favorite out of the <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> bowls. lightly cooked, tender, moist and juicy pork belly strips layered on top of <mark>White Rice</mark>. definitely worth getting along with the ramen.\n\nservice was fantastic. our group of 5 was sixth on the waitlist, but it moved pretty fast; we waited maybe about 20 or so minutes.\n\ncliff notes: tonkatsu ramen with hardboiled egg and extra pork. <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>.",

            "did you ever think there would be such a restaurant here in an \"all-nighter city\" that cooks and serves ramen noodles? yes, there is tucked in-between small shops along spring mountain road or otherwise known as \"chinatown\" in vegas.\n\nas you may or may not know it', \"ramen\" noodles is one of japanese noodles invented in 1958 by japan's nissin foods. these are thin, ribbon-like, lightweight, calorie-rich, tasty, and cheap that can be bought in packs of 1 or 10 (you can find them in your asian or oriental grocery near you or in any of your college friend's pantry). it's one of those quick cook-it-up soups.\n\nit's rather an eccentric choice of mine to dine in this place with my mom last night around 6 p.m. on a very rainy night in vegas. soup is the answer to the cold, wet rain! ramen is kind-of over-the-top in this restaurant!\n\nwith a sweet, smiling greeting from the waitress, \"moshi, moshi!\" in japanese, which translates to \"hello\" or rather \"welcome!\" (i have learned a few japanese greetings in high school and  having been to tokyo before, the greeting didn't sound \"foreign\"). it brought a smile to my lips, i knew i would have a good dining experience. \n\nthe restaurant is small and cozy but cheerful with minimalist japanese style decor including the bathroom's interior design was contemporary japanese. there are table seatings and bar-like seating available. menu is simple. three choices of ramen noodle soups in \"<mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark>\" (pork bone), \"<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark>\" (soy paste), and \"<mark>Miso Ramen</mark>\" (bean paste). nothing else to confuse any soup-hungry soup-lover. a list of toppings for the noodles soup for an extra charge, 8 \"other dishes\", 4 kinds of cold beverages, 2 kinds of beer choices, but no dessert and no hot beverages on the menu.\n\ni ordered the house specialty soup which is the \"tonkatsu ramen\" soup. it's very hearty soup in a thick, cloudy milk-like tasty broth. topped with <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>, 3 slices of pork, bamboo shoots, and with kikurage (dried black mushrooms), i drizzled it with sesame seeds and hot spice powder. oh, wow, there was no need for chewing the roast pork that melted in my mouth. surely, the pork melts! another dish i ordered was the \"mimi mentaiko\" which consists of fish cod roe (or fish eggs which are red-orange in color is otherwise, caviar) with strips of nori seaweed and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark> topped on a bowl of steamed japanese rice. very appetizing, a sure favorite! the \"<mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>\" is also one dish you ought to try; delicious. as usual <mark>Green Tea</mark> on ice was my beverage pairing for these meals.\n\nfunny thing...the cheerful smiling waitress who served us went to show her colleagues in the kitchen my soup bowl which made her shyly squeal in delight to show them all it was empty!! i caught a glimpse of the cook's smile.\n\nyes, i left nothing in the bowl, not even a drop of soup!\nit must have been that i really love soup, or it was cold and wet outside or just that i needed to fill my belly...how can you go wrong in making such a choice to eat for the night. for a price that's easy on your pocket, aahemm! wallet...an excellent deal! \"arigato gozaimas!\" (english translation is \"thank you!\"), as we left the restaurant in good spirit!",

            "you can tell food is good when people are willing to stand in line (which is often out the door) to wait through our blistering summers and biting winters.  luckily, service and cook time are quick, so i have never had to wait more than fifteen minutes or so for a table or spot even when it's crowded.  \n\nmonta is a small, hole in the wall ramen place.  there are three kinds of seating: booth, table and bar stools.  if you're eating solo or you have a small party, you'll probably get seated more quickly because the individual bar stools will open up.  additionally, so they can keep the flow going and keep wait times down, you'll have to sign in on a sheet, and they won't seat you until your entire party is present.  from the bar, you can see the crew in the kitchen cooking the meals.\n\non to the food.  i normally order the tonkot-shoyu (mixed broth of the tonkotsu and shoyu) with corn and nori (dried seaweed), and add in some chili oil and spices from the table set.  the soup itself comes with <mark>Chashu Pork</mark>, bamboo shoots, kikarage (black mushrooms) and <mark>Shredded Green Onion</mark>.  i've tried ramen at two other locations (one in the galleria mall in henderson, and the other was anime ramen) and this is definitely my favorite spot to go.  the noodles have just the right amount of chewiness, the broth is flavorful but not overpowering, and the chashu is tender, melt in your mouth goodness.  \n\ni have also tried the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> and gyoza, and both are pretty good.  i wish they had a different sauce for the gyoza, but soy sauce mixed with vinegar and a little chili oil works just fine.  i've only discovered this place in the last year, but i can honestly say it's become one of my go-to restaurants and it's definitely a comfort food.  prices are more expensive than your fifty cent package of top ramen, but it's still cheap for a restaurant at under ten dollars an entree.  \n\nmy only bone to pick is that their <mark>Green Tea</mark> is only chilled and it comes in a can, though as far as canned <mark>Green Tea</mark> goes, it's not bad.", 
            "as an avid lover of all asian styles of food i was excited to finally try monta ramen since i had heard good things. at first glance it looked like this little noodle shop was going to have a very long wait. however, we did not have to wait too long even with people waiting outside. there are not many seats, but this is not really the place to linger for long. most people seem to leave fairly quickly once they are done. my friend and i sat at the counter and had fun watching the bustling kitchen while we waited for our ramen. the seating may feel cramped for some people, but i really liked the busy, controlled chaos feel of it. \n\non to the good stuff. i ordered the tonkotsu-<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with the regular house fixings and my friend had the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with thin noodles. i was instantly impressed with my choice as soon as i tried it. the broth was slightly creamy and full of flavor, the thin noodles cooked to the perfect point so they were not mushy at all. i found the soup very flavorful, but i had to add a liberal amount of chili oil since i like my ramen spicy. the <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> was also very tasty, the clear beef broth had just as deep a flavor as my selection. we both had a can of <mark>Green Tea</mark> to drink, which was a refreshing counter to my spicy soup. my only gripe was the fact that i was not completely full when i left, which is mostly my own fault. they offer the option of extra noodles, which i will surely do next time. the gyoza and <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> are also on the list to try in the future. \n\nanother great aspect is the price. the total bill for two bowls of ramen and two drinks was $18 and change. a great deal for any sit down place. bottom line is that this place is a great option for a fun, cheap meal. i will definitely be going back.", 
            "this tiny little ramen place was everything it was cracked up to be.  my parents live locally and they'd heard from several sources about how great this place was, so when we were visiting, we took them out to monta.\n\nwe managed to get there at the perfect time because only 1 table was occupied, so getting my dad in was quick and easy (he is in a wheelchair).  they don't have hot drinks, so enjoy some ucc oolong or <mark>Green Tea</mark> or a can of calpico (i wish they had ucc iced coffee!!)  we placed our order and watched as the crowd built up very quickly.  food arrived fast and piping hot.\n\nthe gyoza was fine - crunchy on one side, steamed on the other, hot all the way through.  my mom and hubs got the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> and my dad and i got the <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> (i got mine with corn)\n\nthe charsiu/chashu/chasyu (how ever you want to spell it) was so amazing - i do not use this phrase lightly.  it was literally melt-in-your-mouth delicious.  the pork fat was flavorful and rich and just melted away when it hit your tongue.  so amazing!  i am sad that i didn't stop and order a side of it immediately.\n\nthe ramen noodles had a great chewy texture and the miso broth was delicious.  my mom was very pleased with the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark>, as well.\n\nthe only thing that didn't live up to everything else was the mentaiko bowl.  i got it because i love hot rice and tarako (and my mom had made some for me the night before and i was still jonesing for it).  unfortunately, the rice was not very hot and a little on the dry side, so the bowl was disappointing.  i ladeled some of the miso broth into the bowl and that made the rice more palatable, but it messed with the flavor of the mentaiko.\n\nall in all, it was a great experience and i can't wait to go to vegas again so i can go to monta again! \n\n**accessibility note - the parking lot is not very wheelchair friendly and monta itself can be a little tight to try to get a wheelchair in and out.  the only wheelchair ramp up from the parking lot is blocked by the car when you park in the handicapped space, so once you get the person into their chair, you have to move the car to get them up to the sidewalk level where the restaurants are.", 
            "i'm pretty sure the first thing you hear when you walk in are the waitresses yelling the order in japanese and the chefs in the back confirming and the slurping of noodles from patrons which is a strong first impression. (* + 1) i'm no ramen expert but i believe the best places have distinctive flavors for their broths. at monta, you can definitely tell the miso from the tonkatsu, and the shoyu from the tonkatsu-shoyu which earns a star. ( * + 1) \n\nlocation+atmosphere: it's tucked away in a shady strip mall which i always seem to pass, but a good landmark is the bar at the beginning of the mall called kilroy's (named after the famous kilroy graffiti). i love the atmosphere which is an open kitchen where you see the chefs work. the bar seating has nice spinning bar stools and it's easy to get comfy/friendly with the strangers next to you. (* + 1)\n\nservice: at the door they don't really care who you are or what you do (whether you have a party of one or a party of 10, no special treatment; no forgiveness for leaving/having incomplete party). once seated, the service is quick and they get your stuff out as soon as possible to get another butt in your chair. with a small party (2-3) the wait shouldn't be too long. with a large (+4) party, at munch-time you're out of luck. service does not earn a star.\n\nfood: ramen (why would you get anything else here?). four different broths to choose from with their own noodle style. tonkatsu <mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> comes with wavy noodles and the miso came with thin noodles. extra noodles are $1.25. i don't get add-ons because there's no need, the amounts which are portioned should be rich enough to keep you from wanting for a couple hours. which leads me to portion size. first time it came, i thought i could eat 3 bowls, but after the first tasty, rich bowl you find yourself satisfied. what you're looking for is the flavor of the broth and i think this place has one of the tastiest broths. i like to add the spicy powder, hot oil, and sesame seeds so maybe that's why it gets salty near the bottom, but it makes my noodles tastier. (* + 1) got the gyoza, tasted the gyoza, enjoyed the gyoza, did not write home about the gyoza.\n\nstrangest thing: i do not understand why they don't serve hot tea. too much work to serve and too little space for the cups? they do have canned oolong and <mark>Green Tea</mark> though.", 
            "according to yelp, monta appears to be the most popular ramen joint in vegas. if this place were relocated to little tokyo in dtla, sawtelle blvd. or gardena/torrance, i doubt it would even make the mid-tier.\n\nhits:\n* mildly impressed by the <mark>Tonkotsu Ramen</mark> -- the broth was greasy and creamy, but not completely full-bodied... definitely not worth the half hour wait and hype\n* ramen is cheap (~$7), since the portion sizes are small -- if you're still craving more noodles, add another serving for $1.50\n* order the overpriced hot <mark>Green Tea</mark> ($3) and you'll be amazed that the aluminum can is still hot... apparently the japanese vending machine keeps the can warm\n* the servers are good about splitting the check, and you can pay with card\n\nlessons learned:\n* why are all ramen restaurants so tiny?? this place can seat 20 at a time, and does not easily accommodate to parties larger than 4 (my party of 6 barely fit at the bar counter)\n* prepare to wait -- we waited half an hour coming here at 5p on a monday night\n* while the waitress was nice, she seemed really distracted -- in between taking my friend's order, she rushed into the kitchen and then came back 5 minutes later to resume taking down his order... weird\n* the ajitama ($1 for half an egg -.-) is not included and was slightly overcooked.. lame!\n* i think there was one japanese chef in the show kitchen -- the rest were latino/a ... reminded me of tatsu ramen\n\ni think i'll stick to pho when i'm in vegas from now on.", 
            "monta, according to one of my friends who lived in japan, is as close to authentic japanese ramen as you can get in las vegas. i'll take his word for it.\n\nthe small ramen joint does not fit many and there is often a wait. your entire group has to be there in order to be seated as well. there is a $10 minimum for card.\n\nthe waitresses are obviously experienced and seemlessly work together and with the chefs to efficiently serve customers. they are friendly, but not overly so. food comes quickly as well because their menu is pretty small.\n\nmy usual order is a <mark>Miso Ramen</mark> with corn. the main reason i get corn is because the broth is a little too salty. many people complain about this but i never really felt the extent of monta's salty broth until the past year or so. it just seems thicker and more unhealthy than it used to be. i'm not sure if their recipes changed or if my tastes changed.\n\nyou get nori, chashu, and bamboo. condiments you can add include garlic puree, pickled ginger, sesame oil, soy sauce, sesame seeds, and chili powder. one thing that used to bother me when i first started coming here was that they only have <mark>Green Tea</mark> iced and in a can. \n\nthey also have a few other dishes besides the various ramen, including rice bowls, friend rice, cold noodles, and gyoza. for recent additions to the menu, they have the option to make your noodles spicy (+$1) or the kuro ramen, which is black garlic ramen. it's actually pretty tasty in my opinion, but i am an avid eater of garlic.\n\nregardless of the heavy mouthfeel of the ramen, the consistent service and food keeps regulars like me coming back.", 
            "monta ramen is my second favorite ramen place. pros: good ramen, lines are not too long, broth is not too fatty. cons: they do not have freshly brewed <mark>Green Tea</mark>, only canned (yuck), they do not have fresh garlic as a topping option, which would add a lot of flavor.overall a good place, but not nearly as good as santouka ramen in costa mesa, ca.", 
            "warning: this is not the place to go for a long meal, date, or to socialize. it is small, loud, and every part of the experience is very fast-paced. however, if you're looking for a quick and easy dining experience with incredible food, this is a must go!\n\nservice: extremely fast and efficient staff.\n\ndrink: although it tasted normal, i was put off by their hot <mark>Green Tea</mark> coming in a can. like what even?\n\nappetizer: the <mark>Pork Belly Bowl</mark> was delicious! not too salty which i really appreciated. try not to fill up on appetizers though, their ramen bowls are massive!\n\nramen: i ordered the tonkotsu-<mark>Shoyu Ramen</mark> with egg, nori, and corn, and it was amazing! this is only the second time i have ever had ramen and my expectations were blown away. simply delicious.", 
            "came here for lunch and it was super packed! i wasn't aware there was a sign in sheet so i was kinda just standing there until someone came behind me and signed in. thankfully he said i could go before him anyways! wait was only about 5 minutes, but since there were no seats available i had to wait outside in the heat. definitely not a place where you have an intimate meal, but i spent 45 minutes there without feeling they were rushing me out the door.\n\nthe food was pretty good. i got the tonkotsu shoyu, <mark><mark>Kimchi <mark>Takana Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, and <mark>Green Tea</mark>. the ramen soup and noodles were very good, although i didn't like the meat. it says it's pork but it tasted like turkey and a mix of something else so i didn't eat it. the rice was good too with soy sauce but was a bit too eggy for my liking. \n\nservice was good! was asked twice if i needed refills, check came quickly, and just about everyone said thank you as i left! i would definitely come back just not get the pork or whatever that meat was."

            "i read about this restaurant on yelp and was very excited to find a good ramen place. \n\nas all the other yelpers mentioned, it is very warm in the restaurant so be prepared! the whole restaurant only fits about 26 people but we were lucky we were the only customers.\n\ni went with my boyfriend and i ordered the tonkatsu ramen w/ egg and he had the miso w/ corn, egg & extra chashu. even in the heat i definitely enjoyed the ramen. the broth was very savory and delicious. the chashu was very soft and also very flavorful. i would definitely order the extra chashu next time we go there. i've never had corn in my ramen before (except for the american cuponoodles) but it added a nice crunch to the dish and sweetness.\n\nthe service was good but just be careful with your bill there. this was the first time we went there and they rang up 3 <mark>Coke</mark> instead of 2. after the transaction was completed she had corrected it by giving us cash back for the misrung item. after leaving the restaurant and being a day later, we came to realized the server charged his debit card twice for the meal as well. so not only did they rang up extra items on our tab but they charged the transaction twice.\n\nkeep in mind that we were the only people in the restaurant as well so it wasn't like it was very busy. \n\noverall i was happy with the meal, just will keep in mind to pay cash and triple check the tab from now on.",
