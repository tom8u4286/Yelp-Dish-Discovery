            "so good. had the tacos which were out of this world. also had the <mark>Spicy Black Bean Dip</mark>-- which was majorly spicy. i thought the spot was perfect for a quick casual work lunch. my coworker really enjoyed it and felt like we got a nice break from the convention and vegas craziness.\n\nthe service was also very good. they were very attentive and hannnndsome!", 
            "had an awesome meal here!  the salsas were great and the guac and <mark>Spicy Black Bean Dip</mark> are delish!  must haves!  that and a couple blood orange margaritas and i didn't really need anything else. but of course tried the <mark>Carne Asada Quesadilla</mark>. everything was so good and sunday was our server. would for sure go back again!!  great night with gal pals!", 
            "my bf loves mexican food and we came here before the one show.\n\nit was a saturday night around 7 and we got a table right away.  once we were seated, the water came to our table as did the chips.  idk what it is about their tortilla chips, but they are delicious!\n\nwe ordered the <mark>Spicy Black Bean Dip</mark>..they were good but def not spicy at all!\nfor entrees, we got the <mark>Carne Asada Quesadilla</mark> and the <mark>Wagyu Beef Tacos</mark>.  both dishes were scrumptious.\n\nprices were pretty high for mexican food, especially coming from sd =p\nbut it was worth it!\n\npretty dark in the main dining area, but the light shining off the wall was bright..which made me squint.  but really, the meal made it 5 stars. i don't care for the ambiance.  service was also good and tentative, in the perfect amount.", 
            "what a great find at mandalay.\nwe went to border grill for lunch on a whim.  it is located near the convention center so a bit of a walk from the casino.\nborder grill overlooks the grand mandalay pool, specifically the river part.  however, it is not too noisy and you can still have a good meal conversation.\nthe food choices are all mexican.  we ordered the <mark>Spicy Black Bean Dip</mark> (delicious) and had a few plates of chips.  yum!  \nas for drinks, the margaritas were solid and they have a good selection of mexican beers (my fave being modelo especial).\nservice was very good.\ni would definitely come back if in vegas.", 
            "brandon was a perfect server, he was quick and attentive. the food is wonderful! cheese dip portion was huge and <mark>Spicy Black Bean Dip</mark> was same size. plenty of food - large portions. great drinks. there is a two top table that has a outlet to charge your phone. it's right around the corner on the wall. i love to be able to charge my phone while dining! superb service!!", 
            "so good here are the tacos i've tried. pork belly yum. carnitas yum, yuca tan pork tacos yum, chicken tacos eh. <mark>Spicy Black Bean Dip</mark> yum. don't forget to leave room for the tres leche cake. omg",

            "this was my best dining experience in vegas.  the staff and servers (mike and jose!) were awesome.  as soon as we said we were vegetarians they gave us recommendations some of which were not even on the menu.  we got a veggie platter with <mark>Plantain Empanadas</mark>, sweet <mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark> , potato tacos, poblano quesadillas, and the <mark>Spicy Black Bean Dip</mark>.  i can't even tell you how freaking good the quesadillas and tacos were.  the sweet <mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark> were so flavorful.  i usually dislike fancy mexican but this was by far the best fancy mex i've ever had.  the service was so wonderful and the salsa trio that they give you was incredible fresh and zesty.   thank god it was too much food that i had leftovers.  i'll be stuffing my face tomorrow morning ."

            "i have been there four times, and i love it.  it's authentic, regional cooking with a creative twist.  i always get a shredded chicken and tortilla casserole that is amazing.  \n\nthe prices a somewhat higher than other non-hotel related restaurants.  guess what, you are in a hotel.  hotel restaurants will always cost more money due to the higher overhead.  \n\nthe staff were attentive.  last time, we had a very unattentive server.  this time, we were blessed with an exceptional server.  we appreciated <mark>The Ultimate Border Grill Experience</mark> and the food.", 
            "my recent visit to border grill was not as positive as my previous visits. my first review was based on a few trips to the establishment, which were great experiences. since then, they have remodeled and things within have changed. in my first review i mentioned that the service could use a little improvement. the service in my opinion has taken a step forward. the food didn't taste the same.\n\nthis establishment has changed. what i used to, widely regard as the best mexican food i've ever had, no longer is. the service takes a step forward while the food takes a step back. the <mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark>, still tender but was a little saltier than i remember, smaller portion of steak too. i had the citrus chicken burrito, which my waiter recommended as the best item on the menu. it wasn't the best item!!! the fish tacos are still the best item they have to offer. which i had a little bit of. the beer battered chicken strips, was terrible for the kids menu.\n\ni'm very upset with my latest experience at the border grill. i can't say i would go back, next time i'm in vegas. <mark>The Ultimate Border Grill Experience</mark> was very unsatisfying. adding brunch menu probably not the best idea.",

(2).\n\ni'm torn about what to say about this place.\n\nwent to dinner with my hubby last night and came armed with a restaurant.com coupon. they do have a vip club for locals but the restaurant.com coupon offers a better discount than 15% off the check.\n\njust to say, the service is amazing! shout-out to dale our waiter who was a whirlwind but still took the time to ensure that we were well looked after. he introduced the menu to us and ensured that we got the most of our experience. our water glasses were full and our food was served in a timely manner. while our food was okay, i saw him deal with an unhappy customer who didn't like her dish. he took the food back right away without question and apologized because he recommended it. kudos to dale!\n\nokay, on to the food.\n\nmy husband ordered <mark>The Ultimate Border Grill Experience</mark> which was $42 for 3 courses which included an appetizer sampler, a steak dish with quesadilla, and tres leches cake. i, being less hungry, just ordered an <mark>Chicken Poblano Enchiladas</mark> for $26.\n\nthe chips were perhaps a little overcooked for our tastes. the salsas in general lacked salt and acidity (i like the flavour of lime to come through). of the four we received the chipotle and the diablo salsas were the only two that seemed to be seasoned properly.\n\nthe appetizer plate came with a plantain empanada, a taquito, and a corn tamale. the plantain empanada had great flavour but poor texture from sitting underneath a sauce for a little too long - it really killed the crispiness of a empanada. the taquitos were nice but were a little on the bland side. the corn tamale had the taste and texture of creamed corn. it was one big, hot, gummy mess - a big miss for me.\n\nthe steak entree was good - the marinated tomatoes, cucumber and avocado had a nice acidity that cut through the richness of the beef. the steak itself was a rather large portion which we took part of it home. the accompanying quesadilla however was a little too strong on the cheese flavour for me but had a nice crispness to it.\n\nmy enchiladas were good but yet again a little blander than what i was expecting. overall, they could have used some more of the filling as well. the combination of chicken, corn, and peppers was ok - not outsanding.\n\nthe tres leches cake had the correct flavours but had difficulties with texture. the sponge was right but wasn't luxuriously drenched in a lovely milk all the way through. so the result was the bottom layers were nice but the top layers were a little on the dry side.\n\noverall, there are a lot of issues at border grill with regards to execution. normally, i would have given this place a two however in light of our excellent service, i bumped it up to a three.", 
            "when i'm in vegas border grill (inside the mandalay bay) is one of my favorite places to eat, which is why i am so surprised by it's rating.  the food, service and atmosphere are all fantastic. in my opinion, whoever gave this place less than four stars doesn't know what great mexican food tastes like and should stick to chain restaurants like el toritos.  \n  the staff at bg is amazing. everyone is friendly and welcoming from the moment you check in. we love to sit in jamie's section because she is friendly, very attentive and full of energy. she is also very knowledgeable about the menu and how the items are prepared. she goes above and beyond to make sure we are happy. we never feel rushed or pushed to leave so that they can turn the table. that's rare at most restaurants in vegas.\n  when you first arrive at your table you are welcomed with a basket of fresh  homemade tortilla chip and a trio of homemade salsas. its a great way to start your evening. i love to order the guacamole as well. its chunky, thick and simply delicious.\n  as far as drinks are concerned, i have tried many of them and have yet to be unhappy with a single one. the selection of mixed drinks are fabulous. i am, however, a big fan of the red sangria. its just the right mix of wine and juice and it goes well with the chips and guacamole.\n  if you are in the mood to try a border grill culinary feast then i highly recommend you order <mark>The Ultimate Border Grill Experience</mark>. you get a trio of appetizers, an entree of your choice, and then a dessert of your choice. you really cant go wrong with this deal!\n  my absolute favorite dish on the menu is the bbq beef short ribs. they are wickedly delicious and mouth watering good.  the ribs are so tender that they fall apart and melt in your mouth.  the bbq sauce has just enough kick to it, but isn't overpowering. the ribs are served atop a creamy corn polenta that is to die for.  i sometimes crave the dish... which, i must say, is worth driving to vegas for.\n  dessert is my thing and honestly you can't go wrong with any of the desserts on the menu. i have tried many of them and i haven't been disappointed yet.\n  border grill is definitely worth going to while in vegas!!", 
            "i know border grill from santa monica, so i knew the food would be good. i was surprised how it seemed even better in vegas. we got the ceasar salad, the <mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark> and the grilled fish tacos and every bite was amazing. we had a waiter, jimmy, who treated us like we were fine dining and took care of us with such care even though i know he was busy. this <mark>The Ultimate Border Grill Experience</mark> had that out for dinner, special vibe because of the food, service and decor. impressive! \ni don't think it's a 2 money sign place though. it's more expensive than that. i did bring a www.restaurant.com coupon for $25 off which makes it more fun.", 
            "my wife and i had a wonderful dinner experience\n\nfood was great, very authentic mexican. we shared a starter of beef questadia. for main i had the sow roast porc which was a little on the dry side i must admit however the plate was beautiful, the meat was still very tasty and all the side dishes, salsa, avocado, sauces etc were very good.\nmy wife had the fish tacos which were very good as well\n\ncouple of beers later and we were at $90 however everything was very delicious, its a famous place by a top chef master participant so all in all i guess we really enjoyed the food, the service <mark>The Ultimate Border Grill Experience</mark> and the authentic feel of mexico\n\nwe recommend!", 
            "had lunch here on thursday 4/14 at around 3:00pm. while most of the reviews i've since read complain about the quality of the food matched with the high prices for mexican food, i actually found this to be a respite from what we had become accustomed to during our stay. for once, i thought the two nearly equaled each other, although again, we've had much better.\n\nhad the fish tacos which were fine. the fish was grilled nicely, no bones, fresh cole-slaw on top. nothing to really complain about. gf had some kind of pork sandwich which looked messy. she didn't seem too impressed as she didn't finish it and avoided the bread entirely. good drinks to start (nice to see 'chelada' on the menu) accompanied by warm, fresh chips and three types of salsa. should have just stuck with that combo.\n\nwhat really distracted me from <mark>The Ultimate Border Grill Experience</mark> once again was the service! this time it was the hostess. we were greeted and when i asked if we could sit outside she said she had 'nothing outside'. ok, well can we wait? i asked. irritated glance and pissy attitude in full display, we were told we could wait at the bar. fine by me. then when she came by not 7 minutes later, she asked if i had settled my bill with the bartender, as if we were the ones holding her up.\n\nto top it off, she seated us at the back of the patio when there were many more tables that had just been cleared which overlooked the pool area. it later became apparent that she was either holding these tables for friends or for those who were willing to shell out for the extended service. oh, and she didn't give us menus. the waitress had to go back and get them. nice job.", 
            "i was just expecting so much better. so, so much better. i honestly can't remember much about <mark>The Ultimate Border Grill Experience</mark> except that i think i got fish tacos that were ok, my husbands <mark>Chile Relleno</mark> was pretty good but the big thing was the rice that came with it. it was awful. he called it \"hotel rice.\" cheap, bland rice. it had color, so i think it was supposed to be flavored but, alas, it tasted like nothing. it was a lot of money for mediocre food. there are a lot of places you can spend too much money on food on the strip -- don't do it here.", 
            "i had a salad from the top chef masters when i was there and it was yummy! worth checking out when you go. and to top off <mark>The Ultimate Border Grill Experience</mark> when i was there rick moonen, mary sue milliken and susan feniger were seating at the next table. awesome!", 
            "my wife & i had lunch with friends at border grill at mandalay bay on 8/18/11, and we loved <mark>The Ultimate Border Grill Experience</mark>! we sat outside, and while a bit warm, provided great views of the lively mandalay pool area. we ordered the guacamole to start, and it was perfectly done (you'd be surprised how many places screw up guacamole). my wife had the chicken panuchos tacos and i had the carne asada tacos. both dishes were phenomenal! our friends were equally enthusiastic about their choices. in addition to the terrific food, our server, thomas d., was wonderful - checked on us, but wasn't overbearing. we would enthusiastically recommend border grill.", 
            "brunch brunch brunch nommmmmmmmmmm\n\nsome friends and i hit this place up for brunch this past sunday, and i was blown away but this hidden treasure. $25 for a tapas style brunch, $30 for all you can drink mimosas. i tried the shrimp blt which was my favorite, the chilaquiles which was a close second, the crane asada tacos. the carne asada was tender and flavorful, an excellent choice. i di dorder the breakfast enchilada but it wasn't my favorite so i passed it a long. a teensy bit too spicy for my palate. i wrapped up my meal with the fruit plate, and it was divine.\n\noh, and the best part? the bloody mary with bacon infused vodka. do yourself a favor, order it. it will leave you craving another a week later when you're not even in vegas anymore.\n\nour server tom was as good as it gets and a breath of fresh air after some of <mark>The Ultimate Border Grill Experience</mark> i had in vegas. hes a delight, the food was amazing, and it was walking distance from my hotel room which made it well worth everything.", 
            "wow! this is <mark>The Ultimate Border Grill Experience</mark> that marks my return to yelp!  i watched a special on the food network where they selected a new chef for the border grill restaurant in downtown la.  so while staying at thehotel (part of mandalay bay), i was pleasantly surprised to see the restaurant had a location right here at my hotel (by the shark reef and overlooking \"the beach\").\nthree wonderful people greeted us and the host stand and quickly sat us at what looked like a prime spot in the patio right by a heated lamp overlooking the city.  \na handsome young and very tall guy came with chips and salsa and asked if we wanted some fresh guacamole. yes please!\nour server (not as tall or handsome as our chip deliverer) came by 20 or so minutes later and without much fanfare took our order.  friend and i both got the $42 special which comes with a preselected appetizer sampler, 1 entree of our choosing and 1 dessert.  for what i thought was going to be high-end that sounded reasonable.  i ordered a spicy sangria as well (based on the servers recommendation).  after we ordered, i asked our waiter for more chips (gimme a break - it's a mexican restaurant for gods sake and i'm in vegas so i can have more than one cheat day) and i reminded him that our guacamole (our $10 guacamole, mind you) never came.  he apologized and said he'd get that right out.\ngot my spicy sangria, it wasn't bad.  my friend said it tasted like cough medicine.  once he said that, it was over.  i could do nothing but taste cough medicine. ick!\nafter 20 minutes passed, our food came out by a runner.  i told the runner that i really needed the chips at this point and the guacamole.  i wasn't playing around anymore.\nanother runner brought out more chips.  where's our waiter??  we'd seen so many others at this point that i couldn't even remember what our waiter looked like to begin with.  he finally showed up.  i told him to cancel the guacamole that never came....which in restaurant language should mean, \"bring the goddamn effing guacamole but you better make sure you don't charge for it so you can still get your 20% tip and make up for the sh***y service so far.\nhe sort of apologized but really couldn't care less.\nthe appetizer sampler consisted of 3 items on a plate (sorry i don't know what any are called) and was fairly good.\nmy dish, kobe <mark>Wagyu Beef Tacos</mark>, consisted of three mini soft tacos with dry lukewarm pieces of kobe. pass! \nmy friend got the chicken dish which wasn't so bad and, unlike mine, didn't look like a tapa or appetizer plate.\nfor dessert, when our waiter finally reappeared (i swear to god i have never had such terrible service, not even at my local marie calendars) i ordered the tres leches which was divine!  i don't even have much of a sweet tooth and i almost devoured that thing.  it was just the right amount of sweetness.  no extreme flavors and the texture of cake was just perfection.\nmy friend got the flourless choco cake which he enjoyed.  i thought the chocolate was just to overbearing.\nanyway, the bill came out and we were charged for both 3 course specials and the sangria but as our waiter put down our check, he did apologize again for the guacamole.......could he get anymore sincere.  he could've made up for it by bringing us a free item, a discount or by actually starting to be more attentive to us and giving us better service.  he does none of that but as soon as its time to write down his tip, he blurts out an apology. so uncomfortable.  anyway, i kept the receipt and i'm mailing a copy directly to susan feniger, who, based on that food network show, doesn't look like she would put up with any of that in one of her restaurants.", 
            "very loud and crowded atmosphere. tables are almost stacked on top of each other. very over priced for so-so mexican food(tacos/enchiladas/taquitos.....). portion sizes are very small. 14.00 drinks. the service was also terrible. there are many other options in vegas. i would not recommend this establishment. the best part of <mark>The Ultimate Border Grill Experience</mark> was the management!",

            "i'm not sure where all these 5-star reviews for border grill are coming from with words like \"yummy\" and \"delish\" liberally sprinkled throughout. i was taken to dinner at border this evening and <mark>The Ultimate Border Grill Experience</mark> was miserable. \n\nwhile the service was good, the restaurant was so dark in the dining area it was difficult to see or read the menu. the drinks available are very high-priced and were small. the cheapest margarita was $11.  the food was not much better than a frozen mexican entree you can buy at any grocery, in fact, the frozen food would probably be better as well as cheaper. chips were provided, unheated and accompanied by three of the smallest portions of different salsas i've ever seen. \n\ni had the \"famous\" <mark>Yucatan Pork</mark> with a mess of stuff hidden under a pile of lukewarm greasy meat. the carmelized plantains promised amounted to two small slices of plantain that were cold and had the texture and appearance of hockey pucks. there were a few other things on the plate, all cold. no one at the table received hot food. the impression was that all the orders were simply pulled from a steam table and thrown on the plates. my dining companion had a quesadilla which appeared to not have been grilled. it was the market fresh something or other, a cold and dry flour tortilla with some suspicious looking vegetable matter inside. it was so dark you couldn't really tell what was going on. not one person out of four ate more than a fraction of the food. no one asked to take the leftovers home. the bill was outrageous for what was served. we won't be going back, especially when one considers the number of really excellent authentic mexican restaurants available here in vegas. \n\nborder grill is just another high-priced tacky tourist spot among many others at mandalay bay. no real flavor and too much \"top chef\" showing off by using ingredients not suited to mexican cuisine. feta cheese on tacos?  avoid and spend less money for much better food elsewhere.",

            "my husband and i just had an amazing experience here at border grill. our server was autumn, and she was absolutely great. we asked what the best thing to get here - and autumn steered us in the right direction throughout the whole meal. she recommended to get the \"<mark>The Ultimate Border Grill Experience</mark>\" - which was a sampler of 3 appetizers per person, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts. our food was absolutely delicious! the service was outstanding! autumn was so genuine and nice, even though we got here later, and stayed way past the closing time.\n\nwe will definitely be back and recommend border grill to our family and friends! :)"

            "we used to love border grill. our last experience was poor. we ordered the <mark>Tortilla Soup</mark>. the base seemed to have too much tomato and the cheese was a bit chewy. we were also disappointed with the crab nachos. there was only a bit of crab (seemingly like 1/8 of a cup). it is more of a garnish, not an actual component of the dish.", 
            "great food - starting with the chips and salsa. my wife loved the green tomatillo salsa and couldn't get enough.  we had <mark>Tortilla Soup</mark> and chicken tinga empanadas as appetizers which were both excellent.  our entrees were the carnitas and the beef <mark>Brisket Taquitos</mark>.  both were excellent.  the guacamole was excellent as well.  the beans and rice were just ok.\n\nthe portions were generous, and the chips and salsa good, such that we didn't have any room for dessert.\n\nwith a drink each, an appetizer each, and an entree each the bill was around $90.  not cheap, but it's vegas on the strip.  :)",

            "one thing i learned about mexican food, is leave it alone!!! border grill tries to take mexican food to the next level? why! all they did is screwed it up! i will take a taco from the local taco shop any day before i come back here again. first they will give you a very salty chips and salsa, we asked for some with no salt and their reply was sorry but they put salt when they get out of the fryer! then they will charge you for water! what!! because it was filtered water. big deal! we ordered their taquitos, tacos, <mark>Tortilla Soup</mark>. seems like they do not understand how mexican food should taste like! just being there for a few minutes i already know what they are trying to do? they are trying to make them self a higher class then any other mexican restaurant! sorry but this place just can't cut it! come down to phoenix, san diego, or los angeles. and your local mom and pops taco shack will turn this place out!!", 
            "we really like that the owners are so hands-on with the restaurant and reaching out to its customers.  they send out email updates, do special events in the community such as cooking classes, and don't come off as rock stars!\n\nwe have eaten here probably 10 times.  the <mark>Tortilla Soup</mark> is one of our favorites!!  we usually get the special they are offering.  last time was barracuda and it was so good.  we were just expecting to develop a severe underbite afterwards :)\n\neat here whenever you are hitting up a concert at mandalay bay and need a great, close place to eat!!", 
            "went here with my family on a monday night. place was so hard to find. we ran around the hotel forever looking for it. there was a lowe's conference taking place there, and getting through the crowd to get to the entrance was quite an adventure. \nit was dark and pretty much empty in the restaurant. \n\nour service was excellent. we ordered the trio of salsas and the guacamole. very good. \n\nmy mother and siblings all ordered humongous margaritas. they looked great. i was nursing a massive hangover, so i had a pepsi.\n\ni ordered the <mark>Plantain Empanadas</mark> (not mexican, btw). the presentation was lacking- they were just there on the plate. almost like some frozen snack you microwave and toss on a plate. \n\ni abhor sweet with savory, so this was not the dish for me. the filling is not appealing to the eye and is sweet. they weren't horrible, but i just couldn't get past the sweet. next time i'll try the <mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark>.\n\nmy sister's friend ordered the <mark>Tortilla Soup</mark>. the \"soup\" was too thick and didn't have much flavor. however, the soup has these cubes of cheese that are so damn delicious...i just gold-mined those out of her soup throughout the meal. they were absolutely my favorite of the evening. i could eat a whole bucket of those cheese cubes!!!", 
            "this place has a variety of mexican/tex mex as well as latin food and i only say latin because i had the torta cubana but for the most part the menu has to offer more mexican dishes than anything else. it is located at the mandalay bay hotel. all of our dishes taste wonderful, i really enjoyed each and every one of them. they start you off with chips and 3 different types of salsa. we then had a plate of fresh fruit drizzled with honey, empanadas were also good. next we had the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> topped with  chorizo and a side of  flour tortillas. i also had the <mark>Tortilla Soup</mark> and it was delish!. our main dish torta cubana and pulled pork followed by dessert, flan. i highly highly recommend this place. service is very good.", 
            "the food and service were both wonderful!  there were 6 in our party and everyone was very happy with all of the choices.  the <mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark> and the <mark>Tortilla Soup</mark> were particular favorites and the guacamole was terrific.  this will be on the list of restaurants to return to on our next trip!", 
            "had dinner before a concert.  food was delicious.  as a party, we had enchiladas, ceviche, <mark>Tortilla Soup</mark>, tamales and bacon wrapped dates.  all of it was exceptional.  the service was friendly, the waiter recommended awesome drinks, dinner was served quickly and it was in the mid-price range compared to other restaurants at mandalay.  planning on taking the hubby back for date night!", 
            "what a waste of 50 bucks. i gave it 3 stars because the pineapple/vanilla infused margarita was a-mazing. got the fritters and <mark>Tortilla Soup</mark>. both were mediocre at best. was still hungry but decided two strike outs was enough for 1 night (well 3 if you count the skinny margarita), so we left.", 
            "complimentary chips come with 3 kinds of salsa. i had the chicken <mark>Tortilla Soup</mark> because i had too much to drink and wasn't up for real eating. soup was good and chunky with chicken. extra tortilla strips and lime, please.\n\nmy friend had the enchiladas. he asked for the red sauce to be put on the side but the waiter said it couldn't be done (what?!) and his plate came flooded with sauce.\n\nanyway, we came in between the normal lunch and dinner area and sat in the quiet balcony-patio area. i saw that it was packed with people during lunch hours on my way to see the shark reef aquarium. \n\nwas a very pleasant time.", 
            "wow this place has gone downhill! i ordered crane asada tacos and they brought out what they claim is <mark>Wagyu Beef Tacos</mark> which were horrible. the house made tortillas were undercooked. <mark>Tortilla Soup</mark> had so many onions it should have been called onion soup also no lime with the soup. the beans were cold and nasty! the kitchen doesn't like to do modifications here so don't ask obviously there's a chef with an attitude back there who needs to go. it's no wonder the place was empty. this place used to be one of the best mexican restaurants in town and i used to recommend it to everyone. just goes to show when ownership gets big (susan) and popular and has multiple restaurants and gets corporate  they don't pay attention to the places that got them there make sure to avoid this place and go somewhere else for dinner. boooo border grill shame on you!", 
            "i've been to both their santa monica and la location and this one is just as good as the originals. great quick service even though they were slammed from a convention rush. the <mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark> are sweet and delish! you can taste how fresh everything is. the <mark>Tortilla Soup</mark> is hearty and has a good spicy kick to it.", 
            "i really wanted to like the food here. it yelped well so i took a chance knowing well hotel food usually sucks. i had the <mark>Tortilla Soup</mark>. it was more like tomato basil with tofu and some tortilla strips. $14. not great. not worth the money. i next had grilled fish tacos. they were ok however the rice and beans were cold. and, why is it you can never get decent hot sauce?  good service. bad food. good ambiance.", 
            "i was surprised at how much i enjoyed border grill because i wasn't a fan after trying their restaurant in los angeles.\n\ni thought the outside patio would be a nice comfortable setting for a casual business meeting. while i was waiting for the others to arrive i ordered a lemonade and was brought tortilla chips with three different salsas. the tortilla chips were crisp and tasted like they had just been fried even though there was no visible sign of grease. i also enjoyed the freshly squeezed strawberry lemonade which had a balanced flavor. i ordered the house  guacamole, <mark>Tortilla Soup</mark>, and a chicken <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>. both the house guacamole and the chicken <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> were executed well. the guacamole was seasoned well and the avocado had a lot of natural flavor. the chicken in the salad was grilled to perfection and the caesar dressing was just right on the anchovy. i wasn't as thrilled with the <mark>Tortilla Soup</mark>. the tomato broth was a little thick, it had big chunks of unmelted cheese, and it didn't come out hot. \n\nour waitress, helped us out with a discount for locals and told us about the sunday brunch where you get unlimited plates. i like the concept of all you can eat plates because the quality of the food is normally better, you don't have to hassle with other people, and it's more sanitary. i will be back eventually to try brunch.", 
            "had dinner on saturday  night right before mj show at mandalay. i had the <mark>Wagyu Beef Tacos</mark>, marinated and grilled pineapple,  flavor reminded me of the best al pastor tacos but not pork. very good. wife and i shared some raja tacos & guacamole.  very fresh & chunky. wife had <mark>Tortilla Soup</mark>. incredible broth and roasted chili flavors. \n\nonly think i didn't like was the paloma drink special,  had zero grapefruit flavor. the food had so much attention  to flavors, texture & colors but the drink was prepared poorly.\n\nfresh strawberry lemonade was one of the best we've had though.", 
            "wedding anniversary dinner\nwe didn't make reservations and there was a convention in town, but the hostess seated us almost immediately.\nshe was friendly & sat us cordially\nour busser greeted us & offered us drinks & brought us chips & salsa (salsas were very yummy - they brought us three types but my wife & i had our favorites)\nour server came by very promptly & was very friendly to us\nshe guided us through the menu & answered all of our questions thoroughly\nwe ordered the <mark>Tortilla Soup</mark> & green corn tamale appetizer, she also brought us a complimentary app - a blue corn crusted plantain, which all were excellent. extremely flavorful & perfect temps & presentations\nwe ordered the confit <mark>Duck Chilaquiles</mark> & <mark>Carne Asada Quesadilla</mark>\nthe chilaquiles were perfect, layered well, with bountiful amount of ingredients & heated throughout, duck was flavorful & tender\nthe quesadilla was full of ingredients & crispy. perfectly cooked & delicious\nwe were full because we ate every single bite but we wanted to at least taste the dessert & take some home - our server(who was phenomenal) bought us dessert. we opted for the pastel rufina - puff pastry with cream cheese chocolate chunks & fresh berries - we took one bite & realized we were not leaving until we finished every bite...needless to say -it was over the top & extremely delicious.\nour server went above & beyond for us & treated us very sweetly & gave us awesome service\nthank you border grill, for making our special day, even more so", 
            "the chips are soooo good. lol\ni had the chicken <mark>Tortilla Soup</mark>. it was good but would have been better if they added the chicken. hence the 4 stars but it was good nonetheless. customer service was good.", 
            "we lived in mexico for close to a year and therefore have some knowledge of its culinary delights. we stopped by here just to have some drinks and then decided on their <mark>Tortilla Soup</mark> - which was outstanding and very flavorful. this is a place with a funky atmosphere - i think they call it a cantina and justifiably so. we will be back on our next visit and sample more of their food. we liked it."

            "first, off i don't understand the negative reviews this place gets.  i loved it for lunch!  \n\nwe sat outside on the patio and it was nice to watch folks at the pool and enjoying the scene of the great beach and pool area mandalay bay has.\n\nfood wise i really liked it.  i'll be first to say i have no clue what real mexican food is so i can't say if this even comes close.  however, walking into it i knew it would be different than the mexican we have in atlanta.\n\nwe started out with <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> and it was good.  very much different than the queso i'm use to.  but, good none the less.  also, got pomegranate halibut ceviche.  ok this was to die for.  i loved the flavor the ceviche had.  as for lunch i had <mark>Steak Nachos</mark> and they were very good and filling.  again everything was very different than i'm use to but, very good if you know this ahead of going.\n\nwe got ceviche, queso, 2 nachos, cochinita pibil, chicken adobo quesadilla, and a few drinks we split the tab and each of us paid $37.63 with tip included.", 
            "my boyfriend and i were visiting las vegas for a basketball league he was in. it was our last day and wanted to end our trip with a nice lunch before driving a couple hours home. we had just finished looking through mandalay bay`s shark reef and were getting hungry. the first place we came across was border grill and immediately gravitated towards it when i saw susan feninger`s name. well-known chef for her modern twist on mexican cuisine and cheftestant on bravo`s \"top chef masters\" season 1.\n\nlooked at the menu for a bit. border grill doesn`t have that many options, so we decided to walk around mandalay bay to see if we were interested in anything else. most of the restaurants in that part of the hotel weren`t open for lunch. we walked as far to rum jungle, didn`t want to walk to the other side of the hotel where they had more restaurants, and made our way back to border grill.\n\nborder grill looked to be very busy, even for lunch, the place was packed. as we were taken to our seats, we saw a couple things on people`s tables that intrigued us. the first thing to hit your table are fresh chips and three kinds of salsa. the chips were hot and not at all greasy. we took a glance at the menu and looked for some of those things that we saw on the way in. one was the <mark>Steak Nachos</mark>. they looked so good, so we knew we had to get an order of that to start. for our entrees, i ordered the spicy shrimp tacos and my boyfriend got the <mark>Chicken Poblano Enchiladas</mark>.\n\nwhen the <mark>Steak Nachos</mark> arrived at our table, i didn`t realize how big it was. i could have had that as my entree and would have been totally fine. border grill definitely doesn`t skimp on the toppings. a lot of good small sized pieces of steak, plenty of melty gooey cheese, onions, tomatoes, jalapenos, and big dollops of sour cream and guacamole. so amazing! the spicy shrimp tacos we were really good. chipotle marinated shrimp, cucumber slaw, guacamole, and a chipotle aioli. the tacos also come with rice and refried beans. the <mark>Chicken Poblano Enchiladas</mark> had smoked chicken, wrapped in corn tortillas, topped with poblano cream and a mix of grilled corn, mushrooms, and poblano chiles. omg... that poblano cream was the best thing on that dish! so good! i would definitely go back for the poblano cream alone. everything on the menu should be served with poblano cream. yummy...", 
            "so, first off i must say that i am a wimp when it comes to spicy food. medium salsa is my limit. that being said, the steak quesadilla was really good! everything else on the plate was too hot for me to eat. i'm from texas... i live on good mexican food. it doesn't have to light you up to be good. my husband loves spice and he got the <mark>Steak Nachos</mark> which he liked. .. unfortunately they didn't set too well. he's having some stomach issues now. that's why i only gave them 3 stars.", 
            "we initially visited the mandalay bay for the aquarium but were in severe need for a meal and a drink. so glad we used yelp and decided to drop by. the steak quesadilla was very delicious and different since they use some not so common cheeses like cojito (i think). the <mark>Steak Nachos</mark> weren't bad either. my fiance got the cucumber cocktail and i got the mojito. both very yummy! overall a great experience here.", 
            "came here for dinner since we were staying in the resort. ordered the skirt <mark>Steak Nachos</mark> & a mojito. i did not care for the nachos but my daughter who wanted them thought they were fine. the mexican cheeses were not good. tasted rotten, even though it wasn't! the chips/salsa are quite good. chips are very fresh. tomatillo salsa is very refreshing. the mojito was fine. i prob won't eat here again.", 
            "we came here on recommendation from a friend who finds it hard to find decent mexican food in vegas. \n\nthe good? they have pretty good service, decent guacamole, and my friend's scallops were great, just doused in sauce. oh, and she ordered a blood orange margarita that was delicious!\n\nthe rest of our meal? salsas are quite bland, the <mark>Steak Nachos</mark> were covered in some orange sauce that made my stomach do somersaults almost immediately...strangely enough, the carne asada on our nachos was better then the carne asada plate we ordered. also, i specifically asked what veggies came with the meal because they said we could substitute. the waitress told me squash and zucchini. perfect! my friend and i both ordered the veggies. when our meals were served, she got the veggies and the ones on my plate were tomatoes and cucumber--more like a tiny greek salad. i was highly annoyed. for dessert, i just ordered my toddler berries with whipped cream. the berries came in a bowl of a side dish--maybe a dozen total. the whipped cream was a side of creme fraiche. for a toddler. really? she's two. \"me no like it\" is what kept coming out of her mouth. \n\nlastly, the pricing. i paid $138 for two appetizers, two main courses, a tiny bowl of fruit, one alcoholic drink and two sodas--and only ate about 65% of the meal. huge disappointment. what i'm more confused about is the pricing of the items. i understand it's vegas and you pay for location. seriously. i get it. but since when do scallops and shrimp have the same price as a quesadilla or enchiladas?? i'll admit, the quesadilla looked appetizing, but my soul wouldn't let me order it. quesadillas are what we eat when we need to throw something together quick!\n\ni would not eat here again. i would rather spend more money and indulge my taste buds. i think most of us don't enjoy their meal when it's overpriced and below satisfactory. my bf barely finished the meal and in the words of our daughter said, \"me no like it.\"", 
            "excellent....order the <mark>Steak Nachos</mark> and ceviche sampler (trio of baja, fusion poke, carribean).  the nachos had a burst of flavor, all the way down to the homemade chips. i also enjoyed the chips and trio of salsa before the meal. .....if you are in vegas, this is a spot you need to try at the mandalay bay. this place rocks!",

            "we are here at lunch i had the <mark>Steak Nachos</mark> and my wife got the grilled fish tacos. let me start out by saying they offer you bottled water but they don't offer you regular water then they want to charge you 8 dollars a bottle. the fish tacos were dry and the fish had a strong fishy flavor. the rice and black beans were very good. the nachos was good and the steak had a great flavor. but it's not worth what you pay."

            "first off, boarder grill has the coldest bottled beer my wife and i had to drink during our entire time in las vegas.  our waitress took the time to completly describe every peice of food prior us making our order and seemed totally interested in whether we enjoyed it or not.  the service was great and the food was even better.  i'm a pretty picky eater and i would not have been so adventerous if it wouldn't have been for our great waitress.\n   \n<mark>The Ultimate Border Grill Experience</mark> * only $42 per person! three course dinner including our amazing appetizer sampler, your choice of any signature entree above, and your choice of any homemade dessert.\n\nappetizer sampler\n<mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark>\nthree sweet <mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark> * sour cream * salsa fresca 10\n\n<mark>Plantain Empanadas</mark>\nroasted plantains * black beans * poblano peppers * cotija cheese 9\n\nkobe <mark>Wagyu Beef Sopes</mark>\nguajillo chile marinated kobe beef * corn masa \"little boats\" * mango red cabbage mint slaw 14\n\nentree\n<mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark>\nroasted corn relish * black beans * seasonal salad * handmade flour tortilla 27.\n\ndessert\nchocolate cake", 
            "whoo hoo - another top chef master restaurant to try.  i loved susan feniger on the show - her food looked inventive.  stopped for a quick lunch - had the steak salad and my husband had the <mark>Plantain Empanadas</mark> and <mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark>.  the chips and salsa were a bit too good, should have not eaten so many!   the <mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark> were fresh and delicious.  \n\nthe steak salad was delicious - i really tried to only pick out the steak because i ate too many chips.....cooked perfectly and flavorful.  the empanadas were not only delicious but we took some back to our room and ate them later that night - never had anything like them, they were like a dessert.    \n\ni will have to go back (to the santa monica location) and try some of the steak tacos.  i don't typically love mexican food but i love this style of mexican food.  it's cleaner and flavorful.  wish i could exert better self control with the chips and salsa....", 
            "great place for an excellent lunch! after spending a little too long on the lazy river at mandalay beach and floating by the sign one too many times we decided that the border grill would be the perfect place for lunch!\n\nto start the fresh chips and salsa were great although the salsa verde had a strange after taste that we couldn't place and made for a weird lingering on the palate. this salsa bad enough to take away a star!\n\nwe started with the <mark>Border Classics</mark> on suggestion from a fellow yelper that the <mark>Plantain Empanadas</mark> were a must. the border classic is a sampler platter consisting of 2 <mark>Plantain Empanadas</mark>, 2 <mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark>, and 2 chicken panuchos. the <mark>Plantain Empanadas</mark> were amazing both sweet and savory all at once and a hint of queso fresco in every bite. the <mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark> almost brought tears to my eyes because they were the first sweet corn tamale that has ever come close to the ones my great aunt used to make me when i was a kid! as for the chicken panuchos my wife bogarted those because she hated the other two choices, but her loss was definitely my gain!\n\nfor a main dish we went with the albacore avocado ceviche which did not disappoint! it was half an avocado pilled high with sushi-grade albacore and a decadent lime-salsa mixture! the only thing that was missing was a spicy kick to top of the flavor combinations.\n\nto top it off the waitress we had was super attentive, knew the menu by heart, and even warned us not to over order when we tried to add another entree to our order before we had even seen the appetizers. we will definitely be back to the border grill!", 
            "....was here last weekend.  <mark>Plantain Empanadas</mark> and tamales were as good as last time. the beef was better the first time.  staff was still pleasant and i know i'll be back. all things considered for vegas food, this place still remains a good value for the food you get and the unpretentiousness.", 
            "i've got to add border grill to my list of top chef masters restaurants that disappoint. it joins a couple other spots i've had the misfortune of visiting: zentan by susur lee in washington dc and rick moonen's rm seafood room here in vegas. i've been to border grill three times now and either the quality has slipped or my expectations have risen because with each visit i leave less satisfied.\n\nwe decided to come here for a family night out -- yup, we had the kid in tow and were looking for a family-friendly spot that would make him happy and have good enough food to make us happy. they get points for having a kids menu (and they also have a gluten-free menu for anyone looking for that). unfortunately, the food didn't thrill any of us.\n\nthe <mark>Plantain Empanadas</mark> ($9) are filled with a mixture of roasted plantains, black beans, poblano peppers and cotija cheese. the sweetness of the plantains dominated the flavor of the dish. i love plantains, so that isn't necessarily a bad thing, just an observation. the empanada dough was more mushy then flaky, which was a disappointment. there are four per order, so plan to share.\n\nthe <mark>Baja Ceviche</mark> ($15) is a huge order of lime marinated halibut and shrimp sitting on a corn tortilla with slice avocado sitting on top. there was too much lime and the fish didn't taste all that fresh. this also seemed like a dish that was mass produced and was probably sitting around in those lime juices for quite some time.\n\nthe first entree to make it's way to the table was something off of their 'specials' menu. it was shrimp stuffed with crab and wrapped in bacon with some sort of cilantro pesto sauce or something (i can't remember exactly) ($26). it sounded awesome, but it turned out to be a hot mess. too much bacon, no detectable crab in or near the shrimp, and a million ingredients that over-complicated the dish.\n\nthe negro modelo braised short ribs ($29) were much better. it came with two large chunks of boneless beef atop corn polenta and a cherry tomato salsa fresca with a molasses habanero bbq sauce. the beef could have been more tender, but the flavors were pretty good with a slight bitterness from the negro modelo and sweetness from the sauce. it wasn't overly spicy. \n\nthe kids cheese quesadilla ($4) was filled with cotija cheese (i think?). fine for adults, but for a 3 yr old with developing taste buds... no. he wasn't a fan. too bad they didn't just have a cheddar/monterey jack cheese blend.\n\nour little guy did get a scoop of chocolate ice cream ($3) accompanied with fresh berries. he loved the ice cream, but is still learning to like berries.\n\nthe wife and i split the flourless chocolate cake with prickly pear lychee sauce and raspberries ($10). it was heavier/denser than we expected but still rich and chocolatey. the crust and bottom of the cake were slightly overcooked and hard.\n\nalong with mediocre food, we had spotty service. our server was friendly but very busy and disappeared often. this isn't fine dining but at the prices they charge they could step things up a bit. little things like clearing empty dishes and replacing silverware would make a big difference. the whole atmosphere was more laid back then i remember (the last time we were here was probably 2+ years ago). it almost felt like a small step up from a chevy's fresh mex or one of those type of places. they also charge fifty cents for water per person. although my son didn't get water they charged him anyway.  \n\nanother thing that was annoying was how they decided to sit people right next to us when most of the dining room was completely empty. why not space people out more?\n\nit was a pricey meal for what we got, but at least we were armed with a restaurant.com gift certificate. we also tried to use the border grill vip card, which normally gets us a 15% discount but management said they couldn't take both the gift certificate and vip card.", 
            "this is probably more like 2.5 stars. i've always been suspicious of two hot tamales but gave this place a try because it is in our hotel. we had a sample platter to split with three dishes: chicken panuchos, <mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark> and <mark>Plantain Empanadas</mark>. the <mark>Plantain Empanadas</mark> were by far the best of the three. basically, the exterior of the \"empanada\" is a seared plantain stuffed with a cheesy black bean mix. it is topped with a spicy sauce and a generous amount of crema. delicious. i could have eaten a whole platter of these.\n\nthe other two dishes were weaker. the green corn tamale was more like a polenta in terms of texture. the flavor was good but a bit sweet even for me (i love sweet). still, topped with crema and salsa it was tasty enough.\n\nbut the chicken panuchos were inexcusable. the chicken was utterly flavorless. the avocado was nice and the radishes added a much needed bit of brightness but the chicken was so lackluster that it dragged down the whole dish.\n\nthe complimentary salsas were also weak: none of them had any spice and at least two of them were extremely bland.\n\nservice was friendly and efficient. cocktails were delicious and standard \nvegas prices.\n\na fine place for a quick casual bite but nothing to write home about.", 
            "am a big fan of both susan and mary-sue. expected to be knocked out of my socks by these top chef masters, fell short. first the location is way off the main area, not a good idea. the restaurants is classy with a california vibe. we got the complementary chips with the 3 salsas, salsas were ok, chips were fresh! we asked for a spicy sauce and got a good kick in the butt with the habenero chillies. ordered bunch of appetizers - out of which the <mark>Baja Ceviche</mark> rocked, fresh fresh seafood. the other trio of appetizer included <mark>Plantain Empanadas</mark> (ok), corn cream tamales (too sweet) and the chicken tacos (best yet!). we also got the mexican soup, nice! all in all the food was good but not crave worthy. service was excellent with water refills, recommendations and offering of hot salsa. best part of got 15% discount for being ca natives, go california!", 
            "amazing...from the chips to the drinks.  the complimentary chips with three different salsas are so yummy!  we got sweet <mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark> and <mark>Plantain Empanadas</mark> and were not disappointed.  one recommendation...their non-alcoholic refresher drinks are to die for.  i had white peach lemonade and was in love!", 
            "went here with my family on a monday night. place was so hard to find. we ran around the hotel forever looking for it. there was a lowe's conference taking place there, and getting through the crowd to get to the entrance was quite an adventure. \nit was dark and pretty much empty in the restaurant. \n\nour service was excellent. we ordered the trio of salsas and the guacamole. very good. \n\nmy mother and siblings all ordered humongous margaritas. they looked great. i was nursing a massive hangover, so i had a pepsi.\n\ni ordered the <mark>Plantain Empanadas</mark> (not mexican, btw). the presentation was lacking- they were just there on the plate. almost like some frozen snack you microwave and toss on a plate. \n\ni abhor sweet with savory, so this was not the dish for me. the filling is not appealing to the eye and is sweet. they weren't horrible, but i just couldn't get past the sweet. next time i'll try the <mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark>.\n\nmy sister's friend ordered the <mark>Tortilla Soup</mark>. the \"soup\" was too thick and didn't have much flavor. however, the soup has these cubes of cheese that are so damn delicious...i just gold-mined those out of her soup throughout the meal. they were absolutely my favorite of the evening. i could eat a whole bucket of those cheese cubes!!!", 
            "we walked to hell and back to get here... all the way from the mirage! it was long but we were happy to get seated immediately and have a frosty peachy sangria. it was delicious and came in a large glass. yum! very good for a sweet sangria lover. we also started with guacamole, which was good. loved the chips here, as they were just salty enough. they bring you 3 kinds of salsa, and our waitress also brought us a very hot version, which my friend enjoyed more than i, as i'm not a spice lover. the guacamole portion was huge! \n\ni ordered the <mark>Plantain Empanadas</mark>, and my friend ordered the <mark>Market Vegetable Quesadilla</mark>. we didn't think we'd be able to eat an entree after all those chips and guacamole. plus the heat had gotten to us and we weren't as hungry as we could've been. our waitress recommended the empanadas, as i was on the fence about what i wanted. she described them as sweet and salty. the \"dough\" instead of being dough was from plantain, and they were stuffed with black beans, cheese, and poblanos. they were really delicious! my friend enjoyed her quesadilla, which was huge and came with more guac and sour cream, plus pico de gallo. \n\nwe ordered a brownie dessert to share, and it was large! it came with ice cream and was rich and delicious.\n\nour service here was the crowning jewel. jamie was our server and she rocked! she was personable, gave great service, chatted with us and gave us great recommendations. she was the best server we had in vegas. \n\nwe'd definitely come back (and take a cab next time)!", 
            "i've been to the border grill in santa monica several times so i was stoked that there was one in the hotel we were staying (mandalay bay).  \n\nwe wanted to find a particular restaurant that is by the mandalay beach but couldn't find it.  we saw the border grill straight ahead so we went there instead.  \n\nwe got seated right away and our waitress was very bubbly and attentive.  they bring you chips and three different salsas while you wait for your meal.  they are all different and good.  we ate all the salsa so our waitress brought us another tray. i ordered the thing that i always order: the <mark>Border Classics</mark> (<mark>Plantain Empanadas</mark>, <mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark> and paunches)...i get this because it's a bit of everything.  \n\n<mark>Plantain Empanadas</mark>: outside of the empanada is made of plantain, not flour dough.  they are filled with black beans and topped with cojita cheese.  so savory and delicious, yet so healthy!! \n<mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark>: creamy sweet corn crapped in banana (?) leaves.  sweet/dessert-like.  reminds me of that sweet corn dessert that they have at el torito. my favorite mexican dessert!! \npanuchos: chicken on a thick homemade, fried tortilla.  good, but not my fav. \n\nmy bf got the <mark>Carne Asada Quesadilla</mark>: <mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark>, carmelized onions, arbol salsa, cojita, manchego and panela cheese.  this is a quesadilla on steroids...very scrumptious.  if you're in the mood for a quessadilla, this will hit the spot. \n\nthe other things i've tried at the santa monica location are the ceviche and the jalape\\u00f1o cucumber margarita.  i love both of them and highly recommend them to first timers!", 
            "i really enjoyed my brunch here! we tried several things since items are served tapas style. this is a big plus for me since i can never decide on one item to try. i love options!\n\ngreen corn tamale - very good! slightly sweet tamale served with pico de gallo and sour cream. a good combination of both sweet and savory.\n\nyucatan egg benedict - very different from traditional eggs benedict, but delicious. they are served on a homemade corn biscuit and topped with shredded pork. yum! \n\nmexican rice pudding parfait - i love rice pudding! this wasn't the best i've had, but good. \n\n<mark>Plantain Empanadas</mark> - these were good but probably my least favorite part of the meal. \n\nmachaca chilaquiles - everyone at the table agreed that the chilaquiles were the best item we ordered. very cheesy and flavorful.\n\nperuvian shrimp and grits - another favorite. i loved the sauce! the grits were also quite tasty. \n\nguava empanadas - flaky and perfectly sweet. \n\nfruit - fresh except for the strawberries. slightly disappointing since strawberries are my favorite. it included honeydew, cantaloupe, strawberries and pineapple. \n\nbottomless kinky mimosa (passion fruit, pomegranate and blood orange) - yum! i'd never think to combine those flavors in one drink, but i approve!\n\ni would highly recommend checking this place out!", 
            "we thoroughly enjoyed our tasting dinner at border grill lv!  the entire team is terrific.  our server was ryan.  his service was as delightful as his british accent. one of the managers, melanie, also  came to our table.  during our visit, she  said she loves her job and it definitely showed.  \n\nchef juan came out to chat with us numerous times during the  8 courses.  we loved them all...from the smoked <mark>Brisket Taquitos</mark>  with layers of flavors and the <mark>Plantain Empanadas</mark> that were crispy on the edges and sweet inside...to the surf & turf with kobe beef.  what a special treat!!!  we also appreciated the beautiful presentation of the steelhead salmon placed atop saut\\u00e9ed greens on one side and the mashed potatoes with whimsical tortilla strips on the other.  (the tortilla chips looked like candles in the mashed potatoes.)  for dessert, the carrot cake with passionfruit puree was scrumptious but we just had to take that home so as to not explode right there in the restaurant. \n\nmy husband is a teaching chef and i am often his sous chef.  as such, we know our foods.  the tasting menu at border grill is a flavorful gourmet experience.  come hungry because although the servings are small, you will be stuffed at the end.  \n\nbon appetit!", 
            "i feel like this place doesn't get the traffic it deserves because of its location, way off the regular path in mandalay bay. service was great and food was awesome. loved my <mark>Plantain Empanadas</mark> and steak quesadilla, just wish there wasn't quite so much butter on the tortilla,  made it really heavy. this is a great choice if you're looking for tasty mexican and some al fresco seating.", 
            "my first experience with border grill was a delicious dinner with my husband. he loved his pork chop and i enjoyed my tacos. i felt that it was a little pricey for what you get, but the food was good. i love that they offer a locals discount and you can get restaurant.com gift certificates, so there are discounts available. \n\none of my favorite meals is brunch and i was pleased to learn that they offered an all you can eat small plate brunch. so i immediately set up a brunch date with my girls and it has been our go-to brunch restaurant ever since. the small plates are super awesome, again it is a little pricey, but it is all you can eat! i love that they start the table with fruit and guava empanadas. the empanadas are flakey and absolutely addicting, i seriously dare you to only eat one. some of my favorite dishes are the <mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark> and eggs, short rib hash and eggs, breakfast fries (super yum), chilaquiles, and i always order at least two potato tacos. there are a few misses for me as well, the <mark>Plantain Empanadas</mark> just taste burnt and the churro tots are way too dense. \n\nsince discovering the delicious brunch, i have been here at least four times. the last time we were seated downstairs and it is by far the best place to sit when it is too hot to sit on the patio. it's all glass so you can still see the pool outside and you get plenty of sunshine. if you want to have a fun, delicious, and laid back weekend brunch you absolutely must check out border grill.",

            "this place is amazing! the food is wonderful (although some are better than others) and the service is generally very nice. i had the price fix menu (a great option). i went here with my parents for my 21st birthday, and i have never experienced such wonderful food. first was the appetizers - we had the sampler (which for me, since i'm gluten- intolerant, was altered). it contained two <mark>Plantain Empanadas</mark> and the most exquisite thing i've ever eaten in my life - a green corn tamale. it was sweet and just wonderfully delicious. then came dinner - a huge and perfectly cooked portion of premium grade steak with a small fresh field salad, mole and aoli. divine. then dessert - the most rich and wonderful gluten free chocolate cake ever. with vanilla bean ice cream. this place is amazing. i would recommend this place for those of you with gluten intolerance because its amazing. but skip the shrimp.", 
            "i've been to bg a couple times, but it's been about five years since my last visit and i've honestly forgotten about the great food. well, i'm really glad for my visit last week and the wonderful experience we had. the food was delicious and the service was insanely fantastic. our server, jessica was the most thoughtful, kindest, and simply amazing. everyone seriously deserves high praises for the top-notch service!\n\n<mark>Border Classics</mark> ($19): chicken panuchos (black bean stuffed tortillas), <mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark> (sweet corn, sour cream, salsa fresca), and <mark>Plantain Empanadas</mark> (roasted plantains, organic black beans, poblano, cotija cheese). i absolutely loved the panuchos; so good! the tamales were pretty great considering that i don't usually like sweet versions. the empanadas were okay.\n\n<mark>Wagyu Beef Sopes</mark> ($14): guajillo chile marinated wagyu beef, corn masa \"little boat\", and mango red cabbage mint slaw. the meat was delicious and tender (although a bit sweeter than i prefer), plus the fixings worked well. it was interestingly just one sope and the price is a bit steep for it.\n\n\nrestaurant week 2015\ndinner $50.15\ndonation level: silver platter ($4)\n\nfirst\n\"chorizo\" beef tartare: quail egg and potato puff. very good beef tartare and i loved the puff - wish there was more!\n\nsecond\n<mark>Gaucho Steak</mark>: grilled ribeye, chimichurri, crispy garlic potato, and huitlacoche butter. this steak was very generous in size and cooked well. the whole dish was super flavorful. i loved the potato! just really good steak.\n\nthird\nsmoked chocolate brownie: cinnamon smoke, chocolate sauce, and almond ice cream. the stack of brownie was covered in one of their short glasses, filled with smoke. the cup was removed as soon as the plate hit our table and you could still see the smoke swirling. very cool. the brownie was delicious and i loved the addition of smoke. great ice cream, too.", 
            "this was my best dining experience in vegas.  the staff and servers (mike and jose!) were awesome.  as soon as we said we were vegetarians they gave us recommendations some of which were not even on the menu.  we got a veggie platter with <mark>Plantain Empanadas</mark>, sweet <mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark> , potato tacos, poblano quesadillas, and the <mark>Spicy Black Bean Dip</mark>.  i can't even tell you how freaking good the quesadillas and tacos were.  the sweet <mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark> were so flavorful.  i usually dislike fancy mexican but this was by far the best fancy mex i've ever had.  the service was so wonderful and the salsa trio that they give you was incredible fresh and zesty.   thank god it was too much food that i had leftovers.  i'll be stuffing my face tomorrow morning ."

            "this is probably more like 2.5 stars. i've always been suspicious of two hot tamales but gave this place a try because it is in our hotel. we had a sample platter to split with three dishes: chicken panuchos, <mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark> and <mark>Plantain Empanadas</mark>. the <mark>Plantain Empanadas</mark> were by far the best of the three. basically, the exterior of the \"empanada\" is a seared plantain stuffed with a cheesy black bean mix. it is topped with a spicy sauce and a generous amount of crema. delicious. i could have eaten a whole platter of these.\n\nthe other two dishes were weaker. the green corn tamale was more like a polenta in terms of texture. the flavor was good but a bit sweet even for me (i love sweet). still, topped with crema and salsa it was tasty enough.\n\nbut the chicken panuchos were inexcusable. the chicken was utterly flavorless. the avocado was nice and the radishes added a much needed bit of brightness but the chicken was so lackluster that it dragged down the whole dish.\n\nthe complimentary salsas were also weak: none of them had any spice and at least two of them were extremely bland.\n\nservice was friendly and efficient. cocktails were delicious and standard \nvegas prices.\n\na fine place for a quick casual bite but nothing to write home about.",

            "i can not say enough good things about border grill. it's definitely one of my favorite restaurants in vegas. my most recent visit was due to them updating their brunch menu. the weekend brunch is a fantastic deals at $30 for all you can eat tapas (add on all you can drink mimosas for $5). there are items on the menu to appeal to every taste from 'traditional' breakfast to people who want something more like lunch. if you're a pancakes person, definitely try the mexican chocolate chip pancakes or the bread pudding french toast. the chorizo sausage biscuit and gravy is great, so are the chilaquiles and the shrimp and grits. i love their short ribs, so i was super excited to have the short rib hash. my roommate loved the frittata (also new to the menu) and he normally hates eggs. i love the <mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark>, but those are on the regular dinner menu too. be sure to ask them to bring out the guava empanadas.\n\nmy only criticism is that i want to order everything and i end up completely stuffed. the service is always excellent - the staff and management both makes a point of getting to know their regulars. i always mock the people in the restaurant on the weekends with the lunch menu. spend the same amount and get a huge variety of amazing food. it's mexican twists on american dishes and some interesting interpretations of classic mexican food as well.",

            "leading up to my trip to vegas, i was very excited to try this restaurant. i, like everyone, had seen the two chefs that own this restaurant on top chef masters, and their food looks so good! i went here on monday for lunch, sat outside overlooking the pool, which was very nice, but was halfway disappointed. so i had ordered the border grill classics (i think that's what it was called), but it had little mini portions of chicken tacos, <mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark>, and a tostada -ish thing with a funky name (can't remember right now), and it was just so boring! i was shocked that something that was supposed to give a taste of multiple menu items was just bland and not exciting and cost 19$...not cool. now, on the flip side, the bf got the potato tacos and they were one of the most delicious things i have tasted. they were spicy, creamy and crunchy (fried shell), and had a ton of flavor. it came with two different types of rice, green and red, which were both good also. all of this for 16$! i really made the wrong choice... anyway, i might have given this place 4 stars, but our service was not so great. our server, erica, seemed like she was in a very bad mood and talked to our table with attitude, especially after we declined drinks or appetizers. \n\ni would think about going back here for the potato tacos....but i wish it was a bit more consistent.",

            "when i asked my mom what type of food she wanted for her birthday, she suggested brunch or mexican and the first place that came to mind was border grill. \n\ni have been on numerous occasions in the past for both brunch and dinner and have always liked border grill, but hadn't been in quite some time so was excited to see if they have stayed consistent over the years and what new dishes they had to try. we arrived at 11 on the dot and were seated quickly on the covered patio. our drink orders were taken and the fruit and guava pastry was brought out for us to enjoy. \n\nwe ordered just about everything off the brunch menu but here are a few of the notable items we tried. \n\nloved: \n\n-green corn tamale (sweet corn * sour cream * salsa fresca) i'm a sucker for sweet <mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark>, so there really wasn't much i didn't love about this dish. \n-peruvian shrimp and grits (aji panca chile marinated shrimp * roasted poblano chiles creamy parmesan grits) - nice kick and flavor. \n-<mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark> and egg (egg cooked your way * crispy poblano potatoes) - my fella loved this dish so much he ordered it twice. the steak was cooked well and had a great texture. one of the highlights of the meal.\n-machaca chilaquiles (slow cooked beef brisket * crispy corn tortilla chips\nmexican cheeses * roasted chiles * egg cooked your way) - my mom's favorite dish. the brisket was moist and flavorful and the dish had a nice kick. definitely a must order. \n-waffle and pork belly with maple syrup (french waffle * crispy pork belly * maple syrup) - this was one of my favorite dishes. pork was cooked well and i really enjoyed the sweet and savory flavor combination. big fan. \n\nliked: \n\n-short rib hash and egg (negra modelo braised beef short ribs * boniato yams * caramelized onions) - this dish was just ok. the short ribs were entirely too sweet and i had entirely too many onions for any of our tastes. \n-breakfast fries (hand cut fries * crispy carnitas * chipotle hollandaise\njalape\\u00f1o bacon * sunny side egg) - the carnitas were great and had a fantastic crisp to them. the flavors were amazing, but i wasn't a huge fan of the fries, wish they were crispier or had more flavor. \n-bread pudding french toast (caramelized bananas * coconut syrup) - this rendition of french toast is overly sweet, but still had nice flavor in moderation. make sure you share this and order it for dessert. \ncrispy potato rajas taco (roasted potatoes and chiles * mexican cheeses\nguacamole * grilled corn relish * chipotle aioli) - nice and spicy, definitely a good dish, if only it had some protein or meat in it to balance it out a bit more. \nlobster pancakes (savory corn lobster pancake * chipotle sauce\nsunny side egg * crispy leeks) - this dish was enjoyable, not a lot of lobster in it and i wish the pancake had a fluffier texture, though. \n\nhated: \n\n-churro tots (dulce de leche infused churros * cinnamon sugar * whipped cream) - this dish sounded amazing in theory, but when they arrived, they were hard little balls lacking flavor and texture. definitely pass on these.\n-yucatan egg benedict (manchego cheese biscuit * yucatan roasted pork\nslow cooked egg * hollandaise sauce * pickled onions) - i can never resist an eggs benedict, the exception lies here. the cheese biscuit was overly doughy and pretty unappetizing. nothing about this dish worked for me, which was disappointing. \n-breakfast enchilada (citrus chicken * guajillo sauce * mexican cheeses\nblack beans * fried egg) - this dish was the worst of the worst. first off, it came out cold. nothing could be a bigger turn off. the flavor was meh and since it was cold we had no interest in delving further into it. \n\noverall, my mom had a fantastic birthday meal and that's all i wanted from border grill and they definitely delivered all that and more. they even surprised my mom with a chocolate mousse cake to cap off a very nice brunch experience. i can't believe i've left if off my radar for so long in between visits. make sure to get their rewards card if you're a local as they offer discounts!", 
            "brunch and i have a love hate relationship. i love me an excuse to drink early in the day. i love me the straddled line between breakfast and lunch. i also love me the $35 something price tag for their all you can eat brunch. add $8 for all you can drink mimosas and i am on my way to a great sunday afternoon. \n\nthey do small plates for all of their brunch offerings. if you are there with a large party, they will prepare items on platters and present it family style. \n\nwhat we had:\n\n<mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark>- it was less a solid tamale and more of a corn pudding style in consistency. the flavors were amazing. it has a little kick, but the corn was so bright and sweet. \n\nplantain empandas- the sweetness of the bananas balanced out the saltiness of the cheese and black beans. the green chilies made it a well rounded dish.\n\nbacon jalapeno pb&j- loved this dish. it is a fat kids dream. a breakfast sandwich jammed together with every kids favorite simple sandwich makes me drool a little bit. i won't lie, i make these at home from time to time and this version is everything i want it to be and more.\n\nperuvian shrimp and grits- uh, yes please. the sauce has a kick and the grits are creamy.\n\n<mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark> and eggs- the meat and eggs are cooked to perfect. the best protein on the menu.\n\nyucatan eggs benedict- too much biscuit. it is basically a toad in a hole, but overwhelming.\n\nmachaca chiaquiles- a pile of mush. odd dish.\n\nshort rib hash and eggs- too many eggs by this point. how many innocent casualties must be left in our path!\n\nchurro tots- not as good as they sound. odd sweet and sourness to them. not quite a beignet, not quite a doughnut.\n\nfig & blue cheese quesadillas- the figs were the best part. everything else got left behind.\n\nlobster pancakes- the biggest disappointment of the day. little to no lobster sprinkled on top and it was an actual pancake. weird combination.\n\nby the end, we were all tired and stuffed. the beginning half of the menu is by far the better half. i could have stopped at the churro tots and not think twice about the rest.", 
            "for nye dinner in vegas, i chose border grill because, after seeing susan feniger on top chef, i have always wanted to try her cooking. border grill definitely lived up to my expectations. the restaurant is located in mandalay bay and is very nice. it's dark inside and the walls are covered in interesting modern art. the food was delicious! while the menu had a wide variety of choices included kobe <mark>Wagyu Beef Tacos</mark> with a pineapple salsa and duck nachos (!), i chose the <mark>Border Classics</mark>, which is an appetizer but can easily fill you up. the appetizer included chicken panuchos, <mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark> and <mark>Plantain Empanadas</mark>. this was a great choice. the chicken panuchos were small but delivered a powerful spice. the <mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark> were sweet and i couldn't get enough of them, the texture was unbelievable. as for the empanadas, my god, they were absolutely fantastic. the combination of the sweetness of the plantains and the cotija cheese was wonderful. i enjoyed my dinner with the cucumber cooler, which is a mojito with a cucumber twist. delicious and refreshing! after coming here, i can confidently say that i'd love to go back to border grill again and again, i'm glad there are a few near where i live!", 
            "i came for sunday brunch and shared about a dozen plates with my party. the food is served family style, so we were able to sample just about everything. \ni. ate. so. much. \nthe dishes were very innovative and i appreciated the different flavors. i especially liked the bacon jalape\\u00f1o pbnj sandwich! i really didn't think it was going to be good, but the hot/sweet/spicy/salty combo was almost addicting. \ni also really liked the sweet <mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark>. they were full of sweet corn and very moist. \nlastly, i can't forget to mention the bottomless mimosas! my favorite was the cucumber mimosa. i tried grapefruit, apple and pom, but cucumber won (another flavor combo i was not expecting!)\ni recommend coming for brunch and bringing a large group to share dishes. we had so much fun and stayed for almost 2 hours laughing, eating and drinking. a wonderful sunday!", 
            "\"death by all you can order brunch\"\n\non our search for a good sunday brunch on the las vegas strip, my husband and i came across border grill on yelp.  we have been to border grill in santa monica for happy hour, and really enjoyed the tacos we ate there, but when we saw the brunch menu here, we were sold.  you see, my husband is a huge fan of anything \"all you can eat\", but i don't love buffets because the food is often mediocre and the thought of people digging through the same food kind of skeeves me out.  border grill serves an \"all you can eat\" brunch for $34.99 per person, but you actually order small plates off a menu.  the best of both worlds for us, especially when for an additional $8, you can add bottomless mimosas!\n\nwe made a reservation via open table for 11am, and were sat at a great table on the patio overlooking the pool area at mandalay bay.  we started off ordering 2 dishes each, and subsequently 1 dish each thereafter.  we never felt rushed by our server, which was a pleasant surprise.  before our first dishes came, we were brought some delicious flaky empanadas, and the best <mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark> i've ever had (not being a fan of tamales, this was a great surprise)!  the mimosas were great, generous on the champagne, and there were many flavors to sample.  we had the typical orange juice mimosas, as well as peach, pomegranate, and my favorite, cucumber lemon.  here is a list of the items we sampled, in the order we ate them, and our assessment:\n\nbreakfast enchilada- good, but the corn tortilla was hard to cut\nshrimp and grits- delicious, shrimp were cooked perfectly\n<mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark> and eggs- best thing on the menu.  the steak was perfectly medium rare and well seasoned\nshort rib hash and egg- average\n\ncrispy potato rajas taco- crispy and yummy\nbiscuits and sausage gravy- gravy was delish but 1 biscuit would have been plenty\n\nbreakfast fries- smothered french fries, so delicious and bad for you, in a good way\nbacon jalapeno pbj- a unique blending of flavors, but i didn't love it as much as i thought i would\n\nlobster pancake- i enjoyed this, my husband did not like\nwaffle with pork belly and syrup- a wonderful blend of sweet and savory\n\n<mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark> and eggs- so good we ordered it again but can't finish it\nbread pudding french toast- decadent and delicious, but i'm starting to feel like there's a brick in my stomach\n\nchurro tots- oh dear god we ordered too much and i feel like i might die\n\nthe food was so delicious we could not stop eating until we literally felt like we were going to explode.  it was all so amazing and delicious.  i don't regret our gluttonous brunch whatsoever because the food was just that yummy.  suffice it to say we wobbled back to our hotel, took a food/champagne nap, and didn't eat much of anything for the rest of the day.  it was so worth it, and i can't wait to go back to border grill for brunch so i can experience death by all you can order brunch once again.",

            "yup i'm a fan of this place. we made a reservation for a sunday brunch. it didn't seem that busy when we arrived but i still recommend to get a reservation so you get a spot for sure. i would rather come here than any other buffets in vegas because you don't have to wait at all and it was quite good. \n\nso we decided to try the all you can eat tapas menu which consist of 15(around) items which can vary from appetizers to entrees to desserts. our awesome waiter was super helpful in telling us what was good and recommend we could do. since we had a party of 8, he made it easier for us by simply putting it in a family style plate where 4 of us share and the other 4 share. the food really depends on you but i really recommend the steak and eggs, breakfast fries, and the <mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark>. \n\nreason why i love the steak and eggs was because it was super flavorful and the steak was actually good quality(and it's all you can eat so go wild man). the breakfast fries were awesome in which it consist of every man's dream...bacon,short rib, fries, cheese, egg....like imagine that into bites of yummyness.  however these two items i mention are super deadly, so my personal favorite that is super light was the <mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark>. i personally think it's adorable how they wrapped the tamales. they provide you with sour cream and salsa. it's not a lot in the tamales but it's really good and light. \n\nthen there was our awesome waiter, mike, that was super attentive and friendly towards us. he made small talk, he helped us a lot with the menu, and i simply befriended him(i wasn't even drunk). so the extra star is for our waiter who made me enjoy my time at border grill a lot more. \n\nthere it is people...i recommend giving it a try especially if you're not down to wait 2 hours for a damn buffet.",

            "border grill overlooks the mandalay pools and is much better for drinks during the day than dinner at night. granted, some of my biases are not the fault of the restaurant. such as:\n\n1. due to the economy, mandalay in general and bg specifically were a ghost town this past friday. it was kinda depressing.\n\n2. i prefer mexican restaurants that are rundown, that serves you margaritas by the pitcher.\n\nhowever there are faults with the service and food of the actual restaurant:\n\n1. we ordered the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>. never got it.\n2. i asked for my margarita without salt. it of course came with salt.\n3. my scallops were very sour.", 
            "this is one of the newer restaurants in the mandalay bay.   i guess you could call it upscale mexican cuisine.    we started of with some cocktails, i had a margarita and my wife had a black cherry mojito, both were great.   we also got the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>, which is like mexican fondue with chorizo, and it was delicious.   had we only come in for drinks and apps i would probably be giving 5 stars.  but we stayed and ate dinner.\n\non the servers advice, i had the smoked beef taquitos, they were okay, but they certainly were not $23 taquitos.   my wife ordered the fish tacos with crispy fish, they brought it with grilled fish, no biggie as my wife likes both.  this grilled fish however, was very bland.  you could taste char and little else.  the fish wasn't necessarily burnt, just flavorless so the little char that was there from the grill marks was overwhelming.  we asked for some extra hot salsa and it never showed up. \n\n$140 later, we realized that we should have stuck to drinks and apps.", 
            "first, off i don't understand the negative reviews this place gets.  i loved it for lunch!  \n\nwe sat outside on the patio and it was nice to watch folks at the pool and enjoying the scene of the great beach and pool area mandalay bay has.\n\nfood wise i really liked it.  i'll be first to say i have no clue what real mexican food is so i can't say if this even comes close.  however, walking into it i knew it would be different than the mexican we have in atlanta.\n\nwe started out with <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> and it was good.  very much different than the queso i'm use to.  but, good none the less.  also, got pomegranate halibut ceviche.  ok this was to die for.  i loved the flavor the ceviche had.  as for lunch i had <mark>Steak Nachos</mark> and they were very good and filling.  again everything was very different than i'm use to but, very good if you know this ahead of going.\n\nwe got ceviche, queso, 2 nachos, cochinita pibil, chicken adobo quesadilla, and a few drinks we split the tab and each of us paid $37.63 with tip included.", 
            "i had lunch there on february 13, 2010 and was left extremely dissapointing.\n\ni have watched the two hot tamales cook for almost 15 years.  when i heard they had a restaurant at the mandalay bay, i was excited to finally taste their food.  my reservation was made 1 month ahead.\n\nwhen i arrived there i was not impressed by the restaurant, however i was there for the food, so my husband and i ordered the queso fundillo, i had the enchiladas poblanas and my husband had the carnitas, plus we each had a beer.   we thought it was a bit pricey, however a few months ago we went to fronteras grill in chicago, the restaurant that belongs to rick bayless and there we spent over $140 for the 2 of us and it was one of the best meals i have ever had.  so when i saw the similar prices, i was excited.  when we got the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>, i must say it was just ok.  then we received our entrees.  what a dissapointment.  my enchiladas were bland, small for the $20 price tag, no side dishes, just 3 very skinny enchiladas.  my husband's $23 carnitas were ordinary, again no side dishes, just the meat with 1 flour tortilla.  my husband said to me, now we don't have to visit ciudad, their la restaurant, this food sucks.  this restaurant is not in the same level as fronteras grill in chicago, or even bobby flay.  i can honestly say, very dissapointing 2 hot tamales, you dropped the ball and you lost a 15 year fan.  i even have their cookbooks, what a dissapointment.  for those of you looking for somewhere good to eat in vegas, there are so many great restaurant, including fleur de lys, also located at the mandalay bay, don't waste a great meal opportunity here.",

            "ah ah ah ah amazinggg! service was great. the server was very knowledgeable. had the kobe <mark>Wagyu Beef Tacos</mark>...ummm *droool*. they were amazing. the flavor of the meat alone was exceptional. the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> which is mexican cheeses * chorizo * roasted peppers was soooo good. i could of just ate that for my meal and been satisfied. the alcoholic drinks were a little light on the alcohol but still had great flavor. i recommend the skinny pink lemonade cocktail. (comes in tall glass). come again ? why yes ..yes i will .", 
            "i've been here 3 times and each time i enjoyed the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>.  if you don't speak spanish, i'll translate: \nqueso means 'cheese' and fundido means 'to salt the living shiitt out of'.  expect to be thirsty for at least a week afterwards.  \n\nthe rest of the menu is mainly ok, but not great.  the staff tends to chat with themselves about their family while ignoring you, but once i had a bartender who supplied me with many types of cocktails while taking the time to explain what was in each one.", 
            "border grill - mandalay bay\n\nour last night in las vegas, we decided to take a stroll over to mandalay bay and have dinner at border grill. this place was highly recommended on the gluten free sites and showed on their website to have a dedicated gluten free menu, so needless to say i was pumped to check it out. \n\nthe hostess was not very friendly. i gotta say that i am a stickler for happy, positive employees because they are the face of your business and crucial to customer satisfaction. \n\ni was pleased to see such a large gluten free menu until i opened it and realized 2 of the pages were filled with alcohol choices. \n\nwe decided to try the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>, which they brought out with corn tortillas and the chips are gluten free there. the dip was pretty tasty for sure but it didn't knock my socks off. \n\nour waiter was aware of celiac disease and gluten free preparations so that made me feel at ease too during our time there. \n\ni ordered a shrimp and rice which came out on a plate filled with rice and then a strip of shrimp down the middle. the rice was in a pool of liquids making it a bit soggy. i have to say that i can't stand wet rice so i just ate the rice off the top and picked at the shrimp. the dish was disappointing and i didn't leave there feeling like i had an amazing gluten free dish coming from somewhere that specifically has a gluten free menu. the cost of my 10 small shrimp and rice was also $28 which i found to be completely out of line for the quality of the dish. \n\nnow, had that dish come out and completely wowed me, i wouldn't blink at spending $28 on vacation in las vegas for dinner. it just didn't do it for me so i can tell you i won't likely go back on my trip to las vegas next year. \n\ni would recommend border grill because they are educated and understand gluten free meals but i'm not sure it would be my first pick for someone. it's the safe choice.", 
            "this place has a variety of mexican/tex mex as well as latin food and i only say latin because i had the torta cubana but for the most part the menu has to offer more mexican dishes than anything else. it is located at the mandalay bay hotel. all of our dishes taste wonderful, i really enjoyed each and every one of them. they start you off with chips and 3 different types of salsa. we then had a plate of fresh fruit drizzled with honey, empanadas were also good. next we had the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> topped with  chorizo and a side of  flour tortillas. i also had the <mark>Tortilla Soup</mark> and it was delish!. our main dish torta cubana and pulled pork followed by dessert, flan. i highly highly recommend this place. service is very good.", 
            "update: this time around i wasn't too impressed. service was bit slow though it didn't seem that busy. my skinny lemonade tasted like a sugar cane with a drop of alcohol. the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> wasn't as good as i remember and i had the beef <mark>Brisket Taquitos</mark> which weren't much to rave about either.", 
            "border grill is great!  we were at mandalay for a concert and wanted to grab something to eat beforehand.  i'm so glad we picked this place to eat.  when we walked up, it looked very busy and no open seats.  we asked how long the wait was and the hostess told us there was seating downstairs at the bar and also on the patio!  \n\nsince we didn't know what to order, our waiter/bartender recommended the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>!  it was so delicious.  with the chorizo added in, it had a great unique flavor.  i think we would have licked the bowl if it wasn't frowned upon. \n\nhe also recommended the border classic which had 2 of three appetizers.  this was perfect for us.  tomales, chicken tacos and empanadas.  yum!  \n\nif you are here for an event or just a fun night, definitely stop in!  great service and great food!", 
            "the service is good and the food has good flavor.  the cost is holding them back.  the food is priced too high for what you get.  the value is not there because the portions are small for the price.\n\ni started with the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>.  it has good flavor.  as an appetizer about three people could share this.\n\ni then had the crispy potato <mark>Crispy Rajas Tacos</mark>.  they were quite tasty.  once again the portion is the problem.  you get so little for your money.\n\nour servers were friendly and helpful.", 
            "we had dinner here, we eat out a lot and i have to say by far we received the best service we have ever had at any restaurant.  rachel started us off and crystal took over, both were incredibly personal, attentive and very knowledgable.  the food was outstanding, flavorful, hot and large portions.  if you like grits, you must try the tecate carnita's.  there were six of us so we ordered quite a few dishes...the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> was very good and any dish with the short ribs i highly recommend!  i could go on about this place, but i think you get the picture. we will definitely be back.  it's located at mandalay bay.", 
            "we had dinner at border grill on a saturday night.  the place was about 2/3 full, but the patio, where we ate, was completely full.  it was a nice cool evening, and they had the heaters on.  we were directly underneath them, and i actually found myself a little warm.  not uncomfortably so, but i definitely was noticing the heat. \n\nthat wasn't an issue however; i clearly enjoyed the meal.  to start, you are brought 3 different salsas and chips.  of these, the green was my favorite, although i liked both red salsas as well.  our table of 5 decided to get the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> to start, and 2 of them got guacamole.  the guacamole was good, certainly fresh.  it could have used some heat for my taste.  the queso was fantastic.  made with chorizo, it got crispy on the bottom where the cheese melted against the hot metal bowl.  i seriously considered ordering another serving of this, it was that good.  crispy, melty, a little salty from the sausage.  just a fantastic cheese dish.  \n\nthe meal only got better from there.  the wife had the <mark>Short Rib Enchiladas</mark>, which were great.  loved the sauce, and they were covered with a ton of veggies.  but, the showstopper was my meal:  the <mark>Gaucho Steak</mark>.  this is a large ribeye (cooked to a textbook medium rare, by the way) on top of a huge bed of maybe the best chilaquiles i've ever eaten and served with a roasted onion half and roasted garlic.  if ever a dish was composed well, this is that dish.  all of this stuff went together fantastically well, you could get a perfect bite with all 4 components.  the chilaquiles were soaked in sauce and served with what appeared to be 2 different types of cheese.  the garlic and onion were roasted long enough to become sweet, flavorful and soft, but not so long that they were burnt in anyway.  \n\ni've been to many of the best steakhouses in vegas.  while the <mark>Gaucho Steak</mark> isn't going to make me forget the reserve ribeye at carnevino, it certainly is one of the more memorable steaks i've had on the strip.  can't recommend this enough if you are a beef person.\n\nfor dessert, the table had the tres leches cake and the chocolate cake (can't remember the exact menu title).  both were good, but i found the chocolate cake to be far superior.\n\nservice was good, they leave a carafe of water on your table, which was nice.  and, when that was empty, they brought a replacement very quickly.  we'll definitely return, and i 100% will order the <mark>Gaucho Steak</mark> next time.", 
            "my last visit here was a wonderful experience.  the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> was again delicious, though the tortilla was as hot and greasy as al pacino on his prom night. \n\nthe mixed drinks were decent, and the bartender was willing to alter a few ingredients to my taste.  i am not a fan of agave.  \n\ni decided to try the <mark>Oaxacan Strip Steak</mark>.  magnificent.  the steak was soft and tasty, almost like a rib eye.  the mole sauce was as complex and flavorful as any i tried in mexico.  wow!\n\ndespite the high price, i will return here everytime i am in vegas, and never try any new dish.  i'll keep experimenting with their drinks, however.  as for their desserts.... i'll never know because i am always stuffed before the main course is done.", 
            "we almost always eat here when we are attending an event at the mandalay bay event center. \n\nthe food is generally delicious no matter what you try.  the complimentary chips and salsa are great.  we also ordered the <mark>Baja Ceviche</mark> and the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> as our starters   the ceviche is outstanding and quite large. you could definitely order this as your entr\\u00e9e.  the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark>, which is a cheese dip with shredded beef, was also really good.  surprisingly, it was not as greasy as i expected it to be which was a total plus! \n\ni had the saut\\u00e9ed <mark>Sauted Shrimp and Scallops</mark>.  the scallops were perfectly cooked and had an excellent texture.  they were not at all rubbery.  the broth that the scallops and shrimp were in was very good and the added rice completed the plate.  my husband always orders the <mark>Chick<mark>Pork En Mole</mark> Verde</mark> and he loves the peruvian corn that accompanies it.  \n\ni was very underwhelmed by dessert which is my favorite course. we ordered the pineapple upside down cake which was dry and the banana cream pie.  the banana cream pie was highly recommended by our waiter which was shocking because it was completely tasteless.\n\nthe service at border grill can be hit or miss and the service last night was definitely a miss.  at the bar, i ordered a sangria margarita.  this drink is so good, but i order it with sugar on the rim in lieu of salt (salted rims are really gross to me).  the drink came with the a salted rim.  i am not one to send something back so i just wiped the salt off and moved along.  at the table the second drink i ordered was also incorrect.  our waiter kind of lacked personality. i asked him if he knew where their new 2nd las vegas location was opening. he explained he \"wasn't moving there so he didn't know.\" and seemed visibly annoyed when i asked him if he could ask another server for me. then he never answered the question. \n\ndespite this review, based solely on my experience last night, i would still recommend this spot.  we've had better meals here on other nights and i will definitely update my review the next time we go.",

(because the best thing to do when very drunk is keep drinking, of course. well...at least in vegas) only complaint was that it was so thick that i couldn't even get it through the straw! had to wait til it melted a bit, and even then, was still difficult to get. for appetizers we started with chips, salsa, and guacamole. all items were so fresh and the chips were salty and delicious. we ordered some <mark>Quinoa Fritters</mark> which were amazing and definitely unique! quinoa and cheese deep friend in batter...heavenly. that's what i love about this place, they make healthy eating fun, by dipping the healthy food in melted cheese and then deep frying it. ordered <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> which was perfection and probably the best i have ever had. sooooo creamy, cheesy, and flavorful. it was a bowl of melted cheese sauce with a crunchy layer of cheese on top, which is the best idea in humanity's history. afterwards, got a steak quesadilla which was perfect. the most flavorful steak i have ever had in a quesadilla. even the next morning it was to die for. i'm happy that even though i was drunk when i met this quesadilla and took its leftovers home, when i woke up the next morning and it was still delicious, i was able to say i took home a \"10\" the night before. i feel like this is one of those places you never hear people talk about, but i do...all of the time. go! the hype is real!", 
            "went for a girls long weekend and stayed at luxor, so, this was a perfect place to go within decent walking distance.  one of the girls in our party is gluten free, and they offer several gf options which, also includes their chips (which are ridiculously delicious).  their prices are similar to a decent mexican restaurant in bos which, was great.  i am not big on mexican food, at all.  i strip what everyone loves out of the meals and eat basically the protein, the carb and the cheese, i love the flavors.  with that said, the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> is ah-mazzzz-ing.  this is a must try!  i ordered the <mark>Carne Asada Quesadilla</mark> with only the carne and the cheese (no onions, guac, salsa, etc.).  this can be shared with someone else, the portion is huge.  it is cut into 6 slices, in fact, i took half of it to go.  actually, this went for all of our meals, so, try to share what you can to avoid leftovers, especially if you do not have a micro in your hotel.  this is in no way a negative criticism, for $19, it is the perfect size.  the drinks were great, i did the cadillac margarita, it was so good, i had to try it twice.. = ) \n\nour waiter was michael, he was attentive, and very knowledgeable and considerate to my friends gluten free allergy.  in fact, i put the flour tortilla from the queso on top of the chips and he has pointed out that i \"contaminated\" the chips (jokingly of course..) and brought her \"her own chips that no one else should touch\".  he was very witty and made us laugh.  if you love mexican, give this place a whirl.  we sat on the covered patio and it was breathtaking.",

            "we came here for lunch and used a restaurant.com coupon.  with the coupon, the prices seemed ok, but the menu prices are high for the quality of the food.  i live in california, where we have access to tons of mexican and \"mexican,\" so perhaps that colored my opinion.  \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Quinoa Fritters</mark>, which were a little oily but had a great flavor.  my husband and i split an order of three tacos and sides (you can mix from the tacos listed on the menu, which was a nice way to sample more).  we had the avocado (ok, kind of dry), the carnitas (pretty good, not exceptional), and the chicken panucho (extremely oily, no real flavor).  this came with beans and rice (red and green), which were ok.  this was easily enough for the two of us to share.  \n\nour dining companions ordered the three tacos (shrimp and <mark>Yucatan Pork</mark> were both deemed \"good,\" can't remember the third) and the <mark>Border Classics</mark> (chicken panuchos and some tamales and empanadas), which was also \"good.\"  \n\nthere is a .50 charge for water, which i thought was odd; it included still or sparkling water.   service was very good.", 
            "i've been to the border grill in santa monica several times so i was stoked that there was one in the hotel we were staying (mandalay bay).  \n\nwe wanted to find a particular restaurant that is by the mandalay beach but couldn't find it.  we saw the border grill straight ahead so we went there instead.  \n\nwe got seated right away and our waitress was very bubbly and attentive.  they bring you chips and three different salsas while you wait for your meal.  they are all different and good.  we ate all the salsa so our waitress brought us another tray. i ordered the thing that i always order: the <mark>Border Classics</mark> (<mark>Plantain Empanadas</mark>, <mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark> and paunches)...i get this because it's a bit of everything.  \n\n<mark>Plantain Empanadas</mark>: outside of the empanada is made of plantain, not flour dough.  they are filled with black beans and topped with cojita cheese.  so savory and delicious, yet so healthy!! \n<mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark>: creamy sweet corn crapped in banana (?) leaves.  sweet/dessert-like.  reminds me of that sweet corn dessert that they have at el torito. my favorite mexican dessert!! \npanuchos: chicken on a thick homemade, fried tortilla.  good, but not my fav. \n\nmy bf got the <mark>Carne Asada Quesadilla</mark>: <mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark>, carmelized onions, arbol salsa, cojita, manchego and panela cheese.  this is a quesadilla on steroids...very scrumptious.  if you're in the mood for a quessadilla, this will hit the spot. \n\nthe other things i've tried at the santa monica location are the ceviche and the jalape\\u00f1o cucumber margarita.  i love both of them and highly recommend them to first timers!", 
            "for nye dinner in vegas, i chose border grill because, after seeing susan feniger on top chef, i have always wanted to try her cooking. border grill definitely lived up to my expectations. the restaurant is located in mandalay bay and is very nice. it's dark inside and the walls are covered in interesting modern art. the food was delicious! while the menu had a wide variety of choices included kobe <mark>Wagyu Beef Tacos</mark> with a pineapple salsa and duck nachos (!), i chose the <mark>Border Classics</mark>, which is an appetizer but can easily fill you up. the appetizer included chicken panuchos, <mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark> and <mark>Plantain Empanadas</mark>. this was a great choice. the chicken panuchos were small but delivered a powerful spice. the <mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark> were sweet and i couldn't get enough of them, the texture was unbelievable. as for the empanadas, my god, they were absolutely fantastic. the combination of the sweetness of the plantains and the cotija cheese was wonderful. i enjoyed my dinner with the cucumber cooler, which is a mojito with a cucumber twist. delicious and refreshing! after coming here, i can confidently say that i'd love to go back to border grill again and again, i'm glad there are a few near where i live!", 
            "border grill is an oasis of calm amidst the hustle and bustle of mandalay bay. in need of a gluten free lunch during the awea windpower conference, i found this charming spot near the convention center, grabbed a seat at the bar, and proceeded to relax and let the excellent staff take care of me for the next hour.\n\nalmost everything on the menu is or can be made gluten free. the chips and salsa are a nice way to start your meal, and i washed them down with a hand-muddled traditional mojito. delicious!\n\nthe bartender recommended the <mark>Border Classics</mark> for my meal. this tasty sampler plate is a good way to try a little of the mexican-inspired menu. you get two chicken tacos, two <mark>Plantain Empanadas</mark>, and two <mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark>. i enjoyed every single bite. highly recommended, even if you don't have a gluten allergy.",

            "susan and mary sue did not wow us.\n\nmy wife and i were looking for a place for a light bite for dinner and decided to try this place. we shared the kobe <mark>Wagyu Beef Sopes</mark>, watercress salad and <mark>Tecate Carnitas</mark>. we told the waiter that we had a late buffet lunch and will order a few dishes to share. he seems to be very concern that we did not order enough food and kept asking if we want to order more. this made us felt uncomfortable.\n\nfirst to come was the kobe <mark>Wagyu Beef Sopes</mark>. it was tiny piece of beef wrapped in two quarter size corn masa topped with mango red cabbage mint slaw. the slaw was well seasoned and very tasty. however, i can really taste much of the beef since it was so small.\n\nnext, we had the watercrest, jaicama and orange salad. the salad was topped with 4 little bacon wrapped dates stuffed with chorizo and blue cheese. the salad was very ordinary and the bacon wrapped dates were salty.\n\nlastly, we had the <mark>Tecate Carnitas</mark>. they gave us a good portion of the carnitas for this dish. however, the taste and quality of the roast pork is very mediocre. it is like the carnitas you get from an ordinary mexican restaurant. there was only one piece tortilla came with the dish and it was all dried and cracked. it was not something that i expected a high end restaurant would serve to its diner.\n\nwhen our bill came at the end of our meal, we found that there was $1 charge for  tap water in addition to the our  other drinks. we dinned at many fine restaurants in las vegas and never have anyone charge for tap water.", 
            "about four years ago, i had the best meal of my life at border grill. unfortunately, i wasn't a proud member of yelp at the time so it went largely unnoticed.  back then, i ordered an adobada pork chop that came with mashed potatoes and greens. the thick cut pork chop was smothered in an ancho chile sauce that makes me smile just thinking about it.  unfortunately, my wife and i didn't make it back until this past saturday night. was it a special occasion? no, not really.  however, thanks to our older daughter, we were able to get out for a date night- our second in almost 3 years. so, yeah i guess it was a special occasion -for us anyway.  \n\nso off we went hoping to recapture that memory of what we long considered to be one the best meals we have ever had the privilege of eating.  before i could sit down or even look at a menu, i yelled out adobada pork chop please!  our waiter rob apologized and said that dish was no longer available on the regular menu.  what? what do you mean? there must be some mistake!  rob told us that every now and then the dish is offered as a special-just not saturday night.  now what?\n\ninstead of walking out kicking and screaming, we decided to give the new menu a shot. i settled on the <mark>Tecate Carnitas</mark> plate, and my wife chose the kobe <mark>Wagyu Beef Sopes</mark>. my dish was presented well with the tender pork in the center of the plate surrounded by fantastic guacamole, salsa, onions, cilantro, and a crunchy slaw. since i ordered both flour and corn tortillas, i prepared my own tacos and ate till my shoes started feeling tight. the kobe <mark>Wagyu Beef Sopes</mark> were great! the portion was small (3 little sopes about the size of mini muffins), but the flavor more than made up for it. the cilantro mint slaw on top was heavenly. \n\nas far as the service is concerned, we couldn't have been more satisfied. rob was friendly, attentive, and very knowledgeable about the menu. he provided us with a 10% discount since we signed up for their rewards card a number of years ago. i am glad he asked, since i forgot we did that. border grill also treated us to a free dessert since my wife and i were on a date for the first time in years. well played border grill-well played! \n\ncall it what you want--- tex-mex, mexican food, or fresh-mex.  bottom line, this place offers quality food with complex flavors that will make you want to take your wife/husband out for more dates.  \n\noh yeah, can someone let me know when the pork chop makes it back on the menu?",

            "really delicious, fresh and filling food. a nice departure from the bland, overdone stuff that a lot of local places serve. i had <mark>Peruvian Ceviche</mark>, which (although i'm no expert) is a terrific, light and healthy dish. wife had fish tacos, also very good. minus 1 star for a little too much salt on everything. but i guess we didn't need that second basket of those yummy chips.", 
            "we ate here on a saturday night for our girls weekend in vegas. we were all very excited to see what the 2 hot tamales are all about. we had reservations and were seated promptly in the upstairs balcony. this gave us a perfect view of the train concert going on in the pool area and provided wonderful background noise. the guacamole was worth the extra money but there wasn't any spice to the salsas with the chips. if there was an alternative available it was not offered. i shared the <mark>Peruvian Ceviche</mark> and sweet <mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark> with a friend. i loved the plantain chips with the ceviche and thought it was very refreshing. the tamales had wonderful flavor but was so wet it had to be eaten with a spoon. for the entree we had the seafood <mark>Chile Relleno</mark>. the pepper was nice and crisp with a very flavorful filling. over all it was a very nice atmosphere and good service. i would definitely come back.",

            "truly a top chef master showing!\n\nour dining experience started with being promptly sat when we arrived at the podium met by the friendly hostess. we had 3 adults, 1 3 yr. old and a baby and were sat in their downstairs dining room which was our first experience in that location. couldn't of been happier. noise level was accommodating (baby didn't wake up) and our 3 yr old was entertained by the crayons and kids menu brought to the table by las vegas's most friendly most knowledgeable waitress autumn. she interacted with our 3 yr. old, remembered his name and made us feel like the center of attention throughout the meal. one of the best service staff's i've had the dining pleasure of. one thing i like to do when i dine is start off with \"what's the best thing on the menu?\" 8 out of 10 you will have the server \"push\" either the most expensive dish on the menu or the \"catch of the day\". this was not the case at all. autumn recommended we start with the <mark>Quinoa Fritters</mark> and <mark>Peruvian Ceviche</mark>. both were excellent choices and not to be missed. side note is that today's <mark>Peruvian Ceviche</mark> used \"ono\" so there was a little fishy taste, but we've had this 2x on other occasions and the flavor was on point. in regards to entrees, autumn recommended the \"chick<mark>Pork En Mole</mark>\" and the \"<mark>Pescado Veracruzano</mark>\". i had the chick<mark>Pork En Mole</mark>, which might have been the best decision i have made all month. the chicken breast was juicy, the skin crispy, the flavors completely delectable and not overly salty. a huge portion as well. buyer beware if you fill up on their delicious chips n gauc. needless to say, i'll be reheating this tomorrow. our other two diners both received the <mark>Pescado Veracruzano</mark> which is pan seared sustainable seasonal fish *tomato * kalamata olive *jalape\\u00f1o * oregano * white wine garlic broth. they were both thrilled as the olives were not overpowering and it's more of a soup. this dish's secret weapon is that it's made with a slew of jalapeno peppers, so if you don't like heat, request without. our party loves the fire, so the more the merrier. we finished with the \"tres leches\" and the \"banana cream pie\". tres leches (three milk) was super sweet and a great touch to finish the meal. i would recommend ordering a strong espresso to go with this. overall, can't wait to go back. one of the best dining experiences in a long time and with food and service like this, a true pleasure and tip of the hat to chef susan and chef mary sue.\n\nvisited march 2013", 
            "ok...i admit i was skeptical of trying this place.  celebrity chef mexican themed restaurant.   i mean....how good can food be if the concept is mexican?  i've had the best and the worst mexican around from trips to mexico and living in phoenix for 6 years and they all taste fine (it is hard to mess up).  first of all let me say, this is not traditional mexican.  this is upscale tex-mex with a side of spain.  they have the usual things you'd expect like chips & salsa, guacamole, enchiladas, taquitos and fried ice cream.  they also have things like ahi tuna ceviche, <mark>Peruvian Ceviche</mark> and brisket burritos.\n\n\ni tried a bit off everyone's plate and i must say....everything was delicious.  worth every penny.  the service was also top notch!\n\ni'd shy away from the drinks here....overly sweet and far too expensive (even for vegas)",

(btw, the service was just average...but good enough to not dock any stars)  saved the best for last right?  everything about it was perfect...the flakiness...the creaminess of the hmm...cream?  and the flavor...omg...the guava just took over my taste buds!  i've never had anything like it before...and sadly, i must go all the way back to vegas to have it again...sigh.\n\nwonderful...everything was just wonderful...i can't compare border grill to any other mexican place i've eaten at...it's just some serious gourmet mexican food that is untouchable...i can't wait to go back!!!",

            "i've got to add border grill to my list of top chef masters restaurants that disappoint. it joins a couple other spots i've had the misfortune of visiting: zentan by susur lee in washington dc and rick moonen's rm seafood room here in vegas. i've been to border grill three times now and either the quality has slipped or my expectations have risen because with each visit i leave less satisfied.\n\nwe decided to come here for a family night out -- yup, we had the kid in tow and were looking for a family-friendly spot that would make him happy and have good enough food to make us happy. they get points for having a kids menu (and they also have a gluten-free menu for anyone looking for that). unfortunately, the food didn't thrill any of us.\n\nthe <mark>Plantain Empanadas</mark> ($9) are filled with a mixture of roasted plantains, black beans, poblano peppers and cotija cheese. the sweetness of the plantains dominated the flavor of the dish. i love plantains, so that isn't necessarily a bad thing, just an observation. the empanada dough was more mushy then flaky, which was a disappointment. there are four per order, so plan to share.\n\nthe <mark>Baja Ceviche</mark> ($15) is a huge order of lime marinated halibut and shrimp sitting on a corn tortilla with slice avocado sitting on top. there was too much lime and the fish didn't taste all that fresh. this also seemed like a dish that was mass produced and was probably sitting around in those lime juices for quite some time.\n\nthe first entree to make it's way to the table was something off of their 'specials' menu. it was shrimp stuffed with crab and wrapped in bacon with some sort of cilantro pesto sauce or something (i can't remember exactly) ($26). it sounded awesome, but it turned out to be a hot mess. too much bacon, no detectable crab in or near the shrimp, and a million ingredients that over-complicated the dish.\n\nthe negro modelo braised short ribs ($29) were much better. it came with two large chunks of boneless beef atop corn polenta and a cherry tomato salsa fresca with a molasses habanero bbq sauce. the beef could have been more tender, but the flavors were pretty good with a slight bitterness from the negro modelo and sweetness from the sauce. it wasn't overly spicy. \n\nthe kids cheese quesadilla ($4) was filled with cotija cheese (i think?). fine for adults, but for a 3 yr old with developing taste buds... no. he wasn't a fan. too bad they didn't just have a cheddar/monterey jack cheese blend.\n\nour little guy did get a scoop of chocolate ice cream ($3) accompanied with fresh berries. he loved the ice cream, but is still learning to like berries.\n\nthe wife and i split the flourless chocolate cake with prickly pear lychee sauce and raspberries ($10). it was heavier/denser than we expected but still rich and chocolatey. the crust and bottom of the cake were slightly overcooked and hard.\n\nalong with mediocre food, we had spotty service. our server was friendly but very busy and disappeared often. this isn't fine dining but at the prices they charge they could step things up a bit. little things like clearing empty dishes and replacing silverware would make a big difference. the whole atmosphere was more laid back then i remember (the last time we were here was probably 2+ years ago). it almost felt like a small step up from a chevy's fresh mex or one of those type of places. they also charge fifty cents for water per person. although my son didn't get water they charged him anyway.  \n\nanother thing that was annoying was how they decided to sit people right next to us when most of the dining room was completely empty. why not space people out more?\n\nit was a pricey meal for what we got, but at least we were armed with a restaurant.com gift certificate. we also tried to use the border grill vip card, which normally gets us a 15% discount but management said they couldn't take both the gift certificate and vip card.", 
            "food was very fresh tasting and well seasoned. we really enjoyed the <mark>Baja Ceviche</mark>. i had lunch with my daughter and she didn't know what that was and our server( sarah) wad very helpful. she was very good at explaining the items on the menu. my daughter had the <mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark>, it was so delicious! i had the <mark>Yucatan Pork</mark> which was good but the steak was way better! i had a cadillac margarita that was really good! it is pricey but it is delicious! \nwe did have a dessert it was like a tres leche churro minis, it was terrible! do not order! it sounds delicious but this kind of restaurant should never let it leave the kitchen. the churro's were not crispy and the filling wasn't even in the them anymore. that was my only complaint.", 
            "i actually still have a bad taste in my mouth. ugh... there was definitely no quality control. my husband and i split an appetizer plate. the tamale and taquitos were average, but the empenada had a funky taste to it. my husband had the <mark>Baja Ceviche</mark> as his main course, it was a good ceviche. my dish was the jumbo shrimp. the shrimp were fine, nothing special, but the rice and veg served with it were so salty, it was inedible. it was this that caused the before mentioned bad taste.  we finished by splitting the pastel rufina. soggy pastry, way too thick cream and not much taste except the chocolate chips. \n\ni really wanted to like this place, i like the idea of sustainability. i like the two hot tamales. i will say our service was great, but i go out for a great meal, great service is a bonus. \n\nsigh, i hoped for much more.", 
            "i had the pleasure of sitting on the patio and it was wonderful. shaded by trees and seats were comfortable. i love the beef taquitos, the <mark>Baja Ceviche</mark> and the strawberry margarita. tres leche cake is delicious.", 
            "am a big fan of both susan and mary-sue. expected to be knocked out of my socks by these top chef masters, fell short. first the location is way off the main area, not a good idea. the restaurants is classy with a california vibe. we got the complementary chips with the 3 salsas, salsas were ok, chips were fresh! we asked for a spicy sauce and got a good kick in the butt with the habenero chillies. ordered bunch of appetizers - out of which the <mark>Baja Ceviche</mark> rocked, fresh fresh seafood. the other trio of appetizer included <mark>Plantain Empanadas</mark> (ok), corn cream tamales (too sweet) and the chicken tacos (best yet!). we also got the mexican soup, nice! all in all the food was good but not crave worthy. service was excellent with water refills, recommendations and offering of hot salsa. best part of got 15% discount for being ca natives, go california!", 
            "after checking out the shark reef, i was hungry for sushi but i felt that eating sushi after gazing at aquatic animals for the past 2 hours would of been morally wrong.  \n\nokay, on to the review.  first of all, i'd like to say i love guacamole.  i put it on everything.  undercooked chicken?  guacamole.  overcooked rib eye?  guacamole.  guacamole fixes everything and makes it magically delicious.  with that said, i did not eat the guacamole at border grill but i did see someone who sat diagonally across from my girlfriend and i who was gettin down on some guacamole.  i was jealous.  instead, i satified my palatte by slamming 2 strawberry margaritas back to back and some <mark>Baja Ceviche</mark>.  the <mark>Baja Ceviche</mark> was awesome, the seasonal fish and cilantro ailoli gave it a nice flavor!  unique to any other ceviche i've tried in the past.  highly suggest it.  i finished my meal with a trip to the dessert menu where i got the pastel rufina.  the description says, \"layers of puff pastery, sweetened cream cheese, chocolate chunks, and fresh berries\".  so i'm thinking this is gonna be some mini dessert.  well, it turns out, this dessert is massive.  but luckily, i have a bottomless stomach so i destroyed it without much struggle.  kudos to our server, she was very helpful and knowledgeble of the menu.  she also looked like a girl i've seen on naughtyamerica ....but that's a whole different review.", 
            "i love unique flavor combinations that are not overpowering.  most of the dishes have a unique ingredient that gives it a new twist, without taking over the traditional base.  my favorite dish by far here is the <mark>Baja Ceviche</mark>.  it inspires me to make my own ceviche at home every time i have it.   a delicate blend of fish, shrimp, red onions, tomato, avocado and a fresh cilantro sauce drizzled over.   \n\nmy other favorites from prior visits are the empanadas and the sweet green mini tamales.  last night i had the <mark>Chicken Poblano Enchiladas</mark>.  let me say i have been craving green enchiladas for about 6 months.  i loved the chicken filling and loved the addition of thinly sliced portobello mushrooms, corn, nopal and poblano on top,  but there was way too much green sauce, drowning some of the awesome flavors.  would have been much better with a drizzling of the green sauce and the addition of some melted white cheese.  after all it can't be great enchiladas without lots of cheese.   \n\nmy husband had the carnitas,  which were delicious.  again unique ingredients added a twist,  bacon, citrus and a bed of polenta underneath.  his flour tortilla was the yummy authentic type.  \n\nmy other favorite last night was the cabo rita, mmmmmm,  pear puree in a  margarita made with fresh lime juice and agave,  versus sweet and sour and triple sec.   one of the best margaritas i've ever had.  \n\nsadly the service sucked.  our waitress never once came to check on us.  we had to wave her,  or the busboy down every time we needed something.  it even took 20 minutes just to get and process the check and we had to ask 3 times to move it along.   also, sadly, when we made the reservation, they promised a pool view booth which was not available when we got there.  there was a front pool view table, which we said we would take, but it was \"reserved\"  to make a big table for a future reservation.   when we left, it was occupied by another couple, not  a big table.   being lied to doesn't make the guest feel appreciated. \n\nhad it not been for the service and the over abundance of green sauce, and the slight overprices,  i would rate 5 stars. the awesomeness of the ceviche and the margarita, raise it from 3 stars to 4.  \n\nif you like unique tastes,  i would still recommend.   \n\nthe night was capped beautifully by a fun shopping excursion at my stores, misura, paradiso and ruby blue near the valet entrance!",

            "delicious!\n\nthis was my first time at this restaurant and the hype from my friends was certainly legitimate. i've never been to any of the ones in los angeles, but supposedly (according to my fellow yelper, cori g.) the vegas one is far superior. \n\nwe came here for lunch after driving all day and i had peeked at the menu ahead of time so i was already prepared to order the <mark>Baja Ceviche</mark>. the waiter then informed me that if i wanted, i could order all three or mix two different ones together which was intriguing. i opted for just the one but i think next time i will have to try all three because i was totally blown away by the baja one. it was bright and acidic with lots of onion and delicious tender chunks of fish and shrimp. my mouth is watering right now just thinking about those tart, tangy flavors with just a little bit of spice from the jalapeno. yum!\n\nwe had also ordered the guacamole and a couple plates of the <mark>Crispy Rajas Tacos</mark> and both were equally delicious. the guacamole could have been a lot bigger in my opinion but it did the trick, and the tacos were a very unique appetizer. they were simple, crispy potato tacos accentuated by the salty cotija cheese and the sweet roasted corn. all the flavors came together very nicely in this dish, but it's a shame that you only get two for $10!\n\nof course, the prices here are pretty high but i was expecting that for a restaurant inside the mandalay bay. overall, i would definitely recommend this place to anyone in the area that doesn't mind splurging a little on a meal. i am also really interested in trying the los angeles chains, and hopefully they are equally as good.",

            "3.5 stars\n\ngood food, but kinda pricey. we went to border grill randomly since we were staying at the mandalay bay and wanted to grab a quick dinner. it honestly reminds me of el torito grill or any other mexican restaurant that's on the fancier end. we went on a sunday night around 7pm and found it decently full, but with no wait. keep in mind this was labor day weekend too. we weren't looking for a full-on meal and most of their dishes were $20+ so we ended up ordering the <mark>Baja Ceviche</mark> ($15) and the <mark>Carne Asada Quesadilla</mark> ($19). both were tasty, but a little too pricey for what you're getting, which is not much, in my opinion. i know it's vegas and it's a very nice restaurant so i can't really blame them, but i doubt i will return. it's just mexican food. i can get both dishes for cheaper and tastier elsewhere.\n\nthe two highlights were the complimentary chips and salsa (they give you 3 different sauces) and the service. our waiter was nice enough to even pack our leftover chips and salsa, which was awesome. not really a must if i'm ever in vegas again, but border grill is good and would make a nice date place so it's a solid 3.5 stars in my book."

            "if it were possible to award an eatery a negative value of stars, i would most certainly have given border grill a negative 10. \n\ni arrived in the company of four other people, in the late afternoon after going to the aquarium exhibit. we were all very hungry, and excited to get some mexican food. we're from texas, and thought it would be interesting to see how a top chef's award-winning mexican food would measure up to the stellar tex-mex food to which we are accustomed. \n\nupon arrival, the hostess was cheery enough, if a bit of an airhead. after being seated, we waited a full five minutes before even being greeted by a server. following a perfunctory greeting, we were brought chips and salsa (both lackluster and bland) and had to wait another 5 minutes for water. the waiter was nice enough, but seemed to be mostly unconcerned with giving us good service, or making a decent impression.\n\nthe menu itself was rather pricey. if you're at a place that charges $ 4.50 for a fish taco a la carte (with a tortilla the size of a drink coaster and an even smaller filet of mahi mahi), you know you won't be able to leave the restaurant without paying upwards of $ 25.00 per person/ per dish. the food is billed as \"mexican\", but there were no true mexican dishes on the menu. everything seemed to be more central/ south american.\n\nlet me preface my actual food review by saying that we waited a grand total of 35 minutes for our food to arrive. i was to the point of trying to eat our waiter, who had already conveniently disappeared. \n\ni ordered the <mark>Chile Relleno</mark> burger, with paprika seasoned fries, and a fish taco a la carte. i asked for the burger rare, because 1) it cuts down on cooking time and i was ravenous, and 2) i simply cannot stand an overcooked, rubbery meat patty. \nthe other members of my party ordered 1) crab nachos 2) beef nachos 3) avocado tacos 4) chicken <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>. \n1) the crab nachos were adequate. for a self-proclaimed \"grill\" specializing in seafood, the meat was rather bland and tasteless, and were downplayed by the plethora of toppings heaped upon the actual chip.\n2)the beef nachos were already limp when they arrived at the table. the meat was wholly bland, and the kitchen chose to under-employ cheese, making the overall nacho rather boring.\n3) the avocado tacos were a great disappointment. as said by the consumer of the food, the idea of the avocado tacos was excellent, but the actual execution of the taco was underwhelming. \n4) the chicken <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> was probably the worst thing served. you might be questioning how in the world a kitchen can mess up that which is essentially chopped greens and a simple meat fillet. well, when your \"caesar dressing\" is the taste and consistency of mayonnaise, and is literally drenching the salad, you tend to look unfavorably upon the dish. \n5) my <mark>Chile Relleno</mark> burger was probably the best thing served. the burger was cooked to my standard, and the <mark>Chile Relleno</mark> itself was decent, if a bit bland. the fries were the only really yummy thing served, and i'm not sure that's something a mexican restaurant should be proud of. \n6)the fish taco was terrible. the corn tortilla (while \"homemade\") was bland and too thick, and the filet of mahi mahi was too thick, overcooked, and bland. the guacamole tasted like something you could get at the grocery store, and was heavily salted. \n\nthe overall really shocking thing to me was the lack of seasoning. the chefs behind the menu are award-winning and famed, but don't know how to use simple seasoning on their food to make it palatable. \n\nthe bill wound up being over $ 150.00 (when the checkbook finally made it to the table), and we paid up, left a tip, and got the hell out of there. i wound up with gastrointestinal issues later on that night. if you're looking for good mexican food, i highly suggest going elsewhere. to give you an idea of how deeply disappointing this food was, i would suggest going to taco bell instead. at least there, you're only paying $.99 for a taco, and the diarrhea is cheaper.", 
            "met my colleagues for lunch here after my flight. i love the outside seating, and i will say this was some of the nicest service i've ever experienced. from the host to the waitress, everyone was phenomenal. \n\nwas a little concerned about gluten cross contamination, so i had the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> without croutons. this is my old standby, and it was delicious! everything had a nice presentation as well.", 
            "i want to give this place more stars but just found the place ok.  my wife did love her chicken <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>...but how hard is that kind of dish?  i had three different kinds of tacos (the waitress suggested this when i could not decided).  i was really looking forward to this but nothing about the dish made me say wow.  i think i enjoyed the tacos at tacos el gordo more for much cheaper of a price.  the best part of our meal was our appetizer of <mark>Plantain Empanadas</mark>...yummmm...that i could eat every day for sure.", 
            "we visited border grill this past week while in las vegas for a quick family getaway.  we were there for dinner on a thursday night, we had reservations. we have two teenage kids and found it odd instead of seating us in the main dining room, (with several empty tables) we were escorted down a flight of stairs to a large room.  there was a large party, as well as another family with one child.  perhaps this is reserved for families?  not sure.  we were seated in a corner, so not the best seating.  the hostess handed our teenage kids crayons and paper.  kids were amused, but found it odd.  as far as the food, my husband enjoyed his <mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark>.  it was over-priced, but expected.  i ordered a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> and the <mark>Plantain Empanadas</mark>.  the salad was stale, and mostly croutons.  also stale.  the empanadas were good, but not great.  i think my son had the best meal.  he raved about the fresh tortillas with his burrito.  service was also subpar.  never saw the server.  tried to find her at one point so we could get a refill on our tea.  we had a great experience (food & service) a few years back at border grill, this is why we returned.  after this experience, i do not think we will return.", 
            "i was surprised at how much i enjoyed border grill because i wasn't a fan after trying their restaurant in los angeles.\n\ni thought the outside patio would be a nice comfortable setting for a casual business meeting. while i was waiting for the others to arrive i ordered a lemonade and was brought tortilla chips with three different salsas. the tortilla chips were crisp and tasted like they had just been fried even though there was no visible sign of grease. i also enjoyed the freshly squeezed strawberry lemonade which had a balanced flavor. i ordered the house  guacamole, <mark>Tortilla Soup</mark>, and a chicken <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>. both the house guacamole and the chicken <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> were executed well. the guacamole was seasoned well and the avocado had a lot of natural flavor. the chicken in the salad was grilled to perfection and the caesar dressing was just right on the anchovy. i wasn't as thrilled with the <mark>Tortilla Soup</mark>. the tomato broth was a little thick, it had big chunks of unmelted cheese, and it didn't come out hot. \n\nour waitress, helped us out with a discount for locals and told us about the sunday brunch where you get unlimited plates. i like the concept of all you can eat plates because the quality of the food is normally better, you don't have to hassle with other people, and it's more sanitary. i will be back eventually to try brunch."

            "spectacular place for private dining! we came here in january to celebrate my husband's 30th birthday.  because we were a party of 25, i reserved a private room and worked with the event coordinator on a pre-set menu.  that in itself was a lovely experience.  the event coordinator was infinitely patient with my constant additions to and subtractions from the number of the party and happily accommodated one of my guests, who was battling morning sickness and could only eat certain foods, by letting me order a special entree for her that was not on our pre-set menu, at no extra charge. \n\nthe coordinator's nearly-angelic patience extended to the staff.  no one even blinked an eye or cracked a frown when 90% of our dinner party showed up almost an hour late for our reservation!  and the food was absolutely spectacular!  the chips came out crackling hot and the green salsa was so fresh that i could swear i caught a whiff of the grass from the field where the vegetables were grown! (presuming, that is, that vegetables for salsa are grown in a field, which they are probably not, but i digress...)  our starter was a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, which was really really flavorful.  we had a selection of three main courses - the <mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark>, the <mark>Chicken Poblano Enchiladas</mark> and the chille relleno.  the <mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark> was juicy, tender and really well seasoned.  the enchiladas had a delicious spicy sauce.  i didn't try the chille relleno, but it looked great.  for dessert, we had fresh berries with mint and whipped cream, which came in cute little yummy edible baskets.   i also highly recommend the house-made peach lemonade.  \n\noverall, an absolutely fantastic experience - highly, highly recommend!",

            "as most everyone has mentioned, me and my family came here because of the \"top chef masters\" influence.  we came in and were immediately seated and treated to delicious chips and salsa.  did i mention that all of the three salsa's had a smokey flavor to them? yum!  \n\nthe waiter we had was a bit arrogant or was trying to pull off the \"we're a high class restaurant\" vibe.  oh well, he turned out to be a great asset and offered many suggestions.  i always appreciate when someone tells me what i should or should not order. \n\nwe also ordered the guacamole which was so good.  it came with a little salad with some sort of juice (lime). i appreciate when restaurants offer their own spin on a classic dish.  in regards to dinner, i ordered the <mark>Chicken Poblano Enchiladas</mark>. they were amazing.  the tortillas were wrapped around the meat so tight which is cool. (i can never get my tortillas to do that at home -- amateur chef that i am).  the green sauce was great and was almost sweet but in a good way.  my one complaint is that there was so much sauce that i couldn't enjoy it without some chips.  no one had refilled our chips and looking back i should have asked for more. \n\nall around, a great experience and a place i would come back too when i am in vegas next.",

            "i love unique flavor combinations that are not overpowering.  most of the dishes have a unique ingredient that gives it a new twist, without taking over the traditional base.  my favorite dish by far here is the <mark>Baja Ceviche</mark>.  it inspires me to make my own ceviche at home every time i have it.   a delicate blend of fish, shrimp, red onions, tomato, avocado and a fresh cilantro sauce drizzled over.   \n\nmy other favorites from prior visits are the empanadas and the sweet green mini tamales.  last night i had the <mark>Chicken Poblano Enchiladas</mark>.  let me say i have been craving green enchiladas for about 6 months.  i loved the chicken filling and loved the addition of thinly sliced portobello mushrooms, corn, nopal and poblano on top,  but there was way too much green sauce, drowning some of the awesome flavors.  would have been much better with a drizzling of the green sauce and the addition of some melted white cheese.  after all it can't be great enchiladas without lots of cheese.   \n\nmy husband had the carnitas,  which were delicious.  again unique ingredients added a twist,  bacon, citrus and a bed of polenta underneath.  his flour tortilla was the yummy authentic type.  \n\nmy other favorite last night was the cabo rita, mmmmmm,  pear puree in a  margarita made with fresh lime juice and agave,  versus sweet and sour and triple sec.   one of the best margaritas i've ever had.  \n\nsadly the service sucked.  our waitress never once came to check on us.  we had to wave her,  or the busboy down every time we needed something.  it even took 20 minutes just to get and process the check and we had to ask 3 times to move it along.   also, sadly, when we made the reservation, they promised a pool view booth which was not available when we got there.  there was a front pool view table, which we said we would take, but it was \"reserved\"  to make a big table for a future reservation.   when we left, it was occupied by another couple, not  a big table.   being lied to doesn't make the guest feel appreciated. \n\nhad it not been for the service and the over abundance of green sauce, and the slight overprices,  i would rate 5 stars. the awesomeness of the ceviche and the margarita, raise it from 3 stars to 4.  \n\nif you like unique tastes,  i would still recommend.   \n\nthe night was capped beautifully by a fun shopping excursion at my stores, misura, paradiso and ruby blue near the valet entrance!", 
            "i'm really surprised at how all over the place the reviews are. makes me feel lucky they were \"on\" during our dinner, because we had a really terrific meal all around. the waiter was friendly, patient, and helpful. one person at my table was having a hard time choosing between entrees so he brought out samples of the two sauces -- that's just one example. suggesting without \"up selling\" is a talent and he had it. runners were equally friendly and helpful, etc. the only exception was the hostess, a young girl who was so apathetic and unhelpful that i'm thinking she was doing her job at gunpoint. when we left i thanked her (forgetting momentarily what a bad first impression she'd given) and she didn't even look up from her kindle, much less respond. must have been an awesome book, maybe \"how to alienate potential customers.\"\n\nmargaritas were on the light side, true, but tasty and it was 100 degrees on the patio so probably just as well they weren't loaded. one of my friends had a fresh cherry mojito that is literally the best mixed drink i've ever tasted. ingredients so fresh i momentarily rethought my hatred of rum. \n\nchips were fresh and the 3 salsas were wonderful but the guacamole wasn't a star. i don't need or expect tableside fresh guac but there was way too much lime in it, which makes me think they keep it around a while. i tasted lime rather than avocado, bad news.\n\nwe were warned portions were huge (thanks again, mr. waiter) so we skipped apps and went straight to the entrees. i had the carnitas, which had amazing flavor and were served over black beans and some kind of mashed quinoa that were like light, buttery mashed potatoes. the combo was delicious and unique. the portion was indeed enormous and i only was able to get through half of it. friends had the <mark>Chicken Poblano Enchiladas</mark> and the taquitos. the enchiladas were yummy, the closest i've had north of the border to a certain preparation i've had in mexico city. the taquitos were a little bland but only by comparison. \n\nsorry for the limited review, but we were stuffed after that! prices were high-ish, but compared to other (lesser) vegas chef joints it seemed reasonable. 3 of us left buzzed and very full for $150 including a generous tip. \n\nas i've mentioned in other reviews, i'm no world food expert, but i do know mexico mexican, so a note about \"authentic\" mexican: mexico is a huge country with many regions and styles of cooking. your local place in minnesota or san diego may be run by pueblans, campechans, or baja californians, who have their own ideas of what mexican food is, and no doubt they've changed the food to suit yanqui palettes, or just because it's more difficult to find certain ingredients. (if i hear one more californian tell me only they know what \"real\" mexican is, i'm gonna nuke the san andreas fault. the californian mexican i've tried is a very specific import from baja and border states that isn't representative of much of the country's cuisine.) i go to mexico city about 1-2 times a year and border grill is somewhat like upscale restaurants in that city, though maybe more varied (df restaurants tend to be more regional while border grill is all over the place). thus i found border grill more \"authentic\" than many places i've tried that are run by 1st-generation mexicans. just saying.", 
            "for brunch on our last day in vegas, we opted for the ayce brunch at the border grill at the mandalay. although it is an ayce brunch, the format is not that of a brunch buffet.  you can order as many tapas sized plates from the menu as you want.  the restaurant recommends ordering 3 per person.  we ended up ordering approximately 5 per person, but probably only ate 3-4 as some were misses that we didn't finish.  \n\nwhen you arrive, plates of cut fruit and guava and cheese empanadas are quickly set on the table.  simple appetizers as they are, they were some of the best things all day.  the fruits included a spear of pineapple, a few of watermelon, honeydew, and a few slices of strawberry with a passionfruit puree.  the fruit and empananadas were a great start to the meal.  the fruit was sweet and the puree was very complimentary.  i loved the light, flaky crust of the pastry and the guava jam was delicious.  \n\nthe absolute best dish of the day were the steak and eggs over a crispy potato cake.  hot steak, crispy potatoes, egg yolk, guacamole = perfection.  also good was the sweet corn tamale, which was subtley sweet with kernels of yellow corn inside and offset by the bright pico de gallo and the cool sour cream.  the shrimp and grits was also popular with its spicy sauce. \n\nsome of the other dishes didn't fare as well.  the <mark>Chicken Poblano Enchiladas</mark> and the chilaquiles were clearly pre-assembled and had been reheated but not to optimum temperature.  they were barely warm as compared to the hot seared steak and hot steamed tamale, above.  the flavor of the enchiladas were okay but it just wasn't hot enough and with the chilaquiles, the chips were totally soggy. \n\nsome dishes were just imbalanced.  the short rib hash with yams were overly sweet from the yams.  the pbj biscuit with bacon, pb & j tasted exactly what you might think it would, and the eggs benedict had a bit of clashing flavors with the <mark>Yucatan Pork</mark>, marinated red onions and hollandaise.  also, everything was served with pico de gallo and sour cream.  lovely condiments, generally, but it was tiring to see them so overused.  \n\nwe had little room for dessert so we asked for more fresh fruit and shared one order of the churro tots.  these are more like mini doughnuts rolled in cinnamon and sugar but i must admit they were nicely fried and light.  \n\nall in all, it's a good brunch concept but the food isn't perfect.   reflecting on everything we tried, it was hard to overlook the combination of the lukewarm pre-assembled food and the not quite natural assemblage of american and latin flavors.  if you were to come, stick with the steak & eggs, shrimp & grits and some of the more standard mexican fare.", 
            "got the <mark>Chicken Poblano Enchiladas</mark> and they were mushy and gross.  we also had the brunch tapas which were ok.  the whole in the wall mexican joints i go to are ten times better than this place.  not coming back.", 
            "my husband and i wanted to stay in mandalay bay for dinner before watching michael jackson one. we wanted a somewhat quick sit down dinner. border grill seemed to have the highest reviews and only $$.\n\nchips and 3 types of salsa: the chips were too salty for our liking, maybe it was just our batch?\nguacamole: amazing! worth the $9\n<mark>Plantain Empanadas</mark>: comes with 4, very delicious, not as sweet as you'd think, which i loved!\n<mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark>: a must get before your entree!\n<mark>Chicken Poblano Enchiladas</mark>: just like the chips, they were so salty. sips of water between bites were needed.\n\nif you plan to watch michael jackson one, border grill provides a dinner package with show tickets. $42/person for a first, second, third course and dessert and discounted show tickets. my husband and i weren't too hungry so we decided not to take advantage of the package. but i think it's totally worth it!", 
            "we had such an amazing dinner here! great service, great margaritas and the steak quesadilla and the <mark>Chicken Poblano Enchiladas</mark> were fantastic. order the guacamole to start, it's so good!", 
            "had a great time at this place. seated promptly on the patio with our two kids and our server was great. got us chips and salsa quickly, along with water, so we could keep the toddlers occupied.\n\nmy wife had the <mark>Yucatan Pork</mark> tacos which the waiter recommended. no leftovers for me! she obviously loved them and was very happy, since we were having lunch a little late after going to the mandalay shark reef.\n\ni had the <mark>Chicken Poblano Enchiladas</mark> which were fantastic! the charred, smoky flavor from the poblanos is unforgettable. i'm still thinking about it now. i also had a bloody mary with lunch which was really good.\n\nafter reading some of the other reviews, i think next time the wifey and i will have have to do brunch here sans kiddos!!", 
            "i feel like this is a mexican food joint for white people palates but i enjoy it none the less!  it's a good bet if you're looking for a nice place to have dinner, its a good mix of laid back/fancy.  the few times i've been here i've tried the fish tacos which are thoroughly enjoyable but probably not worth the 23 dollars they charge, the <mark>Chicken Poblano Enchiladas</mark> which are delicious but for 26$? but its the strip so what did i expect right... i've also had the the market veggie quesadilla which is tasty, cheaper, and a good choice if you're vegetarian.  bottom line this place is worth a visit if you're in the area but i probably wouldn't go out of my way for it.  a lot of their reviews seem to be for their brunch so maybe that's where its at, to be honest they probably deserve 3.5 stars but oh well", 
            "i went here with family as we had a groupon to use for the \"<mark>The Ultimate Border Grill Experience</mark>\". it's a restaurant in the mandalay bay.\n\nwe sat outside and had a nice view of the hotel towers. very pretty the  atmosphere is very nice service was very good.\n\nwe had:\n<mark>Plantain Empanadas</mark>\n<mark>Brisket Taquitos</mark>\n<mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark>\n<mark>Chicken Poblano Enchiladas</mark>\n<mark>Baja Ceviche</mark>\nfish taco ensenada\nassorted desserts",

            "some friends and i dined here for sunday brunch while visiting las vegas in march 2014. \n\nfood was wonderful. i had the <mark>Chicken Poblano Enchiladas</mark> poblanos which was really, quite good. i would order it again in a heartbeat. we also ordered dessert. the mexican chocolate cream pie was extremely delicious and very, very rich. i ordered the smaller portion and still couldn't finish it. my spouse had the flourless chocolate cake and said it was quite good. i had a small bite of his, but between the two, i prefer the mexican pie. \n\natmosphere and service are nothing exceptional. it's a perfectly ordinary restaurant that happens to put out some exceptionally good mexican food. they do get bonus points for sustainable sourcing of the meats though. that's something that's important to my family and i was glad to see them take that stance.  i can't say that it's a \"can't miss\" establishment, but if you have the time and are craving mexican food, this is a great place to try. \n\ni'd recommend brunch, for the added bonus of $10 bottomless mimosas.", 
            "31 may 2014, 08:00p\n\ni've been to the santa monica and downtown la locations before so there was no objection from me when our local friend wanted to try this location.  hubby finished early so we decided to go to the restaurant and see if we could get seated earlier than our 9p reservation.\n\nit would take our friend a little while to get there so we sat at the bar and ordered a border shaker for two.  our cocktail waitress was very friendly and shortly after we ordered the bar got pretty crowded.  we were at a table and enjoyed our order.  it was so tasty that i was actually wondering if there was tequila in the drink as it was not noticeable at all.  hubby did get quite buzzy, so that answered my question.  the shaker for two comes with two cocktail glasses, a shaker, a small bottle of tequila (enough for two shakers-full) and an extra glass with the other margarita ingredients.  the shaker contains the first round of the margarita mix and the tequila is added at the table before it's shaken (without a top).  when you're ready for round two, pour the second batch of mix into the mixer and add the rest of the tequila.  note, the first round only had about a third of the tequila in it and the second round was too much to fit into the mixer.  we actually had to pour the tequila into our cocktail glasses.  well worth the $29!\n\nour friend arrived and we were able to be seated an hour earlier than our 9p reservation time.  we were seated outside and even though it was still in the 90s, the sun had set, there was a breeze and it was actually quite comfortable.  water was poured and chips with three types of salsa were brought to the table.  the chips are very light and crispy and appeared to be flour tortillas versus the traditional corn tortillas.  there is a red salsa, a green salsa and a chipotle salsa.  all three are good, but the smokiness of the chipotle easily made it my favorite.  the green came in a close second and the red seemed a bit pedestrian, possibly for the non-adventurous.\n\nwe ordered:\n\nblood orange margarita - for our friend\ncorn chowder (on the special's menu) - for our friend\nceviche trio (peruvian, baja, tuna credo) - for me and hubby\n<mark>Chicken Poblano Enchiladas</mark> - for our friend\n<mark>Gaucho Steak</mark> - for hubby\n<mark>Tecate Carnitas</mark> - for me\n\nthe ceviche trio arrived first and it is a small sampling of the three different types of ceviche listed on the menu.  the trio is not listed, but our waitress informed us that we could do any combo of any of the ceviches.  we opted for the trio so we could try them all.  the tuna credo wasn't very exciting.  the seasonings weren't prominent enough and tasted pretty bland.  the peruvian and baja were a little more flavorful.  hubby enjoyed the baja the best and my favorite was the peruvian.  all three had large amounts of fish (and shrimp in the baja), but the portions are probably only large enough to share between two people.\n\nour friend had the corn chowder and he said it was very tasty, albeit a bit spicy.  he enjoyed the kick to it, though, and finished the entire bowl.\n\nour entrees arrived and all three were generous portions.  our friend enjoyed his enchiladas and finished them.\n\nhubby ate about half of his steak which he really liked.  it was served over a bed of what appeared to be \"chilaquiles\", but he said it was a little odd.\n\nmy carnitas were excellent!  the presentation was pretty interesting as well, with the black bean salsa layered with what the corn grits above and then finished with a huge pile of carnitas, jalapeno bacon and onions.  a singular large flour tortilla accompanied.  i was only able to eat about a third of the meal and i was full.\n\nhubby and i both took our leftovers back to the hotel and had them the next day.  still good!  it's been awhile since i'd been to the border grill and it was nice to have another experience to remind me why i enjoy this restaurant.  the staff and service were excellent and the generous portions of the tasty food don't hurt, either!", 
            "border grill isn't anything mind-blowing & i wouldn't go out of my way to eat there but it's a solid option if grabbing a bite while at mandalay bay. in my case, i like to make reservations there before events. the service is lukewarm but not bad. the chips, salsas & guacamole are yummy... as are the <mark>Chicken Poblano Enchiladas</mark> & quesadillas. but both flavors of rice & the black beans are quite bland. the restaurant itself is kinda cool, with several different dining areas with different personalities.", 
            "the food was good. i am not quite sure it is worth the 20 a plate but it was good. we had the carne asada tacos and <mark>Chicken Poblano Enchiladas</mark>. the service was very slow was about 30 mins after we were done to when we had our check. with so much to do in vegas you hate waiting at a restaurant for no reason. the chips and salsa were very good.", 
            "we were at the border grill on valentine's day, the food was amazing!! i had the <mark>Chicken Poblano Enchiladas</mark> and they were incredible!  our waitress on the other hand was not so great! a man delivered our menus and chips and he was much more friendly and helpful than our waitress who referred to him her assistant, should have been the other way around.  once i got a drink it was great, but she was slow, rude and didnt even tell us the specials.  i asked for a side of something and my meal was over by the time she had it delivered.  then we waited fifteen minutes just to get our check!  great food!  bad waitress!  would go again and hope for a better server.",

            "we had dinner at border grill on a saturday night.  the place was about 2/3 full, but the patio, where we ate, was completely full.  it was a nice cool evening, and they had the heaters on.  we were directly underneath them, and i actually found myself a little warm.  not uncomfortably so, but i definitely was noticing the heat. \n\nthat wasn't an issue however; i clearly enjoyed the meal.  to start, you are brought 3 different salsas and chips.  of these, the green was my favorite, although i liked both red salsas as well.  our table of 5 decided to get the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> to start, and 2 of them got guacamole.  the guacamole was good, certainly fresh.  it could have used some heat for my taste.  the queso was fantastic.  made with chorizo, it got crispy on the bottom where the cheese melted against the hot metal bowl.  i seriously considered ordering another serving of this, it was that good.  crispy, melty, a little salty from the sausage.  just a fantastic cheese dish.  \n\nthe meal only got better from there.  the wife had the <mark>Short Rib Enchiladas</mark>, which were great.  loved the sauce, and they were covered with a ton of veggies.  but, the showstopper was my meal:  the <mark>Gaucho Steak</mark>.  this is a large ribeye (cooked to a textbook medium rare, by the way) on top of a huge bed of maybe the best chilaquiles i've ever eaten and served with a roasted onion half and roasted garlic.  if ever a dish was composed well, this is that dish.  all of this stuff went together fantastically well, you could get a perfect bite with all 4 components.  the chilaquiles were soaked in sauce and served with what appeared to be 2 different types of cheese.  the garlic and onion were roasted long enough to become sweet, flavorful and soft, but not so long that they were burnt in anyway.  \n\ni've been to many of the best steakhouses in vegas.  while the <mark>Gaucho Steak</mark> isn't going to make me forget the reserve ribeye at carnevino, it certainly is one of the more memorable steaks i've had on the strip.  can't recommend this enough if you are a beef person.\n\nfor dessert, the table had the tres leches cake and the chocolate cake (can't remember the exact menu title).  both were good, but i found the chocolate cake to be far superior.\n\nservice was good, they leave a carafe of water on your table, which was nice.  and, when that was empty, they brought a replacement very quickly.  we'll definitely return, and i 100% will order the <mark>Gaucho Steak</mark> next time.", 
            "omg love this place. the food was awesome and so was our waiter jeff. took a cab from the cosmo ($11.00) to mandalay bay to eat here. it lived up to to the hype. i had the <mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark>. it was cooked perfectly. it came with a roasted corn and refried beans,also yummy. my partner had the <mark>Short Rib Enchiladas</mark> and was very happy. the guacamole was very good also. we both had a jalape\\u00f1o margarita that was delicious. it was so good we almost went back the next night for dinner again. it's a must try when in vegas. next time  in vegas i may have to book my stay at mandalay bay just to be close to border grill!",

            "the border grill is inside the mandalay bay casino complex and sports a great outside patio with the view of the lazy river.\n\nit is owned by high wattage chefs sue milliken and susan feniger the two (except too) hot tamales. so a mexican restaurant with real chefs. a must try.\n\nwe started with the <mark>Tuna Crudo</mark> and it was a little plain. although i am merely an amateur, it seemed like it needed an acid of some sort. \n\nthen i moved on to the <mark>Short Rib Enchiladas</mark> and chips and salsa. first, the chips were homemade, crispy and went down a little too smooth. the enchiladas were really good but i wish that i had settled for the chicken option. short rib meat seems like a waste in the enchilada and while good it seemed out of place.\n\nalso, i had a cucumber mojito that was like drinking a cucumber. absolutely delightful.\n\nwe liked this place but we are suckers for mexican food. if you find yourself around the strip and you like mexican food then you should go here. it is top shelf mexican but not weird gourmet mexican. i'll be back.", 
            "this place was just ok. we sat outside and it was very loud but that is not the restaurants fault. we loved the chips and salsa and were looking forward to our meal. i ordered the fish tacos and hubby ordered the <mark>Short Rib Enchiladas</mark>. i was shocked to see my tacos, they were so small, like an appetizer, the tortillas were smaller than fajita sized tortillas(which is the size i expected). there was a chunk of fish in each taco( there were 3) but the piece of fish on one of the tacos only covered half of the tortilla. so, i take a bite and although presentation was good, these tacos were so bland to me. i tasted a hint of lime but that was about it. hubby said he would rather eat taco bell! he said the taste wasn't horrid, but his dish was way overpriced. service was horrible, we were  checked on once during our meal by our waitress. we had more interaction from the bus boy!!  the water we were served was barely cold, after filling our glass once, we were given a carafe of room temperature water. i guess their ice maker was broken. we ordered the guacamole, it was good, but way overpriced as well. it came with two oversized chips to which hubby and i both exclaimed \"that's it?!\"  maybe we both got bad dishes, or the chef was having an off night and forgot to season our food. if you are recovering from the flu and need bland food, i highly recommend this place. :)",

            "we received great service from the host, but once seated the service just dropped off.  our server was just unavailable. it took forever to get basics like silverware or water, and the chips/salsa were probably a good 20 minutes after we sat down.  we waited so long just to get our cocktails that we started playing the game, \"so...do we leave? do you want to leave? where would we eat dinner? i'm so okay leaving, i have no problem getting up and just going. lets give it 3 more minutes? what time is it now...\" but then our cocktails were served and we felt we had to stay.\n\nmr r ordered a really good pork plate. i had the <mark>Short Rib Enchiladas</mark>. they came alone, without any sides except for a few greens on top. it was all really good. i was very impressed with the kids menus - tons of options for $4-6 a plate. we ordered a $5 plate of the green corn tamale which came with rice and beans. the tamale reminded me more of a corn casserole - not my favorite (nor the favorite of my 18 month old, but he had spent an earlier part of the dinner sucking green salsa off his chips and eating crayons, so not sure his opinion should count).\n\nthe patio was beautiful and heated in december, it was a decent place - just not someplace i'd go again.",

            "border grill is now serving brunch!  i love a good breakfast - and they do it right by me.  brunch is served as a tapas menu, perfect for trying a little bit of everything.  for $29.95 you can get an 'all you can eat' brunch with champagne - or pomegranate mimosas as i had (delicious, by the way).  there is nothing wrong with eating chips and salsa at 10 o'clock in the morning - especially their fresh, homemade varieties border grill has to offer, my favorite being the salsa verde -  it is so flavorful.  make sure to ask for the spicy salsa if they don't bring it automatically, it is amazing too.\n\nthe tapas menu is a great idea to try a bit of everything and not get too full off just one item - the waiter will take about 2-3 orders at a time, and spread the delivery out so you are not overwhelmed with food on the table.  with the menu consisting of about 15 or so items, it is perfect for a variety of flavors to start your day.\n\nfor starters, i had the eggs benedict.  now, this is not your average eggs benny by any stretch of the imagination.  instead of an english muffin, they use a light and fluffy biscuit topped with <mark>Yucatan Pork</mark>, a poached egg, fresh hollandaise sauce and pickled onions.  heaven.  \n\nnext on the list was steak and eggs.  i have honestly never ordered this as a breakfast item - so i figured it was time to try it.  the tender carne asada was sliced thin, but not too thin, sitting on top of a poblano potato pancake and an egg (over medium for me please) sitting on top.  i will never be able to order steak and eggs any where else now.  \n\ni tried the shrimp blt - sounds more lunch-y, but hey, where there is shrimp, so am i.  the bread was sliced thin, which was great since by this point, i am already starting to get full. inside lies shrimp, bacon, lettuce and tomatoes, all seasoned to perfection.  \n\nmy friend ordered coconut french toast.  i am not a french toast or coconut fan (which is why she ordered it..)  although, it was actually pretty darn good - this consisted of sourdough bread, coconut syrup and saut\\u00e9ed bananas.  sweet, but not too much, a definite surprise - i might even order it on my own next time.\n\nthe green corn tamale came out next - and dear lord - if i could eat this at every meal, i would.  trust me.  the presentation is great, part of it is in a tamale 'purse' - the other part served along side sour cream and fresh pico de gallo. yummy.  \n\nwe also ordered the fresh fruit they were offering on the brunch menu.  the fruit was perfectly in season with a drizzle of passion fruit sauce.  oh my.  \n\nbesides the food being excellent, the service is something that is outstanding as well.  every wait staff member knows the menu inside and out, has great recommendations, and provides a level of service that you will remember almost as much as the food itself.  good customer service will never go out of style, and as far as i am concerned, neither will this brunch. border grill nailed it, again.", 
            "the food was good but not good enough for more than 3 stars. the best dish was the steak. they make fantastic chips and salsa though. the fish tacos was really good. they give 3 large pieces of perfectly battered fried fish. the <mark>Yucatan Pork</mark> was flavorful but some of my pork pieces were dry and hard. the server was exceptional.", 
            "food was very fresh tasting and well seasoned. we really enjoyed the <mark>Baja Ceviche</mark>. i had lunch with my daughter and she didn't know what that was and our server( sarah) wad very helpful. she was very good at explaining the items on the menu. my daughter had the <mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark>, it was so delicious! i had the <mark>Yucatan Pork</mark> which was good but the steak was way better! i had a cadillac margarita that was really good! it is pricey but it is delicious! \nwe did have a dessert it was like a tres leche churro minis, it was terrible! do not order! it sounds delicious but this kind of restaurant should never let it leave the kitchen. the churro's were not crispy and the filling wasn't even in the them anymore. that was my only complaint.",

            "seriously. overpriced mediocre food. the <mark>Yucatan Pork</mark> was billed as a spice infused pork cooked 8 hours in a banana leaf. one thing was left out-- it also was basted in salt. wow. two flavors stood out: cinnamon and salt. the <mark>Chicken Poblano Enchiladas</mark> were wrapped in a thick tortilla almost impenetrable. the soup was interesting: a stewed tomato taste with subtle heat.  chips and salsa were fine.  was expecting more from this place. too bad. nice people work there and they do their best to sell the food as upbeat as possible. the food lets them down.", 
            "first the great review. my second visit here and this one the food was awesome. we had chips and guacamole which was tasty and well made.\nwe had shrimp tacos and <mark>Yucatan Pork</mark> tacos both on corn. the shrimp had a nice smoky flavor with some heat and fruit flavor, the pork tacos were cooked well and i could have eaten them all day.  but the tacos are small and loaded with taste so you leave feeling sated by taste but not in pain form over eating.\n\nnow the bad. as we sat on the balcony a large loud group of hotel media people crowded onto the balcony all around our table talking about lining up shots and ignoring all the customers. not a warning from the restaurant management or apology from the rude camera crew and snotty on camera people. \nfood - 100\nmanagement for allowing thai circus -zero", 
            "i ended up eating lunch here and i must say i was pleasantly surprised. the food was extremely fresh with great flavors. the salsa and chips are made on site and were really good. i also got the guacamole which was good but it was a bit small but i cannot complain since it was reasonably priced. \n\ni had the <mark>Yucatan Pork</mark> tacos which were incredible and full of flavor. i would love to go back another time to try their dinner menu. \n\noverall, it was a pleasant dining experience with a very helpful wait staff!", 
            "my girlfriend had a conference at mandalay bay and we made reservations for lunch at border.  the place was filled and glad we made the reservation.  we started with the guacamole.  it was a hit.  \nshe had a <mark>Carne Asada Quesadilla</mark>.  the steaks were grilled perfectly and was the best quesadilla she ever had.  she pair the quesadilla with a tasty margarita.\ni went with <mark>Yucatan Pork</mark> tacos.  the pork was fork tender.  the pickled habernero onions were not hot.  of course, nothing was spicy after our thai meal the night before.  overall, this might be the second best restaurant we had in vegas.  definitely, ranked very high in our list.  we like it more than mesa.  sorry bobby flay but imho, mary sue milliken won this throw down.", 
            "we came here for lunch and used a restaurant.com coupon.  with the coupon, the prices seemed ok, but the menu prices are high for the quality of the food.  i live in california, where we have access to tons of mexican and \"mexican,\" so perhaps that colored my opinion.  \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Quinoa Fritters</mark>, which were a little oily but had a great flavor.  my husband and i split an order of three tacos and sides (you can mix from the tacos listed on the menu, which was a nice way to sample more).  we had the avocado (ok, kind of dry), the carnitas (pretty good, not exceptional), and the chicken panucho (extremely oily, no real flavor).  this came with beans and rice (red and green), which were ok.  this was easily enough for the two of us to share.  \n\nour dining companions ordered the three tacos (shrimp and <mark>Yucatan Pork</mark> were both deemed \"good,\" can't remember the third) and the <mark>Border Classics</mark> (chicken panuchos and some tamales and empanadas), which was also \"good.\"  \n\nthere is a .50 charge for water, which i thought was odd; it included still or sparkling water.   service was very good.", 
            "my favorite entree here is the <mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark> ($27).  the steak is so flavorful, mine was cooked perfectly.  the combination of flavors with the corn relish and black beans in that soft, handmade tortilla is just amazing...makes my mouth water just thinking about it :)  it was even better with some of the guacamole that we ordered as a starter.  my husband had the chick<mark>Pork En Mole</mark>, which he said was delicious as well.  our server was wonderful, she recommended the black cherry mojito and the sparkling white peach lemonade, both of which were amazing!  they even brought us a complimentary dessert for my husband's birthday...the pineapple upside down cake served warm with pineapple ice cream...we devoured this dessert!  \n\nthe only misses that i've had here were during a lunch visit: the <mark>Yucatan Pork</mark> (mainly because i didn't like the orange flavor in the pork, too sweet for me), and the <mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark> (also because it was sweeter than i expected).\n\nwe used a restaurant.com gift certificate, which made our dinner fairly reasonable for the strip.  i can't wait to come back for their weekend brunch!",

(boston.) well, while not entirely true, i did make border grill the first stop on our gluttonous trip through vegas, and my friends agreed that it was delicious. the guacamole is also not to missed. our waiter may have been a sociopath with a bright future in sales, as my group all succumbed to his recommendations -- and were not disappointed.", 
            "this place was so good i had to come again. the tomatillo salsa first off is amazing! bright and citrusy and the chips are obviously not tostidos. i had the <mark>Yucatan Pork</mark> and it was just delicious. i hate yams but the yams it came with were amazing and complimented the warm home made corn tortillas wonderfully. a little pork, some yams, and those tortillas was heaven. love on a plate! the second time i went i had the special which was short rib tacos with a roasted corn salsa and cheese grits on top of their home made corn tortillas. it was dry rubbed so it had a nice spice to it and just fell apart. delicious, amazing, delicious, no words can describe how amazing it was. i will def. be going to the border grill close to my house in santa monica, i am a customer for life. autumn was amazing. one of the best servers i have had since i was in vegas though the 2 days i went to border grill the hostesses were sub part. one was suppose to bring me a bunch menu and just completely forgot and it wasn't even busy. that aside this place was pretty much flawless!", 
            "for brunch on our last day in vegas, we opted for the ayce brunch at the border grill at the mandalay. although it is an ayce brunch, the format is not that of a brunch buffet.  you can order as many tapas sized plates from the menu as you want.  the restaurant recommends ordering 3 per person.  we ended up ordering approximately 5 per person, but probably only ate 3-4 as some were misses that we didn't finish.  \n\nwhen you arrive, plates of cut fruit and guava and cheese empanadas are quickly set on the table.  simple appetizers as they are, they were some of the best things all day.  the fruits included a spear of pineapple, a few of watermelon, honeydew, and a few slices of strawberry with a passionfruit puree.  the fruit and empananadas were a great start to the meal.  the fruit was sweet and the puree was very complimentary.  i loved the light, flaky crust of the pastry and the guava jam was delicious.  \n\nthe absolute best dish of the day were the steak and eggs over a crispy potato cake.  hot steak, crispy potatoes, egg yolk, guacamole = perfection.  also good was the sweet corn tamale, which was subtley sweet with kernels of yellow corn inside and offset by the bright pico de gallo and the cool sour cream.  the shrimp and grits was also popular with its spicy sauce. \n\nsome of the other dishes didn't fare as well.  the <mark>Chicken Poblano Enchiladas</mark> and the chilaquiles were clearly pre-assembled and had been reheated but not to optimum temperature.  they were barely warm as compared to the hot seared steak and hot steamed tamale, above.  the flavor of the enchiladas were okay but it just wasn't hot enough and with the chilaquiles, the chips were totally soggy. \n\nsome dishes were just imbalanced.  the short rib hash with yams were overly sweet from the yams.  the pbj biscuit with bacon, pb & j tasted exactly what you might think it would, and the eggs benedict had a bit of clashing flavors with the <mark>Yucatan Pork</mark>, marinated red onions and hollandaise.  also, everything was served with pico de gallo and sour cream.  lovely condiments, generally, but it was tiring to see them so overused.  \n\nwe had little room for dessert so we asked for more fresh fruit and shared one order of the churro tots.  these are more like mini doughnuts rolled in cinnamon and sugar but i must admit they were nicely fried and light.  \n\nall in all, it's a good brunch concept but the food isn't perfect.   reflecting on everything we tried, it was hard to overlook the combination of the lukewarm pre-assembled food and the not quite natural assemblage of american and latin flavors.  if you were to come, stick with the steak & eggs, shrimp & grits and some of the more standard mexican fare.", 
            "i loved my meal but not the service so i'll focus on the lunch. i ordered the <mark>Yucatan Pork</mark> plate and was thoroughly impressed.  while we were waiting to be seated a woman already eating said,  \"this is the worst mexican food i've ever had.\" considering the location and reputation of the chef i thought that was a little overly dramatic and possibly overstated but it still made me concerned.   anyway the menu was full of standards--quesadillas and taco options--but i wanted to have something that required enough effort that the chef couldn't just mindlessly throw it together so i chose the <mark>Yucatan Pork</mark>.\nit was a business lunch so i was concerned that the portion would be a little much but i went for it and so did the gentleman seated next to me (a former bball player built like a lineman, so my portion question remained). \nthe pork was tender, fall apart, melt in your mouth good and season perfectly. the mountain of pork was more than enough and so distracting that the tasteless tortilla accompaniment was unnecessary and unmissed.  a side of sweet plantains with a bit of crunch was excellent!  i considered taking my table mates portion since they weren't of interest to him but kept some form of etiquette and decorum.  i'm not sure what the concoction was but the black bean paste on the side was another great edition with the cheese and rice.\nignore the mile long trek through the restaurant to be seated outside on a freezing vegas afternoon, and the young \"too busy for you\" waitstaff and i would go back specifically for this dish!", 
            "located in the beautiful mandalay bay resort on the las vegas strip, border grill has a bit of a history. it is opened by chef susan feniger and chef mary sue milliken. sounds familiar? yep, they are indeed the chefs featured on bravo's \"top chef masters\"! being huge top chef fans, how can we resist?\n\nas with all restaurants in these large hotel/casino/resorts, border grill was tastefully decorated. in hindsight, i wished we sat on the patio, which supposedly overlooks mandalay bay's beach and pool.\n\nwe started with chips and salsa, as well as a good old margarita.\n\nwe had the following dishes:\n\n<mark>Oaxacan Strip Steak</mark>\n- seared 16 ounce steak, mole colorado, charred wild mushroom quesadilla, avocado tomato relish\n\n<mark>Yucatan Pork</mark>\n- achiote pork slow roasted in banana leaves, caramelized onion, orange, cinnamon, honey lime yams, caramelized brussel sprouts, pineapple jicama salsa\n\nthe <mark>Yucatan Pork</mark> dish was quite tasty, although i was only able to have a few bites. \n\nplease come to my blog for my vegas trip, i have food photos! ;)\n\nhttp://simplygluttonous.blogspot.ca/2013/08/border-grill-mandalay-bay-las-vegas.html",

(it may have had something to do with her deep mid west accent that sold me but whatever it was i am thrilled i took her suggestion, what a great dish!) my fiance had the <mark>Yucatan Pork</mark> (another suggestion of jessi's) and he could not stop talking about it! \njessi made us feel as if we were her most important guests, we never had an empty glass, never had a dirty dish sitting in front of us and i personally felt that jessi anticipated our each and every need.  being that we live so close and visit las vegas quite often we have decided that we will make this our regular spot every time we visit. way to go border grill,with so many options to eat and drink in vegas you have managed to gain 2 new fans of not only your food and drink but your staff!!!",

            "i'm not sure where all these 5-star reviews for border grill are coming from with words like \"yummy\" and \"delish\" liberally sprinkled throughout. i was taken to dinner at border this evening and <mark>The Ultimate Border Grill Experience</mark> was miserable. \n\nwhile the service was good, the restaurant was so dark in the dining area it was difficult to see or read the menu. the drinks available are very high-priced and were small. the cheapest margarita was $11.  the food was not much better than a frozen mexican entree you can buy at any grocery, in fact, the frozen food would probably be better as well as cheaper. chips were provided, unheated and accompanied by three of the smallest portions of different salsas i've ever seen. \n\ni had the \"famous\" <mark>Yucatan Pork</mark> with a mess of stuff hidden under a pile of lukewarm greasy meat. the carmelized plantains promised amounted to two small slices of plantain that were cold and had the texture and appearance of hockey pucks. there were a few other things on the plate, all cold. no one at the table received hot food. the impression was that all the orders were simply pulled from a steam table and thrown on the plates. my dining companion had a quesadilla which appeared to not have been grilled. it was the market fresh something or other, a cold and dry flour tortilla with some suspicious looking vegetable matter inside. it was so dark you couldn't really tell what was going on. not one person out of four ate more than a fraction of the food. no one asked to take the leftovers home. the bill was outrageous for what was served. we won't be going back, especially when one considers the number of really excellent authentic mexican restaurants available here in vegas. \n\nborder grill is just another high-priced tacky tourist spot among many others at mandalay bay. no real flavor and too much \"top chef\" showing off by using ingredients not suited to mexican cuisine. feta cheese on tacos?  avoid and spend less money for much better food elsewhere.", 
            "our reservation for valentine's day dinner at border grill wasn't perfect, but nothing that would take away from the 5 star rating. \n\nwe ordered the guacamole and tuna ceviche appetizers, both fresh and beautifully presented. asked ahead of time for the guacamole to be spicy (more jalape\\u00f1os than normal) and it came out bland. salsas for the table were good, especially the tomatillo salsa. \n\ni ordered the chicken chile verde enchiladas and my honey had the <mark>Yucatan Pork</mark>. both of us thought our dishes were wonderful, generous portions and almost too gorgeous to eat. love a restaurant that ensures the freshest and organic ingredients. handmade tortillas really made the enchilada dish. we were wow'ed. for dessert we had the mexican chocolate pie, which was just like regular chocolate pie, couldn't taste the mexican chocolate, but it was good. \n\nthe only issue i had here was that i was sitting directly under a water leak (air conditioning, maybe?) and got dripped on here & there throughout the meal. didn't want to ruin my dress! told the waitress about it, she was non-chalant about it. weird. \n\nanyway: dinner here was a pleasure. being local, we will be back again. we just won't sit in the leaky dining room!", 
            "had the pleasure of enjoying a late lunch here with my husband while on a business trip. it was hands-down one of the best meals i've had anywhere, mexican or otherwise. the atmosphere was pleasant and relaxing, the staff was friendly, attentive and helpful, and the food was just plain amazing. we started with the traditional chips and salsa, which at border grill, is actually a sampler of three varieties of salsa.  all were fresh and delicious, but my favorite was to green tomatillo salsa.  it was bright and tangy with a great spicy kick. i order the <mark>Brisket Taquitos</mark> and my husband had the yucutan pork. my taquitos were perfect-crispy without being greasy, full of delicious, flavorful beef and topped with just the right quantity of shredded lettuce, salsa, guacamole and sour cream.  the presentation was colorful and beautiful arranged with black beans flanked by petite portions of fabulous arroz verde and red spanish rice.\n\nmy husband's choice of the <mark>Yucatan Pork</mark>, which he chose based on the server's recommendation, was also beautiful and delicious (of course i tried a bite!). the pork was tender, moist with a fascinating, complicated flavor that included orange and cinnamon. served with plantains, rice and fresh corn tortillas, it was a meal to be remembered.\n\nif i ever find myself in las vegas again i will definitely plan to visit border grill again!", 
            "amazing food and service!  i had the enchiladas with a lovely salad on top and my husband had the <mark>Yucatan Pork</mark>.  both were delicious and portions were generous.  chips and salsa were tasty too.  if you are a fan of jose andres or rick bayless, you will love this as well.", 
            "had the best time at our wedding reception here. located in a private room and exceptional service provided by all the staff and manager christina. the food was so good! we had a selection of <mark>Gaucho Steak</mark> (worth the $5 upgrade), <mark>Chicken Poblano Enchiladas</mark> or <mark>Yucatan Pork</mark>. our guests loved it all. the guacamole was endless  and the ultimate margarita package is the best way to go! we ordered our wedding cake and floral through them as well and couldn't be happier. living in ny choosing our reception site unseen was difficult but we made the most affordable and excellent mexican food choice on the strip. thank you so much for making our day awesome!", 
            "came here with a group of 6 last weekend for dinner. service was pretty decent. \n\ni'm only slightly familiar with the work of the two chefs, mary sue milliken and susan feniger. kudos to the duo for creativity of the dishes and the thorough knowledge of the waitstaff. they serve warm and crispy chips and 3 kinds of salsas; all unique and good. we started with an order of the guacamole, which was pretty standard. nothing really stood out with the order and it was a tad bland. \n\nfor my main course, i ordered the <mark>Yucatan Pork</mark> ($24). it was a good-sized plate; price wasn't great but wasn't bad for restaurants on the strip. the pork itself was tender, but the flavor was just ok for me. there is a pretty heavy cinnamon flavor, which i found bright, surprising, and interesting, but that's really all i could taste. i think the dish was slightly bland and could have had a bigger variety of flavors. the rice and beans were very standard and uninteresting. i was a fan of the plantains that came with the dish, though. \n\noverall, just an ok experience for me. i would definitely be open to revisiting and trying some of the other dishes, as a lot of them sounded interesting and creative."

            "joining the bf's colleagues for dinner, border grill was the choice for the evening.  when approaching the restaurant after walking through the maze of mandalay bay, it may appear that border grill isn't very large.  however, you'll find lots of large tables available downstairs too.  \n\nthey seat you down with plenty of salty tortilla chips and a tiny platter of three sauces.  there was one that was green that i just loved, and another one of the two red ones that was yummy too.  \n\ndrink orders first!  i had their cruzan mojito, which is described as \"cuba's most popular cocktail; cruzan estate light rum muddled with fresh mint, lime, and a touch of soda.\"  this was oh-so yum and among the best mojitos ever.  however, not so strong but tasty indeed.  i also tried someone else's mango mojito and it was oh-so yummy too!  the bf had the caipirinha, which is \"a brazilian classic, fresh juices muddled with sugar drowned in ypioca cachaca.\"  it tasted a bit better than my previous experience with caipirinha, but still a bit strong tasting.\n\nour waiter was super friendly and a such a doll.  they get you going when they offer the guacamole (mashed avocado with cilantro, red onion, jalapeo, and lime).  it's standard fresh guacamole, nothing particularly special about it but it does come with a little salad of something or other on the side.\n\nnot sure what to order, i ask for suggestions from the waiter and comes up with a few.  i decide on the <mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark>, which is \"marinated in garlic, cilantro, cumin, and lime; served with charred corn relish, tomato avocado salad, and black beans.\"  i chose my steak rare and it came out nicely to my liking.  the initial bite was very enjoyable...tasty and delicate.  however, as i ate the rest of my steak, i felt it lacked some flavor.  i ended up dipping my steak into the sauces left on the table for the chips to give it a kick.  the tomato avocado salad was a nice blend of heirloom tomatoes that was a nice accompaniment, but the charred corn relish was a bit too hard for my tastes.  (the bf finished it off though.)  and the black beans were standard too.  this came with a large flour tortilla that i ended up not eating.\n\nthe bf had the cochinita pibil, which is \"achiote marinated pork slow roasted in banana leaf with cinnamon, grilled onions, black beans, and plantain orange salsa.\"  it was recommended by the waiter because it came from southern mexico and is considered a rare dish to find on a menu.  i took the first bite and gave it back to the bf.  the pork was nothing special and i was disappointed.  the bf wasn't so impressed either as he kept on eating my steak instead.  it came with corn tortillas that the bf felt overpowered the pork.  and the plantains were okay too.\n\noverall, the food was okay.  dinner for the two of us costs $84, which is definitely not worth it when eating mexican food.  (both of us have been to central mexico, so it's a little hard to justify spending so much on this type of food.)  i would be curious if they had a happy hour just for drinks and appetizers though.  then you'll see me coming back to drink up on their mojitos! \n\nsidenote:  watch out for their elevator.  with the six of us in it, it made a funny sound that had us catching our breath for a moment.  and i know we didn't eat all that much now!", 
            "the border grill is a mexican restaurant located in the mandalay bay hotel casino resort.  it is the last eating establishment along restaurant row. a few of us were already hesitant about eating at a mexican restaurant in section that also has a wolf gang puck's trattoria, red square, fleur de lys,  michael mina's <mark>Oaxacan Strip Steak</mark>, etc.   \nthe decor of this restaurant was outstanding.  the vibrant yellow and orange painted walls decorated with mexican art brightened the whole restaurant in the evening.  i was very surprised at the size of the restaurant.  it has actually two levels with the lower level accommodating larger parties of 6 or more.  the lower level connects to some outdoor seating, which i look forward to taking my lovely dining companion on the milder vegas nights for some drinks.  \nwe started off on some homemade tortilla chips that had just the right amount of saltiness.   it was complimented so well with the salsa roja and salsa verde.  one of the other red salsas had a fruity tinge to it, but   not strong enough to be identified, so it was uninteresting.  we also ordered guacamole, which was a little more bland than i usually like.   they were generous on the avocado, but i think they could have done a better job in adding some more kick (spice, tanginess, saltiness).\nwhen the waiter mentioned that the cochinita pibil was a southern mexican specialty that is rarely found in menus here in the u.s., i immediately knew that i had to order that dish.  basically, it is a specially marinated pork that has been slow roasted with or in banana leaf with cinnamon and grilled onions.  it was accompanied by black beans, rice, and plantains with orange salsa on the side.   sounds yummy, unfortunately after i gave the first bite to the gf, she immediately let me know that i could have the rest of the bite.  i said to myself, \"oh no could it be that bad?\"  i was disappointed at how tough the pork was and how the whole dish lacked any zest.  maybe the tortilla to wrap the meat took away the flavor, or the onions and banana leaf muffled some of the flavors away.  either way, the gfs <mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark> was a lot more tastier.  she ordered it rare and you can actually taste the marinate of garlic, cilantro, cumin, and lime.  she found that her taste buds loved in the beginning and was bored with it towards the end.  i also loved eating her charred corn relish,\ni will have to be honest that the price for our meals were a bit high ~$80/2 people for mexican food.  there are tons of other great mexican restaurants/taquerias in las vegas that are much cheaper and better tasting.  i will have to admit that i will return for drinks.  the mojitos (regular or mango) are very delicious.  ask the gf!!!  they were extra sweet, very refreshing, with a minty bite.  they also have caipirinha (a brazilian concoction, which lacked the tang that i was used to).  i yet have to find this drink anywhere else in vegas.",

            "would have gotten 4 stars if we hadn't had the least attentive waiter in existence.  the food was really good.  i got the special chicken empandas.  my dad got the <mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark>.  the empanadas had a good flavor, but the weren't as crispy as i had hoped.  my dad's <mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark> was fantastic.  the waiter did not pay attention to anything we said, and was inattentive to fill up drinks and take plates away.", 
            "we had our wedding reception in a beautiful private room overlooking the patio.  the room holds about 60 sit down, and i think up to 80 stand up. we put down an 800$ dollar deposit, with a minimum of 4,000$, add on tax and tip and round up to about 5,100. they also have a smaller room that holds about 35 people for 3000$ minimum.  \n\nthe banquet coordinator jessica was unbelievably sweet and helpful.  she went above and beyond the call of duty. she helped me with everything.  i emailed her about a million times and talked with her at length about everything. cake, food, rental, seating arrangements, flowers, and even suggestions of other vendors.  she helped me find rental chairs and she booked it under her business name and got me a cheaper rate. the border grill chairs are an orange-brownish color. i really wanted silver chairs. the rental chairs ran about 10$ dollars each, and jessica got me her cheaper rate at about 8$ each. she also got me a speaker and microphone for about 50$ dollars cheaper. you don't really need a speaker if your best man is loud enough. go through jessica, she makes sure the rental's show up on time.i think she knows about getting a dj as well.  i don't think a dj is worth it. the border grill music is pipped in, the stereo system is awesome. it is kind of jazzy, latin music. they can also turn it off really quick when you have speeches.\n\ni had already booked my wedding cake with another vendor for about 500$. they add a cake cutting fee, i think 2$ per person.\n fyi...she is working with the chef on wedding cakes.  i think she said they would run about 170$ for 30 people, but don't quote me on that. she had no pictures, so i went with my first option.  talk to her about cakes, see if they updated the website with pictures.  \n\nthey have no hidden charges.  she sits with you on the phone tapping away at her calculator.  so you know exactly what things will cost.  \nshe helped me with my choice of entrees and changes that i wanted with adding on different types of sauces and salads.  their \"set menu\" are very flexible, and the prices are very reasonable...for vegas. i got about 8 appetizer platters to pass around for cocktail half hour they run anywhere from 13$ to 50$.  i had two salad choices, a champagne toast and for the entrees i had  fish, <mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark>, and enchilada's.  about 65$ per person. everyone raved about the food. i printed my own menu's, see pictures above. i wish that i had printed a drink menu of margarita's and sangria suggestions on the back of my menu's.  i don't think people took full advantage of the full bar and they mostly got wine and beer. \n\nso my total cost for 55 people with the ultra lavish food, tons of appetizers, champagne toast, full open bar and amazing rental chairs ran about 9000$ dollars. you can easily go thousands less depending on your guest count, food and rental needs. i also asked jessica to charge my card for about 1000$ a month for four months so that i did not have a crazy bill on my wedding day. don't worry, she really only needs the deposit to hold the room.  layaway wedding...less stress.\nalso if you want to send favors, menu's and candles. ship them to her office. she told me to send them to her, and i made the mistake of shipping all my boxes to the hotel room. then they charged me 30$ to deliver to my room and then the hotel lost one of my boxes. jessica walked over to the postal delivery room and talked with security and had him look through all of the boxes for me.  wow, talk about above and beyond. thank you. the lost box had my cake server set, thank god jessica had a nice set to lend me.\nthey do provide beautiful candles in an orange striped color glass, so if your colors match that then your set for the tables.  \nwe had a beautiful wedding reception. it was magical. worth every penny.", 
            "overpriced and overrated. this was some of the most boring mexican food i've ever had and on top of it i paid too much. we ate here for new years and did not do the prix fixe. \n\nthe chips were good, but overall the salsa was boring. one of them was smoked, which has a really good taste to it. \n\nthe $14 cadillac margarita, was weak and tasted like it was mixed with lemon-lime gatorade and crap tequila. couldn't even taste the grand marnier that was allegedly included. \n\nfor the meal, i had the <mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark>. it came out lukewarm at best and was undercoooked (i ordered medium) but i ate it anyways. not impressed, the meat was nice and tender but also pretty tasteless. \n\nif you're looking for good mexi in vegas, get off the strip and head down to viva michoacan in henderson for some good food.", 
            "honestly the best mexican food i've ever had. chips and salsa spot on with flavor, always eat as much as i can when it comes to that. i've tried the <mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark>. mouth watering tender marinated <mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark>. although they we're good, i've fallen in love with the breaded fish tacos. they look small, once they arrive but they will fill you up.\n\neverything that hits the plate, hits your mouth and tastebuds with flavor. been to this restaurant about three times and it's great everytime. on top of that, they make their own tortillas! \n\nif ever you're in the mandalay bay and looking for great food try border grill. it's a very good restaurant that's hip. owned by the too hot tamales! they also have a decent size cantina. overall restaurant is very clean and service isn't too bad but could use a little bit of improvement.", 
            "my recent visit to border grill was not as positive as my previous visits. my first review was based on a few trips to the establishment, which were great experiences. since then, they have remodeled and things within have changed. in my first review i mentioned that the service could use a little improvement. the service in my opinion has taken a step forward. the food didn't taste the same.\n\nthis establishment has changed. what i used to, widely regard as the best mexican food i've ever had, no longer is. the service takes a step forward while the food takes a step back. the <mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark>, still tender but was a little saltier than i remember, smaller portion of steak too. i had the citrus chicken burrito, which my waiter recommended as the best item on the menu. it wasn't the best item!!! the fish tacos are still the best item they have to offer. which i had a little bit of. the beer battered chicken strips, was terrible for the kids menu.\n\ni'm very upset with my latest experience at the border grill. i can't say i would go back, next time i'm in vegas. <mark>The Ultimate Border Grill Experience</mark> was very unsatisfying. adding brunch menu probably not the best idea.",

(presuming, that is, that vegetables for salsa are grown in a field, which they are probably not, but i digress...)  our starter was a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, which was really really flavorful.  we had a selection of three main courses - the <mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark>, the <mark>Chicken Poblano Enchiladas</mark> and the chille relleno.  the <mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark> was juicy, tender and really well seasoned.  the enchiladas had a delicious spicy sauce.  i didn't try the chille relleno, but it looked great.  for dessert, we had fresh berries with mint and whipped cream, which came in cute little yummy edible baskets.   i also highly recommend the house-made peach lemonade.  \n\noverall, an absolutely fantastic experience - highly, highly recommend!", 
            "because we were staying at thehotel at mandalay bay, i had read up extensively on the restaurants within the area. border grill had gotten rave reviews and sounded like my kind of restaurant, given my love for mexican food and restaurants with rave reviews :).\n\nit was a nice day and we sat out on the patio area, though there really is no view unless you have one of the seats on the very outside.. then you would be able to overlook the mandalay bay beach and lazy river area, though i'm not sure it would have been much of a view either way.\n\ni ordered the <mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark> (also referred to as their \"marinated <mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark>\") based on positive reviews from my fellow yelpers. for $24, it's a little pricey for what it is outside of vegas, but it does come with a pretty generous serving of steak. also comes with tortillas, sides of corn, tomatoes, and baked beans (forgive me if i did not describe them in fancy terms.. if you want that, you can check the menu on their website). the food is delicious and very flavorful, definitely characteristic of \"upscale mexican.\"\n\nmy girlfriend got the duck tacos at $19, which comes with the same sides of corn, tomatoes, and baked beans. the duck tacos are relatively small, but i did get a taste of the duck and it was very good. my girlfriend didn't think they were anything special, but she is definitely more food snob than i (sorry babe, but it's true!).\n\nif this review were just up to the food, i would give border grill 4 stars. however, service was not good. our waitress was just never around, and that alone can shift the mood of the dining experience drastically. the waitress took our order while we continued to look over the drink menu, but was then never to be seen again until after our food came out. because of this, we never got to order our drinks. and guess what, she never checked on us again until we were done eating. and damnit, the restaurant was not even busy!!\n\nbecause of lackluster service and $1 for regular water (what, you couldn't throw free water with a $50 lunch?), i am giving border grill 3 stars. if service had been just average, i'd of given border grill 4 stars. and if service was excellent, 4.5 (nice atmosphere).\n\ncheck out my photos for pics of the food.", 
            "food was very fresh tasting and well seasoned. we really enjoyed the <mark>Baja Ceviche</mark>. i had lunch with my daughter and she didn't know what that was and our server( sarah) wad very helpful. she was very good at explaining the items on the menu. my daughter had the <mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark>, it was so delicious! i had the <mark>Yucatan Pork</mark> which was good but the steak was way better! i had a cadillac margarita that was really good! it is pricey but it is delicious! \nwe did have a dessert it was like a tres leche churro minis, it was terrible! do not order! it sounds delicious but this kind of restaurant should never let it leave the kitchen. the churro's were not crispy and the filling wasn't even in the them anymore. that was my only complaint.", 
            "we ate here our second night in vegas after suffering through the first night eating at rm seafood (also located in mandalay bay). \n\ni had the <mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark> which was excellent! very tender and marinated in garlic, cilantro, cumin and lime. my fiance and i shared the tres leches for dessert. yummy! \n\nreasonably priced and excellent service! we felt completely ripped off after eating at rm seafood the night before so we were very happy to receive the level of customer service you'd expect in las vegas. \n\nlooking forward to going back and eating here again!",

            "i think i may have come here with expectations that were over the top. however, the food here is good, i just don't think it warrants me being a fan of it, or saying this is as good as it gets. this has been a trend with \"celebrity chef\" restaurants i have eaten at lately. i came here for their \"border brunch\" $29.99 all you can eat breakfast tapas. plus my friends and i opted for the extra $5 bottomless mimosas.\n\ni had the orange mimosa, which i am sure i would have enjoyed more had i not drunk myself into a stupor the night previous. it was still a good mimosa though. as for the tapas i tried:\n\nbreakfast enchilada - spicy, spicy! seriously this thing had some heat. the flavors were good, but i think it gave me heartburn while i was sitting there at the table.\n\n<mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark> & egg - my second favorite dish. the steak was cooked well, the egg was a nice touch, the guac was good.\n\nperuvian shrimp & grits - okay. is it just me or does it bother anyone else when shrimp is covered in sauce, and yet the tail is still connected, so you have to dig through the sauce, pick up the shrimp and eat it with your fingers because you don't want to be eating shell? this is a good dish though and a surprisingly good combo.\n\npancakes - i forget exactly what these were called, but they were basically mini pancakes with a lot of chocolate chips. pretty much a sugar high on a plate.\n\nchorizo and egg tacos - my favorite dish of all. i kind of wish i had just ordered a bunch of these tacos to be honest. they were just freaking good. and you get two on a plate, so that's a nice touch. really, i'm thinking about these tacos right now and i want them.\n\nanyway, i just don't think this place warrants its high prices. i feel as though the brunch could be priced $5 cheaper because of the quality of the food. yes, maybe it's a top chef or whatever, but i just don't think this place feels like a place where i should be shelling out $8 for coffee, which i did not do by the way, even though i was wishing for coffee so bad during my meal.\n\noverall, it's okay. it's not great, especially when compared to so many other places you can go on the strip, or in las vegas in general. would i come back? maybe just for the chorizo and egg tacos....",

            "this review is for sunday brunch menu. came here on the recommendation of our server from verandah when we were there for rw. brunch is my favorite meal, and this was so disappointing.  we had a reservation for the patio, which was basically a fully covered seating area with one half of it open, wouldn't exactly call it a patio. the brunch menu is tapas style, all you can eat for $29.99, and you can add bottomless mimosas for $5. there was about 18 items on the menu, and since there was 3 of us we decided to just try everything and go down the menu. brunch was started with fresh fruit that was drizzled with some kind of mango sauce and also guava empanadas (fresh fruit would have been great without the sauce on top). i started noticing a theme after the first 4 dishes came out. everything was so sweet and heavily sauced. the green corn tamale was so sweet each of us could only handle two bites, the mexican rice pudding parfait (i love rice pudding) was so overpowered my the taste of cinnamon it wasn't edible. the bacon jalapeno pbj intrigued me, i am really into wierd food combinations, this was basically jiffy pb & grape jelly thrown on a biscuit. no points. the peruvian shrimp & grits i was excited about as well, but the grits were stuck together and hard like they had been sitting prepared for awhile. the yucatan eggs benedict had shredded pork, again i we tasted was cinnamon, we asked if there was a mole sauce on it and our waitress said no, it was what the meat was marinated in. i came to the conclusion that the ingredients they use were sub par, so having to marinate the meats to cover the meat is what they do. pork shouldn't need a lot of added marinate. the only item that the 3 of us actually finished was the <mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark> & egg and the huevos rancheros. pretty bad odds out of 18 dishes. on to the $5 bottomless mimosas, i should have known not to go there, they offered 5 different flavors to add to the champagne, we each tried them and couldn't finish any. i mean i know they aren't serving pj but rather korbel....i had the worst headache for the rest of the day after that crap. have you ever felt so gross and swollen and lethargic after eating a terrible meal? well this is exactly how i felt. \nif you're looking for a spanish style brunch, check out firefly's brunch.",

            "when i asked my mom what type of food she wanted for her birthday, she suggested brunch or mexican and the first place that came to mind was border grill. \n\ni have been on numerous occasions in the past for both brunch and dinner and have always liked border grill, but hadn't been in quite some time so was excited to see if they have stayed consistent over the years and what new dishes they had to try. we arrived at 11 on the dot and were seated quickly on the covered patio. our drink orders were taken and the fruit and guava pastry was brought out for us to enjoy. \n\nwe ordered just about everything off the brunch menu but here are a few of the notable items we tried. \n\nloved: \n\n-green corn tamale (sweet corn * sour cream * salsa fresca) i'm a sucker for sweet <mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark>, so there really wasn't much i didn't love about this dish. \n-peruvian shrimp and grits (aji panca chile marinated shrimp * roasted poblano chiles creamy parmesan grits) - nice kick and flavor. \n-<mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark> and egg (egg cooked your way * crispy poblano potatoes) - my fella loved this dish so much he ordered it twice. the steak was cooked well and had a great texture. one of the highlights of the meal.\n-machaca chilaquiles (slow cooked beef brisket * crispy corn tortilla chips\nmexican cheeses * roasted chiles * egg cooked your way) - my mom's favorite dish. the brisket was moist and flavorful and the dish had a nice kick. definitely a must order. \n-waffle and pork belly with maple syrup (french waffle * crispy pork belly * maple syrup) - this was one of my favorite dishes. pork was cooked well and i really enjoyed the sweet and savory flavor combination. big fan. \n\nliked: \n\n-short rib hash and egg (negra modelo braised beef short ribs * boniato yams * caramelized onions) - this dish was just ok. the short ribs were entirely too sweet and i had entirely too many onions for any of our tastes. \n-breakfast fries (hand cut fries * crispy carnitas * chipotle hollandaise\njalape\\u00f1o bacon * sunny side egg) - the carnitas were great and had a fantastic crisp to them. the flavors were amazing, but i wasn't a huge fan of the fries, wish they were crispier or had more flavor. \n-bread pudding french toast (caramelized bananas * coconut syrup) - this rendition of french toast is overly sweet, but still had nice flavor in moderation. make sure you share this and order it for dessert. \ncrispy potato rajas taco (roasted potatoes and chiles * mexican cheeses\nguacamole * grilled corn relish * chipotle aioli) - nice and spicy, definitely a good dish, if only it had some protein or meat in it to balance it out a bit more. \nlobster pancakes (savory corn lobster pancake * chipotle sauce\nsunny side egg * crispy leeks) - this dish was enjoyable, not a lot of lobster in it and i wish the pancake had a fluffier texture, though. \n\nhated: \n\n-churro tots (dulce de leche infused churros * cinnamon sugar * whipped cream) - this dish sounded amazing in theory, but when they arrived, they were hard little balls lacking flavor and texture. definitely pass on these.\n-yucatan egg benedict (manchego cheese biscuit * yucatan roasted pork\nslow cooked egg * hollandaise sauce * pickled onions) - i can never resist an eggs benedict, the exception lies here. the cheese biscuit was overly doughy and pretty unappetizing. nothing about this dish worked for me, which was disappointing. \n-breakfast enchilada (citrus chicken * guajillo sauce * mexican cheeses\nblack beans * fried egg) - this dish was the worst of the worst. first off, it came out cold. nothing could be a bigger turn off. the flavor was meh and since it was cold we had no interest in delving further into it. \n\noverall, my mom had a fantastic birthday meal and that's all i wanted from border grill and they definitely delivered all that and more. they even surprised my mom with a chocolate mousse cake to cap off a very nice brunch experience. i can't believe i've left if off my radar for so long in between visits. make sure to get their rewards card if you're a local as they offer discounts!", 
            "brunch and i have a love hate relationship. i love me an excuse to drink early in the day. i love me the straddled line between breakfast and lunch. i also love me the $35 something price tag for their all you can eat brunch. add $8 for all you can drink mimosas and i am on my way to a great sunday afternoon. \n\nthey do small plates for all of their brunch offerings. if you are there with a large party, they will prepare items on platters and present it family style. \n\nwhat we had:\n\n<mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark>- it was less a solid tamale and more of a corn pudding style in consistency. the flavors were amazing. it has a little kick, but the corn was so bright and sweet. \n\nplantain empandas- the sweetness of the bananas balanced out the saltiness of the cheese and black beans. the green chilies made it a well rounded dish.\n\nbacon jalapeno pb&j- loved this dish. it is a fat kids dream. a breakfast sandwich jammed together with every kids favorite simple sandwich makes me drool a little bit. i won't lie, i make these at home from time to time and this version is everything i want it to be and more.\n\nperuvian shrimp and grits- uh, yes please. the sauce has a kick and the grits are creamy.\n\n<mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark> and eggs- the meat and eggs are cooked to perfect. the best protein on the menu.\n\nyucatan eggs benedict- too much biscuit. it is basically a toad in a hole, but overwhelming.\n\nmachaca chiaquiles- a pile of mush. odd dish.\n\nshort rib hash and eggs- too many eggs by this point. how many innocent casualties must be left in our path!\n\nchurro tots- not as good as they sound. odd sweet and sourness to them. not quite a beignet, not quite a doughnut.\n\nfig & blue cheese quesadillas- the figs were the best part. everything else got left behind.\n\nlobster pancakes- the biggest disappointment of the day. little to no lobster sprinkled on top and it was an actual pancake. weird combination.\n\nby the end, we were all tired and stuffed. the beginning half of the menu is by far the better half. i could have stopped at the churro tots and not think twice about the rest.", 
            "\"death by all you can order brunch\"\n\non our search for a good sunday brunch on the las vegas strip, my husband and i came across border grill on yelp.  we have been to border grill in santa monica for happy hour, and really enjoyed the tacos we ate there, but when we saw the brunch menu here, we were sold.  you see, my husband is a huge fan of anything \"all you can eat\", but i don't love buffets because the food is often mediocre and the thought of people digging through the same food kind of skeeves me out.  border grill serves an \"all you can eat\" brunch for $34.99 per person, but you actually order small plates off a menu.  the best of both worlds for us, especially when for an additional $8, you can add bottomless mimosas!\n\nwe made a reservation via open table for 11am, and were sat at a great table on the patio overlooking the pool area at mandalay bay.  we started off ordering 2 dishes each, and subsequently 1 dish each thereafter.  we never felt rushed by our server, which was a pleasant surprise.  before our first dishes came, we were brought some delicious flaky empanadas, and the best <mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark> i've ever had (not being a fan of tamales, this was a great surprise)!  the mimosas were great, generous on the champagne, and there were many flavors to sample.  we had the typical orange juice mimosas, as well as peach, pomegranate, and my favorite, cucumber lemon.  here is a list of the items we sampled, in the order we ate them, and our assessment:\n\nbreakfast enchilada- good, but the corn tortilla was hard to cut\nshrimp and grits- delicious, shrimp were cooked perfectly\n<mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark> and eggs- best thing on the menu.  the steak was perfectly medium rare and well seasoned\nshort rib hash and egg- average\n\ncrispy potato rajas taco- crispy and yummy\nbiscuits and sausage gravy- gravy was delish but 1 biscuit would have been plenty\n\nbreakfast fries- smothered french fries, so delicious and bad for you, in a good way\nbacon jalapeno pbj- a unique blending of flavors, but i didn't love it as much as i thought i would\n\nlobster pancake- i enjoyed this, my husband did not like\nwaffle with pork belly and syrup- a wonderful blend of sweet and savory\n\n<mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark> and eggs- so good we ordered it again but can't finish it\nbread pudding french toast- decadent and delicious, but i'm starting to feel like there's a brick in my stomach\n\nchurro tots- oh dear god we ordered too much and i feel like i might die\n\nthe food was so delicious we could not stop eating until we literally felt like we were going to explode.  it was all so amazing and delicious.  i don't regret our gluttonous brunch whatsoever because the food was just that yummy.  suffice it to say we wobbled back to our hotel, took a food/champagne nap, and didn't eat much of anything for the rest of the day.  it was so worth it, and i can't wait to go back to border grill for brunch so i can experience death by all you can order brunch once again.",

            "border grill is hands down the best brunch on the strip- and you heard it from me, c. everet bruncher the 3rd. their brunch combines usual breakfast fare- waffles, eggs, hash browns, with southwestern flavors- tomatillos, guava, chills, and then throws it at your face tappas style instead of trough style like many inferior brunch buffets. when i moved to vegas i had just finished watching the season of top chef pro or whatever its called were mary sue came in second place so i was extremely eager to try this place. as i walked through the desolate mandalay bay (apparently there was no nascar event or p diddy concert, the only things that seem to make this place busy) and got to the restaurant which was only about 1/2 full i started to get a bit worried. had i wasted the precious calories it took to walk here from self park? that walk took at least 4 minutes and i don't undertake such journeys lightly- too large a risk of orcs. \n\nas soon as we were seated we were brought a trio of regular human salsas and then a 4th devils brew salsa seemingly designed to make gitmo detainees talk. service was attentive but not annoying, and since for this brunch you are dependent on your server to bring you the food that is crucial as even a 5-10 minute gap could result in a riot. \n\nthe menu changes every 2-3 months or so, but it is always around 20 small plate items, 3-4 of which is more than enough to fill up the average person. combine that with all you can drink mimosas- that come in like 15 different flavors- and breakfast margaritas... which as far as i can tell is just a regular margarita with a little vanilla in it. what a glorious place where you can get drunk at 10am as long as your drinks have a splash of vanilla. america. \n\nsome menu highlights\n\npigs in  blanket- comes with a manchego cheese dipping sauce that i would drink by the glass if possible- by the glass i say. \n\nchurro tots- i mean, if you needed me to tell you to order these than there is something seriously wrong with you.\n\nbreakfast fries- basically hashbrowns with three delicious sauces spread around them. \n\nwaffle - i have had this twice, once it came with pork belly which was amazing, the other time it came with \"ham\" which appeared to just be bacon cooked inside the waffle itself. the pork belly was definitely better but i'm not gonna split hairs over a bacon stuffed waffle. \n\neggs benedict- this comes with like picked red onion or picked radish or something on it that sort of taints the dish and makes it all pink. order without that.\n\nsteak and eggs- great. you prob get a solid 6 ounces of <mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark> with each order. it has a delicious black bean puree underneath it all. a must get.\n\noyster taco- this came with way more vegetables than i was expecting so i just ate the cornbread battered fried oyster. would eat again. \n\n\nsome things to avoid\n\nbrisket sliders- these are prepared like a vietnamese sandwich. you know all those people who when eating good bbq brisket say \"damn this needs some carrots and cilantro\"... oh wait thats no one. \n\nfruit creme brule- meh, i mean its yogurt, not sure why i ordered this. my b",

            "i've been wanting to try the border grill in la for the longest time.  but i was in las vegas for the weekend staying at mandalay bay, and there was a border grill at the mandalay!  so me and my friends decided to give it a try.  i'm not a vegas person at all since i don't like to gamble.  so i was just there for the pool, drinks and food!  \nsusan feniger of the two hot tamales is the mastermind of border grill.  i've heard a lot of great things about it, so i was very excited to try it out!\nwe started out with the cadillac margaritas and guacamole and chips.  i like my margaritas on the rocks no salt.  the waiter delivered mine with salt.  no biggie, i just wiped the salt away.\nthe guacamole was okay.  it was a bit on the creamy side for my taste.   i prefer guacamole on the chunky side.  one of my friends just loved the guac.\ni decided to order one of the specials for the evening, which was highly recommended by our waiter.  it was tuna encrusted with pistachio served over a pobalno risotto topped with a jicama slaw.  my other two friends ordered the <mark>Chile Relleno</mark> and the pork slowly cooked in banana leaves.  \nthe tuna was way overcooked.  so overcooked that it was dry.  the waiter when explaining the special said it was cooked medium (slightly pink).  the risotto was also a big disappointment.  some parts seemed like it wasn't cooked enough.  my dish was a big disappointment.  also, my meal wish lukewarm at best.  it seemed like it was sitting out for a while.  i should've returned it after the first bite but i didn't since i had a second cadillac margarita to wash it down.\nmy friend's meals were way better than mine.  the <mark>Chile Relleno</mark> was very good.  but i thought the best meal was the pork slowly cooked in banana leaves.  it was cooked perfectly and great flavor.\nfor dessert we shared the empanadas stuffed with dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and white chocolate.  and we also shared the homemade ice cream, a scoop of vanilla bean, and a scoop of kahlua chip.  the dessert was the best part of the meal for me, unfortunately.  i really wanted to love border grill.  but my tuna special was a big disappointment.  i may give it a second try...this time checking out the la restaurant.", 
            "warm taco chips and 3 excellent dips were served.  ann's entr\\u00e9e was a <mark>Chile Relleno</mark> (a roasted poblano pepper, manchego cheese, panela, cotija cheese), tomatillo salsa, spanish rice and refried black beans.  i settled on <mark>Yucatan Pork</mark> - achiote pork roasted in a banana leaf, grilled pickled onion, guacamole, fried plantains, refried black beans, spanish rice and 3 handmade corn tortillas.  we have enjoyed both of these entrees in the past and were not disappointed this evening.  i had a few extra dollars left to use on our gift certificate so we ordered half slices of flan and a tres leches cake with passion fruit and prickly pear sauce.", 
            "came here for dinner last friday and it's so improved from last time! everything was perfect! from the staff to the drinks to the food, it was all superb! \n\nfirst of all, rachel (our waitress) chris and destiny were all attentive and very helpful. \n\nwe had the following... \nguacamole with chips and salsa \nribeye \nempanadas \n<mark>Chile Relleno</mark> \nahi tar tar \nblood orange ginger margaritas \nvodka b----- (can't recall the name but so refreshing) :-) \n\neverything was perfect. i am salivating every time i think of the tuna tar tar and that yummy green sauce it was served with. \n\nalthough this was the best meal we had in a long time and we were stuffed, we decided to finish it off with tres leches. i never had anything that good. \n\ni will absolutely be back here every time i am back in vegas. i highly recommend the border grill for anyone that wants a great meal and service. they have seating inside and outside and it's equally good for groups as it is for romantic dinners. \n\nthank you border grill for a great experience! keep up the great work!!! :-)", 
            "i pretty much deem border grill the best mexican restaurant in vegas. open for brunch, lunch, and dinner. food is always great. and service is always exceptional.\n\ni have never had even a slightly so-so experience at border grill. everything has always been fantastic here. and that's over the course of a few years and at all times of the day.\n\npersonally, i prefer to eat outside on the patio (which overlooks the pool area). and you can't go wrong with choosing a drink or entree off the rotating list of specials.\n\nthe various margaritas and mojitos i have tried have all been great. and my favorite standard menu item is the <mark>Chile Relleno</mark>. absolutely one of the best <mark>Chile Relleno</mark> i've ever had anywhere.\n\nand be sure to check out their brunch menu. the entree offerings are interesting and flavorful. and seriously some of the best (and biggest) cinnamon rolls ever.\n\ni also really appreciate the fact that they have a locals vip club. when you join, you get a discount card for 15% off your meal every time you visit and you receive various special offers via email. you gotta like strip restaurants that offer some locals love.", 
            "we had a lovely beer-soaked lunch on the covered patio here last weekend. the <mark>Chile Relleno</mark> burger called to me, but i couldn't rightly order a burger at a mexican place like this. so, i opted for the shrimp tacos and did not regret it. the shrimp were plump, the tacos spicy and the sides of beans and rice were light and fresh. my husband had the chilaquiles, which were amazingly good. we had to physically restrain ourselves around the chips and salsa, and the delightfully oniony guacamole.  \n\nmy only complaint (and the reason for a star loss) is that they charge 50 cents a person for their water. but i didn't learn that from the waiter. he just showed up and started pouring. nope, the note about the extra charge was buried in tiny print on the menu. i know it's just 50 cents, but a) that adds up over time and b) it's just bad form to sneak stuff like that on people. it would have been nice if the waiter had stated the charge up front and let us decide whether that was okay.", 
            "i was just expecting so much better. so, so much better. i honestly can't remember much about <mark>The Ultimate Border Grill Experience</mark> except that i think i got fish tacos that were ok, my husbands <mark>Chile Relleno</mark> was pretty good but the big thing was the rice that came with it. it was awful. he called it \"hotel rice.\" cheap, bland rice. it had color, so i think it was supposed to be flavored but, alas, it tasted like nothing. it was a lot of money for mediocre food. there are a lot of places you can spend too much money on food on the strip -- don't do it here.", 
            "we ate here on a saturday night for our girls weekend in vegas. we were all very excited to see what the 2 hot tamales are all about. we had reservations and were seated promptly in the upstairs balcony. this gave us a perfect view of the train concert going on in the pool area and provided wonderful background noise. the guacamole was worth the extra money but there wasn't any spice to the salsas with the chips. if there was an alternative available it was not offered. i shared the <mark>Peruvian Ceviche</mark> and sweet <mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark> with a friend. i loved the plantain chips with the ceviche and thought it was very refreshing. the tamales had wonderful flavor but was so wet it had to be eaten with a spoon. for the entree we had the seafood <mark>Chile Relleno</mark>. the pepper was nice and crisp with a very flavorful filling. over all it was a very nice atmosphere and good service. i would definitely come back.", 
            "have been wanting to go to susan feniger and mary sue milliken's restaurant since being awed by their performances on top chef masters.  i was not disappointed.  \nto start off, the staff were lovely - attentive, humorous, engaging and very helpful.  the decor is inviting and vibrant, setting the tone just right for a fun night.\nyeah, it's just mexican food, but it's fricking delicious mexican food.  to start, would recommend the appetizer sampler - the most amazing corn tamale ever along with other succulent delectations.  i also recommend the braised short ribs - some of the best short ribs i've ever had, and believe me when i say, i've eaten a whole bunch.  my wife had the special which was a seafood <mark>Chile Relleno</mark> which was a little heavy on the carrot salad and sauces, and a little light on the crab.\nall in all, worth the trip down the strip.", 
            "the downstairs outdoor dining is wonderful.  the best <mark>Chile Relleno</mark>  out there!", 
            "if it were possible to award an eatery a negative value of stars, i would most certainly have given border grill a negative 10. \n\ni arrived in the company of four other people, in the late afternoon after going to the aquarium exhibit. we were all very hungry, and excited to get some mexican food. we're from texas, and thought it would be interesting to see how a top chef's award-winning mexican food would measure up to the stellar tex-mex food to which we are accustomed. \n\nupon arrival, the hostess was cheery enough, if a bit of an airhead. after being seated, we waited a full five minutes before even being greeted by a server. following a perfunctory greeting, we were brought chips and salsa (both lackluster and bland) and had to wait another 5 minutes for water. the waiter was nice enough, but seemed to be mostly unconcerned with giving us good service, or making a decent impression.\n\nthe menu itself was rather pricey. if you're at a place that charges $ 4.50 for a fish taco a la carte (with a tortilla the size of a drink coaster and an even smaller filet of mahi mahi), you know you won't be able to leave the restaurant without paying upwards of $ 25.00 per person/ per dish. the food is billed as \"mexican\", but there were no true mexican dishes on the menu. everything seemed to be more central/ south american.\n\nlet me preface my actual food review by saying that we waited a grand total of 35 minutes for our food to arrive. i was to the point of trying to eat our waiter, who had already conveniently disappeared. \n\ni ordered the <mark>Chile Relleno</mark> burger, with paprika seasoned fries, and a fish taco a la carte. i asked for the burger rare, because 1) it cuts down on cooking time and i was ravenous, and 2) i simply cannot stand an overcooked, rubbery meat patty. \nthe other members of my party ordered 1) crab nachos 2) beef nachos 3) avocado tacos 4) chicken <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>. \n1) the crab nachos were adequate. for a self-proclaimed \"grill\" specializing in seafood, the meat was rather bland and tasteless, and were downplayed by the plethora of toppings heaped upon the actual chip.\n2)the beef nachos were already limp when they arrived at the table. the meat was wholly bland, and the kitchen chose to under-employ cheese, making the overall nacho rather boring.\n3) the avocado tacos were a great disappointment. as said by the consumer of the food, the idea of the avocado tacos was excellent, but the actual execution of the taco was underwhelming. \n4) the chicken <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> was probably the worst thing served. you might be questioning how in the world a kitchen can mess up that which is essentially chopped greens and a simple meat fillet. well, when your \"caesar dressing\" is the taste and consistency of mayonnaise, and is literally drenching the salad, you tend to look unfavorably upon the dish. \n5) my <mark>Chile Relleno</mark> burger was probably the best thing served. the burger was cooked to my standard, and the <mark>Chile Relleno</mark> itself was decent, if a bit bland. the fries were the only really yummy thing served, and i'm not sure that's something a mexican restaurant should be proud of. \n6)the fish taco was terrible. the corn tortilla (while \"homemade\") was bland and too thick, and the filet of mahi mahi was too thick, overcooked, and bland. the guacamole tasted like something you could get at the grocery store, and was heavily salted. \n\nthe overall really shocking thing to me was the lack of seasoning. the chefs behind the menu are award-winning and famed, but don't know how to use simple seasoning on their food to make it palatable. \n\nthe bill wound up being over $ 150.00 (when the checkbook finally made it to the table), and we paid up, left a tip, and got the hell out of there. i wound up with gastrointestinal issues later on that night. if you're looking for good mexican food, i highly suggest going elsewhere. to give you an idea of how deeply disappointing this food was, i would suggest going to taco bell instead. at least there, you're only paying $.99 for a taco, and the diarrhea is cheaper.", 
            "i was served some salsa (3 types) and tortillas when i ordered my dinner. the three salsas served with the tortillas were very good. the prices for the entrees are on the pricy side for a classical mexican menu. i had the <mark>Chile Relleno</mark>. it was good,  but not the best i have had. the staff was great, and service was fast.", 
            "one of my favorite restaurants in los angeles has made it to las vegas.\n\nthe vibrantly colored, upscale mexican restaurant with cuisine created by celebrity chefs susan feniger and mary sue milliken has been a legend in santa monica for decades, but they recently expanded their business by opening a new restaurant in downtown la, sending a food trucks out into the streets of los angeles, and launching a location in mandalay bay. i'm happy to say that the vegas version of the iconic restaurant lives up to the reputation of the original created by the \"two hot tamales.\"\n\nstuffed plantains, <mark>Chile Relleno</mark>, slow-cooked carnitas... the menu is made entirely of perfectly crafted mexican deliciousness. and their strong, flavorful, and margaritas are unforgettable (unless you drink too many, in which case you'll forget more than the drinks you had at the restaurant).\n\nthe mandalay version also features the same energetic and colorful graffiti art  on the walls that the santa monica version is known for, with views of mandalay's pool area.\n\ni love the border grill so much and the vegas version does not disappoint.", 
            "my local friend and i came here during restaurant week (last week). we each had the 3 course tasting menu, which by the way, is on the regular menu but is marked up $8 additional during restaurant week. they say it's because $4 goes to a children's charity, which is great, but what about the other $4?\n\ni had the mushroom empanadas, the shrimp enchiladas in \"lobster sauce\", and the only dessert option which was some dark chocolate cookie sandwich (whoopie pie) and some cinnamon cream (?horchata). my friend had tuna tartare (more like a a hawaiian poke) and the steak. \n\nfood: where do i begin? oh i know...umm yes, the food was disgusting!! i'm sorry, i never like to say something like this, but both us felt the food was absolutely horrible. i even took home my leftovers and tried to eat them later, but i couldn't. i had to throw them away, and i don't usually throw food away. the flavors were completely off, did not compliment each other at all, and were very unbalanced. they have a sign outside saying this is the most authentic mexican food. that could not be further from the truth. it seems as if the chef is trying very hard to create gourmet dishes, but ended up creating very very pretentious dishes that did not taste good at all. whoever is in the kitchen does not appear to know how to work with ingredients and flavors. \n\nthe hawaiian-poke-style tuna tartare: very very strong flavor of dark sesame oil and soy sauce. sesame oil is a strong flavor, and is supposed to be used lightly. the chef dumped it onto the tuna as a sauce. same with the soy sauce.\n\nmushroom empanadas: the three small pieces were fried, but the crust was chewy and almost stale tasting, instead of crispy. the filling had almost no flavor. the sauce made of black beans, also had no flavor. \n\nthe shrimp enchilladas: very salty, but flavorless. the filling had a fishy taste, which i didn't expect for shrimp, but otherwise had no flavor. the tortillas had a soft, doughy texture that was more like cornbread. the sauce was a pretty shade of orange, but tasted like salty cream, no real flavor at all.\n\nthe dessert: this was absolutely the worst dish. neither of us could eat it. the stuffed cake/cookie thing was stale and had a strange chewiness. it was a very very dark chocolate and had almost no sweetness at all. the cream filling was sort of hard, not creamy, and did not taste sweet or good. the accompanying cinnamon horchata was ok, but very strongly cinnamon-flavored, and nothing else, not sweet.\n\ni cannot comment on the steak, because i don't eat beef.\n\nright after i left vegas, i read an article about the chef/owner, susan feniger, in westways magazine. the article presented her as doing innovative things with authentic mexican food, which is something i would be interested in trying. i was very disappointed that i had such a poor experience. to be fair, the article was about the (original) santa monica location, which hopefully might be better, and i would be willing to give it a try.\n\nprices: ridiculous! i know it's mandalay bay, and it's also a \"gourmet\" restaurant, but even so, the prices were way over the top. my plate of two enchilladas (with no accompanying beans or rice or anything) would be $27 if a la carte. the cheapest entree was an a la carte <mark>Chile Relleno</mark>, which was $19. our three-course menus are normally $42. however, the exact same menu was bumped up to $50 for restaurant week. when we asked why the price was elevated, we were told that $4 per person is donated to a children's charity during restaurant week. that does not account for an $8 price increase. \n\nambience: it's ok, like a typical four star mexican restaurant. the patio seating overlooking the pool is nice. \n\nservice: this is the only reason i'm giving two stars instead of one. our server, kelly, was very friendly, accommodating, very attentive, and just overall amazing. she was very pushy in the beginning trying to make us order more items, but other than that, it was some of the best service i've had. \n\npros: service, location in mandalay bay\n\ncons: food (very poorly executed, bad taste); price\n\nbottom line: something seems to be lost in translation between the chef owner who is in california, and the staff of this vegas location. the food is horrible!", 
            "had an amazing lunch today! my friend for the <mark>Chile Relleno</mark> and that looked fantastic! i had the <mark>Short Rib Enchiladas</mark> and oh my goodness...heaven on a plate! so juicy and delicious and i would definitely come back for more. the service was good as well, our waitress was very knowledgable and attentive. all in all...good place!", 
            "mediocre in a number of ways:\n\nwhile the place was not full by any means i felt rushed from beginning to end\n\nthe prices are high (of course - it's vegas) and the portions are small\n\nasked how large the large margarita was - waiter indicates bucket size so ordered a standard patron which was small and little if any booze in it - $14\n\nwas dining alone (my wife in the room with broken bones and a nurse) so indicated i would want a to go meal at the end, didn't actually specify what it would be, let alone order it until i ordered my flan - specified twice that i wanted the warm to go order 10 minutes after i got my flan. you guessed it!! rush, rush get the bastard out the door as quick as possible and on to the next - my to go order comes with no sign of the flan. thanks guys - you pretty much suck when it comes to service\n\nthe <mark>Chile Relleno</mark> ($19) was so so, the side of guacamole ($9.50) pretty tasteless, <mark>Carne Asada Quesadilla</mark> ($19 i believe) passable.", 
            "we had lunch here and the food and outdoor seating was very nice.  <mark>Chile Relleno</mark> and quinao fritters were very good.  <mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark> tasted good but were too wet and just fell apart into mush.  prices were reasonable for vegas.  food was better than the other upscale mexican restaurant we ate at (hecho en vegas).", 
            "where have you been hiding, border grill?  how have i lived in lv and missed this place for the last 7 years? \n\nin the span of two weeks, i found myself here for dinner and then sunday brunch.  i feel like i should be embarrassed about this, but i have no shame.  if you force me to choose, i would say brunch is the star, but dinner was pretty fantastic too.  the chips and salsa in this town can be very hit or miss.  border grill's delivers.  i had <mark>Chile Relleno</mark> for dinner and loved it.\n\nwhen i returned for brunch, i was corralled by a friend who swears their brunch is the best in town.  i am a die hard dw bistro fan so i was prepared to set her straight.  then i tried the chilaquiles.  and the <mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark> and eggs.  and the breakfast fries.\n\nfor $34.99, you get unlimited small plates.  the quality of the food is unexpectedly good for this price point.  everything is fresh and the small plates allow you to try several things instead of limiting you to one large dish.  the only negative is that a few of the hot dishes did not come out piping hot, but this is likely due to the rush of people in the place.  you really cannot compare dw and border grill because the food, ambience and intentions are totally different.  this is a great spot for endless food options, bottomless mimosas and mexican inspired brunch.  can't wait to go back.", 
            "we have frequented this restaurant ever since it first opened, but our recent visits have been for the highly regarded weekend brunch.  after signing up my wife for the vip club, i printed off a 2 for 1 entree coupon that we decided to use for dinner.  we were started off with a bowl of fresh taco chips and 3 salsas.  each of us decided on <mark>Chile Relleno</mark> for an entree - the roasted poblano peppers were enormous with each accompanied by 2 types of rice and earthy refried beans. service throughout was very good.", 
            "so you get 3 awesome salsa with chips when you sit down. we had a few cinco de mayo inspired drinks which were appropriate considering it was may the 5th. my man ordered a <mark>Chile Relleno</mark> burger which he loved. i had the fish tacos... i have to say we had just landed and went straight there, i was a little hungry. my stomach hurt after the first taco and i still dusted the plate cause i couldn't stop-too good.", 
            "came here for lunch. i was skeptical of the border brunch because it is all you can eat, and i didn't want to eat all i can eat. however, the plates are small tapas style. it's easier to manage the gluttony. everything is great. we had the breakfast fries, the esquite lettuce wraps, spicy chicken tamales, peruvian shrimp and grits, steak and egg, huevos rancheros, spanish omelette and the <mark>Chile Relleno</mark>. it was all great.", 
            "incredible staff provides excellent service and you really get a great value for the money.  <mark>Tecate Carnitas</mark> were ridiculous, <mark>Chile Relleno</mark> were great, plaintain empanadas were really good and the special soup of the day was fantastic with pieces of chorizo in a wonderful broth with loads of beans and veggies.  all around excellent experience and can't emphasize enough the bang you get for your buck.", 
            "you really need to read this. it's a bit long. but, please hang in there. it's worth it. i was amazed by their concern for my issue. i am permanently disabled and walk with a cane with constant pain. i was walking from the convention center and food court area to the casino. i was stopped by a security guard at the border grill due to some ongoing floor reconstruction. rather than telling me where i could pass, i had to ask the guard, \"where do i go?\" she sat there on her wide butt and pointed to a steep long staircase headed downward. it should have already been quite apparent to her that i was in no condition to maneuver those steps. i then asked her how could i get down there, alluding to my obvious disability. she went on and on about an elevator, a walkway downstairs, and an escalator. but her description was unclear as it was obvious that she couldn't care less about my issue.\n\nafter about 10 or 15 minutes of wandering around trying to find where to go, i finally ended up finding a hotel employee who helped me find my way. it was a long walk around. no reason existed for me to even have gone down that long hallway in the first place. no signs were posted, no detour was shown. just, \"good luck, disabled folks! you don't matter!\" i was furious. this was not right. so, as i entered the area that finally got me downstairs below the restaurant, i told the security guard i saw about the problem. he told me to go tell the manager at border grill. so, i did. here's where my day was brightened. \n\ni approached the manager, who was at their \"back door\" entrance. i told her the whole story. she seemed very concerned. however, i still wasn't feeling as though they were going to make any changes or improvements. so, i specifically asked that they find a way to divert the folks who have mobility issues so they can not go through what i just went through. she looked me right in the eye and said she'd handle it. then, she asked if i wanted lunch. i told her, \"no, i'm just walking through getting a little exercise. i just wanted to be sure nobody else has to go through that\" she again offered me lunch and a drink, almost pulling me inside the restaurant. so, i accepted her kind offer. \n\nnow to the food! lol. i had some chips and salsa (three kinds: two red, one green) and guacamole to start. it was delicious, and had good spices. i also had a \"mexican mojito,\" which really kicked some butt. then the <mark>Chile Relleno</mark> burger came. omg - just look for yourself - i posted a photo here. not only was it ridiculously huge, it was awesomely delicious as well. the fries were skin-on and fried just right, too. i barely got through half the plate. but, i did finish that drink! all-in-all a great meal. comfortable porch-like atmosphere downstairs, too. i wasn't even aware that the border grill had a downstairs until this. great service, great food, and now the best part. \n\nthe manager (i wish i remembered her name!) came back to me near the end of my meal. she told me they are using their in-house elevator to divert disabled people around the construction. this eliminated a very long walk around that mess. now, they can just go into the restaurant, take the elevator, and be where they need to be to get to the casino. viola - problem recognized and resolved within the time it took me to half-eat my free lunch. now, that's real service. they didn't have to do any of that. they could have just said, \"ok\" and left it at that; which is what i expected considering the first person (stupid lazy guard) i dealt with on this issue. but, that lady made my day. not for the free lunch. i wasn't even that hungry. but for the kindness and consideration she had, and for having implemented an immediate fix. i'm impressed. great job! great food! great service! thanks!"

            "great food! awesome service. i had a travelzoo deal and it was well worth it. everything was excellent, the chorizo fondue <mark>Sauted Shrimp and Scallops</mark> were highlights and almost too good to describe with words. the guacamole wasn't as good as the rest of the dishes, but overall, a great experience.  i would definitely go back, but probably look for the deal again because otherwise the prices were pretty high."

            "susan and mary sue did not wow us.\n\nmy wife and i were looking for a place for a light bite for dinner and decided to try this place. we shared the kobe <mark>Wagyu Beef Sopes</mark>, watercress salad and <mark>Tecate Carnitas</mark>. we told the waiter that we had a late buffet lunch and will order a few dishes to share. he seems to be very concern that we did not order enough food and kept asking if we want to order more. this made us felt uncomfortable.\n\nfirst to come was the kobe <mark>Wagyu Beef Sopes</mark>. it was tiny piece of beef wrapped in two quarter size corn masa topped with mango red cabbage mint slaw. the slaw was well seasoned and very tasty. however, i can really taste much of the beef since it was so small.\n\nnext, we had the watercrest, jaicama and orange salad. the salad was topped with 4 little bacon wrapped dates stuffed with chorizo and blue cheese. the salad was very ordinary and the bacon wrapped dates were salty.\n\nlastly, we had the <mark>Tecate Carnitas</mark>. they gave us a good portion of the carnitas for this dish. however, the taste and quality of the roast pork is very mediocre. it is like the carnitas you get from an ordinary mexican restaurant. there was only one piece tortilla came with the dish and it was all dried and cracked. it was not something that i expected a high end restaurant would serve to its diner.\n\nwhen our bill came at the end of our meal, we found that there was $1 charge for  tap water in addition to the our  other drinks. we dinned at many fine restaurants in las vegas and never have anyone charge for tap water.", 
            "about four years ago, i had the best meal of my life at border grill. unfortunately, i wasn't a proud member of yelp at the time so it went largely unnoticed.  back then, i ordered an adobada pork chop that came with mashed potatoes and greens. the thick cut pork chop was smothered in an ancho chile sauce that makes me smile just thinking about it.  unfortunately, my wife and i didn't make it back until this past saturday night. was it a special occasion? no, not really.  however, thanks to our older daughter, we were able to get out for a date night- our second in almost 3 years. so, yeah i guess it was a special occasion -for us anyway.  \n\nso off we went hoping to recapture that memory of what we long considered to be one the best meals we have ever had the privilege of eating.  before i could sit down or even look at a menu, i yelled out adobada pork chop please!  our waiter rob apologized and said that dish was no longer available on the regular menu.  what? what do you mean? there must be some mistake!  rob told us that every now and then the dish is offered as a special-just not saturday night.  now what?\n\ninstead of walking out kicking and screaming, we decided to give the new menu a shot. i settled on the <mark>Tecate Carnitas</mark> plate, and my wife chose the kobe <mark>Wagyu Beef Sopes</mark>. my dish was presented well with the tender pork in the center of the plate surrounded by fantastic guacamole, salsa, onions, cilantro, and a crunchy slaw. since i ordered both flour and corn tortillas, i prepared my own tacos and ate till my shoes started feeling tight. the kobe <mark>Wagyu Beef Sopes</mark> were great! the portion was small (3 little sopes about the size of mini muffins), but the flavor more than made up for it. the cilantro mint slaw on top was heavenly. \n\nas far as the service is concerned, we couldn't have been more satisfied. rob was friendly, attentive, and very knowledgeable about the menu. he provided us with a 10% discount since we signed up for their rewards card a number of years ago. i am glad he asked, since i forgot we did that. border grill also treated us to a free dessert since my wife and i were on a date for the first time in years. well played border grill-well played! \n\ncall it what you want--- tex-mex, mexican food, or fresh-mex.  bottom line, this place offers quality food with complex flavors that will make you want to take your wife/husband out for more dates.  \n\noh yeah, can someone let me know when the pork chop makes it back on the menu?", 
            "wow reviews are all over the place for the border grill.  i think this is a make sure you order the right thing kind of place and after reading all the glowing reviews about the carnitas, i sure did.  do your homework people, that's what yelp is for.\n\ni've been on a non-strip dining kick lately and down on the expensive absentee celebrity chef restaurants that adorn every mega resort.  so i was pleasantly surprised that susan feniger & mary sue milliken's border grill in the mandalay bay is serving up some great dishes worthy of the top chef master's themselves.  of course they aren't back in the kitchen, but everything i had tasted like they were.  hats off to executive chef michael minor and his staff for putting a lot of love into these dishes.  i'm sure when you work in a celebrety chef's kitchen, it's hard to get any notoriety, even though you are the one making all the food.\n\nif you've watched susan & mary sue on tv over the years, you know they are about ultra fresh organic produce.  this is totally evident in their salsa and fresh seasonings mixed in their dishes.  the chips and trio of salsas, were very freshly made.  i usually don't like tomatillo salsa very much, but this was wonderful and my favorite of the three with a beautiful lime taste.  the guacamole was on the mild side allowing you to taste the avocado.  sitting next to it on the plate was a pico de gallo, and some greens.  i'm not sure what variety, i just balanced a few on each chip along with the pico and guacamole for some extra flavor and texture.  i forgot to snap a photo of my own so here's tracy w.'s http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/border-grill-las-vegas#kzcg9jbvmmufiaa8hkgckg\n\nthe queso funditio was very thick, full of melted authentic mexican cheeses, chorizo, and roasted red peppers.  there was also a nice amount of guacamole cream on top that satisfied both looks and flavor.  even though their chips are very thick, don't think you are going to be scooping this dip up with the chip, you will need to place it on your chip with a fork. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/border-grill-las-vegas#t5tzf-_veo56fhmnouqoiw\n\nthe star of the show was my tacate carnitas.  the shredded pork was moist and very flavorful.  it was served on a bed of roasted corn grits.  these grits were delicious and contained lots of butter for sure.  you could really taste the corn meal flavor to them bringing to mind the flavor of a tamale.  surrounding the edge of the plate was a bold black bean puree.  the black beans are mixed with huitlacoche, which is a mushroom like fungus that grows on corn.  it has a very earthy flavor that really made these black beans something special.  how do you make a pork dish even better?  top it with crunchy bacon of course.  not just any bacon but chipotle glazed bacon.  it really added a texture here that made each bite enjoyable, after all there is a lot of mushy stuff on the plate.  it was served with a giant flour tortilla.  i just ripped pieces off and used it to balance all of these wonderful flavors together with each bite.  this is a true 5 star dish and the best carnitas i've had. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/border-grill-las-vegas#cz0orcea5rd1dprqhyzciw\n\nmy wife's dish was a little more plain, the carne asada tacos.  i can see being a little disappointed with this dish, especially in comparison with my carnitas.  the chopped up carne asada was a little dry and needed to be dressed up with salsa and topped with some black beans and oaxaca cheese, otherwise it just seemed like plain old street tacos with a $18 price tag.  the two different kinds of rice were nicely infused with fresh herbs, although it added to the dryness of the plate. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/border-grill-las-vegas#pdmm2_ciiwmmresjls3jca\n\nwe came here for lunch on a weekday, thinking it should be no wait, but was packed.  the location is right next to all the conference rooms at the mandalay bay, thus everyone was dressed in suits and trying to grab a quick nearby bite.  after a few minute wait we got a table outside on the patio overlooking the mandalay bay pool.  it wasn't too hot since it was april, but i couldn't help but notice they have a big ass fan that covers the whole patio.  it's the size of an airplane propeller.  it's one big ass fan. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/border-grill-las-vegas#lhl0l6qc71plgeaflc012w  i'm now a big ass fan of border grill, go have the <mark>Tecate Carnitas</mark> and you'll be a big ass fan too!", 
            "31 may 2014, 08:00p\n\ni've been to the santa monica and downtown la locations before so there was no objection from me when our local friend wanted to try this location.  hubby finished early so we decided to go to the restaurant and see if we could get seated earlier than our 9p reservation.\n\nit would take our friend a little while to get there so we sat at the bar and ordered a border shaker for two.  our cocktail waitress was very friendly and shortly after we ordered the bar got pretty crowded.  we were at a table and enjoyed our order.  it was so tasty that i was actually wondering if there was tequila in the drink as it was not noticeable at all.  hubby did get quite buzzy, so that answered my question.  the shaker for two comes with two cocktail glasses, a shaker, a small bottle of tequila (enough for two shakers-full) and an extra glass with the other margarita ingredients.  the shaker contains the first round of the margarita mix and the tequila is added at the table before it's shaken (without a top).  when you're ready for round two, pour the second batch of mix into the mixer and add the rest of the tequila.  note, the first round only had about a third of the tequila in it and the second round was too much to fit into the mixer.  we actually had to pour the tequila into our cocktail glasses.  well worth the $29!\n\nour friend arrived and we were able to be seated an hour earlier than our 9p reservation time.  we were seated outside and even though it was still in the 90s, the sun had set, there was a breeze and it was actually quite comfortable.  water was poured and chips with three types of salsa were brought to the table.  the chips are very light and crispy and appeared to be flour tortillas versus the traditional corn tortillas.  there is a red salsa, a green salsa and a chipotle salsa.  all three are good, but the smokiness of the chipotle easily made it my favorite.  the green came in a close second and the red seemed a bit pedestrian, possibly for the non-adventurous.\n\nwe ordered:\n\nblood orange margarita - for our friend\ncorn chowder (on the special's menu) - for our friend\nceviche trio (peruvian, baja, tuna credo) - for me and hubby\n<mark>Chicken Poblano Enchiladas</mark> - for our friend\n<mark>Gaucho Steak</mark> - for hubby\n<mark>Tecate Carnitas</mark> - for me\n\nthe ceviche trio arrived first and it is a small sampling of the three different types of ceviche listed on the menu.  the trio is not listed, but our waitress informed us that we could do any combo of any of the ceviches.  we opted for the trio so we could try them all.  the tuna credo wasn't very exciting.  the seasonings weren't prominent enough and tasted pretty bland.  the peruvian and baja were a little more flavorful.  hubby enjoyed the baja the best and my favorite was the peruvian.  all three had large amounts of fish (and shrimp in the baja), but the portions are probably only large enough to share between two people.\n\nour friend had the corn chowder and he said it was very tasty, albeit a bit spicy.  he enjoyed the kick to it, though, and finished the entire bowl.\n\nour entrees arrived and all three were generous portions.  our friend enjoyed his enchiladas and finished them.\n\nhubby ate about half of his steak which he really liked.  it was served over a bed of what appeared to be \"chilaquiles\", but he said it was a little odd.\n\nmy carnitas were excellent!  the presentation was pretty interesting as well, with the black bean salsa layered with what the corn grits above and then finished with a huge pile of carnitas, jalapeno bacon and onions.  a singular large flour tortilla accompanied.  i was only able to eat about a third of the meal and i was full.\n\nhubby and i both took our leftovers back to the hotel and had them the next day.  still good!  it's been awhile since i'd been to the border grill and it was nice to have another experience to remind me why i enjoy this restaurant.  the staff and service were excellent and the generous portions of the tasty food don't hurt, either!", 
            "3.5 stars\n\ncame with a group of first timers on a friday night for dinner. no wait and we were able to grab a table in the patio, which looks over the mandalay pools. the ceiling fans kept it cooler and bearable. but if you hate the heat like i do, i'd stick to a table inside during the summer. \n\nreading through the menu, we were all overwhelmed and excited because it all sounded so good! finally we ordered the following:\n\n- <mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark>\n- short rib taquitos \n- <mark>Tecate Carnitas</mark> \n- chocolate cake \n- sangria\n\nunfortunately we were all a little disappointed at the end of dinner. don't get me wrong everything was good but nothing special. i've definitely had better mexican food.\n\nservice was however amazing! our waiter was very nice and hilarious! for the most part the food came out in a timely manner. the only thing that took awhile was the dessert. we weren't sure if they forgot about it. this place is great for families too. they provide crayons and paper for children.", 
            "incredible staff provides excellent service and you really get a great value for the money.  <mark>Tecate Carnitas</mark> were ridiculous, <mark>Chile Relleno</mark> were great, plaintain empanadas were really good and the special soup of the day was fantastic with pieces of chorizo in a wonderful broth with loads of beans and veggies.  all around excellent experience and can't emphasize enough the bang you get for your buck.", 
            "i can't give border grill a better than 3 star review because it is the little things that matter just as much as the big things.\n\nwe went on a livingsocial deal that for $59 for two we got guacamole, an appetizer to share, 2 $29 entrees, a dessert and 2 drinks.  good deal, right?  \n\nthe service was good and attentive, in fact very good.  the margaritas that came with the meal were small and we finished them quickly.  not bad but nothing special.  the chips and salsa were tasty but nothing much beyond what is found in every mexican restaurant in town.  we had the ahi tuna appetizer and while there were spicy tastes, the tuna itself seemed to get lost and had no recognizable taste.\n\nour entrees were good sized, i had the <mark>Tecate Carnitas</mark> and she had the sauteed scallops and shrimp.  both were good and certainly a cut above your average mexican place.  the flour tortilla that came with my dish was really tasty.  the carnitas were not as tasty and seemed a little bland.\n\ni complained when we first sat down that it was cold.  nothing changed.  towards the end of our meal a manager came by to inquire about our satisfaction and i mentioned that sitting and being cold took away from my enjoyment of the meal.  he did apologize with some story of doing some remodeling, that the hotel controls the heat and that the room they put us in was more of an overflow room with lots of glass and doors.  regardless, i was cold and a place that has no control of the temp should renegotiate their lease.  i feel that border grill is responsible for my comfort not mandalay bay hotel.  why put people in this room when you know it is cold.  that night it dropped into the 30's.  i would have trouble hearing any excuse other than offering to move our table which was never offered.\n\nif i would have paid full price i would have left unhappier.  while nice it was not superior and while the servers all did a great job there were enough little things that were only palatable because of the deal."

            "the border grill is a mexican restaurant located in the mandalay bay hotel casino resort.  it is the last eating establishment along restaurant row. a few of us were already hesitant about eating at a mexican restaurant in section that also has a wolf gang puck's trattoria, red square, fleur de lys,  michael mina's <mark>Oaxacan Strip Steak</mark>, etc.   \nthe decor of this restaurant was outstanding.  the vibrant yellow and orange painted walls decorated with mexican art brightened the whole restaurant in the evening.  i was very surprised at the size of the restaurant.  it has actually two levels with the lower level accommodating larger parties of 6 or more.  the lower level connects to some outdoor seating, which i look forward to taking my lovely dining companion on the milder vegas nights for some drinks.  \nwe started off on some homemade tortilla chips that had just the right amount of saltiness.   it was complimented so well with the salsa roja and salsa verde.  one of the other red salsas had a fruity tinge to it, but   not strong enough to be identified, so it was uninteresting.  we also ordered guacamole, which was a little more bland than i usually like.   they were generous on the avocado, but i think they could have done a better job in adding some more kick (spice, tanginess, saltiness).\nwhen the waiter mentioned that the cochinita pibil was a southern mexican specialty that is rarely found in menus here in the u.s., i immediately knew that i had to order that dish.  basically, it is a specially marinated pork that has been slow roasted with or in banana leaf with cinnamon and grilled onions.  it was accompanied by black beans, rice, and plantains with orange salsa on the side.   sounds yummy, unfortunately after i gave the first bite to the gf, she immediately let me know that i could have the rest of the bite.  i said to myself, \"oh no could it be that bad?\"  i was disappointed at how tough the pork was and how the whole dish lacked any zest.  maybe the tortilla to wrap the meat took away the flavor, or the onions and banana leaf muffled some of the flavors away.  either way, the gfs <mark>Grilled Skirt Steak</mark> was a lot more tastier.  she ordered it rare and you can actually taste the marinate of garlic, cilantro, cumin, and lime.  she found that her taste buds loved in the beginning and was bored with it towards the end.  i also loved eating her charred corn relish,\ni will have to be honest that the price for our meals were a bit high ~$80/2 people for mexican food.  there are tons of other great mexican restaurants/taquerias in las vegas that are much cheaper and better tasting.  i will have to admit that i will return for drinks.  the mojitos (regular or mango) are very delicious.  ask the gf!!!  they were extra sweet, very refreshing, with a minty bite.  they also have caipirinha (a brazilian concoction, which lacked the tang that i was used to).  i yet have to find this drink anywhere else in vegas.", 
            "eating at border grill while in las vegas seems to be a choice centered more around necessity than the desire to eat there. oh, <mark>Oaxacan Strip Steak</mark> is full up for the night? you mean i can't get a table at fleur de lys? well i don't want to eat at the buffet again...screw it, let's go to border grill. \n\nit is not that the food is bad, or the decor lacking, it's just well, ordinary. the prices are vegas prices...no not $5.99 prime rib vegas prices... more like $23 fish tacos vegas prices. not exactly the best value for a quick and casual sit down dining experience. \n\nwe decided to come here because well, we had reservations at aureole that we missed because i unfortunately had to keep working about 2 hours past the time i was set to take a dinner break. so what was a 2.5 hour dinner break turned into about 40 minutes to eat something fast. since this location is close to the convention center at mandalay bay, and they have an area in the bar where you can eat quickly, we settled on this.\n\nthe food was good, but not great. thankfully the server was attentive and when we told her we were in a bit of a hurry, she was certain to speed things up for us. overall, our dining experience was not disappointing but it would certainly not be my first choice for a nice sit down dinner at the mandalay bay hotel.", 
            "all of the men in my family thoroughly love mexican food and i enjoy a good margarita so on our recent trip to vegas we decided to try this restaurant which was described to us as \"upscale\" mexican.  the food was good but not great and not what i expected from two top chef masters.  the good -  service was very, very good.  the margaritas and cocktails, in general were fabulous and the guacamole was among some of the best i have tasted.  one of my guys had the oxacan <mark>Oaxacan Strip Steak</mark> and said it was delicious.  now the bad -  i had the taquitos and they were tasteless and small.  my husband had the fish tacos and his verdict was that they were \"ok\" but no better than what he can get at home (which is dayton ohio - a far piece from the border).  i forget what my son had but he agreed with my husband that the food was just good but nothing he could not get at home.  that would be ok but this place was pricey for what we got.  now for the ugly - the place was dirty and the seating was uncomfortable.  we were also promised a \"view\" when we elected to sit on the patio; however, the only people who get a view are the ones who sit in the very front of the patio.  we were at the very back of the patio. the overall appearance of the place just seemed to be chaotic and disorganized.  not an enjoyable experience at all.  we will not be visiting again.", 
            "we usually stay at mandalay bay and so when we're not in the mood for gorging at another buffet, border grill is a great alternative.   it really helps that border grill offers certificates on restaurant.com.   we usually use the $25 off of $50 coupon.  this makes a very good meal  1/2 price here!  we've had the <mark>Oaxacan Strip Steak</mark> and actually liked the flavors better than a much more expensive steak that we had at the glitzy steak restaurant downstairs, <mark>Oaxacan Strip Steak</mark>.   the atmosphere at border grill is also much more down to earth than other restaurants.  once inside the restaurant, you blissfully feel like you've left las vegas and the casinos behind.  and sometimes, that's a very good thing!", 
            "located in the beautiful mandalay bay resort on the las vegas strip, border grill has a bit of a history. it is opened by chef susan feniger and chef mary sue milliken. sounds familiar? yep, they are indeed the chefs featured on bravo's \"top chef masters\"! being huge top chef fans, how can we resist?\n\nas with all restaurants in these large hotel/casino/resorts, border grill was tastefully decorated. in hindsight, i wished we sat on the patio, which supposedly overlooks mandalay bay's beach and pool.\n\nwe started with chips and salsa, as well as a good old margarita.\n\nwe had the following dishes:\n\n<mark>Oaxacan Strip Steak</mark>\n- seared 16 ounce steak, mole colorado, charred wild mushroom quesadilla, avocado tomato relish\n\n<mark>Yucatan Pork</mark>\n- achiote pork slow roasted in banana leaves, caramelized onion, orange, cinnamon, honey lime yams, caramelized brussel sprouts, pineapple jicama salsa\n\nthe <mark>Yucatan Pork</mark> dish was quite tasty, although i was only able to have a few bites. \n\nplease come to my blog for my vegas trip, i have food photos! ;)\n\nhttp://simplygluttonous.blogspot.ca/2013/08/border-grill-mandalay-bay-las-vegas.html", 
            "the nye prix-fixe, four-course menu with champagne was a tremendous bargain and unbelievably satisfying. the oxtail tamale was so good...i'm telling every abuela i know to start making these! the beef tartare and mushroom empanadas were both outstanding as the second course. the dessert...the blueberry ginger tr\\u00e8s leches cake was good on the outside cake part, but the blueberry ginger tasted neither of blueberry or ginger. however, that didn't detract from the cake. the entr\\u00e9e had some issues, some related to the kitchen and others related to the service.\n\nthe biggest problem we had was with our server. several times during the meal we had no silverware or water, and he didn't notice until we flagged him down. then, my entr\\u00e9e -- an amazing 22-ounce porterhouse -- came out medium to medium-well instead of the med-rare i ordered. he didn't seem to even notice that it was cooked incorrectly when i showed hi. (it was gray in some parts...gray!). i told him if it would take too long, to bring me the short rib instead (it looked great on other tables). a few minutes later, he said it wouldn't take long to fire a new steak. at least 15-20 minutes later, a manager delivered it and apologized profusely. my dining partner was already done eating his steak...not a great way to spend nye. the filet of the porterhouse was phenomenal, but the ny. <mark>Oaxacan Strip Steak</mark>, which was chile-rubbed, still lacked flavor and needed either a sauce or butter finishing. too much meat to have not enough flavor. not to mention, what was that horrendous corn cake/casserole slice served on the side? it was...pretty disgusting. i didn't let it ruin an otherwise good meal, but it made absolutely no sense next to a beautiful steak.",

            "we had dinner at border grill on a saturday night.  the place was about 2/3 full, but the patio, where we ate, was completely full.  it was a nice cool evening, and they had the heaters on.  we were directly underneath them, and i actually found myself a little warm.  not uncomfortably so, but i definitely was noticing the heat. \n\nthat wasn't an issue however; i clearly enjoyed the meal.  to start, you are brought 3 different salsas and chips.  of these, the green was my favorite, although i liked both red salsas as well.  our table of 5 decided to get the <mark>Queso Fundido</mark> to start, and 2 of them got guacamole.  the guacamole was good, certainly fresh.  it could have used some heat for my taste.  the queso was fantastic.  made with chorizo, it got crispy on the bottom where the cheese melted against the hot metal bowl.  i seriously considered ordering another serving of this, it was that good.  crispy, melty, a little salty from the sausage.  just a fantastic cheese dish.  \n\nthe meal only got better from there.  the wife had the <mark>Short Rib Enchiladas</mark>, which were great.  loved the sauce, and they were covered with a ton of veggies.  but, the showstopper was my meal:  the <mark>Gaucho Steak</mark>.  this is a large ribeye (cooked to a textbook medium rare, by the way) on top of a huge bed of maybe the best chilaquiles i've ever eaten and served with a roasted onion half and roasted garlic.  if ever a dish was composed well, this is that dish.  all of this stuff went together fantastically well, you could get a perfect bite with all 4 components.  the chilaquiles were soaked in sauce and served with what appeared to be 2 different types of cheese.  the garlic and onion were roasted long enough to become sweet, flavorful and soft, but not so long that they were burnt in anyway.  \n\ni've been to many of the best steakhouses in vegas.  while the <mark>Gaucho Steak</mark> isn't going to make me forget the reserve ribeye at carnevino, it certainly is one of the more memorable steaks i've had on the strip.  can't recommend this enough if you are a beef person.\n\nfor dessert, the table had the tres leches cake and the chocolate cake (can't remember the exact menu title).  both were good, but i found the chocolate cake to be far superior.\n\nservice was good, they leave a carafe of water on your table, which was nice.  and, when that was empty, they brought a replacement very quickly.  we'll definitely return, and i 100% will order the <mark>Gaucho Steak</mark> next time.", 
            "went deeper into the menu this time.   chick<mark>Pork En Mole</mark> is the most tender , tasty chicken dish we ever had.    gotta have the <mark>Gaucho Steak</mark> if u like that char flavor.   great again.", 
            "31 may 2014, 08:00p\n\ni've been to the santa monica and downtown la locations before so there was no objection from me when our local friend wanted to try this location.  hubby finished early so we decided to go to the restaurant and see if we could get seated earlier than our 9p reservation.\n\nit would take our friend a little while to get there so we sat at the bar and ordered a border shaker for two.  our cocktail waitress was very friendly and shortly after we ordered the bar got pretty crowded.  we were at a table and enjoyed our order.  it was so tasty that i was actually wondering if there was tequila in the drink as it was not noticeable at all.  hubby did get quite buzzy, so that answered my question.  the shaker for two comes with two cocktail glasses, a shaker, a small bottle of tequila (enough for two shakers-full) and an extra glass with the other margarita ingredients.  the shaker contains the first round of the margarita mix and the tequila is added at the table before it's shaken (without a top).  when you're ready for round two, pour the second batch of mix into the mixer and add the rest of the tequila.  note, the first round only had about a third of the tequila in it and the second round was too much to fit into the mixer.  we actually had to pour the tequila into our cocktail glasses.  well worth the $29!\n\nour friend arrived and we were able to be seated an hour earlier than our 9p reservation time.  we were seated outside and even though it was still in the 90s, the sun had set, there was a breeze and it was actually quite comfortable.  water was poured and chips with three types of salsa were brought to the table.  the chips are very light and crispy and appeared to be flour tortillas versus the traditional corn tortillas.  there is a red salsa, a green salsa and a chipotle salsa.  all three are good, but the smokiness of the chipotle easily made it my favorite.  the green came in a close second and the red seemed a bit pedestrian, possibly for the non-adventurous.\n\nwe ordered:\n\nblood orange margarita - for our friend\ncorn chowder (on the special's menu) - for our friend\nceviche trio (peruvian, baja, tuna credo) - for me and hubby\n<mark>Chicken Poblano Enchiladas</mark> - for our friend\n<mark>Gaucho Steak</mark> - for hubby\n<mark>Tecate Carnitas</mark> - for me\n\nthe ceviche trio arrived first and it is a small sampling of the three different types of ceviche listed on the menu.  the trio is not listed, but our waitress informed us that we could do any combo of any of the ceviches.  we opted for the trio so we could try them all.  the tuna credo wasn't very exciting.  the seasonings weren't prominent enough and tasted pretty bland.  the peruvian and baja were a little more flavorful.  hubby enjoyed the baja the best and my favorite was the peruvian.  all three had large amounts of fish (and shrimp in the baja), but the portions are probably only large enough to share between two people.\n\nour friend had the corn chowder and he said it was very tasty, albeit a bit spicy.  he enjoyed the kick to it, though, and finished the entire bowl.\n\nour entrees arrived and all three were generous portions.  our friend enjoyed his enchiladas and finished them.\n\nhubby ate about half of his steak which he really liked.  it was served over a bed of what appeared to be \"chilaquiles\", but he said it was a little odd.\n\nmy carnitas were excellent!  the presentation was pretty interesting as well, with the black bean salsa layered with what the corn grits above and then finished with a huge pile of carnitas, jalapeno bacon and onions.  a singular large flour tortilla accompanied.  i was only able to eat about a third of the meal and i was full.\n\nhubby and i both took our leftovers back to the hotel and had them the next day.  still good!  it's been awhile since i'd been to the border grill and it was nice to have another experience to remind me why i enjoy this restaurant.  the staff and service were excellent and the generous portions of the tasty food don't hurt, either!",

            "i've been to bg a couple times, but it's been about five years since my last visit and i've honestly forgotten about the great food. well, i'm really glad for my visit last week and the wonderful experience we had. the food was delicious and the service was insanely fantastic. our server, jessica was the most thoughtful, kindest, and simply amazing. everyone seriously deserves high praises for the top-notch service!\n\n<mark>Border Classics</mark> ($19): chicken panuchos (black bean stuffed tortillas), <mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark> (sweet corn, sour cream, salsa fresca), and <mark>Plantain Empanadas</mark> (roasted plantains, organic black beans, poblano, cotija cheese). i absolutely loved the panuchos; so good! the tamales were pretty great considering that i don't usually like sweet versions. the empanadas were okay.\n\n<mark>Wagyu Beef Sopes</mark> ($14): guajillo chile marinated wagyu beef, corn masa \"little boat\", and mango red cabbage mint slaw. the meat was delicious and tender (although a bit sweeter than i prefer), plus the fixings worked well. it was interestingly just one sope and the price is a bit steep for it.\n\n\nrestaurant week 2015\ndinner $50.15\ndonation level: silver platter ($4)\n\nfirst\n\"chorizo\" beef tartare: quail egg and potato puff. very good beef tartare and i loved the puff - wish there was more!\n\nsecond\n<mark>Gaucho Steak</mark>: grilled ribeye, chimichurri, crispy garlic potato, and huitlacoche butter. this steak was very generous in size and cooked well. the whole dish was super flavorful. i loved the potato! just really good steak.\n\nthird\nsmoked chocolate brownie: cinnamon smoke, chocolate sauce, and almond ice cream. the stack of brownie was covered in one of their short glasses, filled with smoke. the cup was removed as soon as the plate hit our table and you could still see the smoke swirling. very cool. the brownie was delicious and i loved the addition of smoke. great ice cream, too.", 
            "had the best time at our wedding reception here. located in a private room and exceptional service provided by all the staff and manager christina. the food was so good! we had a selection of <mark>Gaucho Steak</mark> (worth the $5 upgrade), <mark>Chicken Poblano Enchiladas</mark> or <mark>Yucatan Pork</mark>. our guests loved it all. the guacamole was endless  and the ultimate margarita package is the best way to go! we ordered our wedding cake and floral through them as well and couldn't be happier. living in ny choosing our reception site unseen was difficult but we made the most affordable and excellent mexican food choice on the strip. thank you so much for making our day awesome!"

            "i am giving border grill 4 stars because i paid $25 for a $75 dollar meal thanks to restaurant.com. border grill is waaaaaaay overpriced, but when you take 50 bucks off the bill it starts looking like a deal. so lets focus on the flavor shall we? i had a delicious mango margarita to start. i ordered the kobe <mark>Wagyu Beef Tacos</mark> and hubby ordered the short ribs. i have to tell you i loved eating off of hubby's plate. i ordered tacos because hello we are at a mexican place, but the short ribs were divine! i can't wait to return and order a plate for myself. the tacos were very good, but nothing in comparison. we ended up sharing both and enjoying the company around us. the staff was very attentive and always offering more alcohol or appetizers to the point of almost annoying, but still better than the alternative.",

            "had dinner on saturday  night right before mj show at mandalay. i had the <mark>Wagyu Beef Tacos</mark>, marinated and grilled pineapple,  flavor reminded me of the best al pastor tacos but not pork. very good. wife and i shared some raja tacos & guacamole.  very fresh & chunky. wife had <mark>Tortilla Soup</mark>. incredible broth and roasted chili flavors. \n\nonly think i didn't like was the paloma drink special,  had zero grapefruit flavor. the food had so much attention  to flavors, texture & colors but the drink was prepared poorly.\n\nfresh strawberry lemonade was one of the best we've had though.", 
            "very nice spot 7n the end of mandala bay, directly located beside the pool. we come here very spontanious, as we decide to eat mexican and headed to mandalay bay hotel&resort. \n\nwe then asked inside the hotel and they have 2 mex restaurants in mandalay. we have done the right decision to choose border grill. avery awesome experience from the beginning. \n\nthe service was very friendly and helpful. he gibe us the advise to try the plates dinner as we asked several questions about the meals. its a all you can eat deal annd so then you cannorder diffrent meals. <mark>Wagyu Beef Tacos</mark>, and steaks have been delicious! all the plates come in a smaller size so you canntry several plates. we had around 6-8 each. \n\nwe also liked the place here. nice decoration, style and overal look. it was a bit crowdy bit thats normal for such a good place at around 8 pm. \n\ndefinetly can highly recommend this spot when you like mexican food. very friendly and fast service, amazing meals and choice and nice atmosphere!!", 
            "we had dinner here on friday and it was excellent! our server was one of the friendliest i had and was eager to help us decide what to order. the margaritas were great! our group of 3 had the <mark>Wagyu Beef Tacos</mark>, the chicken chipotle enchiladas, and the <mark>Short Rib Enchiladas</mark>. all were quite good, although the <mark>Chicken Poblano Enchiladas</mark> were my favorite.\n\nthe 15% off for locals is quite nice -- not easy to find on the strip!", 
            "went there last sunday with my husband and a friend.  i was so excited to see <mark>Peruvian Ceviche</mark> on the menu!  but then it arrived... :(  i've had a lot of peruvian food, and this wasn't even close.  the fish wasn't fresh and there wasn't a trace of lime juice that i could see or taste.  the fish was covered in a sticky paste that i assume was supposed to be the aji pepper paste, but that should have been mixed in with a good helping of lime juice.  i can't remember the last time i sent something back, but i was happy to get this off the table!  our server was really nice about it though... she removed it from the check with no problem.\n\nwe then got our entrees... i had the carnitas tacos, my husband had the <mark>Wagyu Beef Tacos</mark>, and our friend had the <mark>Green Corn Tamales</mark> (she's veggie.)  they both enjoyed their entrees, but i found mine a bit bland.  rice and black bean puree was good, though.\n\nwith all the amazing restaurants in vegas, there's no point in going back to one that, to me, was really lackluster.  one big star for the tres leches dessert... now that was awesome!", 
            "fantastic! one of the best mexican restaurants i've been to. i highly recommend it, if you like mexican. i ordered the guacamole for a table appetizer and had the <mark>Wagyu Beef Tacos</mark> for dinner. the beef was flavorful, tender, and paired perfectly with mango on top."

            "very good sangria margaritas, and chips and salsas are tasty. i found the food to be good, but if you're looking for what californians traditionally  consider to be mexican food, you may be thrown off. for example, i had beef <mark>Brisket Taquitos</mark> with a pineapple pico de gallo, refried black beans, and a red and green rice. my husband had some sort of pork in plantain leaves. so, definitely not your typical taco/burrito/quesadilla joint. \n\nthat said, i think they're going for a more upscale vibe the likes of spots like rosa mexicano in nyc. while the food fits, the atmosphere is off for such a place, as there's no denying you're in a vegas food court.", 
            "great food - starting with the chips and salsa. my wife loved the green tomatillo salsa and couldn't get enough.  we had <mark>Tortilla Soup</mark> and chicken tinga empanadas as appetizers which were both excellent.  our entrees were the carnitas and the beef <mark>Brisket Taquitos</mark>.  both were excellent.  the guacamole was excellent as well.  the beans and rice were just ok.\n\nthe portions were generous, and the chips and salsa good, such that we didn't have any room for dessert.\n\nwith a drink each, an appetizer each, and an entree each the bill was around $90.  not cheap, but it's vegas on the strip.  :)",

(the tortilla chips looked like candles in the mashed potatoes.)  for dessert, the carrot cake with passionfruit puree was scrumptious but we just had to take that home so as to not explode right there in the restaurant. \n\nmy husband is a teaching chef and i am often his sous chef.  as such, we know our foods.  the tasting menu at border grill is a flavorful gourmet experience.  come hungry because although the servings are small, you will be stuffed at the end.  \n\nbon appetit!",

            "margaritas... chips... guacamole, what more can a girl want out of life? we arrived around 7pm on a sunday night sans-reservation. there was a 30-minute wait, so we grabbed a seat at the bar for some drinks & guacamole. i started with the blanco margarita and the boy had a cadillac. i really liked the blanco, it was crisp and refreshing, everything a margarita should be. the guacamole here was great, it had a heavy lime flavor & wasn't overly spicy, read: very karen c. friendly.\n\nfor dinner, i went with the <mark>Fish Tacos Ensenada</mark>, and they were delicious! i skipped the beans, and they instead served them with 3 different kinds of rice... all were so flavorful. the boy had the saut\\u00e9ed shrimp, which i admit to stealing a decent amount of because it was so good! the sauce was so flavorful and seasoned perfectly. the only complaint is that the red rice on both of our plates was a little too salty, but other than that, it was great. it definitely isn't crazy authentic mexican, but that's not what i was looking for, so i'm down with that. \n\ni like the ambiance here, and would have liked to have been sat outside, but there was a huge birthday party so that was a no-go. very random, but i love the glassware they use. overall, i'm very glad we checked this place out!",
