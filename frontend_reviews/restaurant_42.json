            "i was expecting such an experience and while i can say i will never forget my lunch there, i also will never return.  \n\neverything we had was incredibly heavy. doused in dressing and thick sauces, it all tasted so fattening and yet somehow, flavorless.  the pretzel was probably the best thing we ordered with a \"cheese\" and two mustards. i put the cheese in parentheses because it tasted more like cream cheese than cheese. we shared the <mark>Monday - Curry Wurst</mark> to start as well. long hot-dogs covered in a curry sort of ketchup. i liked the flavor of the ketchup, but its all so heavy and greasy that it was hard for me to move beyond that. the fries tasted like something that came out of a bad cafeteria. \n\nthe space is pretty impressive and feels like a college dining hall. long rectangular tables make great fun for large parties ready to embark on a german dining excursion. the best part of the lunch was when our waitress with the board she used to bring us shot glasses paddled my friends. they spank was so hard it echoed throughout the entire place.\n\noverall, this isn't really the type of experience i want when going to vegas, so i probably won't return. if you know someone who is found of german food and beer, bring them here and they will love you forever. bring someone who is on a diet and they will likely try to kill you before the meal is over...", 
            "was in vegas for a week for work and this was by far my favorite dinner of the week.  the food was excellent, reminded me <mark>Soup of the Day</mark> of my youth when i lived in deutchland for a few years.  the atmosphere was authentic german fest hall and the great beer just topped it all off.\n\nthe seating is communal around some large picnic tables.  we were sitting with a nice german family who were very nice but didn't sprecken sie english\n\nhad the <mark>Monday - Curry Wurst</mark> for my dinner and it was super tasty.  the german family dining next to us was eating the schnitzel and it looked really good as well.  i had trouble making up my mind when it came time to order.  no such difficulty when it came time to order my beverage.  \"i'll have a liter of hefe bitte\"\n\nthey also had a pretty good umpah band playing the night we were there, with all the authentic german beer fest tunes.  sweet caroline, who the f is alice and so on...    would not hesitate to go back here the next time i find myself in vegas.\n\nif you sign up for their email news letter they will send you a coupon for a free beer!!\n\nprosit!!", 
            "the hofbrauhaus was a lot of fun for me and my parents (my mom's family is from bavaria, so this is a bit of home cooking for her! what better place to take them?).\n\nas soon as we walked in, we sat at a huge wooden table and ordered some beers. they were delicious (and huge). a bunch of cute german guys were enjoying some beers and brats in their lederhosen, and eventually, they were subjected to shots and spankings (thanks to one of their friends). maybe a little too entertaining, but it was a fun time. a three-piece band played bavarian standards and many of the patrons sang along/danced. a very fun time.\n\nas for the food, the portions are generous and the flavors are savory and delicious. i had one of my favorites, <mark>Monday - Curry Wurst</mark>. the pretzels are really soft and chewy--perfect with a beer. the prices are moderate, but if you're not starving, i'd say split it with a friend. there's too much to eat, and you can always order more if you're hungry. this was, hands-down, my parent's favorite place we visited in vegas. we'll be back next time.", 
            "i went here to watch the world cup final. it was packed, but we had reservations luckily. i ordered a pretzel with brie and liver mousse to start, it was delicious and went great with <mark>Soup of the Day</mark> beer the dunkel. for dinner i ordered the <mark>Monday - Curry Wurst</mark> and it was so damn good, and my new hefe weizen went just right with it as well. for dessert, the apple strudel, not that good, it tasted just as good as a toaster strudel. idk, maybe on a day not so busy it wouldn't have felt like it was fresh out of the microwave. \n\nthe servers were on it , 10/10. \nthe atmosphere - 10/10\n\ni will return, i will order more meat and drink more beer. \n\nyou should go here, it's fun and tasty. done.", 
            "i've been to germany, and i've been to the original haufbr\\u00e4uhaus.  the atmosphere at this location is great but the food is horrible. the first time i was there for lunch - this was at least 7 years ago, their <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark> tasted like they were from a box and their saurcraut was fresh out of a can and not properly rinsed.  just went for their oktoberfest  celebration. i was excited and hopeful that their food had changed.  nope. ordered a large pretzel  to share.  pretzel came out cold and a bit hard. i was excited tho for their <mark>Monday - Curry Wurst</mark>  since i have been craving it since i left germany. i've had about 8 <mark>Monday - Curry Wurst</mark> in my life and this was the most disgusting <mark>Monday - Curry Wurst</mark> ever. how can you mess up a street cart food like <mark>Monday - Curry Wurst</mark>?! also they cut up an american hotdog and placed it on top of my fries  for some unknown reason. i'm not ever going back.  i can get my fix of good german beer from the local liquor stores and if i am craving german food i'll go to the berlin cafe.", 
            "**** (5/5) impression  ****\nlots of spanking! bavarian live music, beer girls! they went all out and it was great!\n\n**** (5/5) ambiance ****\ndefinitely festive! felt like i was in a whole different world!\n\n**** (5/5) service ****\nwe had one of the best services (luckily i didn't get spanked!)\n\n**** (5/5) food ****\ni was extremely impressed! no complaints, i just wish i could eat more, but i was so full! good sized portions! i will be coming back for more (but i don't live in vegas)\n\n* sausage platter\n* meat platter\n* schnitzel\n* apple strudel\n* <mark>Monday - Curry Wurst</mark>", 
            "it is an attraction restaurant and you pay for that. food was excellent except <mark>Monday - Curry Wurst</mark>. i sent back because it was basically a hot dog with sauce, even though they called it a kaiser sausage. manager removed from our bill. you will pay $4+ for a coke . beer cheese and pretzel $18 and $15 for  sandwich with fries, no substitutions. if you are vacationing and sick to death of fries, you would gladly pay an up charge to sub out fries. entertainment was fun. they have good happy hour specials, so i would go back during that time, over at 6:00. very authentic german food."

            "if you've been to germany you might be able to appreciate the hb.  if you haven't, it's not worth a special trip unless you're looking for expensive and mediocre food.  thankfully, it was all good since it was all free...\n\ni visited sept 2006.  if you're on your way to munich, don't visit.  save your appetite for the original.\n\npros:\n+ a friendlier gift shop in lv than in munich\n+ fun, loud, and festive atmosphere\n+ german <mark>Friday - Beer Battered Ocean Cod</mark>\n- the sausages don't seem authentic", 
            "\"... you go... i'm never leaving this place.\"\n\ni'd like to say i rocked the hofbrauhaus, but in truth, the haus rocked me.  the beer at hofbrauhaus is flown in from germany.  their wheat beer is delicious and among one of the better i've tasted.  like true german wheat beers, it is served sans fruit.\n\nhuge steins of <mark>Friday - Beer Battered Ocean Cod</mark> as soon as you can order them.  the beer drinking ensues at your table and on-stage.  i was here during downtime in las vegas, saturday at 2pm, so the place was far from packed.  the band was a husband-wife team and despite the fact that the beer hall was only sparsely populated, they performed like it was a full house.  with interactive songs that ranged from standing on your bench to pounding your stein on the table to the rhythm of the song, they constantly kept all patrons involved.  i could go on with some of the other tricks they have up their sleeves but i'll let you come here to see them for yourself.\n\neven after a tough session of playing trumpet and flugelhorn, they still make rounds of the hall and chat with you while taking slugs off their steins.  both talkative and sapient about the tradition of the hofbrauhaus, they're even willing to get a little personal.  \n\ni had to get them a round of apple schnapps shots before i left, it felt mandatory.", 
            "exact replica of the hofbrauhaus in munchen! except that the outdoor beer garden is not really outdoor. i need to dig out my pictures from germany because it was so similar, i felt like i was teleported back in time to one of my fun trips through europe. \n\nmy co-worker and i were transported back and forth past this place on the way to the convention center and when it was time to eat, we agreed to check this place out. it's diagonal from hard rock and huge - hard to miss. \n\nin the front there is a cute gift shop w/ cheesy souvenirs like beergarden girl aprons and the huge steins w/ the hofbrauhaus logo. we were greeted by a friendly german man who smiled and asked if we'd like to be seated next to some good-looking men. haha - the tables are large and you will sit (if you're in a small party) with other parties. unfortunately, no one was there (men anywhere near our age) so we were seated next to a grandma w/ her teenage granddaughter who was apparently applying for a job. the band was playing in their leiderhausen, beers in hand. great atmosphere.\n\nwe started with a jumbo oktoberfest pretzel that came with a tasty spread on the side, and mustard. great starter! i'm not a huge beer fan, but had to get one to be in the mood. it came in a big ol' mug - it was their version of hefeweizen. i wasn't lovin' it, but i drank it anyway.\n\nfor my meal i ordered the majoram - <mark>Majoram  Veal Bratwurst</mark> and it came with <mark>Red Cabbage</mark> and <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark>. i had to get some spaetzle on the side, but it was flavorless and disappointing. the <mark>Red Cabbage</mark>, which i didn't really want, was good. the bratwurst, also good. we also got sauerkraut and that was good as well and served warm. my coworker got this inappropriately large sausage sandwich - the <mark>HB Riesenbratwurst</mark>. we had to take pics b/c it was so long and huge. hilarious. she was hammin' it up.\n\nno room for dessert, but my coworker had to have some german schnapps <mark>Friday - Beer Battered Ocean Cod</mark> different from american schnapps. i was blown away by how potent the pear one was, but the apple was good. and strong.  by the end of the night we were stuffed. i don't recommend this for dinner before going clubbing. better for <mark>Soup of the Day</mark> of your flight home so you can waddle around and sit.", 
            "omigod! ever since i found out that we get a 20% discount on our perks page at work, i've been itching to check this place out. sam had been to the original hofbauhaus when he was in munich and being the <mark>Friday - Beer Battered Ocean Cod</mark> that he is, we had to visit.\n\nthe parking lot as slightly small but they had valet. we walked in and was greeted by these hostesses that dressed like 15th century beer wenches. ahhhh....\n\nnow to the goodies... the food... we ordered a huge pretzel. yummy! and then i got a bunch of pork based goodies. i think as far as non-asians, go, germans make a good use of the pig in its entirety. the food was great, the beer was great, they even had a live band and spoon dancing. we ended up walking out with a beer glass and a boot shaped beer glass... \n\nauf wiedersehen!", 
            "achtung: the way this country is quickly lapsing into the weimar republic and with the depreciation of the dollar, i swear that the litres of beer at the hofbrauhaus are cheaper than the ones served at the real oktoberfest.\n\nas a two-time veteran of the real oktoberfest, the hofbrauhaus in las vegas does its best to mirror a traditional bavarian beer tent, and it almost succeeds - we have to remember we are in america and no matter how hard we try, we can't get as wild as our european cousins without shanking someone and the swat team is called in - aside from that, the polka band is great, the stein-holding contests are a hoot, and there are people standing on the wooden benches.  the crowd is fun, lively, and loud - another staple of oktoberfest. \n\nthe menu here is almost identical to the ones in germany, though i don't recall seeing pig's knuckles.  the servers are dressed in traditional costume, complete with tightly<mark>Friday - Beer Battered Ocean Cod</mark> boobies spilling out for your viewing pleasure.  there is the expected portrait of king ludwig ii on the wall, and there is lederhosen, naturally.  a nice touch was the band playing the star spangled banner - which i think was an old british drinking song before f. scott fitzgerald's ancestor changed some of the words around. \n\ni got the jagerschnitzel, which was excellent, though i will say the spatzle was a bit blah - the kind i had in regensburg at the goldene ente was the best (yeah, i'm a snob and a name dropper, what of it!)\n\nalso, the steins for sale here in the gift shop are also cheaper than the ones offered up in germany.  if lufthansa is not your airline of choice, head over to vegas - it's almost the same, and you will have a good time.", 
            "is it a schtick..?  there's an oompah band...but they are genuinely having fun!  there are pretty waitresses dressed in flowing blue ruffles...and they're nice!  the <mark>Friday - Beer Battered Ocean Cod</mark> in gigantic 1-liter steins...yet it's pretty dang good!\n\ndefinitely go to the hofbr\\u00e4uhaus with a group.  experience it to the fullest: dance, sing, finally put that high school german to use!  and stay for the cowbells!  i would recommend downing a few gut biers ahead of time, though, as each stein-full will set you back as any drink does in vegas.\n\nthe food was pleasantly awesome.  maybe with those big community tables, i was just jonesing for some viking food.  but i ordered the grillhendl.  this massive half-chicken filled me up after i'd gone most <mark>Soup of the Day</mark> without food.  it was basted with butter and herbs beneath a  crispy brown skin.  on the side: they offer a <mark>Bavarian Potato Salad</mark> that is the best i've ever paid for.\n\nyou'll walk out of hofbr\\u00e4uhaus feeling like beowulf.", 
            "hunter s. thompson once wrote that circus circus is what the whole he world would be doing saturday nights if the nazis had won the war. \n\ni disagree with that wise man on this issue as i not only think, but i know that if zee germans had won zee war, we'd all be going to places like hofbrauhaus on a friday, saturday and sunday night. and you know what? i'm fine with that.\n\nwell, i guess not the whole \"master race\" stuff, but really, more areas should have a hofbrauhaus in their backyard as there is seriously some good times to be had in what i'm happy to say is a complete sausage fest! \n\nyou would have to be a complete dummkopf to not have a lot of fun here. \n\nthis sort of establishment, atmosphere and general wildness can really only be found during oktoberfest in most places. so to have this go on nightly in the vegas hofbrauhaus.. that's something special. \n\nthen you have das boot! yes, das boot! because really, if you even know a little bit of german, you'd realize that everything needs to be said in a very stern and loud voice or you're not speaking the language correctly. though you don't need to speak anything but drunk here.. and das boot will help. \n\nif you've seen the film beerfest, this place has a das boot glass that you can chug down your booze in. just remember to twist it at the end or you'll have a full load of <mark>Friday - Beer Battered Ocean Cod</mark> at you. it is a little pricey if you're going for the glass one, but if you just want das boot, they have a plastic one. \n\nas for the food.. it's delicious! not to mention very large when it comes to portion sizes. now i'm not that much of a sauerkraut fan, but i ate the whole damn plate of it when it was in front of me. though, perhaps that was also to soak up some of the copious amounts of alcohol that i drank while listening to the band play. \n\ni'm sure the house band cycles through songs every two hours. either that or i just got really really german in my time here and felt like i knew the songs by heart. those two semesters in pcc couldn't have taught me that much, could they?\n\nnow they only have two beers here and two beers only. but the lack of selection  is made up by the massive amount of booze. and really, when trying to polish off a huge plate of frankfurters and kraut, who wouldn't want a good pilsener? just don't forget your lederhosen\n\nfor those seeking an even bigger kink, order the shots! a fraulein comes out with them on a paddle so you and a couple of friends can swing them down. then said frau bends you over and gives you a whack with the wooden paddle, mit vergn\\u00fcgen!!!! and who wouldn't want to get spanked with the same paddle that your shots were brought out on? ich weiss nicht?\n\nif visiting the vegas area or you're a local and haven't come already, make sure you suggest it to your group, nein! insist that you go at once! \n\noans, zwoa, g'suffa!", 
            "this place is nutty.  i went with a fantastic group of people.  unfortunately, i was dd and i could not gorge myself with one of their fantastic beers.\n\ni was thoroughly entertained by everything there.  from the band reminiscent of oktoberfest, to the dominatrix lady whose job is to spank people (i assume for a living <mark>Friday - Beer Battered Ocean Cod</mark> you imagine?).\n\ni wasn't extremely happy with my meal (because i eat mounds like a monster), but like in reviews previous, it's hit or miss.  i should have gotten a burger or something, those looked fantastic.  and the fries i tried were pretty fly.\n\ni wish i could try it again!  i just don't live in las vegas.  next time for sure!", 
            "good food, very good beer, fun atmosphere.  then why two stars?  the value ruins it.  they want your money and have created lots of ways to charge for it.\n\nthis place provides a fun party atmosphere where you can partake in fun german traditions and some new ones this place created, all put to loud german folk music.  if you are not much of a drunk partier, it might be over the top for you.  i don't really want to get spanked, sing songs with drunk people, try to hold up an oversized beer mugs until they drop, etc.  if you do, you will enjoy this place!\n\ni've traveled all over germany and this place mimics the fun beer halls of bavaria.  i say mimic because it is fairly authentic but still a reproduction of the true festivals of deutschland.\n\nthe food is very similar to that found in germany but not quite as freshly prepared.  the flavors are good and most cater to the true meat eaters.  almost all sausages and cutlets are worth trying.\n\nbut let's talk about the value.  a pint of <mark>Friday - Beer Battered Ocean Cod</mark> $8 and their terrible ice tea almost as much (germans don't know <mark>Iced Tea</mark>).  $20 for an entree, $6 for a salad, $1.50 for a slice of swiss cheese on the schnitzel, $2 for bread, and a whole host of other charges.  basic food and beverages for 3 people was $78 before the tip.\n\nthen there are all the tips.  tip the waitress, tip the musicians (they even come around begging with their horns), tip the bathroom attendant that hands you a towell but can't keep the bathroom clean...geez, good thing i didn't valet!  you would never find this kind of pandering in germany!  (well, you do need to tip the bathroom attendants in germany but at least they keep the bathrooms spotless during non-festival times.)\n\nso, while there are good elements to this place, i don't recommend it.\n\nif you are interested in an authentic german meal in a quieter setting, i recommend cafe old heidelberg, with very authentic food (albeit, slow service) for a much better price.\n\ntchuss!",

            "i never realized how popular this place was until i came here with about 20 friends during a bachelor party. the place was packed and rocking on a saturday night. we were seated in the main hall where there was music, singing, <mark>Friday - Beer Battered Ocean Cod</mark>, and other events that made the night quite eventful. we had the jager girl come by a few time to give the bachelor a few shots and a few slaps with the paddle. \n\nthe beer and food were flowing for our group and this is definitely a place to drink a lot of beer in large steins, sing random songs, and meet random people.", 
            "wow! this place rocks!\n\nawesome time, awesome experience, if your with the lads then this is where to kick of the party!\nthe music is loud, everyone more or less joins in some way or another in terms of singing or entering the <mark>Friday - Beer Battered Ocean Cod</mark> on stage, the host is awesome and drunk throughout the night. this place is as good as oktoberfest munich. \n\nif your planning on going on the friday or sat night, then ensure you book your reservation on their website so you have a better chance of being where the music is, otherwise you will be seated at the back which is more reserved.\n\nbeers are about $15. jaeger shots $7.\nrecommend to go in a large group.", 
            "to be perfectly honest- i thought this was a horrible representation of the german branded beer destination in munich. i know it's two different countries, but the feeling was just- eh. if you're going to slap the name hofbrauhaus on a venue to lure people in, at least give a similar experience- especially since you're charging a lot for it. i'm actually surprised that this restaurant got as high of ratings as it did. maybe i should have started drinking before coming?\n\nthe location in munich was a warm and friendly atmosphere while the las vegas felt like an afterthought. we ordered two dinners, a beer, an <mark>Iced Tea</mark> and dessert and it came out to a little over $80. wowza. i kinda felt ripped off. there are a ton of great german places in orange county/la that charge significantly less and have a way better vibe. jaime p and i actually joked that there were more servers than customers, yet everyone had to try and flag someone down for attention.\n\ni ordered the n\\u00fcrnberger rostbratwurst which was three pork sausages, sauerkraut and <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark> and the meal was washed down with a mug of the hofbr\\u00e4u maibock. the sausages and sauerkraut were cooked okay, but lacked any real flavor. same went for the <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark>. the beer was good, you can't go wrong with that. i should have ordered more of those and it would have probably still been cheaper in the long run. at least i would have been drunk and satisfied.\n\nwent the extra mile to fill the void in my stomach and ordered the apfelstrudel that came out warm with a side of ice cream. i can't say anything bad about the dish. between this and the beer, it was the only reason i chose to give this place two stars.\n\nthere was a one man band singing some german tunes. he did his best with the crowd in the beer hall to keep them entertained. i think there were seven total in this massive space, but he did what he could to get the audience excited with beer drinking games and off the wall jokes. it was funny because when i called for hours, i was told i should make reservations because it's on a first<mark>Friday - Beer Battered Ocean Cod</mark> basis. maybe the other 500-people or so were on their way?\n\nthis could have just been an off day- unfortunately, i'll never know an on day because i wont be coming back.", 
            "i love this place, always have a great time here. it's off the strip so you need to take a cab or bus. this beer hall is a duplicate of the original in munich. they are located throughout the world and all look / feel the same. the highlights:\n\n- amazing food. lot's of traditional german / bavarian dishes\n- good german beer\n- great service\n- like real german beer halls, you sit at long tables with other visitors. you make a lot of new friends from around the world\n<mark>Friday - Beer Battered Ocean Cod</mark> german bands\n- fantastic apple strudel \n- they sell fresh roasted beer nuts - so good.....\n- great party atmosphere, i stumble out of here regularly\n\nif you buy shots, blond women in tight clothing will spank you hard with a wooden paddle. not sure i get this part but someone gets it every few minutes. \n\nhighly recommended.", 
            "do i love german food? actually not, despite my visit to this restaurant for both lunch and then dinner all within the same day.\n\nregarding lunch we met up with 4 other business colleagues during lunch because one of the guys was there earlier in the week and he really enjoyed his lunch. so there we were table of 6. we had a free <mark>Friday - Beer Battered Ocean Cod</mark> from the embassy suites so we enjoyed one smaller than normal size beer. the other 5 guys enjoyed there lunch, but, i was not so impressed although our table server was very accommodating to our table needs and menu changes. the restaurant looks like an indoor beer garden, but, was very tame and appropriate for a business lunch.\n\nin the evening a different group of 6 of us returned from american shooters in the late evening and decided we would have dinner here. at this point there was live music and the place was hopping with people even dancing on their tables to the music.\n\nwe all used our free <mark>Friday - Beer Battered Ocean Cod</mark> for another small stein of beer. as we were eating our food we noticed one of the customers get up from his table and get paddle spanked by a waitress. i guess the guy did not pay his bill, but, actually others from the same table were also spanked minutes latter.\n\nwe quickly realized this was a ritual, which emanated years ago from customers who ordered after dinner shots. you got paddle spanked and then had to drink your shot. \n\nafter we finished our dinners the one female at our table had ordered shots for the 5 of us. needless to say all the men got spanked except for one, who refused to participate. but we could not suffer alone so we ordered another shot for our female friend. but she had rhine stones on her jeans so the waitress was very easy on her. the guys were disappointed by the uneven hand of our waitress. the guys were hit hard, but, our female friend got off easy.\n\nas for my dinner there was way too much food to eat and again i was not so impressed by the quality or taste of the food. i guess i don't like german food so much even though i am polish? maybe it is because they invaded us in the big one: wwii. \n\ni should add service during dinner was as equally good (or better considering the circumstances) as was during lunch although we did not have any special food requests.\n\ni would still recommend this place not so much for the food, but, because of the live music and the paddle spanking for fun. by the way i recommend <mark>Soup of the Day</mark> draft dunkel, which was pretty tasty.", 
            "wow!  let me start off by saying be prepared for quite the experience!  \n\ni love vegas because two of my favorite things are in one place!  eating and clubbing! the hofbrauhaus is a great place for ridiculously delicious german food.  i had the schnitzel, because i mean, come on, you can't not get schnitzel from a german restaurant.  when the plate came out, it was huge! omg! two people could have shared one and still had leftovers, it was that massive.  the schnitzel came with gravy and spatzle and my oh my, it was amazing!!  i've been to germany and had schnitzel, so this took me right back to europe.  i'm so bummed that i couldn't eat the whole thing, but if you ever visit vegas, this place is a must!!!\n\nas for the experience i was talking about.  seating is communal in the sense that their tables look like giant picnic tables where you can sit with your own party or join other groups of people.  the <mark>Friday - Beer Battered Ocean Cod</mark> in these huge jars that are used for \"prost\"-ing, which is the german term for \"cheers\".  this act of saying cheers is slightly frightening when surrounded by a bunch of drunk people.  at the hofbrauhaus, it's common for people to stand in their seats and when they \"prost\" they slam their glasses together in the hopes of exchanging beer into each other's glass.  a forewarning, be prepared to leave drenched in beer with potential glass shards on your clothes.  when the energy level goes up in this place, it gets loud, rowdy, and chaotic!  in addition, when you order a shot of jagermeister, after you take the shot, they use a large wooden paddle and, literally, spank you with it!  it's hilarious to watch after you've already had a few, but when you get paddled, don't expect to sit down right away!\n\nwith all that being said, if you're in vegas and want the perfect place for a great time with great food and great company, this is most definitely the spot to hit!", 
            "if you love  beer this is the place to go!  i am not into drinking gallons of beer, nor standing on tables singing at the top of my lungs, and definitely not into sharing my table with people who are!   that said, the food is just ok <mark>Friday - Beer Battered Ocean Cod</mark> be more on that plate for being so overpriced!  i love german food and can cook it better in my own kitchen.  and, what's with that spanking?  ridiculous!  keep it in the bedroom not by my dinner plate!  but, if you are that frat  boy breaking out as an adult and feel the need to express yourself while making an a** of yourself in public, then this is the place for you!  fun, fun, fun!  om pa om pa!", 
            "ok... i will just say this. i am of german descent. i love german grub. i love german culture. i love german beer halls. one of the last three things was not on target here =\\\n\nthe guy playing the horns, downing beer, singing, while wearing traditional german leather pants was awesome. he definitely helped to liven up the atmosphere. however what made him even better was that he was having people play quarters for prizes, having contests for free beers (i won one, but was about to drive to la and thus couldn't drink it) and i am sure he has many other things of a similar nature that i missed since we were there at lunch on a sunday.\n\npro tip: i know oktoberfest is going to be awesome here. bavarian brau haus... ohhh yeah...\n\nthe murals, architecture, beer are all authentic. the food is a bit off though to me. i ordered the oktoberfest bratenteller. this is a double dish sauerbraten and pork roast. they each had a different gravy. the sauerbraten comes with a dark brown gravy with a slightly sour note due to the vinegar marinade that it left in for a few days. the meat is tenderized due to the marinating process and is done well. however the taste of the gravy seemed off to me. the pork roast was in a traditional german mushroom gravy. the pork was also tender but the taste wasn't on point to me again. it seemed that the gravy again wasn't like i am used to for most german food.  the pork roast mushroom gravy was also a much lighter shade than i am used to. however what had me crushed as that the sp\\u00e4tzle wasn't that good. sp\\u00e4tzle is my most favorite part of german food. it is a noodle that when smothered in gravy is phenomenal. however here i felt it was anything but. =\\   \n\npro tip #2: most of the items in the gift shop are a weee bit overpriced ;)   so unless money is no object, i bet you can find that stuff cheaper elsewhere.\n\nservice was kind of funky as well. the fraulein who was serving us, was somewhat inattentive and missed some basic things that the other waitresses did not. the details are what will make or break ya, and she forgot to ask if we wanted straws or lemon in our water when every other table had them delivered that way. she had a preoccupied air and was almost mentally checked out it seemed. \n\npro tip #3: if you sign up for their online newsletter (on their website), you get free <mark>Friday - Beer Battered Ocean Cod</mark>!\n\noverall, i would come here for the bier, camaraderie, german culture, drinking songs... heard the pretzels were good as well, but the grub perhaps would be better on a different day/night or perhaps i ordered the wrong item. i also disliked that we got there during lunch time and didn't receive a lunch menu but a dinner menu =\\", 
            "i've been to the real thing in munich. this is not at all the same thing. also, i didn't have a very good time:\n\n- i didn't see a single <mark>Friday - Beer Battered Ocean Cod</mark> out that wasn't under-poured. there's a line on the glass for a reason.\n- service was incredibly slow.\n- the waiter billed my beer wrong and instead of fixing it threw random cash at me to not tell his boss.\n\nalso it's off the strip, which makes it kind of a pain to get to.", 
            "so i think this place is completely different at night. and to be fair, i was here in the middle of the afternoon.\n\nthe ambiance is cool. i liked the big giant hall and getting seated at a table with other people. and the live music was awesome and fun. 4 stars.\n\nwe were seated promptly. but then waited over 20 minutes and still not a single server had even glanced at us. finally, one of the people sitting at the same table as us went to find the server they had (who had just closed them out because her shift was over) and she then came and took our order. she then even delivered our beers. no clue what had happened to the assigned server. when the assigned server did show, there was no apology, no \"i'll cover this round of drinks\", no nothing. not the type of service one is accustomed to in vegas. 1 star.\n\nwhen weren't super hungry, so we just ordered the pretzel. it was a giant pretzel and came with two mustards and the special cheese dip. it was way over<mark>Friday - Beer Battered Ocean Cod</mark> and not tasty. 2 stars.\n\nthe beers were decent. there were 3 options, plus the seasonal. they don't offer samples. 3.5 stars.\n\nmeh. it's basically a tourist trap. i hope the actual food is good. everything seems overpriced. they're big on pushing the gift shop items. not sure if i'll return.", 
            "i took my german family here while they were in town visiting my girlfriend and i (she's german). wow, what a disappointment. \n\nfirst of all, this place is priced like this is universal studios... inside disneyland... inside disney world. seriously. 16-18 dollars for 1 liter beer?! ja, ok! that's a bit of exaggeration ( though the price is accurate), but the whole place felt like you were being hard sold to spend more money. i mean the desserts are ten dollars! items like that make this place outrageously priced, and not affordable for a regular visit. \n\nthe second part that was a disappointment was our waitress. she obviously didn't know much if anything about germany or the menu, seriously mispronouncing a few items over and over even after my german family repeated it back the right way. now, i'm not a stickler for doing some sort of accent or anything, but it showed a lack of authenticity there, and i appreciate a place that tries to give you the real feel (especially in las vegas!)\n\nwhat's more, we felt like she was trying to push things on us, and the second we said hey... we had some coupons for 2 free beers with dinner... she became quite unfriendly and unhelpful. we got the impression we weren't spending enough money for her. i get being a server is difficult, been there... but we were a very easy table and the place wasn't nearly full. no need to flip the switch just because we aren't going nuts on ordering stuff.\n\ni almost laughed out loud when she came by with a \"retail menu\" and told us to order our gift shop items through her so that she gets the credit...really? i can't remember the last place a shopping menu was pushed on you. \n\nwe also didn't particularly enjoy the music, it's very cheesy, and since my family isn't from bavaria, they could not stand that kind of music haha we were excited to leave. \n\nto be fair, the bratwurst sampler dinner and the schnitzel were decent quality, which is what earned this 2 stars instead of one. however we saw a really strange pattern at our table and the tables around us... orders came out no more than 5-10 minutes after being placed. like our full entrees! i've worked at enough restaurants to know there is some serious pre<mark>Friday - Beer Battered Ocean Cod</mark> going on back there, as nothing can be cooked to order so fast. at this price, that's just another reason to not go back.", 
            "we've been to hofbrauhaus on previous visits to vegas and always had a good experience.  after this trip, i have no desire to go back.  we were there for an early dinner, so the service was bit rushed since they weren't busy yet.  we ordered a pretzel for an appetizer.  i recall them being served warm.  this one was cold, so it was just ok.  after being asked several times, we ordered the veal brats for dinner - it arrived within minutes, so it was all pre<mark>Friday - Beer Battered Ocean Cod</mark> apparently.  this made me very glad we hadn't placed the order earlier.  the meal actually was delicious.  that was the best part of the evening.  what really put a damper on the evening, though, was ordering a shot at the end.  don't order a shot unless you want a big welt on your butt!  we didn't realize this was the consequence.  on previous trips, members of our party had ordered a shot and did not get whacked.  this time, the staff was very eager and insistent about it.  i was very uncomfortable and was going to leave it (my boyfriend ordered the shot for me), but he finally drank it.  a server other than ours was instantly over and eager to deliver the punishment.  she was actually kind of mean about it and my boyfriend still has a welt on his behind 5 days later.  i guess they get a twisted satisfaction out of being mean to the people to leave them tips for slightly overpriced beer and food.  i was mad because he was really looking forward to going and ended up being in pain for the rest of the evening and the next day.  hofbrauhaus definitely won't be on my list of places to go on my next trip to vegas!", 
            "located on paradise, caddy corner to the hard rock hotel casino. this replica of a german beer hall serves food and fun and plenty of it. a trip here without trying one of their beers would be a cryin' shame. another must, is the gigantic pretzel.i have been here several times and everything i have had, has been great. also look in the local/tourist magazines for a coupon for a free beer, that's right kiddies, i said free beer, this isn't sheboygan, this is las vegas, nevada, the most exciting city on the planet. so for a night step off the strip and join the boisterous fun, don't for get the free <mark>Friday - Beer Battered Ocean Cod</mark>! live it up you are in las vegas for cryin' out loud!"

            "ok, i love the hofbrauhaus- but not because of the food.  the food is bordering on bad- but bad in the denny's sort of way.  i think it's german denny's.  but let's get to the reason i love it!!!  first of all, it's actually built like a hofbrauhaus.  tall, rounded ceilings, a long hall full of picnic style tables where you sit with strangers, and a live german oompa band!!  yay!!  it's like german disneyland, with music, dancing (normally the chicken dance or some sort of chain style <mark>Soup of the Day</mark>).  most times i've been there i've run into europeans- germans, austrians, swiss- and they know all the songs and sing along!  i've even seen a few dance on the tables.  it is not unusual for diners to dance and participate in the entertainment (though it is not required!)\n\nthe bands change every few weeks or monthly, so every time i go it's a new experience.  some of the bands specialize in things or have different 'activities' such as playing the long alpenhorn, dancing the chickendance in a chicken mask, or one time a band member had people throw coins into his tuba! \n\nif you want to eat, the pretzels are okay, and so is the cheese dip.  i also eat the <mark>Creamy Bavarian Potato Soup</mark> on a regular basis and it's fine.   the salads are okay.  i was not impressed by the schnitzels i've had there.  the sausages were ok, but they're hard to mess up.\n\nof course they have german beer, and a sad selection of wine (i know they have riesling, but no gewurtz).  and they have schnapps paddles.  one good natured waitress posed pretending to spank my boss with the schnapps paddle!  the waitresses are normally not german, but it's vegas, so just go have a drink and have some fun!", 
            "i will definitely return... \nthe hofbrauhaus has german food, german beer, and pretty girls and boys dishing out spankings.  service is friendly and quick.... or maybe there was enough visual stimulation for me to easily forget how long it took between ordering and receiving our food.  they accommodate large groups and singles easily. the pretzel platter with all the dips is a great appetizer, and i loved the <mark>Creamy Bavarian Potato Soup</mark>. yuuuuuuum.  oh yeah, and they have a full bar for those who need something a little stronger.  where else can you grab a stein, stand on the table, and sing? \n\nthe best part is that it's like getting a really cheesy show for free. totally vegas.  and you don't have to glam up to feel comfortable enough to have a great time.", 
            "average but not great.\n\nit was my husband's turn to pick a place for date night and he had heard about hofbrauhaus from some of his co-workers. he decided to check it out for a couple reasons- 1) we both enjoy german food, esp. after living in italy and travelling to germany to see my sister-in-law (stationed in germany) and 2) we're getting ready to move to germany in a year and wanted a little german tease. \n\natmoshpere:  i was not surprised by the decor or the costumes since we had been told about the place. although the description from one of my husband's co-workers was wrong. he described it \"like a restaurant you would go to in bavaria.\" to us, it was more like a beer tent one would see at an oktoberfest. anyway, the atmosphere was pleasant enough but i would not recommend for a date night. \n\nfood & drink: for a starter, i had the soup of that day, salmon and asparagus soup and my husband had the <mark>Creamy Bavarian Potato Soup</mark>. both were really really good and i could have eaten more! main dishes- i ordered the  majoram- <mark>Majoram  Veal Bratwurst</mark> with <mark>Red Cabbage</mark> and a side of spatzle. the sausages (2) were good but not great. the cabbage was too sweet and the spatzle too bland. the beer was good but i've had better dark beers.  my husband ordered the <mark>Munchner Weisswurste</mark>- poached white sausages and a pretzel. he enjoyed his dish but again, it was good not great. drinks- because i wasn't driving, i ordered the hofbrau dunkel (small size). it was okay but i've had better dark german beers. \n\nit's a great place if you're going with a group of friends or family. otherwise, not ideal for a date night unless you enjoy shouting over the live band and sharing a table with strangers.", 
            "drinking actual hofbr\\u00e4u oktoberfestbier imported from munich in a 1 liter mug accompanied by traditional bavarian food and music -- now that is the way to have lunch!    \n\nthe beer was really good.  it was obviously pure and smooth (german laws demand as much), but it also possessed a nice flavor that paired wonderfully with the food.  \n\ni started off with the <mark>Creamy Bavarian Potato Soup</mark>.  rich and creamy, i was impressed with the natural flavors that commingled so nicely in the soup.  carrots added sweetness, fresh chives added soul, and the addition of sausage and croutons made it heartier but not overly so.  great beginning.  \n\nfor the main course i had the wurstplatte which was a plate of 4 sausages served over <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark>  and sauerkraut with a side of spicy mustard.  the sauerkraut was served with caraway seeds (bavarian style) and was very nicely done, full of flavor and not particularly sour.  the vienna sausages were good, the pork sausage was incredible, and the chicken sausage was just okay.  this dish was noticeably heavy towards the end, but the lighter beer helped considerably.  nonetheless, i really enjoyed this selection.  the side of pretzel was fresh and tasty as well.  the mustard really made it come alive.\n\nservice was very attentive, and the girl was so pleasant and friendly.  the ambience was great.  large, open, really cavernous space with picnic table seating and music pouring through the space.  they really captured the beer hall atmosphere of germany here.  \n\ni understand trying to copy the real hofbrauhaus could be a disastrous undertaking.  400 years of tradition shouldn't be reduced to a marketing gimmick, but i think they did a nice job in the reproduction without sacrificing too much in the way of tradition.  in a world where gastropubs are coming into their own and are even being rewarded michelin stars, i think places like the hofbrauhaus will always prove to be a smarter alternative.  highly recommend this side of munich.", 
            "where to begin?\n\nthe food is very good, all of it german/<mark>Creamy Bavarian Potato Soup</mark>, looking, and tasting. at least i thought so, but the two real germans (what! germans in vegas? kidding) sitting next to us said it wasn't like at home. (they didn't say that it was not as good, just not the same. ha ha!) yes, sitting next to us, because seating is beer hall style, at long tables, next to whoever you get planted next to. so if you don't have a big group, your are going to make some new friends.\n\nso what he heck did those two germans know, anyways? well, more than me. besides the food thing, then knew the words to the songs better than i did. at one point the band ... yes you could have guessed it, three guys in leiderhosen ... struck up the national anthem ... we all rose, put our hands over our hearts, and sang ... well the two germans didn't but hey, it's not their anthem, right? right after the anthem the band charged straight into john denver, johnny cash, the monkeys, and neil diamond i think. everyone just kept singing, whether because of the mood or the beer or cause everyone else was. and that's where the two germans put us to shame because they knew the words better.\n\nthe beer is good. and it comes in liter steins. nuf said.\n\nat to top it off, there's a beautiful blond walking around serving up j\\u00e4germeister shots and spankings with a large wooden paddle. (just to be clear, the paddle was for the spankings ... the shots came from what looked like test tubes.) i don't know if this is a bavarian thing or a vegas thing (probably the latter), but it sure got the attention of the spectators and the participants (especially the latter).\n\ngo there!", 
            "very loud in the main part of the restaurant, but a very fun atmosphere, good food and good service. great saurkraut and sausages and awesome <mark>Creamy Bavarian Potato Soup</mark>!", 
            "visited: may 29th, 2011\n\nmy friend kerri made a reservation for 3pm for this place they day before. ania, one of isabel's friends suggested that we go to this place. i do believe that isabel had taken her then boyfriend (now husband) to this place on their anniversary (as an unmarried couple late last year). i was down to try a german/bavarian restaurant and see what foods they had to offer. ania, kerri (went to the munich location), and isabel said that this place was good. of course, i don't know what \"good\" german/bavarian food is supposed to taste like. \n\nwe went to hofbrauhaus after our windy and cold experience at marquee dayclub. it was still windy as we were walking in, but inside was nice and toasty. :) i absolutely loved the architecture in this building as well as the artwork and the long, wooden \"family style\" tables.  we were sat down and within a few minutes we were ready to order. our server was pretty friendly.  i ended up ordering the <mark>Creamy Bavarian Potato Soup</mark> w/ sliced sausage and the <mark>Obazter Classic Bavarian Appetizer</mark> while everyone else ordered meat items. none of us ordered any beer, although i was pretty tempted to order a stein. isabel ordered the shot that came with a paddle spanking, and ordered it for that reason. i know a few people in the restaurant ordered it, and when i saw the spankings and how much they hurt those people, i was not about to order it. when isabel got her spanking, she was a freakin' champ, only a little hop. lol.... \n\nanyway, our food took a little while to come to our table, but it was well worth it. my soup was creamy and tasty, and not salty and my appetizer was so good. the pretzel was soft and it was perfect with the seasoned brie & cream cheese dip, however, i consumed the pretzel before i even finished the two mounds of cheese dip. i ended up having to order another pretzel to finish it off. the girls seemed to enjoy the food and the festivities, which included the chicken dance. this occurred after the beer holding contest (the beer was in a stein and the arm had to be straight with no leaning back for leverage). in the end, two guys ended up in a tie and each got a free stein as a souvenir. us girls got a free stein after doing the chicken dance, and that stein went to isabel because it was her bachelorette party weekend. i hate the chicken dance, but it was worth getting kicked and stepped on to get a free stein. lol.....\n\nhofbrauhaus is a good place to drink tons of german-crafted beer, sing along with the host, get a spanking after taking shots (not for people with a low threshold for pain), eat delicious food, and do the chicken dance.", 
            "this restaurant and beer hall is probably one of the most authentic german establishments i have visited in the u.s.  great atmosphere, great food, and great beer as well.  the oktoberfest brew was right on par with great german beer.  i hope you don't mind sitting, eating, and drinking next to complete strangers, because that's exactly what you'll be doing!  it's a lot of fun though and i enjoyed getting my fellow diner's perspectives.   the dishes on the menu are typical of those you would find in southern germany, with lots of sausage and pork.  i had the reisenbratwurst with fries and a cup of <mark>Creamy Bavarian Potato Soup</mark>. i would very gladly go back several times just to try out some of the other items on the menu.", 
            "food was quite good, nice sausages, killer <mark>Creamy Bavarian Potato Soup</mark> (definitely order this if you're looking for a good meal, the <mark>Creamy Bavarian Potato Soup</mark> alone is worth schlepping over from the strip to this place). \n\nnice waitstaff, but 'service' is abnormally slow, even at off-peak hours. we watched one waitress flirt nearly continuously with a single table of patrons, as two other waitresses managed multiple tables (one appeared to have a majority of them and was doing the best she could while the other two were focused on some tables with heavy, heavy drinking going on). \n\nbasically it looked like the more you drink, the more attention you'll get from the waitstaff. which i suppose makes sense, as that's where they're going to make most of their money as the booze aint cheap. \n\nnoisy as well. \n\ni've also been one previous time and have seen the house band. if you want a (relatively) quiet dinner while they're playing, you'll need to go to the beer garden. if you want to get rip roaringly drunk and don't care about making an &ss out of yourself in public, then go for the main room and try to get there when the band is playing. their schedule is on the website.", 
            "we stayed near the strip for my husband's birthday so i wanted to go to a place we wouldn't normally go to. i chose about 3 to 4 possibilities. my husband liked the idea of eating at hofbrauhaus so we decided to give it a try even though i knew this place is better for big groups. we walked in to people on the table with their beer in hand singing their hearts out! i thought \"oh cool!\" . i was secretly glad the hostess led us to the quieter beer garden though. i just wanted a semi peaceful evening!\n\nit was a nice size space and it looked like we were sitting outside. the ceiling was painted with a beautiful blue sky and there were cute  lanterns hovering around us.  they also have freelance photographers who walk around offering to take souvenir photos of you . we bought one since we were celebrating jon's birthday.  if sentimental gestures are not your thing they have shot girls who will give you shots while smacking your bottom with a wooden paddle! \nsome of the ladies really get into it they kind of do a three step jog then swing! we were fine just watching. it was pretty entertaining to watch while you wait for your food.\n\nthe food comes out really quick so there isn't really a wait time. i was pleasantly  surprised because the place was packed. we started off with the <mark>Creamy Bavarian Potato Soup</mark>. it was too salty for me so i just had a couple of spoons of it. we also ordered the jumbo complete which was a big pretzel served with \"obatzer\" cheese, <mark>Bavarian Sweet Mustard</mark> and <mark>Onion Mustard</mark>. the <mark>Bavarian Sweet Mustard</mark> was my favorite! the pretzel was also too salty for me so i just tried to avoid eating the outside of the pretzel. i had the <mark>Schnitzel Wiener Art</mark> for my main entree . it is a breaded pork cutlet that is served with <mark>Bavarian Potato Salad</mark> and cranberry sauce. it looked like a big chicken patty. the taste was okay but i think i would have liked it better if i dipped it in the mustard rather than the cranberry sauce. the <mark>Bavarian Potato Salad</mark> i was expecting to taste amazing because they specialize in this type of cuisine but it was unremarkable. the strudel is amazing here though! it was so soft and tasted wonderful! \n\nthis is a nice place to go out with friends and have a few beers. i would go back again but i would order different items off the menu. i would keep my dessert the same though!", 
            "we came out here for a friend's birthday on friday night.\n\nbeing an avid yelper, i decided to read up on some reviews. \nafter reading the reviews, i was a little nervous about going, to be honest.  i was really worried that  i wouldn't like any of the food...especially after reading the menu...i'm not really big on pork products, and there is a lot of pork on the menu. lol\n\nso...we got there, and walked in, and were seated...\nwhat a huge hall!  \nat first, i was uncomfortable...it felt like it was a million and a half degrees in that place.  oddly enough, the more i ate and drank, the better i felt. ;)\n\nthe atmosphere here is definitely one of carefree partying.  \nits loud.  there is lots of singing, music, shouting, chanting, and spanking.\ni had a blast.\n\ni personally did not have any shots...something about being spanked by a stranger with a paddle is not super appealing to me.  maybe in the bedroom with someone i know, but not in public...those ladies looked pretty strong too. :)\n\nnow onto what was ordered:\n\nbeer:\ni ordered the hefeweizen, which was awesome.  the half liter was $8...it lasted me the whole time we were there, so it was a good value, but...i'm a slow beer drinker.  the other beers were really good too.  (i tasted everyone's.)\n\nfood:\ni ordered:\na pretzel:  pretty good.  salty, but not overly so.  \nthe potato pancakes with smoked salmon:  this was delicious.  i'm a sucker for potato pancakes, but there were divine.  the salmon was delicious, and the presentation was great.  (i'll upload a picture as soon as i can.)\ngerman <mark>Creamy Bavarian Potato Soup</mark>:  this was delicious!  my favorite of the night. :)\nthe majoram/ (veal sausages):  since i'm not a big fan of pork products, i had intended on getting fish or chicken...but when i saw that there were veal sausages for the same price as the chicken...i opted for those.  they were tasty.  2 sausages served over <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark>, with a <mark>Red Cabbage</mark> sauerkraut.  (i wasn't a fan of the <mark>Red Cabbage</mark>.)\n\nall in all the quality of the food was good.  \nhowever...\nbetween myself and my roommate, we spent $85 on 3 beers, two entrees, and two small starters.  \ni could have eaten better food for half that cost elsewhere, but all in all, for a fun night out for a friend's birthday, it was a fun place to go.",

            "it's been a while since i've been to a hofbrauhaus. the last time i went was in miami, which i fell in love with. the las vegas location is a lot bigger and not as quaint as miami, i like the more nostalgic era. \n\nour visit to the las vegas was nice, we came in as walk in and was seated right away. i really wanted to have the pork knuckles, but it was a specialty item that they only serve when it was ordered. i was devastated! but i quickly recovered trying to pick the very next best thing.... \n\nthe <mark>Creamy Bavarian Potato Soup</mark>- like a loaded baked <mark>Creamy Bavarian Potato Soup</mark> minus bacon, but adding their smoked sausage. it was topped off with croutons and chives. \n\nsauerbraten- bavarian style potroast w/red wine. it was good, not as tender as i thought it would be, sauce was dark a bit on salty side which went well with the roast and spatzle. yes spatzle! they look like gnocci pieces, but its noodles! love them. \n\n<mark>Red Cabbage</mark>- wasnt a fan, i tried it, tasted like caramelized overly sweet and vinegar <mark>Red Cabbage</mark>. i guess this is the bavarian version of our american cranberry to turkey dinner. \n\nthrough our meal, there was a band playing and shouting out and drinking! it was classic! love it!  \n\nyes and the dessert! i had to get apfelstrudel! apple strudel! it was great! had to wait for my chantilly cream which made me think about the movie inglorious bastard with hans landa and the cream for apple strudel.... reminiscing... it was great, wished the pork knuckle was available for us, that was the only reason i would go back for..\n\nthanks and good vibes!", 
            "this place just didn't do it for me. the waitress was too interested in selling us stuff and the food wasn't great. we started off with a sausage tower and that was worth it. everything after was crap. i asked the waitress for something like a \"brat\" and she brought me more like a petrified hot dog. it looked like breakfast sausage. it also had condiments for a hamburger rather than a hot dog or \"brat\" which made absolutely no sense. who just wants a toasted bun and extra long breakfast sausage? not me! i also had their <mark>Creamy Bavarian Potato Soup</mark> and it looked good but really it lacked flavor and the supposed sliced sausage in it was more like sliced ballpark franks. what's sad is i could have had a better loaded sausage at wienerschnitzel.", 
            "our server john was very informative with the menu and gave us great suggestions. the <mark>Creamy Bavarian Potato Soup</mark> and entree he recommended was very good. he even explained each sausage to us. i would definitely come back.",

            "this review is long overdue....\n\nwhile enroute to las vegas on a red eye flight, i was reading an in-flight magazine, when i noticed an ad for this restaurant.  the advertisement called them the first and only authentic german beer hall and restaurant to call las vegas, nv home.  not only that...they're a replica of munich's famed hofbr\\u00e4uhaus but in an enclosed building.  there was also an ad that offered a free mug (per customer) of their oktoberfest beer just for stopping in.  we were excited because we have never been to munich.\n\nanyway, we arrived at the restaurant at lunchtime and there was a line of people waiting to get in.  the building is quite large and has high ceilings that makes you feel like you're under a huge tent with painted indoor gardens.  you could almost hear people's conversation echo about.  we were seated at a large community table as an attentive and friendly server came by.  \n\nwe thought about ordering only a snack to take advantage of the free beer advertisement.   our order consisted of 2 pretzels and 2 small (free) mugs of their oktoberfest beer.  the beer was cold, crisp and clean tasting.  we were told that the beer is imported from the same batches as what is made and served at the hofbr\\u00e4u tents.  we considered upgrading to a 1l stein but we knew that we had dinner reservations set for later that evening.\n\n- jumbo pretzel which was huge and served warm. there were two types of mustards and an obazter (obatzda?) cheese.  we were familiar with the mustards but the cheese spread/dip was deliciously different.  apparently, it is a bavarian cheese delicacy...a mixture of soft cheeses and butter.\n\n- jumbo pretzel with <mark>Bavarian Liver Mousse and Obazter (Cheese Specialty)</mark> (obatzda) cheese.  the liver mousse was light and flavorful. i know, some of you might be saying \"ewww\" but, it was really good.  i wished that there was a larger portion but, it would've been overkill.\n\nwe enjoyed both <mark>Fresh Baked Pretzel</mark> as they were served warm, soft and a bit chewy.  the pretzels and beers were perfect together and we were satiated.  \n\nbut, then....i looked at their dinner menu and spied \"schweinshaxe\" aka roasted pork shank with crispy skin!  omg...i started planning our return because they serve this specialty after 4pm.  alas, our stay in lv was only for a couple <mark>Soup of the Day</mark> and as they say, \"our dance card was filled\".  so, just to keep my tastebuds focused, i borrowed the picture of that pork shank.  i will return.....  maybe the oompah band will be playing.\n\n#495"

            "ist das nicht ein schnitzlebank?  hofbrauhaus is a new drinking hall here in vegas. new as in 3 -4 years old here. exact replica of the original hofbrauhaus in germany. ok so here's my deal. location...across from hard rock. ok that's decent if there wasn't so much construction on this street. parking is in the rear, it's not so bad getting in as long as you don't have old people blocking the walkway to the entrance. grrrr walk faster old people! \nso the beer is big and bitter served by good strong german women.  pretty decent, octoberfest beer. you also have <mark>Soup of the Day</mark> ales and a few different lagers. seriously...who likes german food. kraut, vienerschnitzle which is a breaded pounded peice of meat....sausages...and spaetzle.bleah. needs ketchup or somethin. dessert was a black forest cake. eh...nothing really popped out at me. the food was eh....beer good. polka band with a leiderhosin group of original polka gangstas leading the chicken dance to tourists and kids who don't know any better that dance will get their butts kicked in school. \nso to experience this german flair, go for it if you want to try a new experience. but i just think vegas has more to offer than that.", 
            "my first time here i was amazed at how good a job they did in replicating the original in munich.  the decor is fantastic, and even the celings look the same!  the only difference i noticed is that the original has breathalizer machines in the restrooms, whereas they are conspicuously absent here in vegas.  :)  you'll just have to guesstimate how drunk you get.\n\none comes to hofbrauhaus for the beer, and it certainly does not disappoint.  my favorite is <mark>Soup of the Day</mark> beer, but the wheat beer is the real star:  if you have ever consumed some half-assed american knock off at a wheat beer, you'll see why the brewery even tried!  (i.e. the german stuff is goooooood!!!!).\n\ni've had a few food items here, and they were good.  i woudl highly recommend the 1/2 chicken with <mark>Bavarian Potato Salad</mark>.  \n\nwhen this place is rocking, the atmosphere is the best.  the table setup and beer hall format really liven the place up.  you are likely to be seated next to folks you don't know, so half the fun is making friends while drinking copious amounts of beer.\n\nthe bar area up front is a bit more chill, and you can even watch the game on the 3 plasmas.  they also have a back dining area that is more suitable to families (it is away from the polka band and not filled with drunken idiots like me).", 
            "exact replica of the hofbrauhaus in munchen! except that the outdoor beer garden is not really outdoor. i need to dig out my pictures from germany because it was so similar, i felt like i was teleported back in time to one of my fun trips through europe. \n\nmy co-worker and i were transported back and forth past this place on the way to the convention center and when it was time to eat, we agreed to check this place out. it's diagonal from hard rock and huge - hard to miss. \n\nin the front there is a cute gift shop w/ cheesy souvenirs like beergarden girl aprons and the huge steins w/ the hofbrauhaus logo. we were greeted by a friendly german man who smiled and asked if we'd like to be seated next to some good-looking men. haha - the tables are large and you will sit (if you're in a small party) with other parties. unfortunately, no one was there (men anywhere near our age) so we were seated next to a grandma w/ her teenage granddaughter who was apparently applying for a job. the band was playing in their leiderhausen, beers in hand. great atmosphere.\n\nwe started with a jumbo oktoberfest pretzel that came with a tasty spread on the side, and mustard. great starter! i'm not a huge beer fan, but had to get one to be in the mood. it came in a big ol' mug - it was their version of hefeweizen. i wasn't lovin' it, but i drank it anyway.\n\nfor my meal i ordered the majoram - <mark>Majoram  Veal Bratwurst</mark> and it came with <mark>Red Cabbage</mark> and <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark>. i had to get some spaetzle on the side, but it was flavorless and disappointing. the <mark>Red Cabbage</mark>, which i didn't really want, was good. the bratwurst, also good. we also got sauerkraut and that was good as well and served warm. my coworker got this inappropriately large sausage sandwich - the <mark>HB Riesenbratwurst</mark>. we had to take pics b/c it was so long and huge. hilarious. she was hammin' it up.\n\nno room for dessert, but my coworker had to have some german schnapps <mark>Friday - Beer Battered Ocean Cod</mark> different from american schnapps. i was blown away by how potent the pear one was, but the apple was good. and strong.  by the end of the night we were stuffed. i don't recommend this for dinner before going clubbing. better for <mark>Soup of the Day</mark> of your flight home so you can waddle around and sit.", 
            "i came here for my friend's birthday party. i wasn't too impressed by the food (i mostly ate sauerkraut and sausages), since it was very salty! i love pretzels, but of course, these pretzels were the cold, hard ones and i love the big, soft, warm ones. i like the fact that this place is a huge beer hall, good for groups, and that they brew their own beer the old fashioned german way. i went during <mark>Soup of the Day</mark> time, but i'm pretty sure it gets crazy at night.", 
            "this place isn't too great. their seats are very uncomfortable, as they're all big benches like at a picnic. it's a big place with really no decoration, and the ambiance was pretty bleh. the clothes on the women weren't too shabby, hehe, but the food wasn't good. we ordered the special <mark>Soup of the Day</mark>- the goulash. it was awful. it was just a bunch of meat slapped together with god knows what, then under, some sauerkraut. now, i love all these ingredients-but how is this a goulash? the flavors (not that there were any...) just collided with each other, and overall it didn't work together. plus it's very expensive for what they serve, and i had 2 small cups of diet coke (which they didn't bother to fill even the whole way) which they charge $3 for each!\nhow ridiculous!\nthe only reason i'm giving this 3 stars instead of 2 is because of the great dessert. although skeptical, i ordered the special which was a strawberry rhubarb strudel which was pretty good-taste and texture...i'd give that a 5 stars :)\n\nhope this review helped!", 
            "ok, i love the hofbrauhaus- but not because of the food.  the food is bordering on bad- but bad in the denny's sort of way.  i think it's german denny's.  but let's get to the reason i love it!!!  first of all, it's actually built like a hofbrauhaus.  tall, rounded ceilings, a long hall full of picnic style tables where you sit with strangers, and a live german oompa band!!  yay!!  it's like german disneyland, with music, dancing (normally the chicken dance or some sort of chain style <mark>Soup of the Day</mark>).  most times i've been there i've run into europeans- germans, austrians, swiss- and they know all the songs and sing along!  i've even seen a few dance on the tables.  it is not unusual for diners to dance and participate in the entertainment (though it is not required!)\n\nthe bands change every few weeks or monthly, so every time i go it's a new experience.  some of the bands specialize in things or have different 'activities' such as playing the long alpenhorn, dancing the chickendance in a chicken mask, or one time a band member had people throw coins into his tuba! \n\nif you want to eat, the pretzels are okay, and so is the cheese dip.  i also eat the <mark>Creamy Bavarian Potato Soup</mark> on a regular basis and it's fine.   the salads are okay.  i was not impressed by the schnitzels i've had there.  the sausages were ok, but they're hard to mess up.\n\nof course they have german beer, and a sad selection of wine (i know they have riesling, but no gewurtz).  and they have schnapps paddles.  one good natured waitress posed pretending to spank my boss with the schnapps paddle!  the waitresses are normally not german, but it's vegas, so just go have a drink and have some fun!", 
            "summary: amazing beer and atmosphere, good food, snappy service, patrons were kind of weird, and so loud my ears are still ringing\n\npro: i went here with some of my buddies who wouldn't shut up about this place. as other reviewers noted, it's a bavarian theme, albeit not as authentic or good as the real thing. for vegas though, definitely good enough. 2 liters of beer and some bratwurst later, i was a converted fan. my server lorise was on the ball with our food and drinks, and extra accommodating as we had a few extra people join us halfway through our meal. \n\ncon: so the seating is communal, so expect to get sandwiched next to some orange county db's and an obese family from fresno. we had the supreme luck of being seated next to a dude and his girlfriend that were all over each other like white on rice. also, it's stupid loud in the place when it's full of hundreds of drunk people, and a band playing the chicken dance. we're talking can't talk to anyone, barely able to think loud.\n\nps- they have some really cool tees and other beer related merchandise at their store in the front. beerfest fans, take note <mark>Soup of the Day</mark> boot!", 
            "we reserved a table for our group of about 12. group was all guys that had known each other since high school, plus a few that served together in iraq. we though the plan was to meet for dinner. we had split up into smaller groups since we all wanted to do different things during <mark>Soup of the Day</mark>. well, a lot of the other groups decided they would eat first and just show up for drinks. wish he had thought of that.\n\nbeer was good, but expensive. my favorite was the seasonal winter ale. we had a lot of fun being loud, getting paddled by the shot girl, etc. however, no one else there was being loud or anything. the place was packed, but every other group was pretty subdued. the band was ok. i don't know much about german music so maybe they were more authentic or whatever, but their music didn't seem to get people going as much some bands i've seen at local octoberfest events.\n\nthe place is what you and your friends make of it. we had fun and i would have given it a higher rating if the food and service had been better. i split a sausage platter with a friend. it was around $20 and we got 3 sausages. one tasted like an oscar meyer weiner. we also shared an obatzer which was really good, but only came with one pretzel which was way too little for the giant lump of cheese. we ordered another pretzel, but it never came. supposedly there is a pretzel girl sometimes; she wasn't there when we were there. we were both still hungry when we left. some others in the group got burgers. they we huge. man vs. food huge. however, they said they weren't that good.\n\nservice was mixed. shot girl and souvenir girl were cool and basically hung out at our table since we were the only people buying stuff from them. when you get a shot, the girl paddles you. we saw one other person get paddled while we were there. most of our group got a shot and several got two. our actual server seemed like she wasn't happy to have the \"rowdy\" table. she just kind of stood there.", 
            "of course it can't compare to it's original in munich, germany...  but this vegas gem of a german restaurant comes pretty close.  it is located near the hard rock casino and easy to get to by cab from most other casinos in vegas.  i love the german food almost as much as the huge german beers, and the german entertainment makes the experience that much better.  i cannot leave vegas without a trip here to remind me <mark>Soup of the Day</mark> past spent in bavaria.", 
            "only come here if you're looking for a loud, boisterous crowd and you're in need of a spanking. appears to be a bit campy (like a lot of the vegas experience, i guess), but hey, great beer and hot looking wenches, i mean, waitresses. come with an open mind, a commitment to a good time, and lots of friends and you'll be fine.\n\nwe started with the jumbo complete, which is a huge pretzel served with 3 dipping sauces: obatzer cheese, <mark>Bavarian Sweet Mustard</mark>, and <mark>Onion Mustard</mark> and the hofbrauhaus brotzeittler, the cold cut meat plate that comes with pork, ham, sausages, cheese, pickles, and <mark>German <mark>American Rye Bread</mark></mark>. goes well with any of the beers, my choice (first of 3) was the dunkel, <mark>Soup of the Day</mark> beer which was smooth and rich.\n\nfor our group (3 couples) we also split the:\n- hofbrauhaus platte: smoked pork loin, pork roast, and a delicious smoked sausage served with dark beer sauce, mashed potato, and sauerkraut. a huge plate for 2 but we were able to rise to the task.\n-hofbrauhause wurstplatte: frankfurters, pork and chicken sausages also served with mashed potatos and sauerkraut.\n-muchner weisswurst, the veal and pork sausages, absolutely delicious! good with the heffe (maybe another litre??)\n\ndo a shot of alcohol and your server with spank you as a reward. i can only wonder what you get for finishing das boot, a giant boot of lager. i also had the lager, which had a nice bite to it.\n\nyou can end your visit with a trip to the lobby gift shop for lederhosen, tshirts, or a six-pack of beers for the hotel room after party. will definitely fill you up, looking forward to going back for more (and i don't just mean more spanks). the place fills up on weekends, so definitely call in for a reservation.", 
            "about ten bucks for a beer and pretzel is a bit much.  next time i'm going to the hard rock across the street.\n\nhofbrauhaus opened a few years back on paradise.  the schtick is that this is a replica of a famous restaurant in munich. the hostesses are dressed the part and there is plenty of homage paid to las vegas' most famous germans siegfried and roy.\n\ninside the main dining hall is the classic picnic table setup for a communal dining experience.  i was there during <mark>Soup of the Day</mark> and it was kinda slow so i decided to grab a seat at the bar.  i got a medium sized house beer which is imported daily from germany.  it was ok.  nothing above average.  also grabbed a pretzel hoping for something semi-authentic.  instead they brought something out nary 2 minutes later that was cold and hard.  at least warm it up!  i know it's only a pretzel but substandard service will not win a repeat customer.  i can only hope this place is a little more interesting come oktoberfest.", 
            "i love this place.  there are very few places that make you smile the moment you walk into them.  (the hotel lobby when you first get into vegas, disneyland, and a brothel are things that come close).\n\ntotal authentic german beer hall, or so i was old by friend's german wife seeing that i've never been to germany, but again i digress.\n\nthere's long wood benches where you pretty much sit down close to the other dining guests.  but everyone is super friendly and the place is pretty lively at all hours.  everyone is just drinking, singing, cheering with each other, and having a great time.  the waitresses are the coolest and apparently will lay the smack down with the paddle they keep handy.\n\nthey fly in their hef straight from germany and it comes in it is served in giant beer steins, just the holy grail of goodness.  best hef ever.  the taste is just phenomenal and <mark>Soup of the Day</mark> part is that it goes down like bud light.\n\nthe food is awesome.  got to get the giant pretzel to go along with your hef.  had the ribeye last time and it was just fantastic.  the one minor drawback is that for a beer hall its kinda pricey.  we always end up with a bill of more than $50 a person, but i think that's mostly because the steins of hef run about $15.  but its well worth the money.\n\nbottom line is that you definitely need to come here when you're in vegas.  its right across from the hard rock which is another place you should be visiting so here's your chance to kill two birds with one stone.  cheers.", 
            "a really awesome time. take as many friends as you can, to have a table in the main hall you will want about 10 people in your group. the beer is great and people really get going with the live band and start dancing on the tables and such. plus the servers and jagermeister girl will come around and try to spank you. the music is awesome and everyone pretty much sings along, if your looking for a quiet evening they have the beer garden in the back which is not nearly as intense but is still really cool. basically imagine a party version of the beer fest movie. the food is the best german in vegas but the main attraction is the beer and atmosphere. they have free valet and a taxi stand so transport is no prob. the bill can really sneak up on you so make sure your ready for a few hundred buck s total with a large group and everyone drinking.  i wouldn't bring kids in the evening but during <mark>Soup of the Day</mark> it is totally fine and nothing adult rated is going on.", 
            "is it a schtick..?  there's an oompah band...but they are genuinely having fun!  there are pretty waitresses dressed in flowing blue ruffles...and they're nice!  the <mark>Friday - Beer Battered Ocean Cod</mark> in gigantic 1-liter steins...yet it's pretty dang good!\n\ndefinitely go to the hofbr\\u00e4uhaus with a group.  experience it to the fullest: dance, sing, finally put that high school german to use!  and stay for the cowbells!  i would recommend downing a few gut biers ahead of time, though, as each stein-full will set you back as any drink does in vegas.\n\nthe food was pleasantly awesome.  maybe with those big community tables, i was just jonesing for some viking food.  but i ordered the grillhendl.  this massive half-chicken filled me up after i'd gone most <mark>Soup of the Day</mark> without food.  it was basted with butter and herbs beneath a  crispy brown skin.  on the side: they offer a <mark>Bavarian Potato Salad</mark> that is the best i've ever paid for.\n\nyou'll walk out of hofbr\\u00e4uhaus feeling like beowulf.", 
            "i'm so fascinated with other people's cultures and foods, i forget to occasionally get back to my own roots.  i'm part german, and i can't think of a better way to celebrate that than a visit to hofbrauhaus.\n\nthe food is very rich and filling.  everything is amazingly tasty, so don't be afraid to order something random off the menu.  the portions are big, but be prepared to be even more full than you think.  this is because you will be drinking at least a liter <mark>Soup of the Day</mark> (or light) german beer.\n\nevery time i've visited hofbrauhaus, there has been some authentic german beer hall entertainment.  along with a band, a dude in lederhosen will be cruising around and keeping the party going.  last time i was there, the band made their way around the restaurant with their instruments, and one of the guys hopped up on a table and played spoons like nobody's business.\n\nif you're so inclined, a girl will come around and offer shots of jager (or you can order them from your waitress).  the waitress will bring the shots out on a serving board, which doubles as a paddle.  after taking your shot, it's customary to get spanked with the paddle.  here's a video of my spanking.  watch out for this waitress..  she hits hard:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bajl_-cne2s\n\nhofbrauhaus is a lot of fun, especially when going with a group.  the party atmosphere is also conducive to merging your group with others.  it's not hard to make new friends at hofbrauhaus.  everyone is always happy and having a great time!\n\nziggi zaggi ziggi zaggi hoi hoi hoi!", 
            "it was fun to go since i have been to the real one in munich and the other fake one in newport, ky.  the food was good and <mark>Soup of the Day</mark> beer was as i remembered it.  my waitress actually was fully fluent in german and her entire family was from stuttgart, munich and frankfurt.......that helped.  get the poached sausages, you can't go wrong!", 
            "so lets start by saying that they serve beer the right way...by the liter. i am not a big fan of beer myself, however, i did enjoy my liter <mark>Soup of the Day</mark> beer. the staff is dressed in german folk attire, and they look great, and lets not forget the live band. there is something to say about good old german folk music it has a spring to it and makes the drink and food very exciting. they have a great menu featuring traditional german dishes, i strongly recommend the wiener schnitzel dish it doesn't cost to much and you get to taste the different flavors. the atmosphere is packed with excitement it is a place were you can bring the whole family.", 
            "if yelp permitted 3.5 stars, i think is place is worthy of them.\n\nactually, i take that back, the number of stars really depends on the purpose of your visit. for german mastication, 1 star is plenty. the food is mediocre at best and i've left hungry after each of the two times i ate food here. i'm a big guy, but there are entree salads i've had elsewhere that are much more filling than the schnitzel plates i ate here. the food isn't inedible, but there are far better places in town for authentic and filling german fare.\n\nnow, for a rowdy night of beer drinking and paddling, this place earns 4 stars. steins of light and dark house beer are rampant as is the stereotypical german drinking songs performed by whoever is on stage. as for the house beers, i prefer <mark>Soup of the Day</mark>; flavorful, aromatic and just bitter enough to turn me away from vodka for the evening. if not, there's always jager to fall back on. watch out for the ladies with paddles and either avoid them or give them a holler, depending on how red you'd like your bottom to be at the end of the evening.\n\nall in all, if a night of beers and watching others getting their groove on in full lederhosen is what you crave, this is the place to be.", 
            "this is definitely a tourist trap, which can be a good or bad thing. there's really nothing else like this place in las vegas so there's that. and they have really huge beer mugs, and the live music can be fun.\n\nbut, after you've been here a few times, the novelty definitely wears off. you start to realize that the beers are priced easily twice what you should be paying, the food options are pretty bleak, and the music....meh, it gets a bit old.\n\nlast time i wanted to go, it was a saturday night and i knew it would be packed out so i made a reservation. got there, followed the hostess in and what do you know, she seats my party at the one table that is furthest away from anything, a straight diagonal across the room from the stage. and there were a ton of empty tables that were closer! her reasoning was absurd! so after one beer and a food order that they couldn't even get right, i summoned a manager and complained. she too, was perplexed as to why we were seated in the back, with a reservation. she took our food item off the ticket and apologized, which was nice, but <mark>Soup of the Day</mark> was done. so we finished our first and only round and left. sad though, because it could've turned into a long night and a hefty tab, but i'm sure they didn't miss it because this place will always fill up with tourists like me.",

            "i love this place. i always have a good time here. the food is very good. everyone i have brought here has raved about the food. they have a live band playing german music. the atmosphere is very similar to a oktoberfest. the house beer is very good too. the cheesecake is the best i have ever had. \n\non this trip we started with a beer and jumbo complete pretzel. everyone loved it, even my girlfriend who does not care for breads. the waiter was very friendly and talked with us for awhile answering all our stupid questions about germany and it's culture. before the food was served the band played the chicken dance. unfortunately that night only my girlfriend and me joined the waiter to do <mark>Soup of the Day</mark>. what is up with that? \n\ni got the allgauer kasespatzle which is similar to mac and cheese. my girlfriend ordered the <mark>Munchner Weisswurste</mark> and richard ordered the sampler plate which had sausage, pork chop, pork tenderloin, and sauerkraut. he shared the tenderloin and the review was that it is amazing. for dessert we had the cheese cake and apple strudel. \n\ni like to try and visit to place on every trip to vegas. the more people in the group the better. the restaurant is in it's own building and parking is free and right next to the place. there is a gift shop too.", 
            "was in vegas for a week for work and this was by far my favorite dinner of the week.  the food was excellent, reminded me <mark>Soup of the Day</mark> of my youth when i lived in deutchland for a few years.  the atmosphere was authentic german fest hall and the great beer just topped it all off.\n\nthe seating is communal around some large picnic tables.  we were sitting with a nice german family who were very nice but didn't sprecken sie english\n\nhad the <mark>Monday - Curry Wurst</mark> for my dinner and it was super tasty.  the german family dining next to us was eating the schnitzel and it looked really good as well.  i had trouble making up my mind when it came time to order.  no such difficulty when it came time to order my beverage.  \"i'll have a liter of hefe bitte\"\n\nthey also had a pretty good umpah band playing the night we were there, with all the authentic german beer fest tunes.  sweet caroline, who the f is alice and so on...    would not hesitate to go back here the next time i find myself in vegas.\n\nif you sign up for their email news letter they will send you a coupon for a free beer!!\n\nprosit!!", 
            "we went at 5pm on a tuesday. so i cannot speak to the later time <mark>Soup of the Day</mark> or weekend dining experience.\n\nfood was delicious and seemed authentic to me. the <mark>Red Cabbage</mark> was like a sauerkraut made with <mark>Red Cabbage</mark> with some sugar and spice added. interestingly tasty. generous portions, friendly staff, great atmosphere. i would love to go back.\n\nthey had a live polka-style band. i was disappointed there was not a dance floor.\n\npeople in our party ordered sausages and a couple of the pork roast style dishes. everyone enjoyed the food. \n\none draw back was the seating along the side of the room, where we were seated. the tables can fit up to 8+ people. if you're a party of 4 they will seat another party on the other end of the table which is pushed up against the wall. which means if you're sitting on the outside you have to get up for the other diners or you have to wait for others to get out of your way if you're seated on the inside. this is okay if you like the other people seated at your table. but if you don't like their conversation or demeanor it could get unpleasant. so i recommend making reservations as i got the impression this was \"overflow\" seating. the rest of the seating areas had easy access to both ends of the table.\n\ni didn't try the beer but the drinks menu also offered some interesting brandy and digestive choices.", 
            "the pork shank was delicious. and i'm normally not a fan <mark>Soup of the Day</mark> beer, by theirs was pretty good (dunkel?). if you are planning on eating here, i suggest that you try to make reservations for the main dining hall. the atmosphere there is a lot more festive.", 
            "do i love german food? actually not, despite my visit to this restaurant for both lunch and then dinner all within the same day.\n\nregarding lunch we met up with 4 other business colleagues during lunch because one of the guys was there earlier in the week and he really enjoyed his lunch. so there we were table of 6. we had a free <mark>Friday - Beer Battered Ocean Cod</mark> from the embassy suites so we enjoyed one smaller than normal size beer. the other 5 guys enjoyed there lunch, but, i was not so impressed although our table server was very accommodating to our table needs and menu changes. the restaurant looks like an indoor beer garden, but, was very tame and appropriate for a business lunch.\n\nin the evening a different group of 6 of us returned from american shooters in the late evening and decided we would have dinner here. at this point there was live music and the place was hopping with people even dancing on their tables to the music.\n\nwe all used our free <mark>Friday - Beer Battered Ocean Cod</mark> for another small stein of beer. as we were eating our food we noticed one of the customers get up from his table and get paddle spanked by a waitress. i guess the guy did not pay his bill, but, actually others from the same table were also spanked minutes latter.\n\nwe quickly realized this was a ritual, which emanated years ago from customers who ordered after dinner shots. you got paddle spanked and then had to drink your shot. \n\nafter we finished our dinners the one female at our table had ordered shots for the 5 of us. needless to say all the men got spanked except for one, who refused to participate. but we could not suffer alone so we ordered another shot for our female friend. but she had rhine stones on her jeans so the waitress was very easy on her. the guys were disappointed by the uneven hand of our waitress. the guys were hit hard, but, our female friend got off easy.\n\nas for my dinner there was way too much food to eat and again i was not so impressed by the quality or taste of the food. i guess i don't like german food so much even though i am polish? maybe it is because they invaded us in the big one: wwii. \n\ni should add service during dinner was as equally good (or better considering the circumstances) as was during lunch although we did not have any special food requests.\n\ni would still recommend this place not so much for the food, but, because of the live music and the paddle spanking for fun. by the way i recommend <mark>Soup of the Day</mark> draft dunkel, which was pretty tasty.", 
            "if you judge this place based on the atmosphere of the original location in munich, this place actually does a pretty good job.\n\nparking is available in the back, but the lot isn't the biggest.  we ended up parking at the hyatt next door (signage seemed to indicate it was allowed but i can't be sure).\n\nwhile waiting in front, there's a bar area where you can chill over a beer or two, or browse the souvenir shop.\n\nthe main dining room of this location is noticeably smaller than its german big brother, but they did a lot of work painting the interior to match the real deal.  special mention goes to the ceiling artwork.  the back of the hall has an \"outdoor\" dining room that is quite stunning.  it's fully indoors, but the sky-painted ceilings and decor really make you think you're dining on a patio.  this outdoor room is reserved for special occasions though.\n\nthere was a football match <mark>Soup of the Day</mark> we went, so they had tvs wheeled out.\n\nthere's this one guy hired to play the alpenhorn, and he was go around making sure everyone was slightly drunk and happy.  not the same as the real band in munich, but he kept us all amused.\n\nbeers are available in 0.3l, 0.5l, and 1.0l varieties.  hopefully you know your metric.  one great thing about weissbier (wheat beer) is that it goes down easy.  there are different varieties for you to try as well.  and for the most authentic experience, you obviously want the biggest glass.  i don't even think they have the smaller ones in germany, but that was a few years back.\n\nfood is quite delightful and quite authentic, but not for everyone.  many of the foods are pickled.  the sausages were decent but a bit on the mushy side.  but i really enjoyed their pickled beet salad (mush?) and sauerkraut - both quite good.\n\nservice was prompt and very friendly.  wi-fi is available, but it was quite spotty.\n\nthe only thing is that this place can get pricey really quickly.  at some $20 a dish and $10 for a beer, you can see how this can get expensive if you have a family.\n\nof course, at the end, be sure to swing by the souvenir shop if you didn't do so at the beginning.  much of the swag doesn't say \"las vegas\" on it, so if you wanted to trick someone into thinking you went to germany..\n\noverall, a fun time.  not exactly what you'd experience as a tacky tourist in germany, but actually quite close.", 
            "it's a huge room (2 big rooms, actually) with huge german beers (and draft german beer = awesome tastiness).  the \"indoor\" room has the bandstand, so that's where the party is.  the \"outdoor\" (standard lv sky painted ceiling) has a working fountain and balcony, which look nice.  a great overflow/quiet room to escape any nuttiness in the main room.\n\nand let's be clear, this is vegas (and america), so it's super fake and non-authentic (think venetian), but it tries, the beer is awesome, and the food is good enough, so i'd be back.  if you think you'll be transported to munich, take another look at the map and come back to earth.\n\nwent on a saturday afternoon with the wife and <mark>Soup of the Day</mark> solo act was one of the best one-man shows i've seen in a while.  funny, musical, interactive.  oh, and toasts drinking often, in case you needed a reason.  folks are looking to have fun and talk with each other (i.e., not a normal american bar), so that's a huge plus.\n\ni'll be back here again on a weekend night to try it out--yeah, it's that worth it.\n\nas for the food, the schnitzel isn't breaded (?!) and they charge for extra jaeger sauce, which is stupid, but the spaetzle isn't bad and the wien wuerstl (vienna sausage) is spot-on (with that special german snap).  the black forest cake is horrid, more like a devil's food cake with a couple cherries, so avoid that at all costs.",

            "the decor was fun and the beer was good.  the costumes were entertaining and the atmosphere was enjoyable.  my waitress was attentive and nice.  overall it was a fun evening and i had a good time.  i would go back to this restaurant with a group of friends but the volume is high enough that i would avoid taking anyone i wanted to have a good conversation with.  \n\nthat said there were some issues.  \n\nfirst:  the music when we showed up was really fun.  it wasn't authentic seeming but it was good party music.  they did have a little tribute with an alphorn that the band members carried from table to table.  then the band took a break and when they came back the music style swapped from accordions to guitars and they began playing music that really did not fit the pre-break atmosphere.  i also felt it was inappropriate when they asked everyone to stand for the national anthem, it is not veteran's day or memorial day and i did not go to a bavarian/german restaurant to be invaded by us politics.  really....if you're gonna play an anthem, at least play one from germany.  \n\nsecond:  the food was mediocre at best.  there was very little sauerkraut on the plate and the sausages were somewhat bland.  i ordered a pretzel and it came from the kitchen half frozen.  presentation of the plate was poor and unappealing.  i really did enjoy <mark>Soup of the Day</mark> beer though.  \n\nthird:  price.  at 20$ each, i would expect a lot more in both quality and presentation.", 
            "the hofbr\\u00e4uhaus remains a great place to spend a few hours over lunch. german beer, sausages, and other yummy treats make it a good place to cure a las vegas hangover. go sit down at the oktober-style benches and enjoy treats you would only get in munich itself.  on weekends you find bavarian style entertainment, which consists of a man-show showing off odd skills like blowing a 20 feet long alphorn. the place transforms any crowd into a huge party tent in the middle <mark>Soup of the Day</mark>. recommendation to guys: make sure you try the jaegermeister / butt paddle action: you get a shot of herb-based liquor with a nice spanking from a busty waitress in a dirndle outfit all in front of everybody.",

            "having been to the original hofbrauhaus in munich, i can tell you it was very authentic - albeit at 1/3 the size. as others mentioned, the food is mostly good but nothing to die for. the sausages were the best, but the spaetzle and the pork dishes were good too. <mark>Soup of the Day</mark> beer was tasty also. it's not cheap for what it was, but nonetheless it was a great experience and totally fun!",

            "die hofbrau war betrunken und gem\\u00fctliche zeit mit gutem bier und essen! or in my language:\nde hofbrau was een dronken en gezellig tijd met goed bier en eten! anyway you say it, the hofbrauhaus was a drunken and cozy time with good beer and food and made some new friends! this is our third dinner in vegas as we're just visiting, but wanted something we don't have at home in the bay area or reno (seem my second home). first we did thai, malaysian and now german! there's already a live band playing here and the mood does seem to be set for drinking beer and eating sausage! this place is huge with a big dining hall and if you are a small party like us you may get seated with other people you don't know ...but you will!\n\nwe are seated by ourselves at first. ok, beers! we start with the hofbr\\u00e4u dunkel which is <mark>Soup of the Day</mark> of the beers with the most alcohol content, 5.5% (ok, i looked it up!). seems like bigger than normal beer mugs. very tasty! i like it. so on with some food, we started with the kartoffelpuffer, which was crispy potato pancakes with apple sauce. those went good with the beer. next was the munich sausage salad which was served with <mark>German <mark>American Rye Bread</mark></mark>. the salad had sausage that was marinated in oil and vinegar served with swiss cheese. you take the bread and cheese and eat it with the sausage salad. i liked it, but i think it was a little too euro for my bf. he at the cheese and the bread.\n\nmore beer i say! we stick with <mark>Soup of the Day</mark> beer. getting on to main courses, we order the house sausage plate, which has a bunch of different sausages on it and some <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark>. we shared the plates along with <mark>Schnitzel Wiener Art</mark>, which is a big ass breaded pork cutlet served with <mark>Bavarian Potato Salad</mark>. if you haven't figured out the germans are into meat and potatoes! the sausages served are not labeled, so you just eat by taste, like it eat it, no? then leave it. e ate all of them. \n\nmy bf stopped at 2 beers, but i had more since i wasn't the one driving! now we had neighbors at the table but what the hell, i'm having a good time with beer and the music playing and eating sausages! we made them have a good time too! the <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark> were really good, you can tell they were made from scratch.when that pork cutlet arrived, we all said holy shit is that big! it was tasty too, not too over cooked or tough like some can be. my mom cooked that once and it was not good! i think i had 4 beers, and all i know is i was pretty sloshed at the end, but still knowing i was having a good time! i think we must have been here 2 1/2 hrs. it's a fun place if you let yourself have fun. the food is good, well, as good as german food can be. i was looking forward to having rouladen, but i didn't see it on the menu. come for the whole experience, not just for the food ...or you could come just for the beer!", 
            "oktoberfest all year long...why would i not love this place? \n\ni don't know much about german food...but german beer...well yes. the pitchers are big, the hefeweizen is cold...the polka band is providing entertainment...and you can get paddled. \n\npricing is what you'd expect for a vegas restaurant but the happy hour offers decent deals if you want to get your drinking started during <mark>Soup of the Day</mark>. \n\nyes...i'll be back and prob buy something overpriced at the souvenir shop cause it is beer inspired.", 
            "this review is long overdue....\n\nwhile enroute to las vegas on a red eye flight, i was reading an in-flight magazine, when i noticed an ad for this restaurant.  the advertisement called them the first and only authentic german beer hall and restaurant to call las vegas, nv home.  not only that...they're a replica of munich's famed hofbr\\u00e4uhaus but in an enclosed building.  there was also an ad that offered a free mug (per customer) of their oktoberfest beer just for stopping in.  we were excited because we have never been to munich.\n\nanyway, we arrived at the restaurant at lunchtime and there was a line of people waiting to get in.  the building is quite large and has high ceilings that makes you feel like you're under a huge tent with painted indoor gardens.  you could almost hear people's conversation echo about.  we were seated at a large community table as an attentive and friendly server came by.  \n\nwe thought about ordering only a snack to take advantage of the free beer advertisement.   our order consisted of 2 pretzels and 2 small (free) mugs of their oktoberfest beer.  the beer was cold, crisp and clean tasting.  we were told that the beer is imported from the same batches as what is made and served at the hofbr\\u00e4u tents.  we considered upgrading to a 1l stein but we knew that we had dinner reservations set for later that evening.\n\n- jumbo pretzel which was huge and served warm. there were two types of mustards and an obazter (obatzda?) cheese.  we were familiar with the mustards but the cheese spread/dip was deliciously different.  apparently, it is a bavarian cheese delicacy...a mixture of soft cheeses and butter.\n\n- jumbo pretzel with <mark>Bavarian Liver Mousse and Obazter (Cheese Specialty)</mark> (obatzda) cheese.  the liver mousse was light and flavorful. i know, some of you might be saying \"ewww\" but, it was really good.  i wished that there was a larger portion but, it would've been overkill.\n\nwe enjoyed both <mark>Fresh Baked Pretzel</mark> as they were served warm, soft and a bit chewy.  the pretzels and beers were perfect together and we were satiated.  \n\nbut, then....i looked at their dinner menu and spied \"schweinshaxe\" aka roasted pork shank with crispy skin!  omg...i started planning our return because they serve this specialty after 4pm.  alas, our stay in lv was only for a couple <mark>Soup of the Day</mark> and as they say, \"our dance card was filled\".  so, just to keep my tastebuds focused, i borrowed the picture of that pork shank.  i will return.....  maybe the oompah band will be playing.\n\n#495"

            "love this place! been to the original one in germany, and the first time i walked into the one in vegas, i felt like i was back in europe! the <mark>Jumbo Pretzel Combo</mark> is awesome! it's a great place and always an awesome time!  it can be a little $$$, so just be careful!  i have found that some of the plates are rather large so sharing is what we normally do!  weekends tend to get a little crowded (around 730-8pm), so making a reservation (inside the beer hall) is what i recommend!  all the servers have been awesome, except for when they litterally chase you down in the gift shop and remind you that if you buy something it has to be under their name... strange and annoying, but other then that, the food and atmosphere is amazing!  a great place for any celebration have it be a birthday, a reunion or just life!"

            "love their beer!!   i was over the moon when i discovered they had a beer hall in vegas, so this place was a definite must on places to visit while there.\n\nwe had perfect timing as germany was playing in the world cup when we happened to swing by.  what an amazingly fun atmosphere.  my husband got the sauerbraten (very tender and not uber sour) and loved it.  i had a bite and definitely wanted more.  i don't tend to like a lot of german food (sorry), just not my flavor palette, but i definitely enjoyed theirs.  i even liked the side of cabbage (my husband didn't as much as another local to us german restaurant).  i had to get the bavarian cheese appetizer with pretzel and a <mark>Classic Caesar Salad</mark>, both were mouth watering.  but the true highlight for me was their beer.  i was in 7th heaven!!  the downside, they were charging for water - when the bill came they charged us $4 for a bottle of water that normally costs around $1 at a gas station.  this was the most expensive lunch i think i have ever had, but it was worth it for us.  their hefe weizen is phenomenal!  in case i forgot to mention that before ;p"

            "visited: may 29th, 2011\n\nmy friend kerri made a reservation for 3pm for this place they day before. ania, one of isabel's friends suggested that we go to this place. i do believe that isabel had taken her then boyfriend (now husband) to this place on their anniversary (as an unmarried couple late last year). i was down to try a german/bavarian restaurant and see what foods they had to offer. ania, kerri (went to the munich location), and isabel said that this place was good. of course, i don't know what \"good\" german/bavarian food is supposed to taste like. \n\nwe went to hofbrauhaus after our windy and cold experience at marquee dayclub. it was still windy as we were walking in, but inside was nice and toasty. :) i absolutely loved the architecture in this building as well as the artwork and the long, wooden \"family style\" tables.  we were sat down and within a few minutes we were ready to order. our server was pretty friendly.  i ended up ordering the <mark>Creamy Bavarian Potato Soup</mark> w/ sliced sausage and the <mark>Obazter Classic Bavarian Appetizer</mark> while everyone else ordered meat items. none of us ordered any beer, although i was pretty tempted to order a stein. isabel ordered the shot that came with a paddle spanking, and ordered it for that reason. i know a few people in the restaurant ordered it, and when i saw the spankings and how much they hurt those people, i was not about to order it. when isabel got her spanking, she was a freakin' champ, only a little hop. lol.... \n\nanyway, our food took a little while to come to our table, but it was well worth it. my soup was creamy and tasty, and not salty and my appetizer was so good. the pretzel was soft and it was perfect with the seasoned brie & cream cheese dip, however, i consumed the pretzel before i even finished the two mounds of cheese dip. i ended up having to order another pretzel to finish it off. the girls seemed to enjoy the food and the festivities, which included the chicken dance. this occurred after the beer holding contest (the beer was in a stein and the arm had to be straight with no leaning back for leverage). in the end, two guys ended up in a tie and each got a free stein as a souvenir. us girls got a free stein after doing the chicken dance, and that stein went to isabel because it was her bachelorette party weekend. i hate the chicken dance, but it was worth getting kicked and stepped on to get a free stein. lol.....\n\nhofbrauhaus is a good place to drink tons of german-crafted beer, sing along with the host, get a spanking after taking shots (not for people with a low threshold for pain), eat delicious food, and do the chicken dance.", 
            "buy a spanking, get a free shot. or is it the other way around.?\nthis place is a replica of the famous hofbr\\u00e4uhaus in munich, but unlike many replicas here in vegas, hofbr\\u00e4uhaus was able to also bring the same atmosphere of the original hofbr\\u00e4uhaus, live german band playing classic german and american singalong songs, lots of beer, food and loud drunk customers having one hell of a time. this is definitely a great place for celebrations. also, where else would you get spanked every time you have a shot of j\\u00e4ger?... here!...so i started with a shot of j\\u00e4ger.\nnow, the food is a different story, although people around me seemed to enjoy it, i'm not really a fan. i ordered the hofbr\\u00e4uhaus wurstplatte, recommended by my hispanic looking german waitress, she said it was one of the most popular dishes in the house and the menu says is for sausage lovers. ( i know, it doesn't sound right) it wasn't bad really but it wasn't good either, i wasn't impressed by it, i mean there was the \"wow\" factor but nothing to do with flavor...... so i ordered another shot of j\\u00e4ger. (better sausages at las vegas grille and also less intimidating)\npreviously i had ordered the <mark>Obazter Classic Bavarian Appetizer</mark>, obazda, now this is worth ordering again, it was really good. brie prepared with cream cheese, butter, onions, served with a freshly <mark>Fresh Baked Pretzel</mark>...... and a shot of j\\u00e4ger.\nthe beers are good of course, who doesn't like german beer? but they are a little bit pricey so we only had one 1 litter oktoberfest beer each. wow, when the waitress came back and sat the two beers on the table my friend and i looked at them and we were impressed of how huge they were! wow! there's something worth coming back for! (by the way, the beers were also big) ....so i had a shot of j\\u00e4ger.\nfor dessert i ordered the apfelstrudel which is their signature dessert and i loved it, accompanied with a shot of j\\u00e4ger is the best.\ni'm pretty sure i'll be back. even though this place is a bit pricey and they seem to cater mostly to tourists, this is a good place for birthday parties and any kind of celebration or to bring friends from out of town.\ngerman music playing, beer drinking people singing and dancing, fun staff going around entertaining and serving happy customers, eating and huge (beers), shots of j\\u00e4ger. i can definitely get used to all this.............spanking."

            "exact replica of the hofbrauhaus in munchen! except that the outdoor beer garden is not really outdoor. i need to dig out my pictures from germany because it was so similar, i felt like i was teleported back in time to one of my fun trips through europe. \n\nmy co-worker and i were transported back and forth past this place on the way to the convention center and when it was time to eat, we agreed to check this place out. it's diagonal from hard rock and huge - hard to miss. \n\nin the front there is a cute gift shop w/ cheesy souvenirs like beergarden girl aprons and the huge steins w/ the hofbrauhaus logo. we were greeted by a friendly german man who smiled and asked if we'd like to be seated next to some good-looking men. haha - the tables are large and you will sit (if you're in a small party) with other parties. unfortunately, no one was there (men anywhere near our age) so we were seated next to a grandma w/ her teenage granddaughter who was apparently applying for a job. the band was playing in their leiderhausen, beers in hand. great atmosphere.\n\nwe started with a jumbo oktoberfest pretzel that came with a tasty spread on the side, and mustard. great starter! i'm not a huge beer fan, but had to get one to be in the mood. it came in a big ol' mug - it was their version of hefeweizen. i wasn't lovin' it, but i drank it anyway.\n\nfor my meal i ordered the majoram - <mark>Majoram  Veal Bratwurst</mark> and it came with <mark>Red Cabbage</mark> and <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark>. i had to get some spaetzle on the side, but it was flavorless and disappointing. the <mark>Red Cabbage</mark>, which i didn't really want, was good. the bratwurst, also good. we also got sauerkraut and that was good as well and served warm. my coworker got this inappropriately large sausage sandwich - the <mark>HB Riesenbratwurst</mark>. we had to take pics b/c it was so long and huge. hilarious. she was hammin' it up.\n\nno room for dessert, but my coworker had to have some german schnapps <mark>Friday - Beer Battered Ocean Cod</mark> different from american schnapps. i was blown away by how potent the pear one was, but the apple was good. and strong.  by the end of the night we were stuffed. i don't recommend this for dinner before going clubbing. better for <mark>Soup of the Day</mark> of your flight home so you can waddle around and sit.", 
            "this review maybe a little biased because of how much fun i was having on this night, but i must say, this place is a great time!\n\ni had been once before for lunch with my parents when there was no band, no crowds, and hardly any beer drinking. \n\non saturday night, my girlfriend and i came here with a friend not knowing what to expect. we were wandering the gift shop waiting to be seated and all we could hear were screams and cheers and loud music and grown men screaming in pain as they are paddle spanked by adult women. willingly spanked by women with a large paddle. hysterical. \n\nwe were seated at a table right in front of the band where a group of four were already sitting, drinking, and having a great time. immediately upon our entrance, the band asked everyone to stand up or stand on the tables for the national anthem. drunk people swinging their mugs around and shouting out their american pride! such a funny experience! \n\nwe immediately ordered beers and a pretzel. the hofbr\\u00e4u original beer was delicious! i am not a huge beer drinker, but this beer was smooth and had a wonderful light taste to it. we must have ordered at least 8 of them throughout the night. when the pretzel came out, it was huge and salty and soft and delicious. the dipping sauces (there were two different mustard and one cheese) tasted great, especially the cheese! it may have been because we were feeling a bit tipsy, but we really enjoyed the pretzel and the three of us ate it up in a hurry. \n\nmy girlfriend and i shared the <mark>HB Riesenbratwurst</mark>, which was a slightly small sausage on a roll with sauerkraut and <mark>Onion Mustard</mark>. it tasted delicious! the sausage was a bit smaller than i expected, especially for the price, but the overall flavor combinations were wonderful. again, this may be attributed to my buzzed taste buds, who knows? \n\nas the night progressed, there were many toasts made and many people brought up to the stage for chugging contests and songs and dances. people watching was the greatest and everyone was really friendly and excited to be there. \n\nbottom line: it's impossible to not have a good time here on a friday or saturday night unless you do not enjoy the following: making friends, loud music, toasts and drinking delicious beer, german horns, and some good old fashioned comradery."

            "once upon a time in a far away land there lived a boy that could celebrate octoberfest no more than one month a year.  he would order seconds and thirds of his favorite schnitzel and bratwurst dishes, fill his gullet with authentic german bier till he couldn't walk and toast the night away with good friends as the polka band would play his favorite drinking songs.  he would wake up the next morning with a pounding in his head, his voice gone from singing at the top of his lungs and sounds of accordions and tubas resonating in his ears.  just to do it all over again night after night until the festival was no more.  he would have to wait another long and uneventful eleven months until the magic would return. until now.\n\nthe moment you walk through the door you can't help but smile and think to yourself,\"it's party time\" or in my case,\"lets get fing fed up\".  the band is rocking, or as much as a polka band could rock, the crowd is rowdy, and i mean dancing on top of tables rowdy and bent over getting spankings from jager girls rowdy. the waitresses have german accents, and i mean real accents, not bs fake medieval times accents. \n\nwaiter: \"would me lord wisheth more ale\"\nme:\"cut the crap sir d bag and get me a beer.\" \n\ni also love how this place forces you to socialize.  you can't ask for a table for two and expect a quite romantic dinner.  your seated at large picnic style benches perfect for standing and splashing beer on.  \n\nok so now on to the food.  the dinners are not too pricey the couple times i have been i have spent about $16 a plate.  i usually get the <mark>Nurnberger Rostbratwurstl</mark> it consist of 3 pork sausages with sauerkraut, mash potatoes and gravy.  dudes, believe me when i tell you, this stuff is absolutely amazing.  if you're only experience with bratwurst is something you get out of a package from your local piggly wiggly, forget everything you thought you knew and get ready for the pork epiphany.  every bite you take will open new doors of flavor and flavor combinations.  if your anything like me and like to drink as much as you like to eat you will actually end up spending more money on beer than you will on food.  last time i was there i had 3 liters of beer, one of the dunkelweizen, one of the hefeweizen and one pilsner.  the dunkel was my absolute favorite out of the three.  so all in all if your looking for a place to get rowdy, dance on top of the tables, take shots of jager, get spanking from jager girls as well as get a top notch meal in the mean time look no further."

            "we visited the real hofbrauhaus in munich a few months ago, and wanted to try the las vegas version to see if it could compare.  the verdict: it does a great job of offering 2/3 of the party in a much more convenient location.\n\nit's communal seating, and my wife and i were seated next to a quartet of german guys on a road trip throughout the western us.  at one point they went to talk to the swiss band leader in german for a few minutes, and came back telling us they convinced him to play some conventional oktoberfest music.  the band struck up a stirring, heavily accented rendition of sweet caroline, followed immediately by take me home, country roads.  our table mates lead the sing-along, swinging their liters of beer from side to side.  \"this is exactly what we sing at oktoberfest!\" they exclaimed.  \n\nalso, if you order a shot, the waitress delivers your spirit, then delivers a spirited paddle to your rear... as hard as she can muster.  my wife and i did not try it, but our german table mates partook at least 3 times (each).  they insisted paddling is not a german tradition, but is actually an american misperception of how scary and severe germans are.  (true to this claim, we saw no paddling at the munich hofbrauhaus.)\n\nthen the band played the star spangled banner, and the germans stood on top of the table chanting \"usa! usa! usa!\"  so they were interesting to sit next to, and pretty drunk.  also the first time i've ever heard the national anthem in a bar.\n\nin terms of food, we tried the cheese spaetzel and <mark>Chicken Bratwurst</mark> - both were very good.  the pretzel was just ok -- too hard and not served warm.  i had a radler (beer cut with lemonade) since i wasn't trying to get too drunk -- also just ok, it was cloyingly sweet (i know, it's half lemonade, but an authentic radler has a subtler flavor)."

            "exact replica of the hofbrauhaus in munchen! except that the outdoor beer garden is not really outdoor. i need to dig out my pictures from germany because it was so similar, i felt like i was teleported back in time to one of my fun trips through europe. \n\nmy co-worker and i were transported back and forth past this place on the way to the convention center and when it was time to eat, we agreed to check this place out. it's diagonal from hard rock and huge - hard to miss. \n\nin the front there is a cute gift shop w/ cheesy souvenirs like beergarden girl aprons and the huge steins w/ the hofbrauhaus logo. we were greeted by a friendly german man who smiled and asked if we'd like to be seated next to some good-looking men. haha - the tables are large and you will sit (if you're in a small party) with other parties. unfortunately, no one was there (men anywhere near our age) so we were seated next to a grandma w/ her teenage granddaughter who was apparently applying for a job. the band was playing in their leiderhausen, beers in hand. great atmosphere.\n\nwe started with a jumbo oktoberfest pretzel that came with a tasty spread on the side, and mustard. great starter! i'm not a huge beer fan, but had to get one to be in the mood. it came in a big ol' mug - it was their version of hefeweizen. i wasn't lovin' it, but i drank it anyway.\n\nfor my meal i ordered the majoram - <mark>Majoram  Veal Bratwurst</mark> and it came with <mark>Red Cabbage</mark> and <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark>. i had to get some spaetzle on the side, but it was flavorless and disappointing. the <mark>Red Cabbage</mark>, which i didn't really want, was good. the bratwurst, also good. we also got sauerkraut and that was good as well and served warm. my coworker got this inappropriately large sausage sandwich - the <mark>HB Riesenbratwurst</mark>. we had to take pics b/c it was so long and huge. hilarious. she was hammin' it up.\n\nno room for dessert, but my coworker had to have some german schnapps <mark>Friday - Beer Battered Ocean Cod</mark> different from american schnapps. i was blown away by how potent the pear one was, but the apple was good. and strong.  by the end of the night we were stuffed. i don't recommend this for dinner before going clubbing. better for <mark>Soup of the Day</mark> of your flight home so you can waddle around and sit.",

            "the \"hof\" ( we are going to call it that because hofbrauhaus is way to hard to say and spell) is located in las vegas, nevada across from the hard rock hotel and casino off from harmon avenue. its a german ale house with a great bavarian menu.  the hof has family style seating which basically means bring your family or if you don't have a family to bring, prepare to be introduced to a replacement family for your meal. as luck would have it, simone and i went for lunch around 2:00pm and the place was almost empty so we didn't have to worry about being social with the sin city natives. after much analyzing of the menu we decided to start with the \"obatzer\" appetizer. lucky for my waitress she didn't have to worry about my total butchering of the german language as there were numbers that went along with each menu item for ease of translation. the \"obtazer\" is a hand made warm german pretzel served with a brie cheese and buttered onion dip. the dip was rich and creamy and totally went with the pretzel. there was dip left over after the pretzel was gone so the wife and i very elegantly stuck the rest on top of our knives and proceeded to stick it down our throats. although the choking seemed to be distracting to the other guests we definitely enjoyed our appetizer down to the last knife full.\nfor the entrees simone ordered the \"allgaur kasespatzle\". it was a german style mac and cheese made with mini german spaetzle <mark>Dumpling</mark>, swiss, brie, and again, those luscious buttered onions. it was creamy and rich with just the right amount of onion flavor. although simone could not finish it, due to the earlier appetizer gluttony, i gladly helped her out. for my own entree i choose the \"nurnberger rostbratwurst\". the dish consisted of 3 grilled bratwurst resting on a bed of fresh sauerkraut and <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark> with a beer gravy. the flavors went together perfectly and complimented each other well. the potatoes were creamy with a hint of garlic , the brats were seasoned perfectly, and the sauerkraut was just sour enough but didn't overpower the dish. i completely cleaned the plate and also finished off my side of fluffy spaetzle drizzled in butter and parsley.  my only regret about this meal is i had no more room in the stomach for german beer or dessert. i will definitely try some when i come back during my next vegas visit. this was excellent food in a great and fun setting off from the vegas strip.", 
            "the weekend of frozen fury is infamous for pre-party at hofbrauhaus before the game.  game got cancelled and no one was here, but the food more than made up for it!  the pretzel was a tad try but the mustard was great.  i got a jar to go and we paid $5 for it...i just found it today at cost plus world market for $2.50.  darn; i thought they made it themselves.  we got 2 random dishes that involved sausage and something that resembled potato <mark>Dumpling</mark>; not sure but both were delish!\n\nthe entertainment is amped up to high, even though the place was half packed.  the man looked like he escaped from beer fest and was smashed in the wee hours of the afternoon.  rock on.  we'll be back!", 
            "fun, funky restaurant and bar! live music, spankings, beer, soft pretzels... it's all there! \n\nthe place is located just 2 1/2 blocks off the main strip of las vegas. whether you are a local or just visiting for the weekend, it is definitely a place to check out. it's like most bavrian restaurants - girls in barmaid outfits, long wooden tables family style, and beer steins. \n\nfood - if you are going for appetizers only, get the soft pretzels or the potato pancakes. they are delicious and easy to share. as for the food, you can't go wrong! you have to order the sp\\u00e4tzle - it's an egg noodle that tastes like potato <mark>Dumpling</mark>. the breaded pork chops with mushroom cream sauce is my favorite! \n\ndrinks - good prices and the beer tastes good! but then again, when doesn't it? if you buy shots, the bar maids will spank you, two easy one, but the last one hurts. be careful. :)\n\nthe only downside is that it gets really loud at night. you may have to shout to speak to the person across from you! definitely worth checking out!", 
            "definitely not my scene. i've been wanting to go here for a while and finally went last night with my boyfriend.  what a tourist trap!  do not go if you do not like sitting at a table with strangers. that's how they seat everyone there. i could barely hear myself talk because it was so loud with the live band and spankings. they also have an alphorn that they play at every table to get you to tip them. no kidding, they will set the horn on top of your table and play the same tune at every table in the restaurant to get tipped. it gets very old, very fast. if that's not enough, they also go around asking if you want your picture taken, which they try to make you buy at the end of your meal. the food was meh. my pretzel was hard and the potato <mark>Dumpling</mark> weren't great. the only reason why this review has two stars rather than one is because of their sausage and apple strudel. the strudel was actually really good. other than that, i don't have any interest in returning."

            "the schnitzelmann hates what he must do here because he really believes in supporting unique places, especially one of only two authentic german restaurants in town. but if he is honest, 2 stars is about what the place is worth after deductions for the following:\n\none star must be deducted because of the exaggerated prices, which have risen regularly since the restaurant opened. authentic ethnic cuisine can be had - even imported items - for lower prices than this at other off-strip restaurants. the schnitzelmann suspects that the hofbr\\u00e4uhaus is mercilessly targeting one-time tourists, ignoring locals and practicing monopoly-driven price inflation such that if in germany, the bundesbank would immediately intervene. \n\nanother star must be deducted for the noise level, particularly evenings. the schnitzelmann has been to the original hofbr\\u00e4uhaus in m\\u00fcnchen and can verify the music in las vegas is authentic, but significantly louder than in the old country. it is near-impossible to have any sort of dinner conversation with bands imported from deutschland playing \"hang on sloopy,\" \"country roads\" and other obscure hits amplified to ensure maximum volume. \n\na final star must be deducted for the service. the schnitzelmann has known several of the waitresses personally and agrees they are of the finest personality away from the restaurant. inside, though, the management seems to dictate that most wait staff push the more expensive items, rush customers out the door if they have not bought food or drink within a given amount of time, and be somewhat inflexible as regards splitting the bill. always? no. but too regularly to ignore.\n\nso we are left with two stars. one is for the high-quality food- all the items that can be are imported from germany, including the fine beers on tap, and the schnitzelmann has never had a bad schnitzel, wurst plate or even salad here. the two <mark>Bavarian Potato Salad</mark> on offer are also quite good and the kaiserschmarrn dessert is made just as in mad king ludwig of bavaria's day.\n\none star is granted for the party-hearty atmosphere. the schnitzelmann celebrated his bachelor party here and the long benches and tables and free-flowing beer made it easy to make new friends and revel in the waitresses spanking customers who request it. the same atmosphere (minus spankings) can be had during world cup and european cup fussball matches, which are televised live and to which many knowledgeable and enthusiastic german fans come. \n\nbut as regularly as schnitzelmann comes here, there is always a sense afterwards he could have spent his time and money better elsewhere and that were he not such a fan of german culture and were there other german places in town, he would be at the hofbr\\u00e4uhaus considerably less often.", 
            "nice crowd and a fun time if you don't take yourself too seriously. beer is very good. food is very good. schnitzel and sausage are both well executed. sides (spetzle, <mark>Bavarian Potato Salad</mark>, red beet salad, cucumber salad) shine especially brightly.  delicious. service is with a cheeky smile.  gift shop is kitchy fun.  apparently there is some way that you can convince the waitresses to hit you on the backside with a wooden paddle. it's apparently a traditional thing.  hilarity ensues.", 
            "loved this place!  most people who have been to vegas numerous times don't even know about it.  we just happened to be staying at a hotel nearby and drove by it several times and it was also recommended in frommer's.  what fun!  great food - we chose the appetizer sampler which included variety of sausages, sauerkraut, <mark>Bavarian Potato Salad</mark> and pretzels.  yum!  we also had apfelstrudel for dessert.  there was live entertainment and we were lucky enough to be there at the same time as a bachelor party which made the atmosphere at 2:00 in the afternoon very boisterous!  we totally enjoyed it and loved finding a place off the strip that was so fun and had good food, too.", 
            "i had been told to try the hofbrauhaus before i left for vegas by some co-workers. man was i glad that they recommended this place! the atmosphere was loud, but that is to be expected when the entertainment is never ending. going on a monday night i had thought it would be a smaller crowd, but decided to make a reservation. glad i made a reservation because the place was packed!!!! i started out with one of their white wines and the pretzel appetizer with cheese. delicious!  at that point i was already feeling full but decided to try out some other things. i ordered some german weiners but it tasted kind of like over-done oscar mayer hot dogs honestly....which is why this place did not get 5 stars from me. the <mark>Bavarian Potato Salad</mark> that came with the meal was absolutely amazing! never had any <mark>Bavarian Potato Salad</mark> taste that great! needless to say, it was a great experience but i would probably order a schnitzle or something more authentic next time.", 
            "for me, the main bonus of staying so off the strip at the hard rock was how close the hofbrauhaus was.  while living in germany, this was a main stop for giant beers and plates of schnitzel.  it was nice to relive that experience at the hofbrauhaus las vegas and we even got sat with a boisterous man from munich at one of the many communal tables.  we didn't get the big beers but i forgot how much i loved the hb hefeweizen. \n\nthe only downside for me was the \"german\" <mark>Bavarian Potato Salad</mark> which was much less german and more backyard american barbecue.  i was really looking forward to it but ended up disappointed.  \n\ndespite that one hiccup, we had a good time and after going from one smokey casino to the next, i really appreciated the smoke free environment.", 
            "we stayed near the strip for my husband's birthday so i wanted to go to a place we wouldn't normally go to. i chose about 3 to 4 possibilities. my husband liked the idea of eating at hofbrauhaus so we decided to give it a try even though i knew this place is better for big groups. we walked in to people on the table with their beer in hand singing their hearts out! i thought \"oh cool!\" . i was secretly glad the hostess led us to the quieter beer garden though. i just wanted a semi peaceful evening!\n\nit was a nice size space and it looked like we were sitting outside. the ceiling was painted with a beautiful blue sky and there were cute  lanterns hovering around us.  they also have freelance photographers who walk around offering to take souvenir photos of you . we bought one since we were celebrating jon's birthday.  if sentimental gestures are not your thing they have shot girls who will give you shots while smacking your bottom with a wooden paddle! \nsome of the ladies really get into it they kind of do a three step jog then swing! we were fine just watching. it was pretty entertaining to watch while you wait for your food.\n\nthe food comes out really quick so there isn't really a wait time. i was pleasantly  surprised because the place was packed. we started off with the <mark>Creamy Bavarian Potato Soup</mark>. it was too salty for me so i just had a couple of spoons of it. we also ordered the jumbo complete which was a big pretzel served with \"obatzer\" cheese, <mark>Bavarian Sweet Mustard</mark> and <mark>Onion Mustard</mark>. the <mark>Bavarian Sweet Mustard</mark> was my favorite! the pretzel was also too salty for me so i just tried to avoid eating the outside of the pretzel. i had the <mark>Schnitzel Wiener Art</mark> for my main entree . it is a breaded pork cutlet that is served with <mark>Bavarian Potato Salad</mark> and cranberry sauce. it looked like a big chicken patty. the taste was okay but i think i would have liked it better if i dipped it in the mustard rather than the cranberry sauce. the <mark>Bavarian Potato Salad</mark> i was expecting to taste amazing because they specialize in this type of cuisine but it was unremarkable. the strudel is amazing here though! it was so soft and tasted wonderful! \n\nthis is a nice place to go out with friends and have a few beers. i would go back again but i would order different items off the menu. i would keep my dessert the same though!", 
            "while having a stay-cation, my boyfriend and i walked around the area.  he had never been to hard rock so we walked over from the strip.  i have always wanted to go to the hofbrauhaus and so when we were over we had to stop in.\n\nwe sat down at the bar they have outside the restaurant and he got the hefeweizen and i just got their lager.  i loved the baby mug (10oz or .3l) that i got.  i have to go back one day after work and buy like 2 of them.  i have issues with these baby mugs!  the lager was good and light but i taste the hefeweizen and about had a heart attack!  it was the best hefeweizen i have ever tasted.  my boyfriend was going over the food and was drooling.  he hasn't had german food since he was there so we made reservations to come back that night.\n\nwe came back at 7pm and were seated right away.  ordered each of us a liter of hefeweizen and pretzel and brie cheese app.  omg the brie cheese concoction, delicious!!!  i just wanted to eat it alone it was sooooo good.  we shared the 3 different sausage plate which came with sauerkraut and <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  we also ordered <mark>Bavarian Potato Salad</mark>.  german <mark>Bavarian Potato Salad</mark> is different, more vinegar, but still yummy.  the sausage was good too, one was my favorite but don't remember what was in it.  the food came out fast and the waitress are friendly even with crazy drunks around.  while we were eating they had a band playing traditional german music and also some american.\n\nthey had girls going around spanking people, had a beer holding contest (1 liter, not easy) and just a great time.  we have plans to go back again!!!  i need some hefeweizen!!!", 
            "many tasty looking things on the menu. unfortunately items are seemingly randomly paired with \"fixed\" sides and substitutions are not allowed. for instance, if you don't like <mark>Bavarian Potato Salad</mark> you will be expected to have the <mark>Bavarian Potato Salad</mark> \"held\" from your plate and pay $4.99 for a different side. all sides are listed as $4.99, including the one you just had \"held\" from your plate, so why refuse to be accommodating to a customer who is already paying $19.99 for a lunch entree? this is especially difficult at a place where most of the sides are like it or leave it options like <mark>Red Cabbage</mark> and sauerkraut. i couldn't find two options that looked appetizing so i watched the rest of my party eat and sipped my water. my husband ordered the 306 and was underwhelmed. we ended up spending $7 for my daughter to eat a dry pretzel after they tacked on a $4 upcharge for cheese she couldn't stand. their radler is mixed with <mark>Sierra Mist</mark>, which is close to heresy. all of this from a girl who was born in germany and loved the food. this place is a tourist trap with good beer.",

            "now before anyone jumps on me about this is not a true beer hall or something like that, i too have visited the hofbtauhaus in munich germany and though i was in las vegas this beer hall did bring back some very thoughtful memories. the beer hall is painted very similar to its german patriarch and the smell of german cooking filled the air. i started off with a 0.5l dunkle as did my wife and we ordered a sausage sampler. the order came with <mark>Bavarian Potato Salad</mark>, sauerkraut and a pair of pretzels. with the exception of the pretzels which were well overcooked the meal was a great sampling of food. half way through eating an entertainer arrived playing traditional german music and did a great job getting the crowd involved. we decided to order another round, this time i ordered 1.0l helles, and stayed to enjoy the show. we both had a lot of fun singing and raising our mugs. if you are looking for an escape from all the loud las vegas bars and restaurants and want a truly unique experience visit the hofbtauhaus you will not be disappointed.",

            "i had my hopes up for this place. walking in it seemed like a fun atmosphere, but quickly it felt like more of a tourist attraction. from the start our server was trying to get us to buy raffle tickets. it didn't stop there. when she would check on us, she was saying things like \"if you like the taste of that, we sell it in our gift shop\" and at the end of the meal even asked if she could walk with us to the gift shop (we told her that we didn't want to go earlier and thanked her for the info) to pick somethings out so she could meet her goal since she was in the lead for some sort of competition with the other employees for work. to put people on the spot so many times is rude. ask once and if the customer is interested they will tell you! \n\nwhat encouraged us to come here was because i have family here in town that is hosting an exchange student from germany and i thought she would not only like this place, but maybe feel a bit of home. we sat at nice long table that is shared with the other customers. i don't personally like that, but that's the theme here so it was fine. there was live music being played which was cool. \n\npriced at $19.99 we started out with the \"sausage tower\" at the suggestion of our server. she said it was a \"hidden\" menu item since it isn't on the menu and it would give us a good taste of the different sausages they have. sounded good to me! when it arrived, it looked like a tower of heaven. there were 3 dishes. 1 dish had <mark>Chicken Bratwurst</mark>, pork sausage and <mark>Majoram  Veal Bratwurst</mark> on a bed of sauerkraut. the 2nd dish had krainer, grilled weisswurst and a frankfurter with <mark>Bavarian Potato Salad</mark>. the 3rd dish had 2 <mark>Fresh Baked Pretzel</mark> with 2 types of dipping sauces. of all the sausages i only really liked the taste of a couple of them, so it was nice to be able to sample it all instead of just ordering a certain sausage dish that i might have had a type of sausage in it that i wasn't to find of. the pretzels were pretty good and the mustard sauces had good flavor. for my meal i had priced at $4.95 a \"house salad\" and priced at $14.95 the \"grillhendl\" which is a chicken dish. the salad was average, but the chicken dish was above average. the chicken was roasted and stuffed with parsley, beer butter and onions. the chicken was crispy and had a good flavor. it also came with a side of <mark>Bavarian Potato Salad</mark> that was decent. \n\ni certainly didn't leave hungry! i didn't leave feeling like i would come back though either. the vibe inside just screamed \"gimmick\" and \"tourist attraction here\" which our guest from germany agreed. the server was just too pushy about trying to get us to buy different things. my husbands meal was a joke especially for the price, so i lucked out with the chicken dish i ordered. i'm glad i experienced hofbr\\u00e4uhaus at least once.",

            "the schnitzel was a good average schnitzel. probably some of the better schnitzel you will find in the us. the <mark>Bavarian Potato Salad</mark> was different than the <mark>Bavarian Potato Salad</mark> from germany, but still good. the burger was a very good quality, tasty and moist. i would highly recommend the burger. it is not what you would normally expect. the black forest cake is very good and moist. the sauce is to die for. the hofbr\\u00e4u beer is a true german beer that is not common to most restaurants. i would recommend this restaurant for anyone to visit. it is a good, close to authentic german meal.",

            "the owners of one of munich's most famous institutions, the historic hofbrauhaus, have lovingly recreated it - across from the hard rock hotel - down to the last detail, complete with beers, steins, and brass bands. stepping through the front door, you leave behind the arid desert air and glitzy casinos of vegas as you're transported into a world of schnitzel, ale, and strudel, served in a beer hall with ornately painted columns and ceilings, or an indoor garden with chestnut trees and a fountain, by buxom dirndl-clad waitresses with rosy cheeks. having been to the original, i can attest to the autheniticy of the look, the feel, and the extensive bavarian menu here. liver mousse is served with a pretzel baked with dough flown in from the fatherland on a daily basis. if you like sausage, you must indulge in a wurstplatte, overloaded with viennese franks, chicken and pork links, creamy <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark>, and imported sauerkraut. pork roast with dark beer sauce and bread <mark>Dumpling</mark>, fried filet of cod with warm german <mark>Bavarian Potato Salad</mark>, and breaded pork cutlet with cranberries are among the other specialties. three versions of hofbrau - lager, a premium dark wheat, and a seasonal version - are on tap, and german, australian, and california wines are available by the bottle or glass. naturally the atmosphere is loud and festive, as if it's oktoberfest every day of the year. if you're not part of a group, you probably will be before the night is over. as highly recommended as it is totally unexpected for vegas.", 
            "exact replica of the hofbrauhaus in munchen! except that the outdoor beer garden is not really outdoor. i need to dig out my pictures from germany because it was so similar, i felt like i was teleported back in time to one of my fun trips through europe. \n\nmy co-worker and i were transported back and forth past this place on the way to the convention center and when it was time to eat, we agreed to check this place out. it's diagonal from hard rock and huge - hard to miss. \n\nin the front there is a cute gift shop w/ cheesy souvenirs like beergarden girl aprons and the huge steins w/ the hofbrauhaus logo. we were greeted by a friendly german man who smiled and asked if we'd like to be seated next to some good-looking men. haha - the tables are large and you will sit (if you're in a small party) with other parties. unfortunately, no one was there (men anywhere near our age) so we were seated next to a grandma w/ her teenage granddaughter who was apparently applying for a job. the band was playing in their leiderhausen, beers in hand. great atmosphere.\n\nwe started with a jumbo oktoberfest pretzel that came with a tasty spread on the side, and mustard. great starter! i'm not a huge beer fan, but had to get one to be in the mood. it came in a big ol' mug - it was their version of hefeweizen. i wasn't lovin' it, but i drank it anyway.\n\nfor my meal i ordered the majoram - <mark>Majoram  Veal Bratwurst</mark> and it came with <mark>Red Cabbage</mark> and <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark>. i had to get some spaetzle on the side, but it was flavorless and disappointing. the <mark>Red Cabbage</mark>, which i didn't really want, was good. the bratwurst, also good. we also got sauerkraut and that was good as well and served warm. my coworker got this inappropriately large sausage sandwich - the <mark>HB Riesenbratwurst</mark>. we had to take pics b/c it was so long and huge. hilarious. she was hammin' it up.\n\nno room for dessert, but my coworker had to have some german schnapps <mark>Friday - Beer Battered Ocean Cod</mark> different from american schnapps. i was blown away by how potent the pear one was, but the apple was good. and strong.  by the end of the night we were stuffed. i don't recommend this for dinner before going clubbing. better for <mark>Soup of the Day</mark> of your flight home so you can waddle around and sit.", 
            "so a friend was saying that he wanted to visit this place during this past trip to ces.  while waiting at baggage claim at las, i saw an ad for the place on the humongous tv screens, and it looked like a lot of fun.  so we decided to make a trip out there, and were definitely not disappointed.  although i don't necessarily like loud places, this was still a lot of fun, and it was amazing that for the 2 hours we were there, the band never seemed to stop, and they just kept going on and on with barely a pause, playing lively music, playing games, starting a conga line, etc.\n\nbut more than just the entertainment, which was definitely a lot of fun, the food was also excellent.  i was surprised that i was able to scarf down a plate that had a sausage, pork cutlet, some other pork cut, <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark>, and sauerkrat so quickly!  it was damn tasty, and i washed it down with a stein of beer.  it probably also explains my weight gain after this last trip to las vegas... :d", 
            "loved this place!  we went here in october 2007 and had an absolute blast!!  the beer was cold and delicious!  it was crazy fun - just like the pictures you've seen of the annual octoberfest in munich, but less people (of course).  the band even pulled my girlfriend on the stage to do the chicken dance.  speaking of chicken, we had the chicken sausage with sauerkraut and <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark> -- they were really good (especially after 2 liters of hefe!!).  i can't wait to go back here on our next trip (coming up in march '08)!!!!!!!", 
            "hofbrauhaus is all about the experience for those who love beer and enjoy the silliness of anyone willing to make a spectacle of themselves.  all this takes place in their beer hall where you'll find yourselves sharing a table and bench with a bunch of strangers.  if all goes well and you're friendly enough, you'll have a good time and a few laughs while you're at it.  \n\nthe important thing here is to make reservations!  a saturday night can easily be an hour plus wait and even worse if your party is huge.  so, whatever you do, call ahead!  otherwise you'll be stuck at the bar and peeking through the windows hoping for your turn in the hall.\n\nit's been awhile since i was in germany or had any german food, but all i could remember is some kind of noodle i wanted.  spatzle, it's called - and you can get a side of this dish.  definitely get it with a side of mushroom gravy (which is more like cream of mushroom gravy) 'cuz it's so good with it!  (the spatzle does come with other entrees though.)  \n\nthe bf got the hofbrauhaus platte which is a decent combination of just about everything - \"smoked pork loin, pork roast, smoked sausage, dark beer sauce, sauerkraut, and <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark>.\"  the sausage was pretty good, but the pork loin reminded me of corned beef (the kind you serve on with cabbage).  the pork roast was a bit dry for me, but the bf ate it all up.  a good helping of sauerkraut helps this go down easily.\n\nour friend also ordered this sausage dish that had his wieners sitting in a water bath when it arrived in a big ole bowl.  slather on the <mark>Bavarian Sweet Mustard</mark> and it's pretty grub!  \n\nof course, you have to wash this down with some beer - a liter size mug if you can hang.  (i cannot.)  check to see if they have any seasonal specials because it's worth ordering those instead.  (and be sure to read that newspaper they leave for you when you get the menu, sometimes the specials are listed there instead.)\n\nhofbrauhaus is the kind of place you go with friends - the more, the merrier.  it gets loud and crazy and the service is good.  waitresses and servers are busy, keeping your beverages full and your bellies happy.  (you'll see people from all ages here - toddlers even!)  they have live music where you'll be expected to sing along (and drink along).  weekday lunch specials are available too.  \n\nside note: they are right next to the hyatt plate hotel, so parking gets really full.  they do offer free valet service though.", 
            "german sausages, sauerkraut, <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark> and pitchers of beer!?!  i loveeeeeeeee this place.  the environment is sooo fun.  its a great place to go with ur friends!  they have beer holding stein contests, live german music.... and the seats are large picnic tables and ceiling is high as hell.  its pretty much the beer hall of usa. its a replica of the one from munich, germany which i hope to visit one day =) u must check it out if ur in vegas!!!", 
            "i've driven by this place so many times and from the outside - it looks like a cool building, but nothing really out of the ordinary.  there is no way anyone would ever know what goes on behind these walls by simply viewing the place from the outside.\n\nour party was three, my girlfriend, my girlfriend's close friend, and myself.  we went on saturday night around 9:00pm or so...the place was a mad-house!!  you could hear the revelry from the lobby!  right away, i knew this was going to be a unique experience!  after checking in at the podium, we were ushered into the room...long tables lined up and down the dining hall and in the back was a small stage area with a traditional \"oom-pah-pah\" band going to town!  as we made our way to our table, i saw large breasted women carrying litre sized beer mugs, 3 in each hand!!  people were standing on tables, crashing the beer mugs together and joining in traditional german toasts - then promptly quaffing their beers with a resounding \"prost!\".  \n\nfinally getting to the table - we got a chance to view the menu...all kinds of choices of traditional german fare.  i ended up having a platter that had smoked tenderloin, sausage, and a pork chop served with <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark> and saurkraut!  yum!!  my girlfriend had the weiss wurst platter - three long sausages over a bed of saurkraut.  both of us had a litre of the dunkel - their darkest beer.  it was delicious!!\n\ndinner commenced with lots of commotion, singing, drinking, and all around mayhem!  we thought the food was pretty good and the beer was awesome!  i highly recommend the pretzels...a great appetizer to share, as they are huge!!  \n\nfinal thoughts on this place - this is not the place to go for a romantic dinner and probably not a place you would just go with your significant other, that is unless you are like us....my girlfriend is german and loves beer more than me!!!  so, for us - we had an absolute blast.  just be sure you know what you are getting yourself into before you go....otherwise you will most likely be disappointed.  the prices are a bit steep - but hey, it's vegas!!  nothing is cheap here - unless you are way off strip!!  prepare to drop some coin...those beers are close to $14 a pop!!  still - this is the place to come with friends...bring a big group!  you won't regret it and make sure you bring a camera...we got some priceless photos!  taking a shot, bending over the table, and getting a firm spanking from brunhilda...now that's a unique vegas experience!!", 
            "it's october...and beer drinkers of the world know it's oktoberfest!  the big f and i celebrated at the only place that knows how to celebrate such an event in vegas - hofbrauhaus!\n\nfirst off, make reservations!  you'll save yourself the headache and wait - do it online or on the phone!  and don't sit in the beer garden, you want to be in the hall for sure!\n\nthe special on saturday is frische schweins haxen. \"crispy pork shank, served with sauerkraut, hb-oktoberfest beer gravy, bread and potato dumpling\" for $19.50.  for anyone that knows lechon, this is crispy skin at its ultimate!  a fabulous job on making that piece of meat visually appetizing and tasty! \n\nthey were also offering their famous bavarian dumpling soup for $5.50 and the hb-dessert tower of \"bavarian cream with marinated blueberries, quark strudel with vanilla bean ice cream, and black forest cake with chocolate sauce\" for $9.95.  \n\none friend ordered #310 <mark>Nurnberger Rostbratwurstl</mark>. \"sausage at its best! three roasted pork sausages with sauerkraut and <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark>\" for $13.50.  the sausage was pretty tasty with a good flavor.\n\ni went for their side of spatzel ($4.50) and mushroom gravy ($2.95) because it's something simple and i like their gravy sauce here.\n\nwe also enjoyed their seasonal roasted pecans and almonds.  by the back, there's a cart making roasted candied pecans and almonds for $3.50 a bag or two for $7.  pretty yummy stuff, especially when the nuts are still hot!\n\nhofbrauhaus is a place with a great atmosphere where you are bound to chat it up and drink a bit with your neighbors.  it's definitely not a pretentious crowd here, and you'll see people from all ages doing shots of jager.\n\n(pics posted!)", 
            "we came here with some friends and let me first say that their beer is pretty darn good. and that is coming from some people who love beer (my friends), and others (jason and myself) who usually don't care for many types of beer. that was the highlight of the experience for us as far as i was concerned. \n\nthe room was way too noisy to hold a decent conversation, but as the theme of the restaurant seemed to be \"drink beer and get drunk\", i guess i will let that slide. the waitresses were forced to wear these god awful costumes that were suppose to make them look like german bar maids but really just made them look frumpy, whether they were or not. and there was one poor decrepit 40 something who looked like she had prematurely aged due to partying to look more like she was 60, walking around with shots of jager and a paddle that she was suppose to smack your ass with after you took a shot.\n\nnow the food would have been good if it was served on a plane, but that's about in the quality range that i found it to be. they came out with the plastic covers on them which indicated that they had just been heated up and sent out for us rather than prepared fresh, and upon tasting there was no doubt. the <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark> were the instant kind, my chicken breast was a flattened out patty of a thing, definitely frozen and refrozen a couple of times, and the gravy tasted like it came from a powder. \n\nthey did have a good soft pretzel that they served with an awesome cheese dip, but at $10 for a pretzel, i could pass it up. \n\nmy friends really liked the place though, even though one of them got the same exact meal that i did, only with beef rather than chicken... maybe i am just expecting too much. then again, he did have twice the amount of beer that i did. maybe that's the secret to enjoying this place. \n\ni would come here again, but only to have the beer.", 
            "i love this place ! my friends had their wedding reception here and it was\ngreat. hofbrauhaus is german restaurant with a beer hall and a beer garden both awesome. we dined in the beer garden which is made to look like your outside with the blue sky and trees etc. you think your outside but your not.\nbeing a saturday night the place was jumping with great live music.\nthey had a beerstein holding contest which was fun to watch.\nthe whole atmosphere is like one big party for both young and old.\n as for the food and beer it's very good and i've been to germany many times.\nwe tried the nuenberer rostbratwurst (3 sausages with sauerkaut and\n<mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark> ) $13:95 yum.\nthe wiener schnitzel (breaded pork culets with cranberries and homemade <mark>Bavarian Potato Salad</mark> ) $18:95 was huge and enough for two.\nalmost every table ordered the jumbo pretzel ( with cheese and two kinds of mustard) $12:95 pricy but so good and a great starter to share.\nall the beer is imported from german and served in huge beersteins.\nthe staff and servers all dress in old time german outfits that look cool.\ni've saved the best for last the ( paddle girls ).\nthe paddle girls are servers who bring you a shot that someone has sent you and after drinking it you bend over and get spanked.\nthis goes on all night with screams and cheers from the crowds of guest\nenjoying the fun.\nhofbrauhaus will be opening their first california restaurant in cupertino. it will open  this coming june in the valco mall .\ni can't wait !", 
            "the hofbrauhaus was exactly as it was described, an exact duplicate of the one in munich (or so i have been told). the service was great. the food was pretty good.  we went for lunch. i had the veal brats, <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark>, and spicy mustard. had we had more time in vegas i would have loved to have come back for dinner. the price was high but that's pretty standard for las vegas. i would recommend this place for large groups of people.", 
            "good food, good beer.\n\nthe liter beers are huge, about the size of my head.  you could kill someone w/ the mug, it was so heavy.\n\nwe ordered the <mark>Chicken Bratwurst</mark>, <mark>Majoram  Veal Bratwurst</mark>, weiners (kekeke -_-), and pork cutlet entrees along with two pretzel apeptizers - one was some garlic type tip, and the other was chicken liver.  i was surprised the chicken liver didnt taste bad, but i dont think i'd recommend it.  the pretzels were awesome though, with the other dips.  the <mark>Chicken Bratwurst</mark> seemed too dense and was really filling - it's like they packed a whole chicken into the two bratwursts.  the weiners were soo good, wish we had some buns to put them in (thats what she said).  but really, we all thought they'd be amazing with buns and ketchup.  the pork cutlet was huge, took up the entire plate and was also really good with the spicy mustard.  all the entrees came w/ a side, like <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  i had the liter hef to drink (it was great), and i was surprised i left standing (lightweight, i know o_o).  all the entrees are large portions, so you'll definitely leave feeling full.\n\nthe dining area was cool, felt kind of like a cafeteria.  we came around 2pm so there weren't that many people there, but i bet it would be so fun eating and drinking there when its packed, with live music going on.\n\nnext time i come i want to try some of their fish specials, but being my first time there, it just didn't sound right not getting bratwurst.\n\nthe service was great, really attentive and gave us recommendations on what people liked.  the manager also said it was cool for us to leave the car parked in their private lot and walk across the street to the hard rock too.\n\ni'll be back.", 
            "drinking actual hofbr\\u00e4u oktoberfestbier imported from munich in a 1 liter mug accompanied by traditional bavarian food and music -- now that is the way to have lunch!    \n\nthe beer was really good.  it was obviously pure and smooth (german laws demand as much), but it also possessed a nice flavor that paired wonderfully with the food.  \n\ni started off with the <mark>Creamy Bavarian Potato Soup</mark>.  rich and creamy, i was impressed with the natural flavors that commingled so nicely in the soup.  carrots added sweetness, fresh chives added soul, and the addition of sausage and croutons made it heartier but not overly so.  great beginning.  \n\nfor the main course i had the wurstplatte which was a plate of 4 sausages served over <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark>  and sauerkraut with a side of spicy mustard.  the sauerkraut was served with caraway seeds (bavarian style) and was very nicely done, full of flavor and not particularly sour.  the vienna sausages were good, the pork sausage was incredible, and the chicken sausage was just okay.  this dish was noticeably heavy towards the end, but the lighter beer helped considerably.  nonetheless, i really enjoyed this selection.  the side of pretzel was fresh and tasty as well.  the mustard really made it come alive.\n\nservice was very attentive, and the girl was so pleasant and friendly.  the ambience was great.  large, open, really cavernous space with picnic table seating and music pouring through the space.  they really captured the beer hall atmosphere of germany here.  \n\ni understand trying to copy the real hofbrauhaus could be a disastrous undertaking.  400 years of tradition shouldn't be reduced to a marketing gimmick, but i think they did a nice job in the reproduction without sacrificing too much in the way of tradition.  in a world where gastropubs are coming into their own and are even being rewarded michelin stars, i think places like the hofbrauhaus will always prove to be a smarter alternative.  highly recommend this side of munich.", 
            "having been fortunate enough to have eaten at the original in munich, i was super fucking excited to try this u.s. version of it. \nwe were seated promptly in their dinning/beer hall that looks pretty close to the original, just a bit smaller. \nhearing the live german band playing traditional drinking songs inspired us all to order the liters of their original beer. i was super glad to read that they follow the german beer laws in this joint too. \nin germany it is against the law to add preservatives or sugar to the beer, which means you can drink all the liters you want and feel great the next morning. \n\ni was a bit disappointed that they were not serving the pork knuckle ( pork shoulder on the bone) because i had a hard on for the dish in munich. yet, the fact that they do serve it on other nights made me feel ok with it. obviously i have to come back on my next visit to this crazy city. \nafter going over the mouthwatering menu a couple times, my eyes locked in on the schnitzel (spelling?). a fried slab of pork smothered in a fucking awesome brown gravey, <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark> and some veggies. just enough to fill you up but not to the point of vomiting. \nafter a few more liters it was time to head back to the strip. \nno doubt in my mind i will be back on my next trip for that pork knuckle, and the shirt i was to drunk to remember to buy!", 
            "if you want to get head while you are in vegas then this is the place for you! now get your head out of the gutter...i mean beer foam, you will get lots of it here. \n\ni know this is vegas and drinks are usually not cheap. but this place was very expensive! which is the main reason why i really wanted to give this place 2 stars. but...this place had great qualities that bumped it to 3 stars instead. \n\nfirst great quality was our waitress. she was very friendly and attentive. the food was also very tasty..and the portions are pretty big. the main drawback were the prices though. \n\nwe had to share the meals because we knew we weren't going to be able to drink and eat without going broke. we got the hofbrauhaus plate, which consisted of smoked pork loin, pork roast, smoked sausage with dark beer sauce, side of sauerkraut and <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark>. \n\nthe smoked pork loin was my favorite. i loved how tender and delicious it was when you took a bite of it and combine it with the sauerkraut and potatoes. yummers! \n\nthe grillhendl was also ordered. which is an oktoberfest style roasted half chicken stuffed with parsley, beer butter and onions served crispy brown with homemade <mark>Bavarian Potato Salad</mark>. the chicken was really good! i mean really good people...order this! the chicken was moist and very well seasoned. i wish they would change the <mark>Bavarian Potato Salad</mark> to <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark> instead because they would go better with the chicken. but i really liked this plate...would have been nice to have enjoyed it on my own instead of sharing it :( \n\nthe atmosphere of the place was fun. the bad is very entertaining and of course the people getting spanked is a riot. \n\nso in my future visits to vegas i'm going to have to go gamble, hopefully be lucky and make some money then hit hofbrauhaus cause it's expensive.", 
            "what a beer hall! ive been here a few times and everyone who comes along always has an amazing time. the beers are huge and light's not an option so if you're going to order a beer be prepared to drink.\nit sounds like lately the entertainment has mostly been a one-man band but i've seen a full band play here in the past. all the gals are wearing german bar maid outfits (which become a bit more revealing in the later hours in the evening versus coming in for lunch) which is definitely a sight to see and they'll give ya a shot of whatever liquor is available if you'll let one of them paddle your arse.\n\ndecided to go with the bavarian equivalent to bangers and mash (sausage, <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark>, and sauerkraut rather than peas) which was delicious and considering how filling the beer was, just the right amount for me.\n\nif you've got about $25/head and are debating whether to stop in, go. you'll have a great time.\nthey also have a private photographer offering photos for $15 and $20. if you have a digital camera, their frame isn't worth the $15, but if not, go for it.", 
            "so much fun!  so much to do and look @ and participate in.  so much.... so much!!!!  hubby thought i should branch out and try something new.  we just weren't down for a buuf fat!  so we did.  we went to the house.  boy - am i glad that we did.  it was such a treat.  we really enjoyed every bit.  the live band.  the spankings.  oh yes - you read that right.  the spankings.  old men, young men, women and children.  waitresses come around with their paddle and a shot.  i'm guessing shots are optional for the wee ones.  it's as heavy as a buuf fat though.  man.  i ordered a chicken sandwich and hubby got sausages and <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  very large portions.  the appetizer pretzel we got was huge!  but oh so good.  we stood on tables and drank german beer.  it was such a good time.  we had a blast with just the two of us.  i can imagine the fun to be had by a large group.  grab a good mood and run by this place for a great mood!!!", 
            "forget about oktoberfest, it's all about spankfest. i have never been spanked so hard before! if you see a german girl with a paddle, you better run for your lives. \n\ni was here for my friend's bachelor party and we had a blast. the hofbrauhaus reminds so much of my time in munich. you have people standing up on the benches swaying, chugging and singing german songs.  the music is arguably as much a part of the festival as the liquid gold itself.  the place is filled with happy, merry and drunken people. \n\nsince we had a big party, we made reservation and were seated right away. the food was very authentic. i decide to go with the hofbr\\u00e4uhaus wurstplatte, which came with 3 different types of sausages (vienna style frankfuters, pork and chicken) with sauerkraut and <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark>. the sausages were delicious but i was left still hungry. i was able to fill my hunger with the 1 l of hef beer. it pretty much hit the spot!\n\nthe service was excellent!  our waitresses, dressed in traditional bavarian clothing, carried ten 1-liter beer steins in their hands. it's astounding how they can handle the weight. \n\ni came in sober and left tipsy and violated. what a night at the hofbrauhaus!!!", 
            "end of september is the start of oktoberfest and it is only right to stop by las vegas' most popular bavarian eatery. the large communal dining area are filled with tables and benches. unless you come with a large party, there is a chance that you will sit next to random strangers. this style of dining has seriously caught my interest as of late because i am always interested in other patrons thought on menu items. \n\nthe waitresses are all dressed up in country style outfits. looking around, they reminded me of a more natural attractive look than places on the strip. our waitress was pushy in a playful way and quick to guide us to some of their most popular dishes. \n\nthe beers and food are on the pricey side. they highly rely on their touristy appeal. with the prices comes a relatively large portion as well. we started with two half liters of the oktoberfest beer and their signature soft pretzel with a <mark>Bavarian Sweet Mustard</mark>, spicy mustard, and a cheese spread made from cream cheese and brie. this was magnificent. at first, i was hesitant because the size of our neighbors pretzel was huge. i did not want to load up on unnecessary carbs, but once it hit our table, it stood no chance. \n\nonce the doughy treat was devoured, we ordered the three pork sausages served with sauerkraut and <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark>. the warm pickled cabbage was good, but the mash had very little flavor besides cream. the pork sausages were mild and tender. \n\ni am normally not a fan of this cuisine because it is on the heavy side. splitting an appetizer and an entree was enough for two of us. there was no real big complaints about the experience, but it was just ok.", 
            "is there better pre-going-out food than sausage, spaetzle, <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark> and sweet cabbage?  the answer, young padawan...is no. no, there is not.\n\ni visited hblv post-ghost bar day club and pre-heading out for the night. best decision of our trip.  definitely recommend the <mark>Majoram  Veal Bratwurst</mark> and cabbage plate (majoram plate).  beer was tasty, cold, and large and we were able to purchase a paddling along with a shot for the gentlemen in our group, which was definitely entertaining.  \n\nfun, unpretentious atmosphere and super tasty eats.  ideal if you're staying at the hard rock, as it's right across the street.", 
            "the \"hof\" ( we are going to call it that because hofbrauhaus is way to hard to say and spell) is located in las vegas, nevada across from the hard rock hotel and casino off from harmon avenue. its a german ale house with a great bavarian menu.  the hof has family style seating which basically means bring your family or if you don't have a family to bring, prepare to be introduced to a replacement family for your meal. as luck would have it, simone and i went for lunch around 2:00pm and the place was almost empty so we didn't have to worry about being social with the sin city natives. after much analyzing of the menu we decided to start with the \"obatzer\" appetizer. lucky for my waitress she didn't have to worry about my total butchering of the german language as there were numbers that went along with each menu item for ease of translation. the \"obtazer\" is a hand made warm german pretzel served with a brie cheese and buttered onion dip. the dip was rich and creamy and totally went with the pretzel. there was dip left over after the pretzel was gone so the wife and i very elegantly stuck the rest on top of our knives and proceeded to stick it down our throats. although the choking seemed to be distracting to the other guests we definitely enjoyed our appetizer down to the last knife full.\nfor the entrees simone ordered the \"allgaur kasespatzle\". it was a german style mac and cheese made with mini german spaetzle <mark>Dumpling</mark>, swiss, brie, and again, those luscious buttered onions. it was creamy and rich with just the right amount of onion flavor. although simone could not finish it, due to the earlier appetizer gluttony, i gladly helped her out. for my own entree i choose the \"nurnberger rostbratwurst\". the dish consisted of 3 grilled bratwurst resting on a bed of fresh sauerkraut and <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark> with a beer gravy. the flavors went together perfectly and complimented each other well. the potatoes were creamy with a hint of garlic , the brats were seasoned perfectly, and the sauerkraut was just sour enough but didn't overpower the dish. i completely cleaned the plate and also finished off my side of fluffy spaetzle drizzled in butter and parsley.  my only regret about this meal is i had no more room in the stomach for german beer or dessert. i will definitely try some when i come back during my next vegas visit. this was excellent food in a great and fun setting off from the vegas strip.", 
            "always a lot of fun!  beer and sausage!  friendly staff.  usually there's a band or a guy playing music.  today i had sausage and <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark> and won a beer chugging contest!  won a free stein and a nice buzz!", 
            "this place was sooooo much fun.  it was the best fun i had in vegas the 5 days i was there.  i don't go to  \"adult\" clubs or those sorts of places.\nthe service here was outstanding -jennifer.\nit was so loud in there, i am amazed they can hear us and have anything left in their voices.\nthe food (i had a steak) was perfectly cooked and served with delicious <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  it was fast.\nand yes, i had the jaegermeister shot and took the punishment - jennifer again.  owee!\nit was a great atmosphere with all the people dancing and singing, and the band was awesome!\ni cannot wait to get back to vegas to go to this place again.", 
            "this place is like chuck e. cheese for adults.  adults who like to drink beer (and eat food that doesn't taste like cardboard).\n\nhofbrauhaus is unabashedly fun.  it's full of busty serving gals who deliver ales (and paddlings - we went for a friend's birthday party, and the gal literally handed his backside to him) with enthusiasm.  oompah bands round out the music scene.  and you love lederhosen, it'll be like you died and went to heaven.\n\nthe place is designed for good times.  they encourage you to stand on tables.  they want you to have fun.  they prefer you to be loud in your proclaimed enjoyment of beer.  the mood is pretty light and enjoyable.\n\nthe food is pretty excellent and decent portions.  there were a lot of things that looked tempting, but i tried the chicken sausages with a generous helping of tasty <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  prices ran about $15-20 a plate.  the beer steins are huge, and i had even gotten a \"medium\" that led to a comfortable buzz.  if i can finagle a way to come here without driving, i want one of the ridiculous sized ones.\n\nthere is a ton of audience participation.  they really want to get the crowd involved whether up on stage, or if they come to you in the crowd.  it wasn't one of those awkward vibes where they will force unwilling restaurant patrons to get involved, but if you want to participate, they most definitely will accommodate.\n\nthe only issue that i had during my outing was during the cash handling at the end.  we had a big birthday group, and those things always become hectic with a lot of separate checks.  the problem was that due to a miscommunication, the status of whether someone within our party already covered all our expenses versus if we still needed to pay became a back and forth \"yes/no/yes/no\" issue that while resolved, i wasn't sure if it was until credit card statements were checked.  but to her credit, our server was very patient and was trying very hard to get everything sorted out amongst the beer chants and drinking contests.  i think in a smaller group, that won't be an issue.\n\ni will check out hofbrauhaus again.  between the lively atmosphere, friendly staff, tasty food and copious amounts of beer, it's a hard place to be bummed out in.  just keep your party under 40 people, and it should be fine for an unique dining experience.", 
            "i can't even tell you or pronounce what i had eaten. all i know is that it was really good. i had what looked like three long sausage links with sauerkraut (see picture) and <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark>. and don't forget...the german beer! \n\nmy friends and i had arrived here late in the afternoon, which is why the craziness wasn't happening. i've been to the real hobrauhaus in munchen; i would love to one day go back for oktoberfest. for now, las vegas will suffice and i hope to come back the next time i am in vegas.", 
            "to be perfectly honest- i thought this was a horrible representation of the german branded beer destination in munich. i know it's two different countries, but the feeling was just- eh. if you're going to slap the name hofbrauhaus on a venue to lure people in, at least give a similar experience- especially since you're charging a lot for it. i'm actually surprised that this restaurant got as high of ratings as it did. maybe i should have started drinking before coming?\n\nthe location in munich was a warm and friendly atmosphere while the las vegas felt like an afterthought. we ordered two dinners, a beer, an <mark>Iced Tea</mark> and dessert and it came out to a little over $80. wowza. i kinda felt ripped off. there are a ton of great german places in orange county/la that charge significantly less and have a way better vibe. jaime p and i actually joked that there were more servers than customers, yet everyone had to try and flag someone down for attention.\n\ni ordered the n\\u00fcrnberger rostbratwurst which was three pork sausages, sauerkraut and <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark> and the meal was washed down with a mug of the hofbr\\u00e4u maibock. the sausages and sauerkraut were cooked okay, but lacked any real flavor. same went for the <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark>. the beer was good, you can't go wrong with that. i should have ordered more of those and it would have probably still been cheaper in the long run. at least i would have been drunk and satisfied.\n\nwent the extra mile to fill the void in my stomach and ordered the apfelstrudel that came out warm with a side of ice cream. i can't say anything bad about the dish. between this and the beer, it was the only reason i chose to give this place two stars.\n\nthere was a one man band singing some german tunes. he did his best with the crowd in the beer hall to keep them entertained. i think there were seven total in this massive space, but he did what he could to get the audience excited with beer drinking games and off the wall jokes. it was funny because when i called for hours, i was told i should make reservations because it's on a first<mark>Friday - Beer Battered Ocean Cod</mark> basis. maybe the other 500-people or so were on their way?\n\nthis could have just been an off day- unfortunately, i'll never know an on day because i wont be coming back.", 
            "it looks just like the hofbrau haus in munich. i think the only germans in the place were in the band! service was good. music was good. beer was good. the food was another matter. my wife's jager schnitzel was so tough you could barely cut it with a knife. the sauerkraut with my wurst plate was bland and over cooked. the <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark> tasted like they were made from a mix. we definitely had better german food.", 
            "while having a stay-cation, my boyfriend and i walked around the area.  he had never been to hard rock so we walked over from the strip.  i have always wanted to go to the hofbrauhaus and so when we were over we had to stop in.\n\nwe sat down at the bar they have outside the restaurant and he got the hefeweizen and i just got their lager.  i loved the baby mug (10oz or .3l) that i got.  i have to go back one day after work and buy like 2 of them.  i have issues with these baby mugs!  the lager was good and light but i taste the hefeweizen and about had a heart attack!  it was the best hefeweizen i have ever tasted.  my boyfriend was going over the food and was drooling.  he hasn't had german food since he was there so we made reservations to come back that night.\n\nwe came back at 7pm and were seated right away.  ordered each of us a liter of hefeweizen and pretzel and brie cheese app.  omg the brie cheese concoction, delicious!!!  i just wanted to eat it alone it was sooooo good.  we shared the 3 different sausage plate which came with sauerkraut and <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  we also ordered <mark>Bavarian Potato Salad</mark>.  german <mark>Bavarian Potato Salad</mark> is different, more vinegar, but still yummy.  the sausage was good too, one was my favorite but don't remember what was in it.  the food came out fast and the waitress are friendly even with crazy drunks around.  while we were eating they had a band playing traditional german music and also some american.\n\nthey had girls going around spanking people, had a beer holding contest (1 liter, not easy) and just a great time.  we have plans to go back again!!!  i need some hefeweizen!!!", 
            "this place was a must-stop on our vegas trip as my husband lived in germany and we are both addicted to wurst. we knew exactly what to get (having eaten the authentic versions) and ordered the nuernberger wurst and the muenchner (munich) weisswurst and we were pretty pleased with the results. i would say the nuernburger was better, and was served with more filling and delicious side dishes (sauerkraut and <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark>) that both tasted pretty authentic. although the weisswurst came with the <mark>Bavarian Sweet Mustard</mark> (to die for) the only other thing on the plate was some garnish and a pretzel. \n\nanother person at the table got the frankfurter sausage and, quite honestly, it looked just like a hot dog. go with the nuernberger or the muenchner if you are going to get sausage. \n\nmy only complaint was the noise level. once we walked through the doors into the restaurant area, we were immediately blasted with 100 drunk people yelling. how this place is listed as good for children, i have no idea. bad idea. too loud, too many drunk people, a lot of spanking and cleavage everywhere you look.", 
            "i really enjoyed the jovial atmosphere here and the food is solid. i had the sausage served with <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark> and sauerkraut. some of the sausages were great but others were just ok. the sauerkraut though was just beautiful. i'd call it new sauerkraut because it was less fermented than normal which made it very pleasant to eat on its own. i think the food is reasonably priced, expect $20 an entree, given the added cost of the semi elaborate accompanying atmosphere.\n\nnow while the atmosphere was fun, i'd prefer if the live music matched the theme of the restaurant a bit more. hearing songs like the u.s. national anthem and other u.s. classics was kind of odd in a place this strongly german themed. the beers were great, and the waitresses gave out incredibly entertaining paddle spankings with the purchase of a shot. it's fun! -- but it could be better.", 
            "for some good german food and a good spanking, go to hofbrauhaus.  great beer, great food, great service, and great atmosphere! overall amazing place to go.  you are seated at long tables along side other groups of people and if you order a shot, or say it is your first time there, they spank you with a paddle.  that sound then ripples throughout the hall and you can feel the sting that the victim receives across their butt. ha.  this place is awesome. i always get the n\\u00fcrnberger rostbratw\\u00fcrstl which is basically three pork sausages with a bed of sauerkraut and <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  and they have excellent dunkel weiss!! get the boot!", 
            "loved it! great sausage appetizers. good drinks. the steak came with a crazy gravy with unreal <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark> - thought i was going to pop i was so full. quality food. rowdy atmosphere so be prepared. went with a group of 50 do it took 2 hours to get served but we were all drunk by then and the staff is liberal with giving the paddle to eager participants. good experience overall. if u want fine dining this is not for you.", 
            "great place to go if you feel like some bratwursts, beer and some loud music while having some good time. i got the plate with 4 different sausages and my wife got the wiener schnitzel with <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark> and sauerkraut, of course. half a littler of heffewiesen went down pretty easy after all that food! it was early and kind of empty and the live music was loud, something that i would probably enjoy later in <mark>Soup of the Day</mark> and after some more beers. good for a break from the strip if you have the time or exhausted your options there.", 
            "we came out here for a friend's birthday on friday night.\n\nbeing an avid yelper, i decided to read up on some reviews. \nafter reading the reviews, i was a little nervous about going, to be honest.  i was really worried that  i wouldn't like any of the food...especially after reading the menu...i'm not really big on pork products, and there is a lot of pork on the menu. lol\n\nso...we got there, and walked in, and were seated...\nwhat a huge hall!  \nat first, i was uncomfortable...it felt like it was a million and a half degrees in that place.  oddly enough, the more i ate and drank, the better i felt. ;)\n\nthe atmosphere here is definitely one of carefree partying.  \nits loud.  there is lots of singing, music, shouting, chanting, and spanking.\ni had a blast.\n\ni personally did not have any shots...something about being spanked by a stranger with a paddle is not super appealing to me.  maybe in the bedroom with someone i know, but not in public...those ladies looked pretty strong too. :)\n\nnow onto what was ordered:\n\nbeer:\ni ordered the hefeweizen, which was awesome.  the half liter was $8...it lasted me the whole time we were there, so it was a good value, but...i'm a slow beer drinker.  the other beers were really good too.  (i tasted everyone's.)\n\nfood:\ni ordered:\na pretzel:  pretty good.  salty, but not overly so.  \nthe potato pancakes with smoked salmon:  this was delicious.  i'm a sucker for potato pancakes, but there were divine.  the salmon was delicious, and the presentation was great.  (i'll upload a picture as soon as i can.)\ngerman <mark>Creamy Bavarian Potato Soup</mark>:  this was delicious!  my favorite of the night. :)\nthe majoram/ (veal sausages):  since i'm not a big fan of pork products, i had intended on getting fish or chicken...but when i saw that there were veal sausages for the same price as the chicken...i opted for those.  they were tasty.  2 sausages served over <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark>, with a <mark>Red Cabbage</mark> sauerkraut.  (i wasn't a fan of the <mark>Red Cabbage</mark>.)\n\nall in all the quality of the food was good.  \nhowever...\nbetween myself and my roommate, we spent $85 on 3 beers, two entrees, and two small starters.  \ni could have eaten better food for half that cost elsewhere, but all in all, for a fun night out for a friend's birthday, it was a fun place to go.", 
            "loud, boisterous, and full of drunken fun!  that's the hofbrauhaus for ya (sorry guys, i'm not sure how to make the a with the umlauts, but that's what i intended fyi).  hofbrauhaus is the quintessential rowdy restaurant where you can get some tasty beers and good eats.  i always find myself here in a party-type situation; mostly of the birthday type.  honestly, the atmosphere fits and doesn't disappoint!\n\nthey have a live band playing both american and german folks songs while you get your drink or grub on and it keeps the lively atmosphere going.  as for the beer, they have 1/4, 1/2, and full liter mugs available depending on your thirst level.  imo the best time to come in and funnel some beer into your gullet is around oktoberfest.  their oktoberfest beer is awesome and highly recommended.  but, in the \"off-season\", the dunkel and hefe do just fine.\n\ni've only had a few dishes here but i usually gravitate toward the veggie options.  they have a few veggie items available including the veggie brautwurst that comes complete with sauerkraut and <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  i've also tried the chicken braut here and they're similar enough to go either or, really.  the side salad is a healthy sized plate as well so if you're looking for something a little smaller to snack on, the side is a good option.  also, before i forget, the soft pretzel here is really nice.  it's especially nice when it's fresh out and pieced off with a dab of the cheese or mustard sauce 'shmeared' on.. yummyyy.  pro tip: alternate sauces when going in on the pretzel... trust me, it's a good time.\n\ngood times, good beers, and pretty good food here at the hof!  i don't come here often but definitely lookin' toward oktoberfest for more seasonal german beer goodness.",

            "decent-enough german food, gigantic beer steins, live traditional music, and public humiliation. they seem to pride themselves on not being a tourist destination, but let's get real: very few people come here more than once for anything but the novelty.\n\nconsidering half of texas, where i'm from, was settled by germans, the food here did not live up to my expectations given the price point- but we have few restaurants turning out this cuisine here, so some inflation is to be expected.\n$60 dinner for two, splitting a plate, an app, and a beer? not really worth it, imo. quality was just not there for the majority of the items.\n\nkartoffelpuffer - two crisp and golden brown potato pancakes served with smoked salmon and traditional garnish; it's like going to a jewish deli for breakfast and being torn between the pancakes and the lox, and deciding to combine them. not bad, but pancakes aren't seasoned at all.  $15\n\nspecial plate <mark>Soup of the Day</mark>- pork loin served with two kinds of sausage, sauerkraut and <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark>, sided with gravy and mustard. sausages weren't bad, one was considerably better than the other. pork was unremarkable, as were the 'kraut and 'taters. $20\n\nthe beer. good lord, i have no idea which beer my guy opted for, but we got the 36oz stein and it was huge but we drank it all without problem because it was light, smooth, and delicious. complemented the sausages, as it's supposed to. hb prides itself on only importing beers that meet the traditional purity law, with simple, classic ingredients only. mad hops, i mean props, to their beer! $16\n\nthe reason i can't tell you which sausage was the best is because service is mostly nonexistent. i guess if your basic couple is likely to spend $100, and most people tip 20%, you don't have to do much to get halfway decent pay by default.\nour waitress took our order, kitchen staff brought it out and took it away, waitress brought our bill. the end. gave us a vague and rushed \"you good?\" as she walked by once, but otherwise did the bare minimum.\nthere was a featured dessert trio, but only one sounded appealing. disappointed that they are unable to accommodate an order for a single dessert without spending $15 on the bunch of them.", 
            "meh.  it's decent food, but nothing to write home about.  \n\ni had a plate of sausages with <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark> and sauerkraut, my wife had jagetschnitzle, and she definitely chose better than i did, but neither of us were all that impressed.  the servers were nice, but not all that quick to refill water (i realize this is not the sort of place one normally orders water, but i was already all liquored up and looking for something hearty to help soak up my liquid lunch). \n\nif i were, for some reason, to go back here i'd probably order my food from the bar next to the gift shop.  that way i could avoid the obnoxiously loud cafeteria-esque dining room and the utterly terrible live music.  and even if the food wasn't extraordinary it was at least decent and decently priced.  this might be a fun place to go with a big group, but not really what i was looking for.",

            "i always pass by this place on paradise on my way to the airport and now i can finally say i've stepped foot in this german beer hall. apparently this was a recreation of the original hofbr\\u00e4uhaus in munich. everyone comes for the beer, which is served in three different sizes, but let's be real - you want the one served in the giant one liter stein. of the beers to choose from, they have the classic bavarian lager, a darker lager, and a hefe weizen. \n\nthe menu consists of some traditional bavarian fare such as sausage, sauerkraut, potatoes, schnitzel, and the giant pretzel. i was quite disappointed by the \"freshly baked\" pretzel as it was very dry and tough. the cold \"obazter\" cheese dip didn't help matters. if you're a fan of sausage, try the hofbr\\u00e4uhaus wurstplatte for a combination of vienna style frankfurters, pork, and chicken sausages with sides of sauerkraut and <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark>. personally, i loved the j\\u00e4gerschnitzel. nothing says you're hungry like a big pork cutlet topped with mushrooms, bacon, and onions with a side of sp\\u00e4tzle. if you're still hungry for dessert, the apple strudel with vanilla ice cream was delicious. \n\nthere's live entertainment that comes on at night, which makes this place even more fun. but, you can always start your own entertainment at your very own table. this is the perfect place for a large group. if you find yourself in such a situation, be sure to order shots for that one naughty boy or girl. each shot comes on a paddle. after that unfortunate guy or gal downs the shot, the beer maid gives that person a thunderclap paddling that echoes throughout the hall (why do you think they built the ceilings to be so high?). i'm still sore just thinking about it. \n\ncome one, come all. you will enter sober and leave with a headache, no memory of what happened, and unsure why your left buttcheek hurts so much.",

            "we were eating here many times in the past few years. nothing extra ordinary about the food. very limited items on the lunch menu, little bit more on the dinner menu. variety of sausages ... unfortunately they are not made in their kitchen. my favorite item is from the dinner menu: the hunter's platter, varieties of meats and sausages, <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark> and <mark>Red Cabbage</mark>. they don't serve it at lunchtime! don't even try to ask! \ni ended up ordering a pretzel! over priced!\nmy friend ordered a sausage platter. asked to switch some of the sides, and the waitress said no. she didn't offer to order separate sides from the menu. she just said \"no substitution\". well, not liking what the original order was, we decided to ask for the check. paid for the drinks and the pretzel, and left!\nthe waitress didn't care less ... \nwell, i did care, because i always had excellent experience here, and i wanted to introduce this place to my friend, who was a first time guest here!\nalso i love their apple strudel, and i wanted to eat it!\ninstead of that we left with a bittersweet taste in the mouth! \nthe place has a great atmosphere, excellent entertainment (live bands most of the time) with authentic music. very loud, but very original!\nbeing a local, 24 years, i am very spoiled with good food and service! based on our last experience, i won't break my leg to hurry up to come back, especially with new friends!",

(all except 1 waiter. he was a total bitchy queen, but once i requested a new waiter, all was well. the place was so fun, i couldn't have anyone ruin it!) the place is loud and raucous, and fun! there is a band who plays german music, a jagermeister girl who spanks your behind pretty hard after you take a shot, and great food and beer. i had a smoked pork platter with amazing german <mark>Bavarian Potato Salad</mark>, sauerkraut and <mark>Red Cabbage</mark>. the place was great and we didn't want to leave. they also had delicious looking desserts that we had no room to sample. we were so full. everything was reasonably priced, and the environment was awesome. i would def make a point to return whenever i am in vegas.",

            "the skinny: texturally offensive cafeteria food that had probably sat in a chafing dish all day (1), low cut, faux-german, dairy maid costumes does not constitute service unless you are at a strip club (2), overall value can only be justified if you've had way too much to drink (1).\n\nhofbrauhaus is a disneyworld-esque german-styled building close to hard rock hotel. i wanted to try this place out for a while because of the charming facade outside.\n\nwe decided to head there to eat because it was in my head that it would be like a mini-trip to a sanitized germany without the pricetag. \n\nwhen we entered, the place has the tired ambience of a hangover  complete with the loud, cacophony of a bad german folk band. nobody was singing along with music, dancing or laughing... just downing a bunch of beer one after another.\n\nour waitress came by and took our orders dressed to... err... impress. she soon lost interest in our table however when we told her we weren't interested in alcohol. ordered a diet coke/pepsi which was not only flat but also tasted like there was some <mark>Root Beer</mark> mixed in there too.\n\ni ordered the sauerbraten which is supposed to be a roast pork dish with <mark>Dumpling</mark>, vegetables and red wine sauce with <mark>Red Cabbage</mark>. we were surprised at how quickly the food came out of the kitchen. after we tasted our food , we knew why.\n\nthe food obviously was sitting under a heat lamp for way too long. someone tried to disguise overly dry, salty pork with an overabundance of a lumpy, thick, red wine gravy. the <mark>Dumpling</mark> were large, gummy and unappetizing. vegetables were overcooked. the only thing that was okay on the dish was the stewed <mark>Red Cabbage</mark>.\n\nmy husband's schnitzel was dry and soggy. the gravy, it was swimming in, was bland. the <mark>Bavarian Potato Salad</mark> was unpleasant, sour and overly warm.\n\nthis place is not cheap - a typical entree can be around the $20 mark - yet they do not provide you any value for your dollar given the quality of the ambience, service and food.",

            "many tasty looking things on the menu. unfortunately items are seemingly randomly paired with \"fixed\" sides and substitutions are not allowed. for instance, if you don't like <mark>Bavarian Potato Salad</mark> you will be expected to have the <mark>Bavarian Potato Salad</mark> \"held\" from your plate and pay $4.99 for a different side. all sides are listed as $4.99, including the one you just had \"held\" from your plate, so why refuse to be accommodating to a customer who is already paying $19.99 for a lunch entree? this is especially difficult at a place where most of the sides are like it or leave it options like <mark>Red Cabbage</mark> and sauerkraut. i couldn't find two options that looked appetizing so i watched the rest of my party eat and sipped my water. my husband ordered the 306 and was underwhelmed. we ended up spending $7 for my daughter to eat a dry pretzel after they tacked on a $4 upcharge for cheese she couldn't stand. their radler is mixed with <mark>Sierra Mist</mark>, which is close to heresy. all of this from a girl who was born in germany and loved the food. this place is a tourist trap with good beer.", 
            "we came out here for a friend's birthday on friday night.\n\nbeing an avid yelper, i decided to read up on some reviews. \nafter reading the reviews, i was a little nervous about going, to be honest.  i was really worried that  i wouldn't like any of the food...especially after reading the menu...i'm not really big on pork products, and there is a lot of pork on the menu. lol\n\nso...we got there, and walked in, and were seated...\nwhat a huge hall!  \nat first, i was uncomfortable...it felt like it was a million and a half degrees in that place.  oddly enough, the more i ate and drank, the better i felt. ;)\n\nthe atmosphere here is definitely one of carefree partying.  \nits loud.  there is lots of singing, music, shouting, chanting, and spanking.\ni had a blast.\n\ni personally did not have any shots...something about being spanked by a stranger with a paddle is not super appealing to me.  maybe in the bedroom with someone i know, but not in public...those ladies looked pretty strong too. :)\n\nnow onto what was ordered:\n\nbeer:\ni ordered the hefeweizen, which was awesome.  the half liter was $8...it lasted me the whole time we were there, so it was a good value, but...i'm a slow beer drinker.  the other beers were really good too.  (i tasted everyone's.)\n\nfood:\ni ordered:\na pretzel:  pretty good.  salty, but not overly so.  \nthe potato pancakes with smoked salmon:  this was delicious.  i'm a sucker for potato pancakes, but there were divine.  the salmon was delicious, and the presentation was great.  (i'll upload a picture as soon as i can.)\ngerman <mark>Creamy Bavarian Potato Soup</mark>:  this was delicious!  my favorite of the night. :)\nthe majoram/ (veal sausages):  since i'm not a big fan of pork products, i had intended on getting fish or chicken...but when i saw that there were veal sausages for the same price as the chicken...i opted for those.  they were tasty.  2 sausages served over <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark>, with a <mark>Red Cabbage</mark> sauerkraut.  (i wasn't a fan of the <mark>Red Cabbage</mark>.)\n\nall in all the quality of the food was good.  \nhowever...\nbetween myself and my roommate, we spent $85 on 3 beers, two entrees, and two small starters.  \ni could have eaten better food for half that cost elsewhere, but all in all, for a fun night out for a friend's birthday, it was a fun place to go.", 
            "it's been a while since i've been to a hofbrauhaus. the last time i went was in miami, which i fell in love with. the las vegas location is a lot bigger and not as quaint as miami, i like the more nostalgic era. \n\nour visit to the las vegas was nice, we came in as walk in and was seated right away. i really wanted to have the pork knuckles, but it was a specialty item that they only serve when it was ordered. i was devastated! but i quickly recovered trying to pick the very next best thing.... \n\nthe <mark>Creamy Bavarian Potato Soup</mark>- like a loaded baked <mark>Creamy Bavarian Potato Soup</mark> minus bacon, but adding their smoked sausage. it was topped off with croutons and chives. \n\nsauerbraten- bavarian style potroast w/red wine. it was good, not as tender as i thought it would be, sauce was dark a bit on salty side which went well with the roast and spatzle. yes spatzle! they look like gnocci pieces, but its noodles! love them. \n\n<mark>Red Cabbage</mark>- wasnt a fan, i tried it, tasted like caramelized overly sweet and vinegar <mark>Red Cabbage</mark>. i guess this is the bavarian version of our american cranberry to turkey dinner. \n\nthrough our meal, there was a band playing and shouting out and drinking! it was classic! love it!  \n\nyes and the dessert! i had to get apfelstrudel! apple strudel! it was great! had to wait for my chantilly cream which made me think about the movie inglorious bastard with hans landa and the cream for apple strudel.... reminiscing... it was great, wished the pork knuckle was available for us, that was the only reason i would go back for..\n\nthanks and good vibes!", 
            "wow, tough to give it four stars, but i am going to do that. i will explain why. beer should never be $16 for a draught beer. sure it is one liter in size, but really who came up with that price? you almost feel obligated to spend it because the smaller beers are $9 so you might as well splurge and get the full bavarian experience.\n\nso why 4 stars? the food. let me tell you after spending five years in germany and knowing what bavarian food should taste like, it is spot on. really rich and authentic. i had the cheese plate appetizer which had american cheese on it, but don't let that bother you, it was done well and you get the same plate in bavaria anyway. \n\nthe bratenteller is a mixture of pork and beef with <mark>Red Cabbage</mark> and spatzle. authentic in every way and so good every bite was made with some sort of noise like umm, yumm, mmm, etc. \n\nentertainment is good but in my opinion it should be louder. \n\nyou will be seated with total strangers unless you indicate your comfort is not there, but sitting with strangers is the bavarian way and i met some of the most fantastic people including a family from ireland. \n\nso money aside, bring a hundred so you can get just a little of everything and at least 2 beers to get the full effect. this is a great place to celebrate someone's birthday or anniversary or whatever. just make sure you tell your waiter and they may do something special for you.", 
            "yes, it's incredibly loud. and yes, the entertainment can be hokey. and yes, it's overpriced. but everyone should experience the hofbrauhaus at least once! the menu is everything german( <mark>Red Cabbage</mark>, german <mark>Bavarian Potato Salad</mark>, spatzle, and, of course, beer), but the standouts are the sausages, the huge wienerschnitzel, and the bavarian pretzels with a delicious <mark>Bavarian Sweet Mustard</mark>. for dessert, there's apple strudel and black forest cake. go with friends, but don't expect to carry on a conversation! just enjoy the ambiance!", 
            "mediocre german food.\noverpriced.\ninfexible with the menu sides.\n\nthe hofbrau house tries to recreate a big beer hall atmosphere, so if you just want to get plastered like it's oktoberfest and don't really care about the food, then it's probably great. however, if you want good german food, look elsewhere. almost every non sandwhich type meal is $19.99 which is a high for the smallish portion sizes, and the first german restaurant that we have been to where you absolutely cannot swap a small side item to suit your tastes. my girlfriend got some bratwurst, and found the only mustard option was some generic guldens, no german mustards; she also isn't a fan of saurkraut but couldn't substitute for <mark>Red Cabbage</mark>. if the meals were half the price, then i'd understand their inflexible, tight-fisted policy, but we've had much better german food with much better service for less money way too many times to find this place worth ever going back to.", 
            "food was ok. but why does everything come with sauerkraut? germans actually eat very little of that. ordered a side dish of blaukraut (<mark>Red Cabbage</mark>), it was awful. can buy better stuff in a jar. beer is good but a bit pricey at 7 $ for 0.5 l. what's up with the spanking that comes with a shot of booze? never saw that before and i've been around the block a few times. very noisy, not a good place for a conversation. definitely a tourist trap. but it's las vegas, what do you expect.", 
            "do not expect authentic german food there. <mark>Red Cabbage</mark> could be better, i can make better <mark>Bavarian Potato Salad</mark> myself and bratwurst should not be served with <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark> (where did they ever get that idea?). $3 for a soft pretzel. really??  very noisy, poor acoustics. typical las vegas tourist trap. i'll give them 2 stars for the good beer and the friendly staff.", 
            "took my 94 y/o aunt to celebrate her birthday and regretted my decision.  weiner schnitzel was huge...could feed 2-3 people - and both of us ordered it.  came with <mark>Bavarian Potato Salad</mark>, which neither of us enjoyed, and small cup of applesauce, which both of us enjoyed.  extra to order <mark>Red Cabbage</mark> and potato pancakes which were ok.  i asked for a slice of german rye which cost me $1.69.  total cost was about $70 for lunch w/o alcoholic beverages.  waitress was as bland as the food.  she could have suggested that we share the weiner schnitzel because of the large size.  won't go there again.", 
            "we were eating here many times in the past few years. nothing extra ordinary about the food. very limited items on the lunch menu, little bit more on the dinner menu. variety of sausages ... unfortunately they are not made in their kitchen. my favorite item is from the dinner menu: the hunter's platter, varieties of meats and sausages, <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark> and <mark>Red Cabbage</mark>. they don't serve it at lunchtime! don't even try to ask! \ni ended up ordering a pretzel! over priced!\nmy friend ordered a sausage platter. asked to switch some of the sides, and the waitress said no. she didn't offer to order separate sides from the menu. she just said \"no substitution\". well, not liking what the original order was, we decided to ask for the check. paid for the drinks and the pretzel, and left!\nthe waitress didn't care less ... \nwell, i did care, because i always had excellent experience here, and i wanted to introduce this place to my friend, who was a first time guest here!\nalso i love their apple strudel, and i wanted to eat it!\ninstead of that we left with a bittersweet taste in the mouth! \nthe place has a great atmosphere, excellent entertainment (live bands most of the time) with authentic music. very loud, but very original!\nbeing a local, 24 years, i am very spoiled with good food and service! based on our last experience, i won't break my leg to hurry up to come back, especially with new friends!"

( i know, it doesn't sound right) it wasn't bad really but it wasn't good either, i wasn't impressed by it, i mean there was the \"wow\" factor but nothing to do with flavor...... so i ordered another shot of j\\u00e4ger. (better sausages at las vegas grille and also less intimidating)\npreviously i had ordered the <mark>Obazter Classic Bavarian Appetizer</mark>, obazda, now this is worth ordering again, it was really good. brie prepared with cream cheese, butter, onions, served with a freshly <mark>Fresh Baked Pretzel</mark>...... and a shot of j\\u00e4ger.\nthe beers are good of course, who doesn't like german beer? but they are a little bit pricey so we only had one 1 litter oktoberfest beer each. wow, when the waitress came back and sat the two beers on the table my friend and i looked at them and we were impressed of how huge they were! wow! there's something worth coming back for!

            "i had my hopes up for this place. walking in it seemed like a fun atmosphere, but quickly it felt like more of a tourist attraction. from the start our server was trying to get us to buy raffle tickets. it didn't stop there. when she would check on us, she was saying things like \"if you like the taste of that, we sell it in our gift shop\" and at the end of the meal even asked if she could walk with us to the gift shop (we told her that we didn't want to go earlier and thanked her for the info) to pick somethings out so she could meet her goal since she was in the lead for some sort of competition with the other employees for work. to put people on the spot so many times is rude. ask once and if the customer is interested they will tell you! \n\nwhat encouraged us to come here was because i have family here in town that is hosting an exchange student from germany and i thought she would not only like this place, but maybe feel a bit of home. we sat at nice long table that is shared with the other customers. i don't personally like that, but that's the theme here so it was fine. there was live music being played which was cool. \n\npriced at $19.99 we started out with the \"sausage tower\" at the suggestion of our server. she said it was a \"hidden\" menu item since it isn't on the menu and it would give us a good taste of the different sausages they have. sounded good to me! when it arrived, it looked like a tower of heaven. there were 3 dishes. 1 dish had <mark>Chicken Bratwurst</mark>, pork sausage and <mark>Majoram  Veal Bratwurst</mark> on a bed of sauerkraut. the 2nd dish had krainer, grilled weisswurst and a frankfurter with <mark>Bavarian Potato Salad</mark>. the 3rd dish had 2 <mark>Fresh Baked Pretzel</mark> with 2 types of dipping sauces. of all the sausages i only really liked the taste of a couple of them, so it was nice to be able to sample it all instead of just ordering a certain sausage dish that i might have had a type of sausage in it that i wasn't to find of. the pretzels were pretty good and the mustard sauces had good flavor. for my meal i had priced at $4.95 a \"house salad\" and priced at $14.95 the \"grillhendl\" which is a chicken dish. the salad was average, but the chicken dish was above average. the chicken was roasted and stuffed with parsley, beer butter and onions. the chicken was crispy and had a good flavor. it also came with a side of <mark>Bavarian Potato Salad</mark> that was decent. \n\ni certainly didn't leave hungry! i didn't leave feeling like i would come back though either. the vibe inside just screamed \"gimmick\" and \"tourist attraction here\" which our guest from germany agreed. the server was just too pushy about trying to get us to buy different things. my husbands meal was a joke especially for the price, so i lucked out with the chicken dish i ordered. i'm glad i experienced hofbr\\u00e4uhaus at least once.",

            "this review is long overdue....\n\nwhile enroute to las vegas on a red eye flight, i was reading an in-flight magazine, when i noticed an ad for this restaurant.  the advertisement called them the first and only authentic german beer hall and restaurant to call las vegas, nv home.  not only that...they're a replica of munich's famed hofbr\\u00e4uhaus but in an enclosed building.  there was also an ad that offered a free mug (per customer) of their oktoberfest beer just for stopping in.  we were excited because we have never been to munich.\n\nanyway, we arrived at the restaurant at lunchtime and there was a line of people waiting to get in.  the building is quite large and has high ceilings that makes you feel like you're under a huge tent with painted indoor gardens.  you could almost hear people's conversation echo about.  we were seated at a large community table as an attentive and friendly server came by.  \n\nwe thought about ordering only a snack to take advantage of the free beer advertisement.   our order consisted of 2 pretzels and 2 small (free) mugs of their oktoberfest beer.  the beer was cold, crisp and clean tasting.  we were told that the beer is imported from the same batches as what is made and served at the hofbr\\u00e4u tents.  we considered upgrading to a 1l stein but we knew that we had dinner reservations set for later that evening.\n\n- jumbo pretzel which was huge and served warm. there were two types of mustards and an obazter (obatzda?) cheese.  we were familiar with the mustards but the cheese spread/dip was deliciously different.  apparently, it is a bavarian cheese delicacy...a mixture of soft cheeses and butter.\n\n- jumbo pretzel with <mark>Bavarian Liver Mousse and Obazter (Cheese Specialty)</mark> (obatzda) cheese.  the liver mousse was light and flavorful. i know, some of you might be saying \"ewww\" but, it was really good.  i wished that there was a larger portion but, it would've been overkill.\n\nwe enjoyed both <mark>Fresh Baked Pretzel</mark> as they were served warm, soft and a bit chewy.  the pretzels and beers were perfect together and we were satiated.  \n\nbut, then....i looked at their dinner menu and spied \"schweinshaxe\" aka roasted pork shank with crispy skin!  omg...i started planning our return because they serve this specialty after 4pm.  alas, our stay in lv was only for a couple <mark>Soup of the Day</mark> and as they say, \"our dance card was filled\".  so, just to keep my tastebuds focused, i borrowed the picture of that pork shank.  i will return.....  maybe the oompah band will be playing.\n\n#495"

(i cannot.)  check to see if they have any seasonal specials because it's worth ordering those instead.  (and be sure to read that newspaper they leave for you when you get the menu, sometimes the specials are listed there instead.)\n\nhofbrauhaus is the kind of place you go with friends - the more, the merrier.  it gets loud and crazy and the service is good.  waitresses and servers are busy, keeping your beverages full and your bellies happy.

            "here is a good place to get a pg-13 version of two vegas staples--alcohol and breasts.  just don't come here expecting traditional bavarian culture.\n\nwhile it's a hell of a great time, this hofbrauhaus is not authentic.  i don't know how much they're trying to be, but they're not, and that's okay.  i have been to the real thing in munich several times, and i assure you that the similarities are skin-deep (and even in munich the hbh is the most commercialized of all the traditional beer halls).  this place looks beautiful, the beer is just as great (lager, dunkel, or hefeweizen--all are excellent), and of course the waitresses boast dirndls and bountiful cleavage.  \n\nin munich, they do a brisk tourist business but there is a healthy local presence:  one room has a large rack covering one entire wall, like a wine cage, where the regulars store their personal steins.  in vegas, the only locals are the staff.  the munich hbh is a crossroads of the globe and you may make new friends from a dozen countries within a few hours.  in vegas, you will meet people from buffalo, tupelo, and modesto.  still, you will meet people and have fun with them.  in munich, the place is packed to the roaring rafters by 7pm.  in vegas, the place is still half empty at that time and suffers from the loss of conviviality.  in munich, an oompah band makes the rounds every half-hour or so.  in vegas, three skinny white guys make do with guitar, bass, and keyboard.  oh, and in vegas there is a restroom attendant.\n\nbut that's all okay, because like i said, it's a great time.  there is still a lot of energy in the room, the staff are wonderful (especially our waitress rebecca), and the beer and food are awesome.  do not miss the <mark>Onion Mustard</mark> and obatzer cheese that come with the \"pretzel complete\" and check out the delicious crispy pork shank, after 4pm saturdays only.  plus they have added a uniquely american touch--whenever you down a shot, you get spanked by a waitress wielding a wooden paddle.  those ladies mean business.  great photo opportunity to embarrass your friends.\n\nif you want to have a great time with a group of friends and get away from the standard debauchery, you cannot make a better choice than the hofbrauhaus las vegas.", 
            "this review maybe a little biased because of how much fun i was having on this night, but i must say, this place is a great time!\n\ni had been once before for lunch with my parents when there was no band, no crowds, and hardly any beer drinking. \n\non saturday night, my girlfriend and i came here with a friend not knowing what to expect. we were wandering the gift shop waiting to be seated and all we could hear were screams and cheers and loud music and grown men screaming in pain as they are paddle spanked by adult women. willingly spanked by women with a large paddle. hysterical. \n\nwe were seated at a table right in front of the band where a group of four were already sitting, drinking, and having a great time. immediately upon our entrance, the band asked everyone to stand up or stand on the tables for the national anthem. drunk people swinging their mugs around and shouting out their american pride! such a funny experience! \n\nwe immediately ordered beers and a pretzel. the hofbr\\u00e4u original beer was delicious! i am not a huge beer drinker, but this beer was smooth and had a wonderful light taste to it. we must have ordered at least 8 of them throughout the night. when the pretzel came out, it was huge and salty and soft and delicious. the dipping sauces (there were two different mustard and one cheese) tasted great, especially the cheese! it may have been because we were feeling a bit tipsy, but we really enjoyed the pretzel and the three of us ate it up in a hurry. \n\nmy girlfriend and i shared the <mark>HB Riesenbratwurst</mark>, which was a slightly small sausage on a roll with sauerkraut and <mark>Onion Mustard</mark>. it tasted delicious! the sausage was a bit smaller than i expected, especially for the price, but the overall flavor combinations were wonderful. again, this may be attributed to my buzzed taste buds, who knows? \n\nas the night progressed, there were many toasts made and many people brought up to the stage for chugging contests and songs and dances. people watching was the greatest and everyone was really friendly and excited to be there. \n\nbottom line: it's impossible to not have a good time here on a friday or saturday night unless you do not enjoy the following: making friends, loud music, toasts and drinking delicious beer, german horns, and some good old fashioned comradery.",

(turned out to be a big mistake as hard rock is a terrible hotel choice)\n\nwe went for valentine's dinner. how romantic is that, right?!! i made reservations even though they weren't needed. when we entered the restaurant, there were approximately 10 people waiting for a table, but we were seated right away.\n\nmake sure you get one of the $12.95 pretzels as an appetizer. best thing on the menu!\n\nthere was a special menu available including: \n\n+ tomato cream soup garnished with pretzel croutons and chives. delicious!\n+ <mark>Chicken Schnitzel</mark> garnished with green asparagus and sauce choron, served with parsley yukon gold potatoes. sadly, this plate was sold out by the time we got there. :( i ended up eating an enormous plate of sausage. nom nom nom.\n+ valentine's crepe \"romanoff\" served with vanilla ice cream, marinated strawberries and whipped cream. they have an amazing whipped cream. \n\none of the fun things about this place is watching the all female chugging contest. the women all introduce themselves before downing their beer. based on their looks, we placed bets on who the winner would be. i went with a puffy faced girl wearing a wisconsin sweatshirt (how could i go wrong!?). the winner ended up being some girl from santa barbara with no gag reflex what-so-ever. she didn't breathe once while downing her beer. (i'm fairly certain all females from santa barbara have no gag reflex, but that is for another site.)\n\none strange part of the dinner was the main guy on stage wearing lederhosen. he was announcing everything and singing on the microphone. he honestly sounded like alvin from the chipmunks. it was so bizarre. \n\none of the better moments was another guy blowing the \"alphorn\". there was a wedding party eating dinner and they got the bride up on stage. she was wearing a tiny skirt and they placed the large end of the alphorn between her legs and.......well....... they blew her. watching her face was hilarious. the horn blower announced that she was now \"ready to go!\"\n\nahhhh, good times hofbrauhaus! see you on our next trip to vegas.",

            "imagine you're at a large group dinner.  you order something modest from the menu, and since you drove to meet everyone, you order a soda or an <mark>Iced Tea</mark> because you're a responsible non-drinking-and-driving kind of person.\n\nnow imagine that everyone else orders steak, lobster, and lots of alcohol, in addition to the multiple bottles of wine that somebody suggested.  the check comes, and \"it's easier to just split the total evenly than to try to figure out what everyone owes.\"  so you end up spending $75 for your burger, side salad, and diet coke.  admit it, you all know what i'm talking about.\n\neating at the hofbrauhaus is kind of like that, except everyone in your party is disappointed.\n\nif you're in vegas, stay on the strip for god's sake!", 
            "so i'm not much of a beer drinker and i'm really trying to stay away from really rich and fatty foods.  so this was probably not a good choice.\n\nthe entire table looked down at me as my salad headed my way.  i knew i was hungry so i also ordered the creamy mushrooms since the waitress said that the serving size was like that of a side dish and would go perfectly with the salad. now...either she lied or she has one hell of an appetite.\n\nmy salad was rather blah and nor did it feel healthy as the chicken was kinda greasy.  and the creamy mushrooms....well, there were less mushrooms than cream.  and in between it all was this like huge ball of stuffing.  it was actually pretty good, but definitely not healthy.\n\nand my non-beer drinking self...well, i washed it down with some good ol' <mark>Iced Tea</mark> :-)\n\nthe atmosphere was loud....pretty loud, but still exciting and fun.  don't expect to hold any type of conversation while there, but do expect to get an opportunity to be spanked.  yes...literally.  with a big paddle.  i think you get a free shot with every spank.  oh yeah, and they take your picture as well.\n\noooo...their hot pretzel....excellent!", 
            "good food, very good beer, fun atmosphere.  then why two stars?  the value ruins it.  they want your money and have created lots of ways to charge for it.\n\nthis place provides a fun party atmosphere where you can partake in fun german traditions and some new ones this place created, all put to loud german folk music.  if you are not much of a drunk partier, it might be over the top for you.  i don't really want to get spanked, sing songs with drunk people, try to hold up an oversized beer mugs until they drop, etc.  if you do, you will enjoy this place!\n\ni've traveled all over germany and this place mimics the fun beer halls of bavaria.  i say mimic because it is fairly authentic but still a reproduction of the true festivals of deutschland.\n\nthe food is very similar to that found in germany but not quite as freshly prepared.  the flavors are good and most cater to the true meat eaters.  almost all sausages and cutlets are worth trying.\n\nbut let's talk about the value.  a pint of <mark>Friday - Beer Battered Ocean Cod</mark> $8 and their terrible ice tea almost as much (germans don't know <mark>Iced Tea</mark>).  $20 for an entree, $6 for a salad, $1.50 for a slice of swiss cheese on the schnitzel, $2 for bread, and a whole host of other charges.  basic food and beverages for 3 people was $78 before the tip.\n\nthen there are all the tips.  tip the waitress, tip the musicians (they even come around begging with their horns), tip the bathroom attendant that hands you a towell but can't keep the bathroom clean...geez, good thing i didn't valet!  you would never find this kind of pandering in germany!  (well, you do need to tip the bathroom attendants in germany but at least they keep the bathrooms spotless during non-festival times.)\n\nso, while there are good elements to this place, i don't recommend it.\n\nif you are interested in an authentic german meal in a quieter setting, i recommend cafe old heidelberg, with very authentic food (albeit, slow service) for a much better price.\n\ntchuss!", 
            "ok, i have been to the real one in munich several times and i have to say that it is my favorite place in the world to sit with friends, eat some good food and have the best beer in the world! the hofbrauhaus in las vegas is a fun place to take some friends and i would recommend it to most people, but it does fall short of the original hofbrauhaus in munich, germany. \n\nfirst, the bad: its pricey!!! $15 for a beer? in germany it was less then $6 (us) but its vegas and they are selling an experience so i get it. it cost us $180 for 4 people to eat dinner... wow, but again its vegas. my only issue with the price is that the servers don't come around all that often so you must flag them down when you see them or you may not get another chance. also, i didn't appreciate that after the 2nd refill on her <mark>Iced Tea</mark> my friend was told she would be charged for the next one? seriously? at these prices she should be able to drink as much tea as she wants. \n\nthe good: its a fun party environment. especially on the weekend! i love the euro style dining experience in the main hall because as you drink and sing along with the band (which can be a little loud) you can't help but to meet some interesting people. the garden section is also available for the more intimate dining experience and isn't nearly as loud!  also, the food is very true to the dining experience we had in germany. was it as good as munich? maybe not, but how many german places can you find in vegas? fact: google lists 7! hb, cafe eidalvice (sp) and 5 weinerschnitzels... so it was good enough! \n\noverall its a fun place to go every now and then, but you can also find a better dining experience for the money (think mortons). as a substitute for flying to munich, its totally worth it.", 
            "this is a hard one to review.\n\nwhether you like it or not will be depend on what you're looking for when you walk in the door.  we were seated in the main dining hall and i have to say that place is loud.  its not a good place to have a conversation - as a matter of fact i applaud you if you can actually have a conversation over all that noise.  even when the band isn't playing its noisy.  i was at the end of the table and had to have others repeat what the waitress was saying because i couldn't hear her from 6 feet away.\n\nthat being said its definately a fun drinking place.  the band mostly played german beer hall songs but sometimes they'd sneak in a sweet caroline or a jimmy buffett song. \n\nwe were a party of 6; we all ordered different things and we all were happy with our meals.  i'm not a beer drinker so i didn't sample anything but there seemed to be a good selection.\n\nas others have said, it can be pricy depending on what you order.  i had a chicken sandwich and <mark>Iced Tea</mark> and my bill (incl tip) was just over $27.\n\nits not somewhere you'd go often but it definately has its place among eating establishments.", 
            "to be perfectly honest- i thought this was a horrible representation of the german branded beer destination in munich. i know it's two different countries, but the feeling was just- eh. if you're going to slap the name hofbrauhaus on a venue to lure people in, at least give a similar experience- especially since you're charging a lot for it. i'm actually surprised that this restaurant got as high of ratings as it did. maybe i should have started drinking before coming?\n\nthe location in munich was a warm and friendly atmosphere while the las vegas felt like an afterthought. we ordered two dinners, a beer, an <mark>Iced Tea</mark> and dessert and it came out to a little over $80. wowza. i kinda felt ripped off. there are a ton of great german places in orange county/la that charge significantly less and have a way better vibe. jaime p and i actually joked that there were more servers than customers, yet everyone had to try and flag someone down for attention.\n\ni ordered the n\\u00fcrnberger rostbratwurst which was three pork sausages, sauerkraut and <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark> and the meal was washed down with a mug of the hofbr\\u00e4u maibock. the sausages and sauerkraut were cooked okay, but lacked any real flavor. same went for the <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark>. the beer was good, you can't go wrong with that. i should have ordered more of those and it would have probably still been cheaper in the long run. at least i would have been drunk and satisfied.\n\nwent the extra mile to fill the void in my stomach and ordered the apfelstrudel that came out warm with a side of ice cream. i can't say anything bad about the dish. between this and the beer, it was the only reason i chose to give this place two stars.\n\nthere was a one man band singing some german tunes. he did his best with the crowd in the beer hall to keep them entertained. i think there were seven total in this massive space, but he did what he could to get the audience excited with beer drinking games and off the wall jokes. it was funny because when i called for hours, i was told i should make reservations because it's on a first<mark>Friday - Beer Battered Ocean Cod</mark> basis. maybe the other 500-people or so were on their way?\n\nthis could have just been an off day- unfortunately, i'll never know an on day because i wont be coming back.", 
            "i hate to leave bad review but can't help it this time. \n\nwe love this restaurant. food are always good. we love the environment. it's a fun place to go for beer and some german food. \n\ntoday i'm very disappointed about the service. too bad i didn't get her name. she has long black curly hair. and work on sep 17,2015 at 6:30 pm. ( i think only her have long black curly hair). we were waiting more than 15 min to place order for appetizer. we decided to order our main dishes at the same time because we don't want to wait for another 20 min to place orders again. there is no refill on my <mark>Iced Tea</mark>. come back and check on us only 1 time. again we wait for 20 min after somebody took our plates to order dessert. so when she bring our dessert , we ask for our check. again still no refill for my <mark>Iced Tea</mark>. also no refill for the guy that sit the same table with us. she always disappear from her section. can't get anybody attention. \n\nwe never have bad service at this place. this is the first time we had bad service. hopefully we won't have bad service next time otherwise we won't go back anymore.", 
            "one of the members of our hiking group came here a few times during octoberfest for lunch and she convinced the group we should do this.  knowing our hiking group, going somewhere for lunch after hiking is not a hard sell at all so we put this on our to do list.\n\nwe got there before they opened at 11 am.  as soon as they opened, the 9 of us were shown to a long table in the main room with high, arched ceiling.  the set up consists of long wooden benches at long wooden tables.\n\nour server was angela and she was terrific!  first drinks.  i got <mark>Iced Tea</mark> and my tea along with others who had been or soda were brought quickly.  our orders were then taken.  i wanted to get something somewhat german.  my only experience with german food had been at luchows in new york city many years ago.  i was never overly fond of german food despite it being half my heritage.  i got the wurstplatte, a sampling of three german sausages--a vienna style frank, and one pork and one chicken sausage.  they were served on a bed of <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark> topped with sauerkraut and served with a spicy <mark>Onion Mustard</mark>.\n\nthe sausages were ok--nothing outstanding--but ok.  the sauerkraut on top of the <mark>Mashed Potatoes</mark> was something knew for me but the two went together well.  i was surpirsed at how much of the mustard was gone when i was finished with the sausages.  maybe i overdid it a bit so the sausages had a bit more flavor?\n\ni was the only one to get dessert.  i got the black forest cake at angela's suggestion and this was so good that it would be reason to stop in here sometime when i wanted a good dessert.  creamy and very flavorful, it was a perfect ending to the meal.  and, the hiker who suggested we come here was the only one who got a taste of my dessert.  my question to the hofbrauhas is, \"why serve this piece of cake with 4 forks?  do you think i'm going to share?\"  no way!!\n\nservice was very good!  i will make a return visit some time and try a different dish but i'll go for lunch rather than in the evening when it will be loud with many beer drinkers banging their glasses and pretending to be in munich."

            "the skinny: texturally offensive cafeteria food that had probably sat in a chafing dish all day (1), low cut, faux-german, dairy maid costumes does not constitute service unless you are at a strip club (2), overall value can only be justified if you've had way too much to drink (1).\n\nhofbrauhaus is a disneyworld-esque german-styled building close to hard rock hotel. i wanted to try this place out for a while because of the charming facade outside.\n\nwe decided to head there to eat because it was in my head that it would be like a mini-trip to a sanitized germany without the pricetag. \n\nwhen we entered, the place has the tired ambience of a hangover  complete with the loud, cacophony of a bad german folk band. nobody was singing along with music, dancing or laughing... just downing a bunch of beer one after another.\n\nour waitress came by and took our orders dressed to... err... impress. she soon lost interest in our table however when we told her we weren't interested in alcohol. ordered a diet coke/pepsi which was not only flat but also tasted like there was some <mark>Root Beer</mark> mixed in there too.\n\ni ordered the sauerbraten which is supposed to be a roast pork dish with <mark>Dumpling</mark>, vegetables and red wine sauce with <mark>Red Cabbage</mark>. we were surprised at how quickly the food came out of the kitchen. after we tasted our food , we knew why.\n\nthe food obviously was sitting under a heat lamp for way too long. someone tried to disguise overly dry, salty pork with an overabundance of a lumpy, thick, red wine gravy. the <mark>Dumpling</mark> were large, gummy and unappetizing. vegetables were overcooked. the only thing that was okay on the dish was the stewed <mark>Red Cabbage</mark>.\n\nmy husband's schnitzel was dry and soggy. the gravy, it was swimming in, was bland. the <mark>Bavarian Potato Salad</mark> was unpleasant, sour and overly warm.\n\nthis place is not cheap - a typical entree can be around the $20 mark - yet they do not provide you any value for your dollar given the quality of the ambience, service and food.", 
            "the hofbrauhaus is a great place to bring your friends or your naughty kids. my friends and i were on an all guys trip to vegas and on our last night we decided to check this place out. we had no reservations, but within one hour, we were able to make a reservation via open table, and get seated. i was impressed because there were 10 of us and it was a saturday night. as soon as we get there i was overwhelmed with the \n\nthe environment is huge! they have a live band at the very front and the decor is great. very german/oktoberfestish. all seating is on wooden picnic bench style seats.  one thing to keep in mind is the noise. it's really loud when a band is playing.  so loud that we had to pretty much yell at each other to have a conversation. however, just because it's loud, it doesn't mean you can fart at will. you have to remember that its picnic bench style seating and your friends will still feel the vibration.  \n\nthe food here was satisfactory imo. i asked our server for his recommendation and he suggested the jagerschnitzel. it's a pork cutlet with bacon and onions covered in mushroom sauce. plate also comes with cranberries and spatzle which is a german noodle. the spatzle taste like macaroni. the pork was a little gristly for me but the overall blend of everything on the plate was pretty good.  \n\nthe beer tasted great and was so refreshing. since we were there in october the seasonal beer was the famous oktoberfest. all their beers are brewed and imported from munich germany. we all ordered our beers in that huge beer mug that you can serve <mark>Root Beer</mark> floats in. it was so good that i wanted another but the night was young and that one mug already had me feelin pretty good.  \n\nspanking service - while we were waiting for our food this lady aka the jager girl came to our table and asked us if we wanted a jager shot. she didn't say how much and we didn't care to ask at the time because we wanted one of our friends who never drinks and is really shy to get loose. so a few of us bought shots for him. we didn't realize that you get spanked for every shot you take. he took it well and we later found out that each shot was only 5 dollars. so then we all decided to get one. \n\nthe actual service of the restaurant was pretty good as well. they checked on us quite a bit and our food was brought out in a timely manner. \n\noverall, it was a great experience. solid 4 stars for me.", 
            "real german food!\n\ni live in sacramento, ca and usually come to vegas for about a week once every year while attending the ces convention.  there are a lot of places i have to make sure i visit to eat and this is one of them.  looking around, we don't really have german restaurants in sacramento. i mean there are restaurants in sacramento that are categorized as german, but they are german themed food with your meats and potatoes and such.  this place has actual authentic german dishes which is what i look forward too and what sacramento sorely needs.\n\nwhen you first walk into here, you walk into their small merchandise room where you can find an assortment of german themed items and clothing, some of them of course with hofbrauhaus's name into it. beyond there are two rooms, not sure the name of the first room but walking through that room, you arrive to the beer garden portion of the room.  the first room is slightly dark lit, and as we've always come there for dinner, they always have a band playing there. it's a very loud room.  i prefer to eat in the beer garden where i can't hear most of the music. for those looking for a happy go lucky fun time with eating, drinking and singing, that first room is for you. when the hostess asked if i wanted to be seated close or far from the music, she took us and was proceeding to have us sit in the first room, but further from the band.  i had to tell her that we actually meant the beer garden. so it looks like you have to specify that in the beginning.\n\nmost of the patrons are in the first room and the beer garden is more empty although is slowly fills up as well.  we ordered and had our drinks shortly.  the food came out surprisingly fast and bow was the food good.  i did notice that teh waitresses weren't that busy, even when more people started to file into the beer garden.  they spent a lot of time talking with one another. not sure if this is a good or bad thing but they did it a ways away from us so whenever i needed something, they were right there. very attentive? too attentive?  it didn't bother me too much.  \n\nalso, i think their <mark>Root Beer</mark> might be house made.  drinking it, i really couldn't distinguish between what type of <mark>Root Beer</mark> it was but it was pleasantly sweet.\n\nif you love german food or haven't tried german food before, you have to hit this place up."
