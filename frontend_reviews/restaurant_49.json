            "so how does one start a review of a restaurant/butcher shop???? i tell you how, with a comment a good friend said as she was looking at all the meat cuts, wow,  w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> great alternative to wf's!  i can come here order my meat and have a martini while i wait until they cut it up fresh!  t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> how i am starting my review of echo & rig.  and the patience and care the 23 year old butcher, yup t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> not a typo, t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> care of her, while in slicing her meat was ...frankly in today's world amazing - t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> call customer service.\n\nt<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> does not end there, it only begins there.  jason and courtnee  are polite without being pushy, knowing the menu items and making the correct recommendations; friendly but professional, comparable to the 5 star restaurants i have eaten at in las vegas - t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> the service we received at echo & rig, not once, but two nights in a row.  not to mention michael , who is just so excited to have the restaurant open - well michael you are not the only one, we of vegas and especially summerlin, cannot be happier, to have a premier, delicious, vivacious, restaurant with great energy opened in our backyard.  welcome to the neighborhood!\n\nand now for the food -  omg, delicious.  <mark>Fried Spinach</mark> salad, kale with baby yellow beets, gratin caramelized onion soup with pumpkin squash (i would come back just for that), <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>, brussels sprouts with pistachio and fresh lemon, black spaghetti with seafood and roasted peppers, butter fish, sea bass, skirt steak, prime rib, caramel salted ice cream and short cake and berries with ice cream.... yup t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> more, not one bad item, not one complaint from me or in two days from the 6 people i ate with.  the people around us ate different items and could not stop complementing them, such as the bone marrow and carne asada.  if you are a meat eating you will love this place, if you are conscious of farm to table eating, you will love this place, if you are a vegetarian, there are plenty of choices.  so let me recap: great atmosphere, great food, amazing service and prices, beyond reasonable.  least i forget to mention the cocktails; they do know how to make a drink. so w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> this mean, you need to go and try echo & rig at tivoli village, make your reservations , book your parties, bring your friends, stop by for a drink, you are not going to regret it!  and they have only just gotten started so it is only going to get better!!", 
            "this is the best steakhouse off the strip.  and even with that, echo & rig has so much more going for it!\n\ni came here with a 8 adults and 4 kids for my wife's birthday dinner on a very busy saturday night.  even though they normally don't take reservations, the manager i spoke with on the phone the day before (cheryl) was very helpful as i had my eye on the big long striped wooden table t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> pictured on their site and they saved it for us.  we arrived a few minutes before and were treated to passed hors d'oeuvres of their homemade salami and smoked chicken.  yum freakin yum.\n\nwith so many small plates offered, echo & rig is meant for groups so everything can be shared.  we split 3 salads and they all threw curveballs to the palate.  the kale salad with yellow beets, <mark>Toast</mark> hazelnuts and goat cheese was really nice.  their \"over the rainbow salad\" was an explosion of flavor featuring farro, quinoa, red, yellow & orange bell peppers, corn, red onion, asparagus, cherry tomatoes, almonds, herbs & champagne vinaigrette.  that's a vegetarian's dream right there.  and the <mark>Fried Spinach</mark> salad with red onion, cauliflower, broccoli was fantastic with the chile-lime vinaigrette was probably my favorite of them all.  the crispness of the spinach combined with the heat from the dressing was quite a combination.  \n\nwe ordered a bunch of small plates and the standouts for me were the cauliflower with chili de arbol, crispy shallots and onions and the roasted garlic mashed potatoes with sharp white cheddar but the description didn't do t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>.  it was almost like a super hash brown with a really nice dijon sauce.  i was also able to sample the burnt peas, pumpkin squash, grilled thick cut bacon with bbq sauce (no sauce needed), butcher's sausage and mac and cheese.  all of them were solid options and everything was devoured by the group.  \n\ni got the \"spencer steak\" which was one of the 3 ribeye cuts offered.  each steak comes with a complimentary sauce and i went with charred onion but sauce just isn't necessary when the meat is awesome.  my medium rare cut was closer to rare but it was probably better t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>.  it was everything you wanted in a steak...tender, juicy and flavorful.  my wife's rare filet mignon was cooked perfectly and just got better bite after bite.\n\nthen there's the freakin value of it all!!  the priciest entree is only $35!  no corkage fee (we brought 3 bottles), no cake fee (got a cake from patisserie manon) and they lit the candles and brought it out.  the total bill for 8 adults and 4 kids came out to what 2 people would spend at carnevino.  total wine and more is just across the way in boca park so pick something up there.  \n\ni cannot wait to come back since there are so many other dishes i must try like bone marrow carne asada and hawaiian cowboy.  i also can't wait for them to bust out their brunch and late night menus.  they also have tables set up on a balcony overlooking the tivoli village fountain which would make for a terrific date night.   \n\nthe staff was top notch from beginning to end and the experience here wouldn't have been as wonderful as it was without their great work.  they earned their tips and then some! i'm ready to go back for lunch.  \n\nsay hi to the pig heads outside!!", 
            "i walked in expecting to pay a lot for my lunch. i was wrong. there is no separate lunch and dinner menu. everything is very reasonably priced and well-portioned. i ordered the <mark>Fried Spinach</mark> salad with chili lime vinaigrette, <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>, and the butterfish. the spinach salad was such a delightful combination of flavors and textures. he <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> were amazing! the butterfish was the highlight of the day. so moist, so tender, so much flavor! i can't wait to go back and try everything!", 
            "this place was a little confusing as they serve food downstairs but the actual full service restaurant is upstairs. we almost left until a server caught us and escorted us upstairs. \n\nthis was a good place for lunch. fast service. the <mark>Fried Spinach</mark> salad was to die for. the tri tip sandwich was just ok though. i could go back and just have three <mark>Fried Spinach</mark> salads. it was t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>. \n\nanother good option in tivoli village.", 
            "given the length of time t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'ve been wanting to try this spot, it's no surprise t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> chose to have everything on the menu.  \n\nlet's back up and start at the beginning.\nfrom the time you enter echo & rig, you know you are in for a unique experience.  there's the cute little bar tucked off to the left.  the white staircase which must have heaven at the top.  the cute group of hostesses in their all black attire.  and then there's the meat.  that's right.  a full butcher shop with big, beautiful hunks of meat pornographically on display.  meat-centric heaven. \n\nwe went with friends on a saturday night at 7 and arrived a little early, expecting a wait.  no need, a table was ready for us and when our friends arrived, we were quickly taken to the upper echelon where the real deal happens.  the overall vibe of the restaurant's upstairs is t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> a very inviting, rich person's dining room (no travertine decking out my house!).  the lighting is low and warm, but not so low t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> need a flashlight to read the menu.  i am also a fan of open kitchens and really like how it is set back enough t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> noise from the kitchen doesn't take over the dining room.  \n\nnow for the stars of the evening.  we took the advice of yelpers and ordered the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> although i was a little unsure.  don't question it.  t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>, fried goodness is delicious and unlike anything i've ever had.  we also started with:\n\n<mark>Fried Spinach</mark> salad - one of my favorites.  just the right amount of oil and the crunch of the cauliflower is bomb\nkale salad\ncaesar salad\nfried oyster sliders (2 orders) (didn't try because fried oysters are not for me)\nsmall charcuterie plate - this was a last minute addition by my boyfriend who knows all too well t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'s not really anything i like more than a beautiful plate of meat, cheese and accoutrements.  i have insanely high standards and echo & rig's plate exceeded them.  fresh prosciutto and salami, two housemade pates, sour gherkins, whole grain mustard, some sliced turkey and toast points.  i literally had to force myself not to eat the whole thing, knowing a bomb diggity steak was in my future.   \n\nmy friend and i both had the spencer steak which was recommended by our server and our other halves both had the new york strip.  i really liked my steak, but be aware t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> char on the outside of the steak may require you go a little more raw than you normally would.  my medium rare was a little too done but now i know to order rare.  it was still an incredible cut of meat and i really enjoyed it.  you get a steak sauce of your choice and i went with the horseradish cream.  \n\nas everyone has said, there's no corkage fee at echo & rig.  i hope they continue this practice, although i know it has to be difficult to make money doing so.  we brought a few bottles of wine for dinner and then ended the night with some espresso and <mark>Coffee</mark>.  the manager visited our table and all around, the wait staff was just fantastic.  finally, a dining denizen t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> can love in the snooze fest t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> summerlin cuisine.  echo & rig, don't do me like rosemary's.  don't you ever go away.", 
            "horrible experience!  i was looking forward to my \"date night\" with my husband and time with friends.  we went on a friday night with a reservation for 14 people at 6:30.  they had to seat us at 2 separate tables.  we were seated within 5 minutes of arriving and it was a good 15 minutes before our drink order was taken.  our server kept coming by our table and saying \"take your time-no hurry\", well we were ready the first time.  drinks took about 10 minutes once we ordered them and then we had to make the effort to ask for additional drinks t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> just as slow as the first.  it was about 25 minutes till we received bread and they took our order.  needless to say we had 8 people at our table and they only brought enough bread for each person to have one very small piece and only one very small thing of butter.  it took 30 minutes to get our appetizers and we had to request 4 additional bread refills because we were all sitting there starving...plus each time i had to ask for additional butter.  25 minutes after our appetizers the main dishes arrived.  my husband's porterhouse was over cooked and had way to much sinew.  i only got a <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> so really no need to comment on that.  however, most meals came with a side of \"garlic chips\"...these were homemade, deep fried slices of potatoes with absolutely no taste.  complete blah with no hint of garlic or any seasoning.  the mushroom served with all meals was plain and stuffed with very dried bread crumbs...  they must have felt bad for making us wait so long for our dinner because they threw in a complimentary deep <mark>Fried Spinach</mark> salad...way to much oil on that!  ooops, almost forgot--i ordered a side of brussel sprouts which they never brought so i had to request they remove t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> my bill.  over all this dinner dragged on and on and was not relaxing nor enjoyable.  only great or memorable thing was my husband's drink- kentucky peachtree, very good!", 
            "first time here and have to admit t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was pleasantly impressed with the service, knowledge of the staff and attentiveness. got the <mark>Fried Spinach</mark> salad, awesome, by the way. sides of burnt peas with garlic and the broccolini. decided to order the t-bone porterhouse steak (31oz) to share (wasn't on the menu, waiter showed us the daily cuts). paired with red wine. dinner was exquisite. ambiance and overall experience will make me come back for more.", 
            "to clarify the hours, the restaurant upstairs is open until 11. there is a bar downstairs with only a few late night  food specials t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> open until 1am.\n\nthis place is carnivore heaven. with an in-house butcher shop supplying the restaurant, you can get pretty much any cut of meat you want.\n\ni appreciate t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> & rig proudly displays w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> their meat comes from. this is huge, i wish all restaurants had this level of transparency.\n\necho seems to source meat from smaller organic or all natural farms, something i am very happy to see and happy to pay a premium for.\n\non my first visit here i opted to share a massive 48oz porterhouse with my friend. when it came out pre-sliced i was worried, but all was good when i took a bite. it was properly rested before cutting, and so much easier to eat t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>. i'm now a fan of this style.\n\nthe steak was perfectly cooked, well seasoned, and good enough t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> has brought me back to echo & rig many times.\n\nthis is now the place i crave after too many visits to veggie house or when i need a little more (ok, a lot more) protein in my diet. \n\nall the main dishes i have tried here have been excellent, i have not been disappointed with a single one. notable highlights include the lamb porterhouse chops, summertime steak salad, horseradish crusted butterfish, and of course all the steaks. you can't go wrong with any piece of meat here, but the spencer steak takes the crown - it's lean but very tender and always cooks to an even, perfect medium rare.\n\none minor complaint, the potato chips and stuffed mushroom t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> with the steaks seem more like lunch items. these sides are not fit for dinner steaks and certainly don't add anything to the amazing steaks they are served with. i would prefer a choice of vegetable, roast or mashed potatoes, or even fries instead of the dry underwhelming chips.\n\nsome of my favorite sides are the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> & herb aioli, grilled octopus, charcuterie platter, <mark>Fried Spinach</mark> salad (perfect to share, ask for it to be split in half), and roast potatoes.\n\nthe no corkage policy is awesome, i hope it is here to stay.", 
            "my friend and i decided on a night of lusty looks and gnawing on meat as we took in echo & rig for dinner before heading over to the suncoast to see the new scarlett johansson feature \"under the skin\"   while waiting for my friend i took a seat at the bar where i was pleasantly surprised to find t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> offered the full menu.   since we were on a limited amount of time (heaven forbid i miss any minutes of scarjo action) i decided our best bet was to just eat there, and it also allowed us to partake in the final moments of happy hour.   \n\nunfortunately and probably due to a mixture of too much jack daniels and just the right amount of scarjo intake during the evening i don't recall our bartender's name. but he was friendly, engaging, and got our refills and food orders put in with perfect timing.   i heard him make some recommendations on food items to some other patrons, but i didn't need those as i'm a yelper who does his research and generally knows w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> wants to order before ever sitting down at a restaurant.\n\nhere's w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> went with (everything was shared)\n\n1.  <mark>Fried Spinach</mark> salad:   this reminded me so much of one of my favorite eats ever, toro with crispy spinach from izakaya by katsuya in los angeles.  the spinach is melt in your mouth with a great flavor.   a must order\n\n2.  salt and pepper fries:  i would have normally gone with the yelp favorite <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>, but i thought my dining companion would enjoy these more based on her tastes.  perfectly cooked, but perhaps not enough pepper to really stand out as anything other than a batch of decent salted french fries you can get all over town\n\n3.  brussel sprouts:  the yonaka effect.  ever since yonaka's version anytime i see these on any menu i want to try them.   these were tasty.   perfectly grilled with lemon and pistachios.   \n\n4.  then came the star of the show, the filet mignon which is billed as \"double r ranch sustainable beef\".   it came with a green peppercorn sauce on the side which we chose, but honestly it might as well not have come with t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> all.   we both took a bite of the meat with the sauce and enjoyed it, but then ate the rest of it without ever putting anymore sauce on it.   i tend to think beef stands on it's own and only needs the slightest of seasoning to make it perfect, and this was a shining example of that.   \n\nall in all our bill came out to roughly $80 and was worth every penny.   now i anxiously await a new mila kunis or natalie portman feature to be exclusively playing at the suncoast so i can do it all over again.", 
            "our server was kendra - she was very informative offering recommendations and her favorites.  when we realized we were running short on time she quickly accommodated us by getting our dessert to go.  we had the grilled octopus, <mark>Fried Spinach</mark> salad, burrata, and <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>. would order all again! they were all awesome!  we had leftovers and took the dessert to go. we shall return!", 
            "so so good. went for brunch and we loved everything. the short rib hash is amazing. the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> are delish. the <mark>Fried Spinach</mark> salad was so tasty. this is my new favorite place for brunch. great prices.", 
            "i had the opportunity to come here for brunch and dinner and both times i had an amazing experience. the service is amazing, the food awesome and the atmosphere is great! we tried the <mark>Fried Spinach</mark> which had an interesting flavor, but very good. we also ordered the mac and cheese which was creamy and very tasty. as our main course we ordered the filet mignon and the spencer.     although they were both very good i would recommend the spencer! their meat is organic and fresh\noverall great restaurant! \n\ntip: you can buy fresh meat at a great price!", 
            "san diego native on a stink in las vegas looking for some of the best joints to eat at t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> not on the strip. found one! echo & rig deliver a very upscale atmosphere with creative cocktails and cuisine. the service was exceptional! when we entered the establishment the head butcher aaron gave me a tour of his spice rack (amazing stuff) along with the craftsmanship he instills in his butchery. then we were welcomed by the floor manager derrick with a warm great to see you again family vibe. the drinks were creative but the dionysus (vodka cocktail) was the best by far. we started with the <mark>Fried Spinach</mark> and kale salads, very nice and light with great flavors. our server nicolas has a great knowledge of the menu and suggested the eggplant fries with the pesto mayo. very nice! nicolas mentioned about 75 menu items, i would have been good with hearing two of his favorites from each category but he was prompt and showed care in his work. we also chose the rib-eye cap steaks for dinner with an assortment of sauces. i will say t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> wish i would have gone for the bone in rib-eye. the steak was good but not great! go with the bone-in or filet ( i will next time). on the side was a nice stuff mushroom and some garlic chips t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> not memorable. they probably could ditch the chips for something else, garlic mashed potatoes are always welcome on a plate with beef. we also ordered a side dish of caramelized carrots t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> very nice. overall the service was fantastic and i highly recommend this spot. the service is w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> this place from a 4 to a 5. great price point too!", 
            "i took my boyfriend here for his birthday. when we first arrived, i could barely get him to keep walking to the door as he admired all the fresh cuts of meat in the window. we had a reservation and were seated quickly. our water came out quickly as well; i chose flat, and my boyfriend chose the complimentary sparkling water. after this, the waiter took his time to come back and get our drink and appetizer orders. about fifteen minutes after our appetizer order was taken, a small loaf of bread finally came out. considering how long it had taken, i assumed the bread would be hot and fresh - but it was not. the drinks came a few minutes after; i felt they really took too long for a simple loaf of cold bread and a single cocktail.\n\nas appetizers we had the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> and <mark>Fried Spinach</mark> salad. in retrospect we probably shouldn't have had two fried things together, but t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> our fault not theirs! both appetizers were delicious and the flavors were well balanced. \n\nfor the main course, i ordered sides only as i am a vegetarian. i found they had fairly unique vegetable dishes; i didn't have to settle for a salad and baked potato like at a lot of steakhouses. i had a spicy cauliflower dish and black tuscan kale. both were excellent. my boyfriend ordered a medium ribeye and reported it was cooked perfectly.  we also shared the baked brie and sourdough with stone fruit; i really enjoyed this at first, but after it cooled the bread became tough and chewy. if you get this, make sure to eat it while it's fresh! \n\nthey brought out a complimentary caramel ice cream for the birthday boy. \n\noverall we had a great experience, but the service was slightly lacking. we both felt the initial wait for drinks and bread took too long. our waiter also seemed rushed and slightly inattentive. the busser enrique was constantly smiling and courteous; it's a little sad i remember his name but not the waiter's name! enrique certainly made more of a positive impression.   \n\noverall we gave the service 3 stars and the food 5 stars. the price was very reasonable. we will be back to try it again, but hope to have a different waiter!",

            "this place is a gem! an amazing destination for steaks and seafood. i've dined here 3 times and each time, everything has been impeccable. my first time was for lunch, and i am surprised the inside was packed during lunch time. but don't let t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> you, they also have a very cozy patio area with heaters if you want to go al fresco. \n\non the next 2 occasions, we made reservations because we had a large party of 8 and we were whisked right in. servers are always very courteous with plenty of recommendations if you ask. in these trips, i have tried a crazy array of their food and all of it is amazing! for appetizers, you have to get the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>. they are the best fries (potatoes and other vegetables included) t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> have ever eaten. i dream about these babies and would come here just to eat 3 orders of fries and leave (don't judge me). \n\nother noteworthy mentions include the spinach salad (not healthy, <mark>Fried Spinach</mark>, but the texture of it is incredible) and brussel sprouts. wow. their brussel sprouts are so tasty with each leaf peeled off individually and a lemony tang and crunch from pistachios. they are a must-have to offset all the protein you're about to ingest.\n\nfor proteins, we've had the filet, spencer, rib-eye, skirt, brisket, salmon, and butterfish. each protein is cooked perfectly to your request and the quality of the meats are obvious. there is no chewy stuff you have to cut off and pile onto the side of your plate. knives cut through everything in one foul stroke. although the sign of a good steak is not needing to have any condiments, they have the best condiments if you want to shake it up. i personally love the chimichurri and horseradish. lastly, it was my first time trying butterfish this week from echo & rig, and let me tell you t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> is my new favorite fish. if you're not in the mood for steak, get the butterfish!!\n\ntheir dessert menu is simple with everything being ice cream. i would like more variety, but will not complain because i still love t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> turtle sundae. if you haven't been in awhile, go back. they have added many new signature items in their menu. if you're a vegetarian, don't be afraid to come here. there are so many vegetarian and vegan options on the menu t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> will leave stuffed and happy. i love echo & rig and think it is an amazing gem in suburban las vegas with the perfect price point and atmosphere. don't even think about going to the <mark>Chai</mark> steakhouse down the street when you can be receiving great quality for the same price.",

            "w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> pleasant surprise.  i've been to echo & rig only once, but the overall experience will undoubtedly keep me coming back.  \n\nfor starters, the service is excellent, from the host to the asst. gm.  the staff is not only friendly, but passionate about their food.  the dishes we selected on our own were good, but the dishes t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> recommended to us were exceptional.  another important attribute, the prices are reasonable for w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> produce.  \n\non to the meal:\nthe restaurant offers complimentary purified still or sparkling water.  this is a nice touch, one i wish more restaurants would adopt.\n\n<mark>Portobello Fries</mark> & herb aioli\nthey call this one of their signature dishes and it was the first item t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> recommended to us.  we were not let down, the fries were delicious. they're not too greasy/heavy and the aioli is a perfect accompaniment.  \n\nsteak tartare\ni love a good steak tartare and echo and rig deliver a great version.  the dish is well balanced and the <mark>Toast</mark> bread is a good vessel to deliver the meat with just the right amount of crunch.  the caper/beef combo is so delicious.  \n\nbrussels sprouts, pistachio & fresh lemon\nthis was probably the most basic item we ordered, but t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> no way is a criticism.  in comparison to other dishes, the flavors were simple, which i often welcome in a vegetable dish.  great crisp in the leaves, just the right amount of citrus.\n\n<mark>Fried Spinach</mark>\nwe were about to order the arugula salad, but knowing we were open to recommendations, the server steered us towards the <mark>Fried Spinach</mark>.  this is one of my favorite dishes of the night.  flash frying the spinach, gave it a kale-chip like texture.   throw in the chile-lime vinaigrette and thinly-sliced red onions and you have harmony on a plate.  the vinaigrette was almost sweet, but just the right amount to play off the spinach and onions.  bravo.\n\ncauliflower, chili de arbol, crispy shallots & onions\nanother impressive and inventive dish.  the cauliflower almost tasted candied.  there were so many layers of flavor and texture, i'm not sure i can do a technical description any justice.  \n\nthe spencer steak\nthis was an excellent cut of meat.  cooked to perfection, the steak was tender and smokey (they say their steaks are cooked over red oak).  we sampled three of the steak sauces - charred onion, red wine demi and brandied mushroom, which i liked in t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>.  i didn't always taste the garlic in their garlic-chips, but they were tasty nonetheless. the mushroom rockefeller was so good.  \n\ndessert - caramel turtle\nanother staff pick, the salted-caramel sundae topped with peanut brittle, whipped cream, bourbon sauce, etc. was quite good.  their dessert menu is entirely sundaes or an option for seasonal berries and sorbet.  \n\n\non top of everything, the restaurant contains a full bar and wait for it...  a butcher shop!  i don't know about you, but this is exciting for me.  it's a very smart concept and one t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> adds to the culture of the restaurant.  on my next visit, i'll likely take home some cuts of meat and wood (assuming it's red oak), for my home bbq.  \n\ni look forward to returning to try some of the other dishes t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was simply too full to order.", 
            "they did it again! i was actually late to my parents house for easter dinner. don't judge me but, i had to come here first. service is second to none. from the time i arrived the hostess remembered me. walking upstairs and being greeted by \"my man\" xavier. i feel like a rock star when i come here. food was superb! <mark>Fried Spinach</mark>, cauliflower, spencer steak, and asparagus. all cooked to perfection. during dinner, we were not interrupted, it felt like i was watching a \"third base baseball coach\" with the hand signals xavier was performing. this led to the type of water we wanted, to clearing the cable, and asking us if we wanted refills. i've never witnessed anything like this. great job by the entire staff. i will be back next week to bring my family so they see why i rave about echo and rig!", 
            "been here three times and all three times i really enjoyed it. first time, mainly because i was with my two awesome girlfriends i have not seen in years and we always manage to order the best dishes together and have a blast. \n\nother two times were with my man and the dog and well.. i could be eating a frozen chicken drumstick in an nyc subway stop and have the most awesomest time ever. \n\nother than great company, the food is also pretty good. i love a good off the strip steakhouse.\n\nthey used to have this gazpacho t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> just ridiculous. it's off of the menu now. i recently \ne-mailed the gm asking for the recipe and they gave it to us! my love and i had an amazing time preparing it at home. got loaded on some first class whites and enjoyed this amazing, cold and crisp treat. just perfect. thank you guys so so much!! i made two gallons of it, probably. gazpacho for days, people.\n\nthe <mark>Fried Spinach</mark> salad is pretty amazing. great texture paired with tangy and sweet asian vinaigrette.\n\nthe grits and pork belly is just amazing. my steak was as pretty damn good too. everything was lovely except the ceviche.... interesting flavor, off putting color. did not care for it, but only because i was craving the traditional chopped shrimp, onion, cilantro, lime situation. \n\nsit on the patio, the evening and nightfall are great :-)",

            "alright here we go- lets start off with impeccable service. from the moment you walk in, you are greeted by two hostess' who walk you up to your table making small talk about how the restaurant works and w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> occasion is we have joined them for. once seated, the server takes full control and walks us through the menu, elaborating on his favorite dishes and the most popular items. unfortunately this time around it was only two of us or we would have gone with their delicious tomahawk presented to us on a platter with all their fresh cuts of beef. to begin, we ordered a tempranillo t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> well with our three starters (flash <mark>Fried Spinach</mark> salad is a must, along with the watermelon cucumber salad t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> the sweet/salty mix to your tastebuds. our meat selection for this meal was the beef tenderloin cooked mr and the cowboy marinade skirt steak served m t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> full of flavor and quite honestly \"blew our minds\". at this point of a meal we didn't think it could possibly get any better until they brought up their 20 and 30 year ports to finish us off right. this steakhouse could quite possibly take over las vegas or anywhere it expands to. do not hesitate to give this place a shot. you will surely be overjoyed with the camaraderie of staff and the love and pride they have in their establishment.", 
            "the service kicks some serious ass. they were all over us with recommendations, information on how they select food, asking where we were from and if we had any time restrictions. the drinks were on point (i had a \"seascape\" with kettle one and a glass of house cabernet with the main course.) and the menu selection had a nice range. the <mark>Fried Spinach</mark> salad was probably one of the best salads i've ever had. period. the mac n cheese was cheesy and delicious. the chips t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> served with the steak were flavorful and crispy and the mushroom cap was a nice touch to the plate. the wait staff were awesome. they were close by and made sure the table was always cleared and the water was topped off. the fresh cut lemons on the table were a nice touch as well. the steaks were cooked to perfection. i had the spenser cut and mrs c had the rib eye cap. trust me. you want to try all of the sauces and they will let you. we recommend the blue cheese and the horseradish sauces the most but all were great. unbelievably they comped us dessert (which we didn't ask for but it was exactly w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> were going to order anyway)! it was the caramel turtle and it was seriously ridiculously good. i asked my wife w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> name of the dessert was and she said \"wait a second while i finish having sex with this ice cream in my mouth\". enough said. eat here. you will be happy you did.",

            "me wife and i visited for the first time last night. great service, food and very reasonable pricing for a upscale steakhouse. we shared the burratta with peas and the sausage, beans and escarole as appetizers, both were marvelous. my wife had the <mark>Hanger Steak</mark> and i decided to try the black spaghetti, both of those dishes were very good. the restaurant is clearly laid out much differently than most. they greet you upon arrival, take down your name and escort you to the 2nd floor dining area. i found the dining area little noisier than expected and had a little difficulty hearing my wife from time to time. but other than that, i found it a very pleasant dining experience. and btw, we enjoyed the fresh sausage so much t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> bought a pound at the butcher shop on the way out! can't wait to fire up our bbq for another taste of their sausage!", 
            "good steak; they marinate cheaper, tougher cuts of beef & make it taste good by charcoal grilling. the side of cauliflower was excellent. we enjoyed the skirt and <mark>Hanger Steak</mark>. the caesar salad was good but  the dressing did not taste like it had garlic in it. the waitress was the ditziest i have ever experienced..every 3rd word was yummie..gr8 english vocabulary she had, dah..poor vegas education or just an absolute ditz. when we asked about the sides..well, her comment was they are all so awesome & yummie with no description of any. we finally got bread as we finished our entrees. the tuscan bread was the saltiest i have ever had..absolutely inedible.  we will  return for the steak & sides. they are quite disorganized with so many employees t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> poorly trained or just poorly educated young kids. poor on the service side. definitely not even close to t bones in red rock. the meats in the butcher shop are off the chart expensive & they raise the per lb price almost every day. no way is a lousy tough ny strip steak worth $27./lb.  the whole carcusses are hanging in their window as are 2 whole headless pigs and their heads are on the top shelf. t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> enough to turn anybody off. very attractive restaurant but extremely loud with marble-like hard floors. the restaurant is on the 2nd floor. nice outdoor dining if it is not too hot outdoors.", 
            "first time and the man quotes the best place he's been to! everything was simply amazing from the service , feel, quality and food! went on a sunday and it was pretty busy but nothing a glass of wine to wait with cant fix. we sat outside on the heated patio -so comfortable and was greeted by devin. he's was awesome the whole night thru and helped with the menu. started with the cauliflower and pepper small plate. along with the garlic mashed potatoes - they have a good selection to go off of. hard to choose just one. both were amazing flavor and great size. we got the trenn\\u00e9 prime rib eye pasta and the <mark>Hanger Steak</mark> sandwich . for how amazing the food was the price is great as well. the texture, quality and savory melt in your mouth flavor is so inviting. it's refreshing to have real- good food. ended with their carmel sunday and coffee. not too full but definitely satisfied! can't wait to go back!", 
            "the highlight of this place is, without a doubt, t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> serve grass-fed steaks at legit prices! i ordered the <mark>Hanger Steak</mark> and the wife had the spencer steak. both were absolutely excellent. they were cooked and seasoned almost perfectly. the atmosphere is great, the staff is great, the bar downstairs has a great sangria. overall, i think it's my new go-to steakhouse. the prices for the quality of food you're getting is just amazing.\n\naside from our main dishes, we had the mashed potatoes and the asparagus with fried egg. both were also amazingly delicious. one of the waiters came by and asked out of curiosity why i'd ordered the asparagus and i had to admit it was a legit question. not usually two things t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> ever would have thought to put together. my answer to him was, \"well, i like eggs and i like asparagus, so i figured i couldn't lose.\"  i was right. it's a combination i never would have thought of t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> together very well. the sauce on the plate is also delicious, and the flavors all just go together.\n\nthey brought out bread while we waited for our appetizers, which i usually don't eat. i made an exception this time and ended up eating all four pieces. it was very very good, and apparently very high quality because i didn't feel terrible after eating it. i have found t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> higher the quality of ingredients in a few foods i avoid --\\u00a0like bread, for example --\\u00a0the less terrible i will feel. i still shouldn't have eaten it and felt the effects later, but i don't regret it. the bread was delicious and was high quality.\n\nthere are three things t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was not too happy with during the meal. one, i ordered the bone marrow appetizer and the waiter came back about 10 minutes later to tell me t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> were all out of bone marrow. i wish he would have known t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> i ordered it, and i wish they wouldn't have run out! not a big deal, since this is w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> me order the asparagus and egg which ended up being delicious also. two, the <mark>Hanger Steak</mark> was cut incorrectly. a steak like this needs to be cut across the grain of the meat, otherwise the fibers in the pieces are very long and it makes the steak chewy. thankfully, the steak was cut in such a way t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> i made the pieces smaller i was able to cut them across the grain myself and the steak was definitely cooked just right so it was perfect when properly cut. third, and this was the case for both my and my wife's steak, the char on the outside was a bit heavy on the ends. two small bites of each steak on the ends was very charcoal-like, with t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> texture and bitter taste. it doesn't extend too far into the meat so you're just losing the nice seared exterior of these two very small parts of the meat, and i ate them anyway. just something t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'d like to see them be more watchful of.\n\nthis place is definitely a 5-star-worthy steak house, and if you're trying to eat paleo you can  just chow down on grass-fed steak and a bunch of paleo-friendly appetizers and have a great night out.\n\npro tip: a spencer steak is s boneless ribeye; also called a delmonico steak in some places, but really it's just a ribeye. the spencer steak here is ~$10 cheaper than the bone-in ribeye. you get the same great cut of meat and more for your money by weight, but you miss out a bit on the little something extra of flavor t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> bone imparts.", 
            "w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> great night for a bone in steak. we ended up at our usual spot-echo & rig-for one of our indulgent dinners for the month. we dined and had cocktails, ending on a high note--complimentary dessert--their turtle sundae. \n\ni tried their rib cap, flat iron, sirloin, and <mark>Hanger Steak</mark>. this was the first go at the bone in ribeye.\\u00a0 nicholas, our amazong server, helped us choose a great xut. the chef cooked it perfectly, simply seasoned to allow the quality cut to speak for itself. i tried a dip in the peppercorn, charred onion, and red wine sauces, but they are unnecessary with the steak. it's succulent, sexy, and the salty fat crust t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> into a heavenly cracker on the sides of each slice made my eyes roll back in ecstasy with every bite. \n\ni began <mark>A Love Affair</mark> with this restaurant since their doors opened, and continue to return for the surprises in every meal, the quality, the impeccable service, and the fact t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> costs 5 bills on the strip is readily available in the neighborhood. with great cocktails and amazing meats, i return to their open arms for moments like the one this steak provided.", 
            "my first visit here i came for brunch. it was just before the seasons changed (you know, summer and winter) so it was still warm enough to sit outside on their patio, which is situated on the second floor of the restaurant overlooking the valet turnstyle of tivoli.\n\nso we decided to try a couple different sanwiches instead of going with breakfast food. \n\nburrata- english peas, green onion and mint. this was terrible. i won't even bother explaining.\n\n<mark>Portobello Fries</mark>- not sure w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> the fuss is about. they weren't all that.\n\n<mark>Hanger Steak</mark>- with roasted anaheim chilies, spinach and lemon aoili chimichurri.\nthe steak was so raw, i couldn't eat  it. i asked our waiter if this was normal, the blood coming from the meat made the roll soggy. he replied t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> is supposed to be rare (it doesn't state this on the menu). anyways, i couldn't eat it, and he didn't offer to replace it with a different meal.\n\n<mark>Grilled Cheese</mark>- short ribs, gruyere, parmesan and white chedder. this was definitely the table favorite. the short ribs really gave it an extra flavor to the awesome combo of cheeses.\n\n<mark>Smoked Salmon</mark>- it never gets old. still one of my favorites\n\nthe best part about brunch? the $16 <mark>Bottomless Mimosas</mark>.\n\nback for dinner the next week, and i had the colorado lamb chops. these were good, but nothing to write home about. i enjoyed my cocktails more than my meal.\nheat of the moment is an excellent drink, and at $8 you can't help but have a couple.\n\n bring your patience with you, they don't except reservations, so it can be an hour wait at time.", 
            "let me start by saying i'm not a fan and i doubt i will ever be back to echo & rig.  we came here late afternoon and there was one other party in the restaurant.  we were brought our <mark>Black <mark>Green Iced Tea</mark></mark> quickly and it was refilled frequently while we were there.\n\ni had looked at the menu online and i took some time to decide once there.  for a starter, we ordered their <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> which were served with an herb aioli.  this was the first i noticed t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> garlic or should have had garlic (herb aioli) had no garlic taste at all.  the herb aioli was good but missing the garlic flavor.\n\nmy wife ordered the tri-tip steak--medium--even though i suggested she get medium rare and i ordered the <mark>Hanger Steak</mark> blue.  she was drawn to the tri-tip because the menu said lemon and garlic neither of which was evident in any way.  garlic fail number 2.  all their steaks come with garlic chips (no garlic flavor here either--garlic fail #3) and a mushroom rockefeller, a breadcrumb stuffed mushroom cap.\n\nthe portobello mushroom was wonderful with the light coating and the cheese shreds.  then we waited.  we saved some of the mushrooms fries for our steak, and then we waited some more.  approximately 20 minutes later, our server said the steaks would be right out.  he took our small plates and silver away.  about 5 minutes went by and he stopped by once again and said the steaks would be right there.  about 5 minutes later, he stopped by to say they'd be out in about a minute.  this time, he was right.\n\nwhen the steaks arrived, i noticed t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> had been cut in slices and i just cringed.  i absolutely <mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> it when this is done.  maybe that's why so few places do it.  i asked if there was a culinary reason and the server said he'd ask.  when he came back he told us t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> chefs said it was to make the steaks more tender.  my steak was good, but it was cooked a little more than i would do it at home.  my wife's steak was less tender and because of her medium order, which they did, the steak was less juicy and there was a fair amount of sinew t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> wouldn't expect.  she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.  but above all, i'd say, please don't cut my steak.  i'm not a two year old and i'm not infirm.  i googled this when i got home and found t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> only reason (perhaps) to do this was to cut the steak against the grain the right way.\n\nwe each had a sundae for dessert.  they were ok.\n\ni left echo & rig very disappointed.  the length of time from ordering to getting our mains was ridiculous when the place is less than 1/10 full.  it was a tuesday afternoon--not date night usa at 8 pm.", 
            "a favorite of mine because of the exceptional food, service and ambience.  great weekend brunch w/short rib hash or <mark>Hanger Steak</mark> w /chile pepper.  steaks include unique cuts cooked well and presented in nice proportions.  patio overlooking tivoli village is fun for people watching.  a meat lovers paradise you can visit the butcher shop and bar downstairs.", 
            "directly from mccarran to tivoli village after a tiring 5-hour flight from newark, we figured on happy hour.  it was shortly after 10 p.m. on a tuesday, and i didn't expect our restaurant of choice to be closing up.  but the bartender there said t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> & rig was going to be the only game in town.  i'd been wanting to try it, so actually was happy with the suggestion.\n\ni sure wasn't about to scarf down a full meal, so we sat in the bar area.  happy hour had just kicked in, and our first waiter told me t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'s a ladies' drink and it's free.  w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> be better than free?  i think probably lots of things.  the drink, with muddled strawberries and w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> like grapefruit juice, was so tart t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was puckering up like a fish.  the bartender said there was another drink, a black betty, t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> could try.  it was a rum concoction with pineapple and oj, but that, too, was way too tart.  maybe these drinks solely exist to get ladies to order from the regular drink menu??  speaking of which, said menu has wines available by the glass, bottle, and half-glass.  half a glass of wine??  while the size of wine glasses has grown in direct proportion to the price of an entree at a given restaurant, the contents has shrunk just like your favorite roll of toilet paper.  i imagine half a glass of wine will equal two sips.  \n\nthe waiter recited the happy hour menu - shrimp cocktail or steak and egg(s) for $1.99, or a hot dog for $1.  i didn't think any of t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> going to hold us, so we ordered one steak and egg, an onion soup to share, and a <mark>Hanger Steak</mark> sandwich.  \n\nthe steak and egg was a cute little plate, with a child-size steak and a single fried egg.  not a lot to eat, but hell, it was 1.99!  we both loved the onion soup.  i was surprised to see the <mark>Hanger Steak</mark> sandwich served on a baguette-type bread, something t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> so hard to come by in vegas.  i just wish the bread had the crusty crunch t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> baguette sandwich should have.  the steak was on the rare side of medium, and the fresh spinach was good.  but it was all soooooo unnecessarily salty t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> didn't enjoy it as much as i could have.  i would have also appreciated a lot less salt on the otherwise-delicious chips t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> with the sandwich.\n\nthe bartender, jeff, was a delight.  he took over as our waiter, and sat down with and went through the entire menu for a future visit, letting us know which items he particularly recommends.  and they weren't all the priciest, either.\n\ni got to see the dining room upstairs when i passed through it on my way to the ladies' room.  the dining room - and the outdoor patio - are beautiful, but the bathroom is gorgeous!  loved the granite trough sink and the salt rub, which price i forgot to check out in their store.\n\ni definitely will go back to check out the regular menu, but next time will try to have them ease up on the salt.", 
            "in one visit, echo & rig has become a place i cannot afford to miss whenever i visit las vegas.\n\nas soon as you enter, you'll see the place is unique, with a large butcher counter and organic juice bar on the floor level. the people behind the counters are smiling and engaging and are happy to tell you anything and everything about the sumptuous foods they're preparing. t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> where it came from as well as recipes for the specific cut you want.\n\nupstairs, via stairs or elevator, is the restaurant and kitchen. the kitchen is open for everyone to see with about a dozen cooks who really know their stuff. when i visited, the co-owners/head chefs, frank & sam, were both there and i got to meet them. they are genuinely nice guys. so nice in fact, they served us a complimentary lamb porterhouse steak, which wasn't even on the lunch menu! this was after i told them i came all the way from los angeles to try their lamb. it was so good, i nearly cried.\n\nall the food is delicious, we tried things from every portion of the menu: portobello mushroom fries, burrata (cheese), charcuterie plate (assorted pates and deli meats), pepper fries, arugula salad, cauliflower with spices, the <mark>Hanger Steak</mark> sandwich (super good!), and even some of their ice cream desserts. everything is made from scratch including all sauces, breads, deli meats, and desserts. they are primarily a butcher shop, so you can expect the highest quality of meat compared to anywhere. their signature cut of beef is the <mark>Hanger Steak</mark>, which is not easy to get at most places because a single cow only yields a few ounces of it. yet e&r has it at the ready and at a good price.\n\nthe service is good, it's much like fine dining with a team of very courteous people flying around the table, each with their designated tasks. the thing t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> win you over is the value. you get the same (if not better) food quality you would expect from a place like spago or mastro's, but it's half the price. yes, half.\n\nif there has to be a negative, it's t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'s a ways off of the vegas strip. about 15 miles (20 min) separates e&r from your favorite strip hotel, but in light of that, there's a valuable thing i learned by going here. the best food you can find in any city is intended for local customers, not tourists. so get away from the sparkly lights and overpriced, mediocre buffets and taste something so good, it might bring tears to your eyes!", 
            "i have been here several times now for both brunch and dinner. whenever i go, the service is always the same - perfect. from the moment you sit down until you leave, you are greeted promptly with a smiling face. i always get the steak hash for brunch time and <mark>Hanger Steak</mark> for dinner. the <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark> are really good too - the sauce they use is so good. the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> and corn are also delicious. the bathroom hand soap/scrub is amazing - i even bought a couple mason jars of it. it leaves your hand so moisturized and soft. please wash your hands haha", 
            "awesome restaurant.  we have been here for brunch, lunch and dinner and each meal has always been amazing!!  we love the atmosphere; it is relaxing and they have a great outdoor patio too!!!  brunch offers a great menu and <mark>Bottomless Mimosas</mark> for $16, which is a great deal and worth the drive from henderson.  the service is outstanding and your beverage is never empty!!  we usually ask for kendra's section if we can....she is the best!!!  our favorites for brunch are the portobello mushroom fries, the <mark>Fried Spinach</mark> salad, the short rib hash, quiche or the <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> with short rib and gruyere!!  yum!!!  the steaks are also great and they double as a butcher downstairs so you can take your favorite cuts to go and cook them at home too.  the spencer and the <mark>Hanger Steak</mark> were both very flavorful but i am sure all of the steaks are great!!  we can't wait to get back in there to try the rest of them!!", 
            "echo & rig you cannot go wrong here with the food, i have dined several times and sat in the bar area and had appetizers. sometimes the bar service can be spotty if you are seated at a table, but the food always makes up for service, and other times the service is excellent.\n\nmy last three meals i have had the <mark>Hanger Steak</mark> and it never disappoints, it is flavorful and tender, in fact my mom who had ordered the filet regretted her choice. the fried portabella mushrooms are a favorite and always disappear quick. my meal came with mushrooms rockefeller and were wonderful. i can no longer eat gluten so many of these sides i need to scrape of the toppings but i will not hold my dietary limitations. the dessert we had an assortment of sorbets and they were outstanding. our waiter overheard it was our birthday and delivered it with a candle and a great smile. he was attentive for our needs and was a great server, i wish i remembered his name. he was latin and worked may 9th.\n\nthe dining room with its marble floors and high ceilings can be a little noisy. we requested to sit outside and they were able to accommodate us and it was absolutely wonderful. the setting is beautiful and weather permitting, it will be my first choice.\n\ni also love their wine list, be sure to check it out online, it is not only extensive, but there are many options including ordering a half glass and i appreciate this when i am trying new wines or do not want a full glass. very nice touch. i also love they have an great selection of sides, one can graze and be very satisfied.\n\necho and rig has figured it out, blending high end dining to keeping the cpst reasonable with their options and always having great food!", 
            "wowed last night by echo & rig's <mark>Stella</mark> dinner performance for our party of 4. we all received generous and fair cuts of steak - i was stuffed after my 'standard 12oz' rib-eye. side dishes were standouts, as always - the heirloom carrots, spicy cauliflower, and garlic mashed potatoes were all perfectly seasoned.\n\neveryone at the table got a steak. filet mignon and <mark>Hanger Steak</mark> came out great as well.\n\nincredible service as always. servers know the menu up and down and inside and out. if you describe w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'re feeling like eating but don't know exactly w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> order, they will quickly tailor a custom order for you. i love that.\n\nhuge fan. the rat pack would dig this joint! as good as it gets - and certainly for a steak lovin' town like vegas!\n\nthe *only* thing i might address/change at the restaurant is the super bright fluorescent kitchen lights t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> it hard to sit facing the kitchen while seating in the upstairs dining room at night. not the best setup for great ambience..."

            "let me start by saying i only take the time to review a restaurant if it's worth reviewing.  t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> said, echo & rig, culinary-wise, might just be in my top 3 favorite restaurants in las vegas.  their downfall is 80% of the staff and service! \n\ni started going there a couple if months ago and my first experience was amazing!! since january i have been back at least 10 times and have been disappointed most of those times.  i return because the food is t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> (t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>, if i receive it, or if the kitchen staff cares to sear the meat right). \nfirst time i went, it was during lunch.  the server was casual but his recommendations were spot on.  lunch was delicious and server was helpful friendly.\n\nreturned several times after that (a couple nights back to back).  there are two evening hostesses t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> remember us, which makes us feel welcome.  however the staff upstairs acted too busy or were overwhelmed with tables.  only a few times we were offered bread when we sat.  offered the cuts of the house only once since i've been there.  once they mixed the sparkling water with the still water.  found a hair in our soup and they did nothing but take it off the check, did not offer a replacement or an apology.  one waiter made us feel bad about not ordering an alcoholic beverage.  waiters seem rushed or impatient.  management seems unconcerned.  complained to a manager who did absolutely nothing and appeared completely uninterested.\n\nwent for lunch once and, i kid you not, there were approximately 4 other tables there.  ordered the portabello fries (yum by the way) had a view of the kitchen and watched as it sat for 30 min while i ate the rest of my meal, all the while the cooks, waitstaff and management walked past it many times without a single person commenting who's dish was sitting out under the warmer.  also asked for a coke, which didn't arrive.  at the end of the meal (fries still up in the warmer) i was presented with a check t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> had the fries and coke.  mind you there were only 4 other tables present. \n\nalso have issues with getting my table bussed, usually plates pile up before someone comes and clears them.  also they'll take your silverware before you're even done.  \n\npositive notes: food is amazing.  flat iron steak is my favorite and 9 out of 10 times it's seared right and cooked perfectly.  portabello fries are always a favorite, carne asada bone marrow delish.  love the grilled octopus but every so often it's tough.  black spaghetti used to be my favorite until they changed the scallops to mussels.  crispy bacon is decadent.  <mark>Ultimate BLT</mark> was one of the first things i tried and nothing short of amazing but have had it since and it didn't quite measure up (the bread seemed old).  decent wine selection, <mark>White Peach Sangria</mark> is tasty, cocktail selection is ok.  they used to have a chaucuterie board t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> really good but i no longer see on their menu.  downstairs has fresh squeezed juices t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> should put at least on their lunch menu, i am always curious about them but never know w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> have.  steaks are amazing, i have had several different cuts and all are tender and delicious (they should be, they're a butchery!) and prices are great, especially compared to a steak house on the strip.  all their meats or all natural grass fed.\n\nhave been hesitant to return because of service, have returned solely because of the food, only 2 stars because of overall experience.  this restaurant definitely deserves better.", 
            "great dinner at echo & rig - excellent food and amazing service from brian.  started with three great appetizers... portobella fries (very flavorful breading), tomato watermelon salad (nice light dressing) and lamb cigars (with pickled onions and tzatziki sauce).\n\nmain entrees were the ribeye (nicely seasoned and prepared), porterhouse (so tender you could cut it with a fork and big enough for two) and... the surprise of the evening... the <mark>Ultimate BLT</mark> was amazing.. probably the best blt i've ever tasted. of the steak sauces... i liked the charred onion best, but the table favorite was brandied mushroom\n\nfinished with the caramel turtle sundae... really good, but would have been better without the peanut brittle pieces.\n\nall in all... a great dinner experience!"

            "3 stars for the food! we will get to the service later...\n\nstarted out with the mache salad. o-m-g. it was sooo good. consisting of avocado, mache, celery, <mark>Roasted Chicken</mark>, and green onions. and only god knows the recipe to this slad dressing. \nthen we had a few apps.\nfavorite- burrata, english peas, mint and onions. i will make this my personal goal to replicate this dish. it was so light and fresh. sometimes burrata can me on the oily side, not here! it was perfect fluffy. so delish\nfried calamari- i only had a few bites because of my gluten issue but wow these were amazing. \ngrilled shrimp and scallop ceviche- this was pretty good as well.\n\nfor dinner my boyfriend and i each ordered a different steak. i had the filet and he had the spencer. i must say, the spencer won. w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> amazing cut of meat. after going 2 years without a bite or red meat im pretty happy i chose this meal to break my no red meat diet. when i saw this piece of beef melts in your mouth.. im serious. accompanied with their house chips this dish was pretty outstanding. we also had the horseradish creme to go a long with it. yum! \nand the wine... wow. we had about 6 bottles for the table of the emblem cab. this wine went perfect with everything. it was so drinkable.. too drinkable. i highly suggest it.\n\nim going to keep the \"bad\" short and sweet since the meal itself was so amazing. jason, our server was a total amateur. my bf and i had to wait to eat anything because he didnt know if there were nuts in anything the table ordered. since we shared everything family style almost everyone was done with sides/apps/salads before we were able to start eating. it was very frustrating. next time we come in it will probably be to sit at the bar instead. and when i asked to see the manager (because i actually knew him) jason said he told him to come over. this ended up not true at all. \n\nother then t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> meal was amazing. i highly recommend this place over any other in tivoli village... or summerlin for t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>.", 
            "echo & rig = one of my favorites in vegas!!!\n\nmy boyfriend and i happened to walk by this restaurant a few months ago and were intrigued by the fresh meat and butchering demonstrations in the window. we went in and met the butcher / chef. aaron and he was very friendly and informative. he even gave us a personalized crock pot receipe and some fresh ingredients!\n\nafter that, we knew we had to go back and try the dining experience. we went back this weekend and there was a 40 minute wait, but it flew by. we enjoyed a glass of wine at the bar downstairs and c<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> with the aaron again while he was breaking down some meat for the evening. \n\nnow for the food - - amazing! first we started with the sausage and peppers and the portabella fries. now, i don't like mushrooms but the waitress said we had to try them so we did and they were great! the breadding was light and crunchy and not at all greasy and the dipping sauce complimented them superbly. for entrees my boyfriend had the new coulotte steak and i had the <mark>Roasted Chicken</mark> sandwich (i know, i know a sandwich at a steak place? but the balsamic onions had me at hello). for sides we had the cauliflower and fries. the steak was scrumptous, perfect crust with just the right amount of seasoning to let the natural flavor of the meat shine. the cauliflower was unlike any vegetable i have ever had. it was sweet and spicy and all the different flavors popped in my mouth with each bite. a must try! the sandwich was great too - the bread was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside and the onions, arugula and onions merried perfectly with the chicken. \n\nwe brought in our own wine to take advantage of free corkage so the total bill was only $60!! we couldn't belive it. for food t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> its own against some of the steak greats like mastros, flemmings and mortons the value was unlike any other. one of the best restaurant experiences in vegas!", 
            "i can sum up this place in one word...wow! we came here for a rehearsal dinner prior to a wedding so the menu was picked out for us. every single thing we tried was like heaven on a plate. we had the lamb cigars & tzatziki sauce, kennebec salt & pepper fries, and <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> & herb aioli for starters. absolutely delicious! i highly recommend the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>...even if you are not a mushroom fan, these simply melt in your mouth.\n\nfor the main meal, we had the <mark>Roasted Chicken</mark> and tomahawk chop. wow wow wow...you might think chicken is boring, but without trying to sound cliche, this was literally the most delicious piece of chicken i have ever had. the tomahawk chop looked very rare, but it was sooooo tender and delicious. please do not eat this with steak sauce...it is meant to be enjoyed as is!\n\nthe only disappointment was the dessert. while it wasn't bad (how can dessert be bad??), it just didn't have t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> factor. but hey, this is a chophouse...so enjoy the meat!\n\none of the best meals i've ever had. if i was going to die tomorrow, i would want my last meal to come from echo & rig.", 
            "a good steakhouse in the 'burbs is rare, so echo and rig can easily lay claim to being one of the best. located in the perennially empty tivoli village, the modern, open two-story space features a butcher shop and bar on the first level and the main dining room and patio on the second. \n\nthe menu is dominated by appetizers and small plates. the best of the bunch might be the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> ($9.80) with their crispy, crunchy fried exterior. if you like fried foods, try the lamb cigars ($8.10) too. a thin, crispy egg roll-like wrapper covers a savory lamb mixture and is accompanied by a tzatziki sauce. less successful was an excessively oily gratin ($5.90) full of caramelized onions, roasted pumpkin squash, sage and gruyere. you may want to avoid the steak tartare ($8.10) as well. not only is it the least appetizing looking dish there, the mushy texture made it doubly unappealing. \n\ncraving a salad? they've got some good ones, like a kale salad ($8) with baby yellow beets, <mark>Toast</mark> hazelnuts, goat cheese and a citrus vinaigrette. if you want one with a little more substance the arugula salad comes with plenty of prosciutto and is large enough for two to share.\n\nas for main entrees, the spencer steak ($27.70) is a solid choice. it's a prime grade, center cut rib eye t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> a modest amount of charring and a savoriness t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> enhanced by their mushroom sauce -- a rich and earthy accompaniment t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> their other complimentary sauces.\n\nbrussels sprouts are all the rage these days, and their version ($8.10) was enhanced with pistachios t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> a nice crunch and salinity to the dish. even better was a grilled summer corn ($5.90) dish showcasing a char and smokiness t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> me of eating corn on the cob straight from the grill, but without the mess or random kernels stuck in between my teeth.\n\nnot to be overlooked is their <mark>Butcher Blend Burger</mark> ($12.40) - a great savory and juicy blend of chuck and brisket. topped with lettuce, tomato, red onions, and the optional sharp cheddar cheese, it's a simple burger that's well proportioned and executed beautifully.\n\nthey don't have a kid's menu, but were happy to strip down their <mark>Roasted Chicken</mark> sandwich ($12) to accommodate my son's tastes -- chicken and cheese on ciabatta.\n\nprices are reasonable for their location and while it's on the higher end of the spectrum of w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> may want to pay off strip, the solid and safe menu makes it a sure bet for most diners.", 
            "i should be biased to be writing a review of a steakhouse since i'm not one to love steak. anyways, this place alone deserves the greatest praise for customer service. customer service is everything when it comes to dining in to a fancy restaurant. a group of us were here for dinner during our last weekend in vegas as suggested by our friends who live here to try this place out as it raves awesome reviews. \n\nfrom beginning to end, service was impressive. the waiter offered us water (with a complimentary choice of still or sparkling) all around and the way t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> all presented themselves in pouring our drinks were quite the service. our waters were constantly filled even when it was only half way. they even poured the rest of my cider when i drank just enough to fill up my cup again. the waiter who served us brought different cuts of meat and explained the different types of meats we could get. he offered recommendations as well to preferences we may have had. very informative to any questions we had. \n\neveryone else on my table got steak but me of course. i got the <mark>Roasted Chicken</mark> sandwich with a side of <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> & herb aioli. all our entrees came with potato chips as a side. as much as i love potato chips, these were too salty for me. the chicken was tasty, the sauces made the sandwich more flavorful. the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> is a must! it was really good with the aoli sauce t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> the perfectly battered crisp fries.  it was the highlight of my meal. it has a unique taste to it but its full of flavor. \n\nbut really, if you're a steak lover, this would be the place for you as it's well known for their steak cuts. they also came out with a complimentary dessert for our friend who was celebrating her birthday and so we all sang for her. i would recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a nice place and atmosphere to celebrate something special. \n\nbtw, use the sea salt scrub in the bathroom, it's makes your skin so soft! fancy bathroom for a fancy restaurant. the view outside overlooked the big beautiful christmas tree out in the courtyard. go outside and take a picture as it makes for a great background during the holidays!"

            "one of the best things about this place is the pricing compared to steakhouses on the on the strip. its also a great place in t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'s a steakhouse but it also has other items, great for couples where one enjoys a good steak and the other is less of a carnivore!\n\nthe service was great and the hostess immediately asked if it was our first time or if we were celebrating something special. yes to the first, no to the second. but t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was clearly passed on, as our waited and a manager-type both acknowledged t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> had not been in before and took the time to explain the menu/food/ect. so there is a long line of communication going on between employees and that's a good thing. \n\nnow to the food: \n\nshort-rib <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> - order it! just do it. it comes with thick bread, egg battered and then grilled with tender, savory short-rib meat, gruyere cheese and white cheddar. it's savory, flavorful and filling. \n\nribeye - i'm not much of a steak eater, but i enjoyed the seasoning and flavors of this steak and the way it was cooked. \n\ngarlic chips - come with each entree and are the classic home-made style of kettle cooked potato chips. they are salty and garlicky and good. \n\nmac and cheese - pretty standard. creamy with breadcrumbs on the top. not the best mac and cheese you've ever had, but still good. \n\nbrocillini - pretty basic, but good. \n\nlamb cigars - almost like an eggroll, but with lamb filling. unique but worth trying. i could have done with out the wrapping and just had the strips of meat, but the eggroll aspect did give it a unique flavor and style t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> haven't had before. \n\nbaked brie - i'd probably skip next time. i love cheeses but this brie did not have much flavor and the bread was over cooked. just wasn't my favorite. \n\neach of those items plus a bottle of wine and the bill was about $150 which is a nice price when you compare it to w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> would pay at a steakhouse on the strip. the menu is large enough t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> could go back several times and never order the same thing. the service was great, food was high quality and well prepared and the atmosphere was nice.", 
            "awesome restaurant.  we have been here for brunch, lunch and dinner and each meal has always been amazing!!  we love the atmosphere; it is relaxing and they have a great outdoor patio too!!!  brunch offers a great menu and <mark>Bottomless Mimosas</mark> for $16, which is a great deal and worth the drive from henderson.  the service is outstanding and your beverage is never empty!!  we usually ask for kendra's section if we can....she is the best!!!  our favorites for brunch are the portobello mushroom fries, the <mark>Fried Spinach</mark> salad, the short rib hash, quiche or the <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> with short rib and gruyere!!  yum!!!  the steaks are also great and they double as a butcher downstairs so you can take your favorite cuts to go and cook them at home too.  the spencer and the <mark>Hanger Steak</mark> were both very flavorful but i am sure all of the steaks are great!!  we can't wait to get back in there to try the rest of them!!",

at a mere fraction of the cost.\n\nnow approaching its third year in business, and outlasting concepts from several more 'celebrated' chefs with nearly universal accolades arriving from locals since opening its doors, echo & rig pairs the all-too-common farm-to-table concept with in-house butchery in the style of a steakhouse and leveraging the later knowledge of sourcing and artisan cuts to curtail costs the restaurant happily outstrips the likes of nearby flemming's while retaining a local sort of feel, the two-story building upscale yet extremely comfortable with a feel t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> welcoming whether one is seated in a jacket inside or sporting sandals with a glass of wine in hand under misters on the second-floor patio outdoors.\n\nadmittedly known to the restaurant as a result of reaching out to management with questions regarding the concept and thoughts pertaining to the echo & rig's longterm success in a complex where little else has thrived, it was on arrival t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> party was escorted to a sizeable four-top at the top of the stairs and greeted by a handful of the restaurant's sizable staff the evening started out with a comprehensive rundown of the menu followed by a complimentary plate of housemade charcuterie joining warm bread and butter as cocktails were sipped and an order was put forth.\n\nserved largely by a man named brian, first described as the restaurant's best waiter and later as a 'brand ambassador,' it was not long after ordering a first course of food t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> plates began to arrive and treated to a bowl of crispy cauliflower tinged in spice along with the items t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'d ordered one would be hard pressed to name a single bite t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> not shine, the signature <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> probably the weakest of the items as seasoning seemed to obscure more earthy notes while both the housemade sausage and ricotta with fruit and honey were entirely irresistible, the same to be said of vegetables t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> simple yet satisfying while the '<mark>Grilled Cheese</mark>' was every bit the crowd pleaser t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> would contend.\n\nalready questioning an order t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> quite large when accounting for portion sizes and enticing presentations t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> it difficult to resist finishing each plate, entrees saw four prime proteins paired to a trio of sides and although the \"santa maria rub\" unfortunately served only to overwhelm one friend's tri-tip, the quality of an enormous pounded pork cutlet and both the spencer as well as the cap were undeniable, the sides a bit of a mixed bag with both corn and potatoes pleasant amidst their accoutrements while the mac & cheese featuring \"seven cheeses\" was nothing more than run of the mill.\n\nunfortunately short-selling on desserts, an odd choice for a place going so far as to bake their own bread, it was in a duo of sundaes t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> bites were invested and although both were well comprised of high quality ingredients one can't help but wonder how much better the experience could be with a dedicated pastry chef, or even a cheese board considering the fact t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> brie is featured amongst the side plates while candied fruits served with the ricotta were also quite good.",

            "visiting the area and staying at the jw marriott, we were seeking a unique place to enjoy a birthday dinner. on a suggestion, we decided on echo & rig and so very glad we did! \n\nconveniently located with valet service, this butcher shop/restaurant was an instant hit when we walked in the door. an open concept with a trendy feel, the immediate impression from the receptionists were warm and welcoming!\n\nwe sat at the bar for pre dinner drinks and enjoyed a sampling of the homemade beef jerky! it was fantastic! \n\nwe requested a balcony table because the inside seating was rather loud. we hoped to hear each other throughout the dining experience and it would be a challenge inside.\n\nbecause we asked for balcony, we had to wait a bit longer but we didn't care. the bar drinks, jerky and conversation were keeping a smile on all of our faces. nevertheless, the manager approached us to apologize and presented us with complementary appetizers - tuna poke and watermelon & cucumber salad. both were so light, fresh, and awesome! \n\nnow i was even more excited about dinner!\n\nwe sat down and our waiters were attentive, funny, and professional - we could tell things were only going to get better. \n\nthen, the waiter did it. he brought a wooden tray t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> the massive cuts of beef available for purchase and boy, were they pretty!  the menu was loaded with so many tasty looking things we decided to make a buffer between the 4 of us. \n\nwe ordered a 40oz steak which arrived on the bone and was cooked perfectly! our table also held all of the following: bone marrow, risotto, <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark>, <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark>, brussels sprouts, stuffed mushrooms, grilled corn, and bottles of wine. everything was fantastic!\n\ni would definitely return! w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> fun dining experience with a great view and table setting. awesome service from everyone we met as soon as we walked in the door.  only downfall - noise level inside, but t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'t keep me away if we are in the area again. that <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> with braised short ribs is calling my name!!",

            "their butcher stand is located on the main floor along with a small bar, charcuterie stand and hostess area. you have to wait in this awkwardly laid out area with not enough seats for the hostesses to run up and down the stairs to the main seating area of the restaurant, one party at a time. my visit was on a quiet saturday afternoon, yet we still managed to wait a solid 10 minutes to be seated with only two parties ahead of us. when we got upstairs i was pretty confused by how long we had to wait based on how empty the dining room was, hopefully they figured out a better system during busy hours! then our waiter took the orders for the 10 person table near us and disappeared for a good 5 minutes before finally coming back to take our drink and food orders at the same time. plus we pointed out t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> of our water glasses were dirty so he swapped them with two from the table next to us, which got immediately placed back into t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> setting. yum! the dining room is a bit strange, very minimally decorated and doesn't seem too thought out. their brunch menu is fairly decent, with a handful of salads, sandwiches, breakfasts, small plates and sides. there is a different dinner menu t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> slightly different. i would also note t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> burger is listed under the sandwiches section, for those t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'t think a burger is a sandwich...\n\ntheir burger, in this case the <mark>Butcher Blend Burger</mark>, comes with usda prime beef, bibb lettuce, brandywine tomato and red onion. the bun was a little dry, but the meat was cooked to medium rare as ordered so it wasn't much of an issue. if this was a well done burger it would have been a vacuum of moisture. the meat had excellent flavor; it was very juicy, peppery and delicious. you could definitely tell this wasn't cooked with a frozen, pre-made patty. the sharp cheddar i added was flavorful and melted well, the tomato was colorful but didn't have a strong presence with the meat and oniony mystery base under the patty. i'm not quite sure w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was as t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'t a listed item on the menu, but it was quite tasty.\n\nsadly the burger comes with chips, fries would have been extra. the chips were good; crunchy and of your kettle variety but not the fries i want with a good burger. overall this was a pretty great deal for $12, but could have been way better with fries instead of chips. w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> this not such a great meal was the experience at the beginning and our service overall. i <mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> to say it but our waiter sucked, he was non-existent for much of our meal, never took away our table setup plates so our two-person table was a little crowded, and we sat for a full 10 minutes after our meals were done before he returned. we spotted him rolling silverware in the kitchen area while we sat around, and all the managers were having a little powwow to the side. the food seemed pretty good, but service like this is unacceptable even during quiet hours. i would probably have given my burger a better score based on the quality, but we walked out with such a bad feeling after this t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> have to go by my overall experience. if you're in this area and want a great burger, stick with honey salt.",

            "great spot for fine dining off the strip.  i've had dinner or lunch here multiple times, and the food is fantastic.  great steaks, the spicy cauliflower side is excellent, and the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> made my mom and i get into an argument over who got the last one.  the sandwiches at lunch can tend to be greasy, but they are delicious (especially the <mark>Drunken Goat</mark>).\n\nbut, the restaurant is not my favorite thing about this place.  the butcher shop is.  we come here to get all of our steaks.  the butchers are so nice, helpful, and friendly.  they make some excellent rillette if you can catch it before it sells out!  the steaks are high quality, and not much more expensive than buying them at the grocery store.\n\none other note: we have ordered thanksgiving to-go twice from them, and it is convenient, fast, and delicious.  i like how everything is ready to go for you, but you still get the \"thanksgiving smell\" like you've been cooking all day when you stick the bird in the oven to fully cook it.\n\ni took off a star for some small things t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> me, but may not bother others: i'm not a big fan of their cocktail list (but i like their wine list), the restaurant tends to get very loud (so i always sit on the patio when able), and sometimes i feel like we have 6 waiters because so many people come to the table to take orders and say hello (it's a bit overbearing for me, but i bet some people like all the service).", 
            "there aren't many places t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> my socks off or blow my hair back...but this is one of them. the ambiance is top notch for a new age bar with a classic and sophisticated vibe. \n\ni figured t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> to a butcher/meat restaurant t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> would be looking for a steak or a sandwich with some meat on it. i asked my waiter (who pretty much lived up to every  expectation t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'ve ever had of a waiter, his name was jeffrey and he's worth requesting) w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> favorite sandwich was. he admits t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was a meat junky but his favorite sandwich was the <mark>Drunken Goat</mark> and it didn't even have meat on it. it was legit and worth the drive from downtown las vegas. the brussel sprouts and the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> were great. the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> are a super up version of salt, cheese, and lightly battered shrooms that, once dipped in the aoli sauce will leave you wishing you had more...and for $5, com'on man!!!", 
            "my first time here was amazing! this place definitely had wow service! my servers name was nan and she was so nice she even told us stories and was super friendly. the manager xavier took really good care of us. the food was great i ordered the <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> with ribs and my friend ordered the <mark>Drunken Goat</mark> sandwich all food was great. the bathroom was phenomenal it had a salt scrub t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> your skin feel so soft. the server even boxed up our left overs for us. i literally had zero complaints and it was such a beautiful day to sit outside. if i could give this place more stars i would. i would def recommend. i was there for probably 2 more hours than i expected that's how great the atmosphere was.", 
            "love the food,drinks and atmosphere at echo! patio is chill for more intimate setting especially during summer evenings. bruch on sat. & sun. is great with an option of <mark>Bottomless Mimosas</mark>! my fave food here are the little bites: brussels sprouts,cauliflower, bacon with bbq sauce and a must have are <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> sandwich with shredded short rib along with 7+ different types of cheese! also a vegetarian fave sandwich of mine is the <mark>Drunken Goat</mark>!!", 
            "as always loved the food and service here. the <mark>Drunken Goat</mark> sammy is amazing. irvin as our waiter took spectacular care of us, made us laugh, kept the champagne glasses full and brought an amazing birthday dessert. successful sunday brunch", 
            "my best friend and i flew out to las vegas for the rock n roll half marathon, and this restaurant was recommended to us for our day trip out to red rock canyon. absolutely the best food we've enjoyed this entire week! i had the wild mushroom soup and blt.. my friend had the <mark>Drunken Goat</mark> and we split the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>. everything was so delicious, it's difficult to even name a favorite. nothing lacked flavor and the service was outstanding. our waiter took his time sharing details about the food to us to help us chose our menu items. if you're ever in the area, please stop by! not to mention, the area and restaurant are absolutely stunning."

            "a friend was visiting from out of town and she wanted to have brunch with a couple other friends from college. we didn't realize it would be such a busy weekend and parking was tricky, but fortunately, the restaurant was still quiet. i was able to make a reservation via phone a couple days prior to our visit.\n\nthe space is beautiful. you enter downstairs with a bar on the left and their butcher shop on the right. i love t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'re able to watch the chefs work with the meats as you walk in. the host stand is located on the right as well and you're lead via elevator or stairs to the second floor. the dining room is bordered with floor-to-ceiling windows allowing a view of their outdoor patio and the center of tivoli village. there is also a beautiful chandelier above the stairs and an open kitchen.\n\ni ordered the <mark>Steak Frites</mark> ($21) and was pleased t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> came with ribeye, my favorite cut of steak. it was also served with a roasted tomato, fries, and bearnaise sauce (or sunny side-up eggs upon request). when i initially read the menu, i didn't realize the eggs were to replace the bearnaise sauce (i thought it was an addition). i didn't miss the sauce, but i wonder if it may have changed my experience with the steak. \n\ni ordered \"rare plus\" for the ribeye and it was more on the rare side. i was disappointed, but it's still much better than having it overcooked! either way, i was sorely disappointed with my steak. it lacked proper seasoning. also, it had so much sinew and/or gristle t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> (obviously) made it very difficult to eat!! i couldn't believe it. a reputable steakhouse? i was expecting nothing short of perfect. it wasn't the worst steak i've had at a restaurant, but i've never been served one t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> so difficult to cut or chew.\n\ni contemplated ordering the short rib hash and after seeing photos of it, i definitely made the wrong choice. it's hard to forgive the steak mishap, however, i am possibly willing to try other dishes (not steak), since everyone seems to love this place so much.", 
            "i said i'd give them another chance, i did, and it warrants a new review and additional star.\n\nmy visit was for brunch again and this experience was much better. i didn't have a reservation this time, but the hostess was very enthusiastic about seating us and gave us a 15-minute wait (we received a table within this time frame, however, we were not given an option to sit outside). \n\n<mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> benedict ($17): smoked wild salmon, poached eggs, cr\\u00e8me fra\\u00eeche, red onion, saut\\u00e9ed spinach, and hollandaise sauce on <mark>Potato Pancakes</mark>. the elements of this dish were good, but there were issues. the spinach was a tad salty and the flavor managed to overpower the salmon. the menu says 'saut\\u00e9ed greens,' so they may serve something besides spinach t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> complement the salmon more? we really didn't like the spinach with the <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark>. so, i just ate them separately. the hollandaise was fantastic. the <mark>Potato Pancakes</mark> were all right. it seemed like they were just piles of hash brown. also, i'm not sure w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>, but i didn't see any cr\\u00e8me fra\\u00eeche or red onion..?\n\nshort rib hash ($15): prime short rib, yukon gold potatoes, bell peppers, shallots, herbs, two poached eggs, and smoked paprika hollandaise sauce. great hash! w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> it was the delicious hollandaise with the smoked paprika - it added nice flavor. the diced potatoes were perfect and the short rib was very tender.\n\nwe had some small plates as well and they were really wonderful. i highly recommend ordering them and i'd love to try the others during another visit.\n\n<mark>Portobello Fries</mark> ($9) with a herb a\\u00efoli. if you fell in love with these fries at bottega louie in l.a., you'll be thrilled t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> have them in vegas now! i love the large cuts of portobello, the light and flavorful batter, and the great a\\u00efoli t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> it all together. yum!\n\n<mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark> ($9) served with red pepper coulis and lime wedge. this is one of the best <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark> i've had and i loved the coulis with it. the cake has a light cornmeal exterior and large chucks of crab meat. great flavors. you'll wish there was more than one cake per order!\n\nthe 1/2-inch <mark>1/2-inch Thick Grilled Bacon</mark> ($8) is amazing. it comes with a housemade bbq sauce and trust me, you don't need it! the bacon has the best of both worlds - smoking and grilling. the two flavors mend together to make a really tasty piece of meat.\n\nservice was great, as it was last time. waters refilled frequently and many check-ups from our server. we had a great time. also, the food was delicious and satisfying. i certainly enjoy this spot for brunch for its atmosphere and fun sharing dishes. i'd love to dine on the outdoor patio. perhaps i'll even brave another steak and/or dinner in the future.\n\nside note: the '<mark>Steak Frites</mark>' is now served with new york strip rather than ribeye (online menu does not reflect this change yet). i'm not a fan of ny strip, however, it may be a better fit for this particular dish seeing t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> did not enjoy the ribeye i was served during my previous visit.", 
            "a friend suggested checking out echo when i was in vegas recently, and looking for any reason to get off of the strip, i happily went. so glad i did! the first thing i noticed is how pleasant the staff is. beth, the manager; even came to our table and introduced herself and checked up on everything. our server was roland, who was absolutely great, he knew everything about the menu, and was more than happy to give us his suggestions when we couldn't figure out w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> we wanted to try and it didn't hurt t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was a total hottie. there were five of us at the table and we all ordered different menu items and tried each one. everything was delicious, literally no complaints. i personally had the <mark>Steak Frites</mark>, and it came out perfect. i'm not normally the type to have steak during brunch but i'm so glad i did this time. the atmosphere is light and airy, and the patio seating was so nice. i would absolutely recommend echo & rig to everyone i know."

            "if things couldn't get any tastier at my favorite restaurant in vegas--echo & rig--they did.  brunch has begun as of october 5th and offerings such as <mark>Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes</mark>, short rib hash, and an all-american breakfast keep things simple.  echo & rig keeps the menu succinct so guests can determine w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> eat without the hassle of running through five pages of options.  each dish has explosive flavor, is presented beautifully, and with perfect portion sizes no one leaves hungry.  side orders of toast, bacon, and eggs are available as well.\ni found t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> a nice martini with my meal out on their gorgeous patio made saturday brunch even better.  we went through half of the cocktail menu, starting with a kentucky peachtree and a french kiss.\n\nboth drinks were a perfect start to the meal.  when the food arrived we were excited.  i ordered <mark>Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes</mark> with orange-infused syrup.\n\nthese pancakes are like pillows wrapping blueberries within each one ever so gently.  i used the whipped butter and syrup on top, taking my time to each all four pancakes.  with a cocktail on the side, it was a perfect meal. \n\nmy husband had their special short rib has with poached eggs topped with a southwestern sauce.\n\nthe short ribs were shredded and tossed with the hash.  once he broke into the perfectly poached eggs and stirred it around, the flavors and textures were too good to be true.  he had to give our server a high five for this suggestion.  when he finished, the entire bowl was empty and he came very close to picking it up in public to lick it.\n\nwe ended with one last cocktail for dessert--the strawberry bliss--then headed out to the farmers market to pick up some fruits and vegetables.  overall, brunch at echo & rig is a winner, one t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> hope to frequent every weekend.  with brunch starting at 9am sharp through 3pm, you can still sleep in from friday night's party and make it on time to have some hash or pancakes with a cocktail or two.  this is a must on anyone's breakfast list.  with their special <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> available on their brunch menu, salads, soups, and other dishes, you can still have your favorite small plates before 11am.  set t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>, get up at 9am, and grab a table on the patio at echo & rig this weekend.  ask for nan.  she's one of the best servers there.\n\nhappy eating.", 
            "service was great, atmosphere was warm and inviting. i will come back for dinner, but never again for brunch. i had the <mark>Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes</mark>, very tart. the server suggested them, and made them sound amazing. they are made with ricotta (couldn't tell), lemon zest (way too much), and blueberries. because of the tartness of the zest and the blueberries, the pancakes were hard to eat. i literally had to drown them in syrup to sweeten them up, and i don't like doing that. the star of meal was the bacon and homemade bbq sauce. i was hoping to have a sweet pancake and a salty bacon combo, but the pancakes didn't come through. partially my fault, don't go to butcher house and order pancakes. my date said the hollandaise was bland as well. i will come back and have a sandwich, they looked great! i am also interested in their dinner menu and they late night bar specials.", 
            "had <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> listed on the menu with three different kinds of cheese - i only wanted cheddar, they wouldn't accommodate me. how can you screw up something so simple and basic as a <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark>? reach for 'one' kind of cheese when you make it? why was t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> hard to understand? i felt ridiculous trying to understand why they couldn't do it? it was a scene right out of \"five easy pieces.\" in the end, i ordered something i didn't want and it was a unpleasant experience all around. i may try it again for their steaks, but as for brunch, i'll pass.  but, the <mark>Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes</mark> i tried off my nephew, was delicious.", 
            "i really like this place. a couple of friends and i came here for brunch on sunday. \n\nupon entering the lobby area, the butcher shop was on the right, and the hostess and bar, to the left. i loved the modern-rustic decor and the ambiance of the place. we were seated upstairs in the loft. there are elevators to the right, if you do not want to take the stairs. there is also balcony seating, but a bit too windy for me, so inside was nice. \n\nwe had the <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> benedict, <mark>Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes</mark>, the waffle, and a side of the 1/2-inch <mark>1/2-inch Thick Grilled Bacon</mark>. everything was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious! the only complaint would be the bloody mary; it was a bit too bland for me. they could probably spruce it up by adding a square piece of bacon with the olive. they are a butcher shop, after all. anyway, service was very good and there was a \"brand ambassador\" walking around making sure guests were happy (i think that's code for general manager). overall, i recommend this place and look forward to coming back for dinner. i can't wait to try their steaks!", 
            "this place is the ultimate spot for lunch or dinner, but their brunch is out of this world. \n\nthe brunch menu offers both savory and sweet options, from benedicts to <mark>Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes</mark>. i started my order with a classic bloody mary (a bloody mary isn't on the menu but they will make one for you t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> fresh and still has a great kick.) we also ordered the restaurants <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> served with a herb aioli ($9) as a starter. the fries are a signature item for the spot and they go through more portobello mushrooms than any other restaurant in las vegas. the breading was light and the mushrooms were sliced at a great size, plus i'm a sucker for any aioli.\n\nin addition to being a restaurant echo & rig is also a butcher shop which made savory an easy decision for my main brunch plate. i decided on the short rib hash ($15) and i was so glad i did. the short rib was perfectly cooked and the potatoes and peppers were diced to the perfect consistency. plus the hollandaise sauce had a dash of paprika on top which i was obsessed with. my friend got the same hash as me and my other friend got the <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> ($12) which was also stuffed with short rib and was equally unreal.  \n\ni capped off brunch with a final cocktail from their signature cocktail menu. i got the echo gimlet ($9) which was beyond refreshing, sweet and delicious! it was a vodka based cocktail with peach and mint, definitely one of the better cocktails i've had in my brunch explorations. they also offer bottomless bubbly ($16) if that's your thing, which it totally should be.\n\nif it's a beautiful day (hello, las vegas) take advantage of their outdoor balcony seating offering lovely views of tivoli village. \n\nlove this spot, a favorite for lunch and weekend brunch. i will absolutely be coming back for dinner soon."

            "this is the best steakhouse off the strip.  and even with that, echo & rig has so much more going for it!\n\ni came here with a 8 adults and 4 kids for my wife's birthday dinner on a very busy saturday night.  even though they normally don't take reservations, the manager i spoke with on the phone the day before (cheryl) was very helpful as i had my eye on the big long striped wooden table t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> pictured on their site and they saved it for us.  we arrived a few minutes before and were treated to passed hors d'oeuvres of their homemade salami and smoked chicken.  yum freakin yum.\n\nwith so many small plates offered, echo & rig is meant for groups so everything can be shared.  we split 3 salads and they all threw curveballs to the palate.  the kale salad with yellow beets, <mark>Toast</mark> hazelnuts and goat cheese was really nice.  their \"over the rainbow salad\" was an explosion of flavor featuring farro, quinoa, red, yellow & orange bell peppers, corn, red onion, asparagus, cherry tomatoes, almonds, herbs & champagne vinaigrette.  that's a vegetarian's dream right there.  and the <mark>Fried Spinach</mark> salad with red onion, cauliflower, broccoli was fantastic with the chile-lime vinaigrette was probably my favorite of them all.  the crispness of the spinach combined with the heat from the dressing was quite a combination.  \n\nwe ordered a bunch of small plates and the standouts for me were the cauliflower with chili de arbol, crispy shallots and onions and the roasted garlic mashed potatoes with sharp white cheddar but the description didn't do t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>.  it was almost like a super hash brown with a really nice dijon sauce.  i was also able to sample the burnt peas, pumpkin squash, grilled thick cut bacon with bbq sauce (no sauce needed), butcher's sausage and mac and cheese.  all of them were solid options and everything was devoured by the group.  \n\ni got the \"spencer steak\" which was one of the 3 ribeye cuts offered.  each steak comes with a complimentary sauce and i went with charred onion but sauce just isn't necessary when the meat is awesome.  my medium rare cut was closer to rare but it was probably better t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>.  it was everything you wanted in a steak...tender, juicy and flavorful.  my wife's rare filet mignon was cooked perfectly and just got better bite after bite.\n\nthen there's the freakin value of it all!!  the priciest entree is only $35!  no corkage fee (we brought 3 bottles), no cake fee (got a cake from patisserie manon) and they lit the candles and brought it out.  the total bill for 8 adults and 4 kids came out to what 2 people would spend at carnevino.  total wine and more is just across the way in boca park so pick something up there.  \n\ni cannot wait to come back since there are so many other dishes i must try like bone marrow carne asada and hawaiian cowboy.  i also can't wait for them to bust out their brunch and late night menus.  they also have tables set up on a balcony overlooking the tivoli village fountain which would make for a terrific date night.   \n\nthe staff was top notch from beginning to end and the experience here wouldn't have been as wonderful as it was without their great work.  they earned their tips and then some! i'm ready to go back for lunch.  \n\nsay hi to the pig heads outside!!", 
            "we went there for dinner a few months ago and had the worst service, but the food was really good.  my husband and i agreed t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> would try this place again this time in the bar for happy hour! already from the start it was five stars for price and quality of the happy hour items and drink! $1.99 steak and egg and shrimp cocktail & $1 hot dog.  for ladies, we enjoy the drink of the day for free- today it was tequila sunrise! we decided to try a few other things on the menu we were adventurous and tried the sweetbread nugget.  this didn't sound appetizing when the bartender explained w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was- but once in your mouth it was absolutely divine! next we tried the bone marrow carne asada- bone marrow was good, tasty, fatty, with carne asada and onions on top with three <mark>Toast</mark>.  i would have preferred to have more carne asada. finally we tried all the happy hour items and you can't go wrong with those prices! all were delicious! our server in the bar was awesome too! he made the experience even better and that's why i gave the full 5 stars! we will be back!",

            "let's begin with...\n\nsmall plates - although echo & rig is quite obviously a steakhouse, the menu has an eclectic, yet put-together feel. steak, salads, pasta dishes, did i say steak?, and small plates are found here. small plates have three price ranges. one could come here and simply eat off the small plates menu, or use the small plates menu to come along as sides with a steak. the variety is good, but not overwhelming. you can tell these items have been selected with the utmost care.\n\nbutcher's choice sausage - this sausage changes daily as noted by our incredibly helpful server, edward. when my friend and i dined it was a chicken sausage, within a pork casing, with a sweet tomato sauce, onions, and jalapenos. this sausage was quite possibly the best sausage i have ever eaten. cooked perfectly, with a snap to the outside, and a deep flavor without the \"taste\" of your normal run-of-the-mill grocery sausage (t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> is not good). \n\ncarne asada bone marrow - the sausage blew this small plate away. however, it was still good, presented beautifully, and a decent-sized portion (my friend and i shared). comes with onions.\n\nmoving on to main courses..\n\nas impressed as i was by the brilliant selection of steaks and the lesson the server gave us about each of the cuts i wanted to order more small plates, however, i was so mesmerized by the cuts of meat available i decided to have the hangar steak sandwich. this comes with roasted anaheim chiles, spinach, and preserved lemon chimichurri. i certainly picked a good dish as the steak was cooked to a velvety medium, the bread slightly <mark>Toast</mark>, and all the flavors melding together, plus a serving of crunchy potato chips.\n\nlastly, dessert. my friend and i chose a chocolate ice cream bowl t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> with candied pecan cookies, cherry gelee, and big, ripe, bourbon-soaked cherries, topped with w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> know was a freshly whipped-up whip cream. this little dessert was the perfect end to a perfect meal.\n\nother features... a decent wine listing with wines t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> and won't break your pocket book. service t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> immaculate, friendly, yet not too hoity-toity. our table was also visited by the manager of the night who was a very nice gentleman.\n\noverall i will absolutely return to echo & rig.", 
            "another excellent meal here, came here with a huge group this time.  service is awesome as usual, very attentive and friendly from the host to the server.\n\nso to the food:\n\nbrussel sprouts - excellent tasting, the nice lemon flavor and crisp brussel sprouts.\n\ncauliflower with peppers - if you like a little spicy kick and cauliflower this is a good side dish.\n\nspicy sausage - not bad, not too spicy but good flavors.\n\n<mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark> - decent, not a huge <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark> fan but still good.\n\noctopus salad - octopus was a little dry t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> got, but the flavors were good. \n\nbone marrow carne asada -  awesome!  this is surprisingly really good.  the combination on top of a nice <mark>Toast</mark> bread.\n\npumpkin squash - a bit sweet, but i believe it's the sweetness of the squash.  like a small grilled pumpkin.\n\nportebello fries - excellent appetizer, great pick as usual.\n\npork belly grits - not bad, pretty unique tasting.\n\nstir fry kale - not bad, nothing t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> out.\n\nstuffed portebello - decent, but didn't stand out compared to the other stuff.\n\ntomahawk ribeye - pretty tasty, cooked pretty tender.  a great thing we did get with this is a selection of the sauces, you need to ask for it though.  7 sauces tonight.\n\nblack spaghetti - delicious!  still one of my favorite dishes here.  nice lemony flavors with the sun dried tomatoes and seafood mix.  highly recommended.", 
            "a good steakhouse in the 'burbs is rare, so echo and rig can easily lay claim to being one of the best. located in the perennially empty tivoli village, the modern, open two-story space features a butcher shop and bar on the first level and the main dining room and patio on the second. \n\nthe menu is dominated by appetizers and small plates. the best of the bunch might be the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> ($9.80) with their crispy, crunchy fried exterior. if you like fried foods, try the lamb cigars ($8.10) too. a thin, crispy egg roll-like wrapper covers a savory lamb mixture and is accompanied by a tzatziki sauce. less successful was an excessively oily gratin ($5.90) full of caramelized onions, roasted pumpkin squash, sage and gruyere. you may want to avoid the steak tartare ($8.10) as well. not only is it the least appetizing looking dish there, the mushy texture made it doubly unappealing. \n\ncraving a salad? they've got some good ones, like a kale salad ($8) with baby yellow beets, <mark>Toast</mark> hazelnuts, goat cheese and a citrus vinaigrette. if you want one with a little more substance the arugula salad comes with plenty of prosciutto and is large enough for two to share.\n\nas for main entrees, the spencer steak ($27.70) is a solid choice. it's a prime grade, center cut rib eye t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> a modest amount of charring and a savoriness t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> enhanced by their mushroom sauce -- a rich and earthy accompaniment t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> their other complimentary sauces.\n\nbrussels sprouts are all the rage these days, and their version ($8.10) was enhanced with pistachios t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> a nice crunch and salinity to the dish. even better was a grilled summer corn ($5.90) dish showcasing a char and smokiness t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> me of eating corn on the cob straight from the grill, but without the mess or random kernels stuck in between my teeth.\n\nnot to be overlooked is their <mark>Butcher Blend Burger</mark> ($12.40) - a great savory and juicy blend of chuck and brisket. topped with lettuce, tomato, red onions, and the optional sharp cheddar cheese, it's a simple burger that's well proportioned and executed beautifully.\n\nthey don't have a kid's menu, but were happy to strip down their <mark>Roasted Chicken</mark> sandwich ($12) to accommodate my son's tastes -- chicken and cheese on ciabatta.\n\nprices are reasonable for their location and while it's on the higher end of the spectrum of w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> may want to pay off strip, the solid and safe menu makes it a sure bet for most diners.", 
            "w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> pleasant surprise.  i've been to echo & rig only once, but the overall experience will undoubtedly keep me coming back.  \n\nfor starters, the service is excellent, from the host to the asst. gm.  the staff is not only friendly, but passionate about their food.  the dishes we selected on our own were good, but the dishes t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> recommended to us were exceptional.  another important attribute, the prices are reasonable for w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> produce.  \n\non to the meal:\nthe restaurant offers complimentary purified still or sparkling water.  this is a nice touch, one i wish more restaurants would adopt.\n\n<mark>Portobello Fries</mark> & herb aioli\nthey call this one of their signature dishes and it was the first item t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> recommended to us.  we were not let down, the fries were delicious. they're not too greasy/heavy and the aioli is a perfect accompaniment.  \n\nsteak tartare\ni love a good steak tartare and echo and rig deliver a great version.  the dish is well balanced and the <mark>Toast</mark> bread is a good vessel to deliver the meat with just the right amount of crunch.  the caper/beef combo is so delicious.  \n\nbrussels sprouts, pistachio & fresh lemon\nthis was probably the most basic item we ordered, but t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> no way is a criticism.  in comparison to other dishes, the flavors were simple, which i often welcome in a vegetable dish.  great crisp in the leaves, just the right amount of citrus.\n\n<mark>Fried Spinach</mark>\nwe were about to order the arugula salad, but knowing we were open to recommendations, the server steered us towards the <mark>Fried Spinach</mark>.  this is one of my favorite dishes of the night.  flash frying the spinach, gave it a kale-chip like texture.   throw in the chile-lime vinaigrette and thinly-sliced red onions and you have harmony on a plate.  the vinaigrette was almost sweet, but just the right amount to play off the spinach and onions.  bravo.\n\ncauliflower, chili de arbol, crispy shallots & onions\nanother impressive and inventive dish.  the cauliflower almost tasted candied.  there were so many layers of flavor and texture, i'm not sure i can do a technical description any justice.  \n\nthe spencer steak\nthis was an excellent cut of meat.  cooked to perfection, the steak was tender and smokey (they say their steaks are cooked over red oak).  we sampled three of the steak sauces - charred onion, red wine demi and brandied mushroom, which i liked in t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>.  i didn't always taste the garlic in their garlic-chips, but they were tasty nonetheless. the mushroom rockefeller was so good.  \n\ndessert - caramel turtle\nanother staff pick, the salted-caramel sundae topped with peanut brittle, whipped cream, bourbon sauce, etc. was quite good.  their dessert menu is entirely sundaes or an option for seasonal berries and sorbet.  \n\n\non top of everything, the restaurant contains a full bar and wait for it...  a butcher shop!  i don't know about you, but this is exciting for me.  it's a very smart concept and one t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> adds to the culture of the restaurant.  on my next visit, i'll likely take home some cuts of meat and wood (assuming it's red oak), for my home bbq.  \n\ni look forward to returning to try some of the other dishes t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was simply too full to order.", 
            "this is for dinner service, never been here for brunch.\n\none of the best valued steakhouses around. service is always top notch, the hostesses are nice and make small talk while taking you to your seat, and the managers always make a point to stop by and say hello. it's nice to have an establishment pay attention to little details like that. most servers are pretty awesome, there are a couple who really try to upsell you on different things - we just ask not to be seated in their section. \n\nwe love rib cap, and echo and rig is one of the few places t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> this cut in town (and for such a great price!!).  we have received our steaks overcooked a couple times, and they are always quick to re-fire a new one and bring it out asap (derrick, one of the managers, even boxed an overcooked one up for us to take home once, talk about superb service). we've only tried the steaks, so i can't say anything about the entrees. you can't go wrong with any of the cuts. the appetizers are generally pretty tasty, too. i love the baked brie in the garlic-butter brushed sourdough. it's perfect with the gooey cheese and tangy fruit compote on the buttery <mark>Toast</mark> bread. if in the mood for charcuterie, they do have one available and they make all the meats in house. it's not on the dinner menu, so you'll have to ask for it. (i wish they would add some cheese!) \n\ni'm a sucker for a great hendricks martini, and i promise you the bartender (i'm sorry i don't know your name) makes one of the best ones in town.  i've been all over looking for a good martini and places like picasso, sw, mandarin bar, olives, other mama etc etc don't even stack up. \n\nno corkage fee, and we take full advantage. we've even stopped by total wine a couple times before dinner to grab a bottle (just call me a lush).  don't forget to scrub your hands with the divine salt scrub in the restrooms too!\n\nmore like 4.5 - minus points for the couple of pushy servers and sometimes inconsistent meat temps."

            "this place was very, very nice. one of the nicest places i've been to in a while and my dad and his lady took my boyfriend and i out to dinner. we had an amazing sunset dinner, on the balcony. i had a piece of skirt steak i believe it was just alright i wasn't crazy about it and side of asparagus.\n\nthe setting, the food, and the atmosphere really made this an enjoyable dinner while visiting in town for the week. \n\nour table ordered everything from the steak tartare, to the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>, to the  <mark>1/2-inch Thick Grilled Bacon</mark> with bbq sauce which the bacon was made in house ( it was the best bacon i've ever had). my boyfriend loves the oysters too, and the men had the butterfish and were raving about it."

            "with all of the hype and the paid advertisement in urban daddy, i thought i might make the trek off the strip to echo and rig.  it was advertised as butcher shop where you can pick your meat and they will cook it for you.  all the meats are grass fed and come from california.  upon walking in, you see the butchers in action slicing meats, making <mark>Sausage</mark>, and grinding beef for meatballs and hamburgers.\n\nthey don't take reservations, so expect to wait a little bit before getting a table.  the good thing is t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> have a bar with 3-4 bartenders slinging up craft cocktails and making a great impression.  the bartender even gave us some complimentary shots of jalapeno infused tequila which seemed to improve our moods.  the drinks were $8, which is reasonable compared to $15-$18 drinks on the strip, so t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> well for us.  \n\nafter a 15 minute wait, we got a table and a great personable server.  they presented us with the selections of meats on a platter, which were supposedly steaks for 2 people.  i could have easily eaten their ny strip which was 24 ounces and sold by the ounce ($2.29/ounce).  so yea, it would have been a $50+ steak. \n\nwe opted for for the hangar steak with chimichurri ($22.5) and the ribeye ($34.50) along with a couple of appetizers of <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> and a charcuterie platter with assorted meats.  the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> were delicious and the charcuterie platter was a very good.  then the main course came.\n\nmy ribeye was about 10 ounces for $34 and was maybe 3/4 inch thick.  it was well cooked, but one of the worst ribeyes t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> have eaten in a long time.  i get better meat at sam's club.  the hangar steak was charred on the outside and chewy as all hell. the portion size of the hangar steak was probably about 5-6 ounces and even though it is probably the correct amount of food per dietary guidelines as a serving, it was small and we did not leave feeling full, but left with a bill of over $150.\n\ni would try it again, but i wouldn't go back for dinner.  maybe their sandwiches and lunch selections will be a bit better.", 
            "this is a beautifully decorated butcher shop and restaurant. they don't take reservation so be prepared for a little wait. after reviewing the menu, i was glad it was simple and did not offer too many items. you get to choose side dishes, salads, pasta and steak. for the visit, we ordered a kale salad, roasted  pumpkin squash and carrots, a chopped steak salad and the butcher's sausage. \n\nthe pumpkin squash and carrots were amazing. max said the steak salad was good and the sausage was the best sausage he has ever had in his life so if <mark>Sausage</mark> are your thing then this item is a must try! \n\ni didn't like the kale salad. there was too much cheese and dressing which made the greens all soggy. \n\ni'm coming back here to try more side dishes!", 
            "this review is based on two dinner outings.  the first was somew<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> than the second.\n\non my initial visit, i reveled in an excellent small appetizer plate of meatballs with mixed flavors and straight ahead red tomato sauce and fresh grated parmesan cheese brought on request.  french onion gratin soup with caramelized onion, roasted pumpkin squash, sage, and domestic swiss cheese was great and somew<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> served in a staub metal pot.  a side of butternut squash & brown sugar was also excellent.   sweet fire cauliflower was rather spicy but sweet at the same time.  mushroom rockefeller was interesting and tasty.  garlic shrimp featured 5 jumbo shrimps.  and, garlic chips were light on garlic and very good.   on the first occasion, these were offered to us to savor as snacks while we waited to be seated despite arriving on schedule.  but, on the second, during a delay t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> about 15 minutes to be seated after the time of our reservation, we were offered nothing.    \n\nthere was a long wait between consumption of starters and delivery of our entrees during the first dinner service.  when entrees did finally arrive, i enjoyed a medium rare filet mignon t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> in fact almost rare, with a good red wine demi glace and excellent bearnaise sauce.  this meal ended on a very upbeat note with great moist strawberry shortcake and assorted berries along with a turtle espresso sundae provided gratis by the manager to make up for our delayed entrees.  a yummy finish! \n\nboth times after our arrival, the period of waiting to be seated was a little unusual, as my party of four had to stand on our feet and awkwardly mill about with other strangers in the sleek tiled atrium until we were called.  the only diversions were observing butchers at work or looking at cuts of beef, chicken, lamb, and pork, and various <mark>Sausage</mark> in the on site butcher shop t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> staggering prices for each offered item.\n\non the second occasion just over three weeks after the first, wild mushroom soup with a touch of cream was even better than the french onion gratin soup experienced earlier.  complimentary bread was very tasty.  garlic shrimp were juicy, tasty, and extra fine.  a steak salad with large cannelini beans, medium rare hunks of tender beef, pepperoni, white onions, red bell pepper, pepperoncini, and zucchini was a very good chopped salad, but almost a meal in itself.  and, another 8 oz. medium rare filet was very tender and buttery (again almost rare), enhanced by a good green peppercorn sauce and again an excellent bearnaise sauce.  moist skin-on redskin mashed potatoes were very good, just as again were homemade garlic chips (if you like potato chips with your steak, which i don't).  the only food item i didn't find appealing on this occasion was a side of too hard, falling apart brussels sprouts.  and, a fellow diner announced t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> did not like her shaking beef entree.\n\nwhile the food served here both times was generally praiseworthy, the second dinner was marred by a cluster of service errors: one bowl of wild mushroom soup (mine) was missed, and then the server forgot to bring it to the table again; no steak knife was provided until requested; refilling water glasses was very intermittent; bearnaise sauce was initially forgotten; and grilled seabass was proferred with skin on after the server declared t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> would only arrive at the table with skin off, and being told \"good!\" by the diner who ordered this dish.  my steak was also cold by the time i finished this delayed entree, after dispatching the salad and belated soup courses.  the decor here is modern but rather austere, and feels somew<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>.  the capacious upstairs dining room can also become very loud when it fills up, as it did both times i was here.\n\nbut to me, food is paramount.  although this restaurant still has a few kinks to work out, it offers much promise.  based on my two experiences to date, i rate it 4-1/2 stars overall.", 
            "2 hour wait. i was expecting a wait, but 2 hours was a bit much. was it worth 2 hours? definitely not, sorry to say! i would think t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> my hunger and grumpiness i would like anything i ate, but t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> not the case. \n\non a positive note, i liked hoe the butchers were cutting steaks and you could talk to them and sample some <mark>Sausage</mark> and such. personally, i am not a sausage fan and did not like w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> had to sample, but i believe my hubby liked this sampling. i liked the displays of meat and opportunity to interact with butchers. \n\nonce we were seated (pretty area upstairs by the way), i already knew i wanted the rip eye cap and the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> so i was ready to order. well, come to find out they were out of the rib eye cap! \n\nat t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> we had to ask for recommendations. i was a little confused by the steak choices. they had rib eye steak on the menu and rib eye steak t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> buy from precut slices t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> butchers were cutting downstairs. apparently there is a difference in the quality of them. there is also a difference in the price, major difference. i just found it weird. i mean options are great, but this was a little bit too much for me to decide. i think they should just stick to w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> they feel would taste the best. the waiter almost made the rib eye from the menu sound like something i could have bought myself at the supermarket. he was really \"selling\" the ribeye/steaks t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> brought out raw on a platter. maybe to some people they would appreciate this and it did remind me of my experience at gordon ramsay steak, but the prices were almost the same as strip prices for those cuts of meat. it almost felt like we would be making a bad choice if we chose the steak from the menu. again, why not just have one type of meat on your menu?\n\nhe claimed the fish was brought in from fisherman t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> day and i did not understand how t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> even possible?\n\nbased on the waiter's recommendation, i ordered the slow roasted short ribs with castelvetrano olives, celery, walnuts, and horseradish. i'm not going to lie, these toppings did not seem like they would go well with short ribs, but the waiter was saying it was excellent so i got it. the olives, celery, and walnuts literally looked like they were sprinkled on top after the short ribs were cooked. i don't think raw celery, uncooked olives, and chunky walnuts compliments short ribs at all! i was hoping it was maybe chopped up small and possibly cooked in some way. i've ordered short ribs often at restaurants and just never saw it made this way. it was presented on a piece of paper and board (similar to how a charcuterie would be served), also weird. i think of short ribs as having a yummy sauce t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> would want to pair with mashed potato or rice or something to enjoy the sauce with and some sort of cooked veggies. instead, the sauce was dripping off of the paper. weird presentation. \n\nmy husband's ribeye steak was good and so was the mushroom. he also enjoyed the bone marrow (i did not try it) and i liked the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>. the waiter was quick to move around and seemed to be good (except for his recommendation).\n\noverall t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> rib and the long wait did not leave me wanting to come back for more.", 
            "about time vegas got an old school butcher shop! well walking at tivoli i noticed echo and rig. the previous day i went to my local grocery store and asked if they could cut me some thin slices of sirloin so i could make cheese steaks. they lacked the equipment so i was out of luck. when i walked up to echo and rigs window the first thing i noticed where the pigs hanging from hooks and then there was rack of lamb and strings of <mark>Sausage</mark>. i knew i had to walk in to check it out. inside, it's a two story restaurant. rustic looking but really cool none the less. i went to the butcher counter after looking at all the beautiful meats. i asked if they could shave sirloin for cheese steaks. they said absolutely and brought me out two choice cuts of steak to choose from.  i made my selection and it was shaved so beautifully thin. they packaged it and i paid. for those of you who dread cooking at thanksgiving they make thanksgiving dishes and turkeys if you like. just fyi :) i'll definitely be back for more custom cuts!", 
            "hospitality here is amazing! really memorable experience, and the food was excellent.  the location is a few miles off the strip which is great, because it gives you a chance to drive out and forget you're in one of the most touristy destination places in the western world.  it's a newly developed plaza, so it may not show up on older gps maps as i found out.  better to use your phone instead.  \n\nso you pull up to this sprawling italian influenced shopping center, tivoli village, complete with huge center fountain.  the restaurant is prominently located at the entrance across from a popular italian restaurant and sports bar, near the fountain.  there is plenty of free parking if you don't want to valet.  when you enter echo & rig, it looks like an upscale butcher's, with fresh meat and <mark>Sausage</mark> on display.  the hostess is extremely friendly, and got to know our party a little before selecting our table (where we were from, if it was our first time, etc).  they had tables out on the patio and a larger, beautiful dining area inside, next to the kitchen.  we sat inside, which was perfect.\n\nthe hostess took us upstairs via the elevator although there is a winding grand staircase, and she really makes us feel at home.  once seated, we were greeted by i think the m'aitre d, derrick, who welcomes us and thanks us for coming.  our waiter, raoul, then walked us through the menu and the specialty items, going through the ala carte menu as well which you can also order as appetizers.  there are so many small tapa like items to order, we got the lamb cigars and <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark> which i highly recommend.  the small dishes range from $6, $8, and $10.  i also ordered a baked potato, which wasn't on the menu (although there is a baked sweet potato) but they happily made anyway t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> with the steak.\n\nfor the main entrees, they have surprisingly a large variety of choices besides steaks.  there's several chicken dishes, seafood, pork, and even duck.  of course, they are known as a steak house and their choice of cuts is superb.  i got the rib eye cap (the best part of the ribeye) and was not disappointed.  each entree came with homemade chips and potato cakes.  every cut is, i believe, 10 ounces and was plenty big.  grilled to perfection too, of course.\n\nyou can't go here without noticing the excellent service and modern technology implemented.  derrick who i think is the m'aitre d again came out to c<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> us after our appetizers came out to make sure everything was to our satisfaction and asked if there was anything we needed.  i ordered a beer and then less than a minute later someone from downstairs comes up and delivers my beer.  how did t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> so fast?  also, we noticed t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> were a couple of people with ipads just walking around making sure and double checking t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was being done, which was somew<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>.  the level of communication and service here was extraordinary and worth another visit just to observe!  \n\nfinally, the gm of the restaurant came out to visit after the meal to invite us back and make sure everything was exceptional, which it was.  he even mentioned t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> were planning to open another echo & rig in los angeles by next year and t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> owner already owned a popular italian steakhouse in dtla, botega louie which i now want to try.  we were too full for dessert, but i would have to assume it would have been awesome.", 
            "i can't speak to the restaurant proper, but i am quite the regular at the butcher shop and have been known to hang out with friends at the bar.  the butcher shop is truly full service.  the slab bacon is excellent, the burger patties are amazing, and the <mark>Sausage</mark> and terrines are lovely.  they're the only butcher i have put special requests in to t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> produced, and since they bring in whole animals, i can always get pork skin on, which is very rare these days outside of a chinese market (which don't generally have roasts).  oh, and give their experiments a try, never been disappointed.\n\nservice at the bar is friendly and competent.  the beer selection is respectable for the small number of taps and the house wines are decent.  the happy hour menu is great, sadly they've reduced the happy hour hours.  from the full menu the bone marrow carne asada is excellent, and they do not treat their calamari as an afterthought.  the mac and cheese is not the best in town but it is not disappointing.  \n\nthe one real problem is the weekend.  since they do brunch the regular menu is not available before 4pm, which is kind of a bummer if you go to the farmer's market, which ends at 2pm, and want to grab a proper bite there afterwards.  i don't know about anyone else but i like to have breakfast before wandering a farmer's market, not after."

            "so how does one start a review of a restaurant/butcher shop???? i tell you how, with a comment a good friend said as she was looking at all the meat cuts, wow,  w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> great alternative to wf's!  i can come here order my meat and have a martini while i wait until they cut it up fresh!  t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> how i am starting my review of echo & rig.  and the patience and care the 23 year old butcher, yup t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> not a typo, t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> care of her, while in slicing her meat was ...frankly in today's world amazing - t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> call customer service.\n\nt<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> does not end there, it only begins there.  jason and courtnee  are polite without being pushy, knowing the menu items and making the correct recommendations; friendly but professional, comparable to the 5 star restaurants i have eaten at in las vegas - t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> the service we received at echo & rig, not once, but two nights in a row.  not to mention michael , who is just so excited to have the restaurant open - well michael you are not the only one, we of vegas and especially summerlin, cannot be happier, to have a premier, delicious, vivacious, restaurant with great energy opened in our backyard.  welcome to the neighborhood!\n\nand now for the food -  omg, delicious.  <mark>Fried Spinach</mark> salad, kale with baby yellow beets, gratin caramelized onion soup with pumpkin squash (i would come back just for that), <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>, brussels sprouts with pistachio and fresh lemon, black spaghetti with seafood and roasted peppers, butter fish, sea bass, skirt steak, prime rib, caramel salted ice cream and short cake and berries with ice cream.... yup t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> more, not one bad item, not one complaint from me or in two days from the 6 people i ate with.  the people around us ate different items and could not stop complementing them, such as the bone marrow and carne asada.  if you are a meat eating you will love this place, if you are conscious of farm to table eating, you will love this place, if you are a vegetarian, there are plenty of choices.  so let me recap: great atmosphere, great food, amazing service and prices, beyond reasonable.  least i forget to mention the cocktails; they do know how to make a drink. so w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> this mean, you need to go and try echo & rig at tivoli village, make your reservations , book your parties, bring your friends, stop by for a drink, you are not going to regret it!  and they have only just gotten started so it is only going to get better!!", 
            "w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> concept: 5 star food at 3 star prices! seriously affordable awesomeness here, with eminently sharable plates starting at $5.\n   everything is made from scratch, which makes everything from sausage to designer cocktails amazeballs great. we had the rib eye cap steak... taken from the most tender part of the rib eye area (i'm not a meat expert! but they are). it was seriously the best steak we've ever eaten, and at $22, are you kidding me? they had a choice of 8 sauces, but none tasted as good as the naked steak. also amazing was the lighter-than-air \"over the rainbow\" chopped salad (quinoa, citrus, veggies in a champagne vinaigrette dressing), $8. and the crispy fried <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> with aioli dip was a knockout, don't miss them w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> you do.\n   we bought an awesome roast and some amazing breakfast sausage (made t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>!) at the butcher shop downstairs, on the way out. meat so awesomely fresh t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> can tell you the story of each kind of meat... where the cow came from, how it was raised, how it lived (on the farm, grazing naturally), no hormones no preservatives, none of that. and super reasonably priced, just like our meal was upstairs. we'll be back, just for the butcher shop.\n   sorry to run off at the mouth, but echo & rig should not be missed.\n   great service, too... intuitive but not interruptive. ask for patrick!", 
            "i usually will wait until a 2nd visit to review a place, however if the place is really bad or amazingly good i'll write a review when i get home from the place. this is one of those reviews.\n\ni don't often make it up to tivoli village but on the trips i did i would always peek in the windows and see how things were going at echo & rig. tonight i finally got into the place and it was great.\n\nwhen we entered they walked us through the lower level, we got to check out the butcher shop, the deli/charcuterie counter, and the bar before heading upstairs to the dining room.\n\nthe layout is a little random with the bar/butcher shop downstairs, and the dining room & kitchen upstairs. the dining room is very open and there's some room between the tables. there is a patio off the dining room and an exhibition kitchen along the entire south wall of the dining room.\n\nthe servers were attentive, the hosts were friendly, the bussers were quick to refill the water glasses (complimentary sparkling or still water), and bringing the proper weapons(utensils) to make sure we could properly enjoy our meals.\n\nthe food was really, really damn good. we had several things off of their expansive (over 90 item) menu. the hardest part of the entire meal was selecting which items on the menu to try and which to keep for another visit.\n\nthe meal started with a bread basket, it was a pretty basic looking basket with 3 slices of bread and no butter, at first i thought it was odd, but after trying the bread i realized butter wasn't needed.\n\nnext up was our small plate \"appetizers\". first up was the thick cut bacon and bbq sauce. the bacon was grilled which added a great flavor, the bbq sauce was ok, but i mainly ate the bacon plain and it was good. we also had the bone marrow carne asada, yes you read t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> it's not only \"gods butter\" bone marrow it also comes with carne asada as well a perfect combo on the toast.\n\nafter t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> the charcuterie plate, prosciutto, 3 different salamis, pate, and head cheese all were delish, but the prosciutto was my favorite.  next was grilled octopus, now i myself am not an octopus guy, but this dish was amazing and made me rethink my <mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> for octopus. we also had the mushroom soup, it was creamy and delish.\n\nnext was the entree course, i had the butcher's cut ribeye which was a 14oz steak cooked medium rare (possibly a touch over), served with garlic chips and mushroom rockefeller. this would have been enough on it's own, but not for us. we also added <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>, mashed potatoes, and heirloom carrots for bonus eats. the potatoes and carrots were amazing, but the steak was the stand out item of the meal. i'm not a fan of steak sauces, but if you are, unlike most places t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> $5-7 for a sauce, echo & rig includes one free sauce with your steak, which is a nice touch.\n\nas if all this food wasn't enough the waiter told us about the dessert menu. they  only serve ice cream sundaes. and after hearing him say \"salted caramel ice cream\" i was getting the turtle sundae. it was the perfect end to an amazing meal.\n\ni can't wait to get back and try the rest of their menu. i really am looking forward to their late night menu for a late bite before heading to la casa down the road for the a cigar.\n\nalso the have free wifi for all your food porn posting needs which is a great added bonus",

            "hands down one of the best steak houses in town!  best value $22 for a steak - how does this place make any money?!!\n\nit was packed and we had to wait an hour but we had no problems since we sampled a dozen items while we were waiting including lamb sausage, bolognese, sirloin steak, pork sandwich, and much more.  with all the sampling they provide, i'd actually prefer to arrive at a busy time for the freebies.\n\nno corkage fees and when the manager saw t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> had our bottle in hand while we were waiting, she took it to go get it chilled and brought it out immediately when we were seated.  \n\nwe ordered the spencer steak (specialized rib eye) and the lamb chops which was some of the highest quality and best bang for the buck steaks you can get.  this was accompanied by <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> fried perfectly with a little crisp and all the fresh umami meatiness from the mushrooms.   the cauliflower you could practically feed to kids...so delicious.\n\nwe will definitely be back.   i stll dont know how this place makes any money but we'll continue to go back.  with the free wine corkage and ridiculously cheap prices, i dont know how you could ever go on the strip.   echo and rig is a must!", 
            "amazing. the food was fantastic. the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> were so good just order an extra aioli. get the spencer cut. it's kind of like a fillet and ribeye mix, but don't be crazy, you have to order it medium rare. the horseradish cream sauce and the charred onion sauce were bomb too. the mac and cheese was pretty good and the cauliflower also. just watch out for the little brown chunks in the cauliflower because it's brown sugar. beer is draught or can which is fine because they have a good draught selection. the only complaint i have is t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> bar is downstairs and the restaurant is upstairs which means the wait staff takes a while to bring you a drink. downstairs is a butcher shop and a little sandwich stand. both are pretty cool. the butchers seemed pretty knowledgeable and personable and the prices weren't horrible either. probably cheaper than whole foods. the hostess was very nice and respectful and fun to c<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>. all in all this place is most likely my favorite steak joint and will recommend it to all of my friends. keep up the good work!!!", 
            "the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> are incredible!\nservice is lacking. ordered two appetizers to start and never got asked if i wanted anything else. was there for over an hour and a half.\nmy glass sat empty for about 15mins while sitting in the bar area with 4+ bartenders behind the counter.\n\nprobably won't be back in a hurry. too many restaurants to enjoy in vegas.", 
            "3.5 ish i'm not really sure w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> here. \n\ni loved the beef jerky from the butcher shop so much i decided to eat lunch here. \n\ngot the rib eye, portobello mushroom fries and egg with grilled tomato and the hot and bothered cocktail. \n\nthe rib eye was ok, really just ok, not fab which was not w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was expecting. the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> where kinda awesome but way to salty, the tomato was ok. the fried egg was ok. the cocktail was supposed to be bourbon based but it was so mildly burbony it mostly tasted of the avave syrup. so ya that's it the whole meal was ok.\n\ni'm pretty sure they have amazing food hiding in there somewhere but unfortunately i just got teased. \n\nwould i go back and try again, u betcha.", 
            "if things couldn't get any tastier at my favorite restaurant in vegas--echo & rig--they did.  brunch has begun as of october 5th and offerings such as <mark>Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes</mark>, short rib hash, and an all-american breakfast keep things simple.  echo & rig keeps the menu succinct so guests can determine w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> eat without the hassle of running through five pages of options.  each dish has explosive flavor, is presented beautifully, and with perfect portion sizes no one leaves hungry.  side orders of toast, bacon, and eggs are available as well.\ni found t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> a nice martini with my meal out on their gorgeous patio made saturday brunch even better.  we went through half of the cocktail menu, starting with a kentucky peachtree and a french kiss.\n\nboth drinks were a perfect start to the meal.  when the food arrived we were excited.  i ordered <mark>Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes</mark> with orange-infused syrup.\n\nthese pancakes are like pillows wrapping blueberries within each one ever so gently.  i used the whipped butter and syrup on top, taking my time to each all four pancakes.  with a cocktail on the side, it was a perfect meal. \n\nmy husband had their special short rib has with poached eggs topped with a southwestern sauce.\n\nthe short ribs were shredded and tossed with the hash.  once he broke into the perfectly poached eggs and stirred it around, the flavors and textures were too good to be true.  he had to give our server a high five for this suggestion.  when he finished, the entire bowl was empty and he came very close to picking it up in public to lick it.\n\nwe ended with one last cocktail for dessert--the strawberry bliss--then headed out to the farmers market to pick up some fruits and vegetables.  overall, brunch at echo & rig is a winner, one t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> hope to frequent every weekend.  with brunch starting at 9am sharp through 3pm, you can still sleep in from friday night's party and make it on time to have some hash or pancakes with a cocktail or two.  this is a must on anyone's breakfast list.  with their special <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> available on their brunch menu, salads, soups, and other dishes, you can still have your favorite small plates before 11am.  set t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>, get up at 9am, and grab a table on the patio at echo & rig this weekend.  ask for nan.  she's one of the best servers there.\n\nhappy eating.", 
            "with all of the hype and the paid advertisement in urban daddy, i thought i might make the trek off the strip to echo and rig.  it was advertised as butcher shop where you can pick your meat and they will cook it for you.  all the meats are grass fed and come from california.  upon walking in, you see the butchers in action slicing meats, making <mark>Sausage</mark>, and grinding beef for meatballs and hamburgers.\n\nthey don't take reservations, so expect to wait a little bit before getting a table.  the good thing is t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> have a bar with 3-4 bartenders slinging up craft cocktails and making a great impression.  the bartender even gave us some complimentary shots of jalapeno infused tequila which seemed to improve our moods.  the drinks were $8, which is reasonable compared to $15-$18 drinks on the strip, so t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> well for us.  \n\nafter a 15 minute wait, we got a table and a great personable server.  they presented us with the selections of meats on a platter, which were supposedly steaks for 2 people.  i could have easily eaten their ny strip which was 24 ounces and sold by the ounce ($2.29/ounce).  so yea, it would have been a $50+ steak. \n\nwe opted for for the hangar steak with chimichurri ($22.5) and the ribeye ($34.50) along with a couple of appetizers of <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> and a charcuterie platter with assorted meats.  the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> were delicious and the charcuterie platter was a very good.  then the main course came.\n\nmy ribeye was about 10 ounces for $34 and was maybe 3/4 inch thick.  it was well cooked, but one of the worst ribeyes t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> have eaten in a long time.  i get better meat at sam's club.  the hangar steak was charred on the outside and chewy as all hell. the portion size of the hangar steak was probably about 5-6 ounces and even though it is probably the correct amount of food per dietary guidelines as a serving, it was small and we did not leave feeling full, but left with a bill of over $150.\n\ni would try it again, but i wouldn't go back for dinner.  maybe their sandwiches and lunch selections will be a bit better.", 
            "i want to give 4 1/2 stars but i can't.  i really like this place and am adding it to my rotation of places good enough to go back t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> my budget.\n\necho & rig is a butcher shop/restaurant.  just walking past the window into the butcher area made me salivate, craving a good steak.\n\nwe entered and were greeted by the butcher, the manager (maybe even an owner?) and several other employees.  the hostess was very friendly and one of the chefs brought us a prosciutto appetizer with a little pork belly slider while we waited. (this does not seem like a typical thing so don't expect it.)  there is a small bar t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> crowded for a thursday and a small appetizer bar t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> the charcuterie plate, sausage plate and a few other items.\n\nwe were seated upstairs where our waiter brian explained the menu to us.  the menu consists of small plates (appetizers or sides or combine a few to make a meal) and steaks.  unlike the traditional steak restaurants t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> on ny and ribeye and filet, echo has a wide selection of variety steaks like spencer steak (essentially a boneless ribeye without the cap), ribeye cap, hanger, flatiron and more.  you can also get the traditional steaks.  i enjoy the pick your own sauce option and was extremely glad when the sauce came as a side so i could decide how much to put on.\n\ni asked for the flatiron steak medium rare.  the service took a long time and in afterthought, i would have them bring the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> (portobello mushroom, lightly breaded and fried with an amazing aioli.) as an appetizer so we didn't feel like the wait was long.  brian was very attentive in an old school waiter type way, remembering my name, ushering me to the restroom when i had to go, and making sure our water was filled.\n\nsparkling and flat water are available gratis (free).\n\none of the best parts of this place is the price - portion ratio.  the flat iron steak runs at $17.00 and is a 7 oz portion. (note, they can make a ribeye as large as 64 oz if you really must eat t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>).  one of my biggest complaints about the traditional steakhouses is the steaks are usually 12-16 oz.  i almost never finish them and i cannot think of anything else t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> so easily ruined by overnight refrigeration and reheating than a good medium rare steak.   here, the 7 oz was just enough to fill my tummy and not make me feel overstuffed.\n\nwe also loved the asparagus and fried egg appetizer and the spencer steak.\n\nso why not 5 stars you ask?  1) presentation was boring. essentially steak on a plate surrounded by some potato chips. i don't need fancy but there was a pile of chips on the left side of my plate, the steak in the center and about 1/3 the plate empty on the right. and 2) the service time was long as the place did not seem very crowded.\n\nsome other interesting facts about echo & rig are 1) you can bring your own wine with no corkage fee!!!! and 2) they make their own ribeye jerky.  even their glass prices for wine are reasonable.\n\nenjoy!", 
            "i walked in expecting to pay a lot for my lunch. i was wrong. there is no separate lunch and dinner menu. everything is very reasonably priced and well-portioned. i ordered the <mark>Fried Spinach</mark> salad with chili lime vinaigrette, <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>, and the butterfish. the spinach salad was such a delightful combination of flavors and textures. he <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> were amazing! the butterfish was the highlight of the day. so moist, so tender, so much flavor! i can't wait to go back and try everything!",

            "well i finally tried eating here.  fantastic steak, unique side dishes and a very good simple wine selection.  very reasonable prices too.  no reservations here so be patient for dinner - gets crowded.  try the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> or the grilled octopus side dish - fantastic.", 
            "i was very happy with my experience here and will be going back.  there is something i have found at so many restaurants - for all the cooks t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> how to prepare steak or chicken well, many don't know how to bring out the best in vegetables.  so, i was very happy to find the best dishes i sampled here were from their small plates selection - cauliflower browned with chili and crispy shallots and the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>.  both were fantastic.  \nthe wine list gets a gold star for some very reasonable prices both for bottles and by the glass.\nour server was painfully new and slightly awkward, but his heart was in the right place, so any missteps were forgiven. a missed order was quickly corrected and comped, though i thought t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> unnecessary, they were obviously aiming for good customer service, which is more than i have experienced at some of the other restaurants in t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> area (t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> you honey&salt, ahem).\nfor my main course, i had the rib eye cap at a truly reasonable $22.50.  it was served with garlic chips and a stuffed mushroom.  my steak was good and cooked exactly right.  it came with one complimentary sauce - i chose chimichurri.  i had mixed feelings about part of this: i tried both the chimichurri and the horseradish sauce and they were equally bland.  i also didn't really enjoy the chips or mushroom much, but considering t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> steak places no longer give you anything with  your steak - any sides are usually $7 or more, i thought it was nice to have something with it.\ni finished off with a turtle sundae and left happy.  all t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> for $50 per person (before tip) = happy diner.",

            "i'm on the fence about this place.  my first visit, our little group of 3 got seated immediately at around 9pm on a friday.  we ordered a few appetizers and ribeyes off the menu.  stand out appetizer was the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>, as many other reviewers attest.  the steaks were cooked to perfection, cut like butter, and tasted great.\n\nthe next time i went alone with the husband.  we arrived around 8:15 on a saturday and had to wait about 20 minutes, which was fine.  wait staff was quick to get our drink orders.  this time we decided to take the advice of others and selected a bone-in rib eye to share. appetizers came out quickly, but our steak took near 45 minutes to make its way from the kitchen.  apparently, our expectation t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> steakhouse should never mess up steaks was asking too much.  we asked for medium rare and got well done instead.  for w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> reason, i don't like to send food back.  we ate a few bites, and even at well done, it wasn't bad, which is a testament to their cuts, but our ribeye's pre-cooked weight was 26oz and cost ~$2.50/oz ($65).  i couldn't sit still for a $65 piece of meat, so we called our waiter over.  he saw our plate, instantly recognized t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> meat was overcooked, and called the manager to come over.  while we were waiting, the couple next to us sent back their salmon for the same problem.  the waiter's reaction seemed to indicate t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was happening all night long.  \n\nthe manager was professional about the situation.  he told us t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> would comp the steak and asked if we would like another.  we were already running late for a movie, so we opted for just the comp. \n\nwe ended up missing the movie.  although the manager handled the overcooked steak in a most appropriate way, i do think it is a sin for the kitchen staff to mess up, w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> to be, multiple orders.  it's a relatively new restaurant, so i'll give them one more chance, but if they screw up steak again, there is no way i could recommend this place to anyone.", 
            "this is definitely one of my new favorite places. everything about our dinner was wonderful from the service to the meat quality and and selection. the preparation of everything was perfect! definitely try one of the larger cuts to share , the cauliflower, brussels sprouts, and <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>. now i don't feel like i need to go to the strip for a good steak dinner anymore! i like this place better than stk, honestly.",

            "let me start by saying i'm not a fan and i doubt i will ever be back to echo & rig.  we came here late afternoon and there was one other party in the restaurant.  we were brought our <mark>Black <mark>Green Iced Tea</mark></mark> quickly and it was refilled frequently while we were there.\n\ni had looked at the menu online and i took some time to decide once there.  for a starter, we ordered their <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> which were served with an herb aioli.  this was the first i noticed t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> garlic or should have had garlic (herb aioli) had no garlic taste at all.  the herb aioli was good but missing the garlic flavor.\n\nmy wife ordered the tri-tip steak--medium--even though i suggested she get medium rare and i ordered the <mark>Hanger Steak</mark> blue.  she was drawn to the tri-tip because the menu said lemon and garlic neither of which was evident in any way.  garlic fail number 2.  all their steaks come with garlic chips (no garlic flavor here either--garlic fail #3) and a mushroom rockefeller, a breadcrumb stuffed mushroom cap.\n\nthe portobello mushroom was wonderful with the light coating and the cheese shreds.  then we waited.  we saved some of the mushrooms fries for our steak, and then we waited some more.  approximately 20 minutes later, our server said the steaks would be right out.  he took our small plates and silver away.  about 5 minutes went by and he stopped by once again and said the steaks would be right there.  about 5 minutes later, he stopped by to say they'd be out in about a minute.  this time, he was right.\n\nwhen the steaks arrived, i noticed t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> had been cut in slices and i just cringed.  i absolutely <mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> it when this is done.  maybe that's why so few places do it.  i asked if there was a culinary reason and the server said he'd ask.  when he came back he told us t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> chefs said it was to make the steaks more tender.  my steak was good, but it was cooked a little more than i would do it at home.  my wife's steak was less tender and because of her medium order, which they did, the steak was less juicy and there was a fair amount of sinew t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> wouldn't expect.  she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.  but above all, i'd say, please don't cut my steak.  i'm not a two year old and i'm not infirm.  i googled this when i got home and found t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> only reason (perhaps) to do this was to cut the steak against the grain the right way.\n\nwe each had a sundae for dessert.  they were ok.\n\ni left echo & rig very disappointed.  the length of time from ordering to getting our mains was ridiculous when the place is less than 1/10 full.  it was a tuesday afternoon--not date night usa at 8 pm.", 
            "first visit to echo & rig and we were pleasantly surprise!\n\nwhen we arrived, this man was giving away free beer sample (ballast point <mark>Sierra Nevada <mark>Ballast Point Pale Ale</mark></mark>).  there is also a charcuterie  area, tables and <mark>Chai</mark>, a bar, it was quite nice.  the hostess took us upstairs where the dining area is.  it looked very classy and chic.\n\nwe were immediately greeted by our server and they have a pretty good memory on our complimentary selection of flat or sparkling water.  our table shared/tasted the following:\n-<mark>Portobello Fries</mark>: slices of thick portobello were lightly battered and served with a green aioli.  yum.\n-bone marrow:  a must try!  we all enjoyed this appetizer.\n-octopus with gigante beans and green olives: very refreshing.\n-lamb chops: seasoned to perfection and was very tender.\n-trenne: our server nicholas recommended this but for us to keep in mind t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> is not like the typical pasta.  i loved it!  i liked the crispiness and charred taste to some of the trenne.  the prime rib eye was super tender as well.  the black kale went so well with it.\n\nwe tasted nelson's hangar steak and oh boy, t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> seasoned very well and again, super tender.  e&r sure knows how to cook up a piece of meat.\n\nwe ended the meal with the berry shortcake and the caramel turtle sundae.  caramel turtle sundae was the winner of the two.\n\nour entire dinner service was <mark>Stella</mark>.  nicholas was super attentive.  even after we had paid our bill, he still made sure t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> are ok, and t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> water is topped off.\n\nwe have already made plans in the future to return for brunch!", 
            "i wish i could give this place more than 5 stars because it is t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>. i came here with my family for my mother's birthday dinner when they were visiting from california. i had read the yelp reviews on it and i used to frequent bottega louie in downtown los angeles when i lived there which is operated by the same owners and chef. i knew the food was going to be great.\n\nwe waited about 10 minutes for a party of 6 to be sat and while we waited we looked at the butcher's display case. one of the butchers was telling us t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> can give you recipes for the different cuts of meat you might purchase to take home. after looking at the different meat they offered, we were called on by the hostess and seated upstairs by the kitchen which is open and we had a great view of the area where the food is expedited so we got to see everything t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> out.\n\nnicholas was our server and he was amazing. he made excellent drink and appetizer suggestions and helped us with any questions we had about the menu. we had a couple of the specialty drinks and they were all good, particularly the cosmo and french kiss. for appetizers, we had calamari, fried chicken, meatballs, sausage and peppers, and the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>. the fried chicken was a tad overcooked but everything else was amazing and tasty. they were all small plates meant to be shared family style so we each got to nibble on a little of everything. \n\nfor dinner, the table ordered two spencer steaks, the wagyu cut, the short rib <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark>, and two orders of the sea bass. everything was melt in your mouth delicious. i particularly liked the wagyu cut. it was only $22.50 and was comparable to wagyu cuts i have had on the strip for $60. we also shared mashed potatoes and heirloom carrots for the table. the stuffed mushroom and parmesan crisps t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> the steaks were very good too. \n\nfor dessert, nicholas suggested the turtle sundae and the berry sundae with hibiscus sauce for the table. they both tasted like heaven. \n\nmy dad used to be a chef and can be incredibly critical of food, service, and presentation and he thoroughly enjoyed our experience. also, every worker, whether it was a server, food runner, drink runner, manager or hostess wished my mother a happy birthday which is another reason i would recommend echo & rig. i don't know which is better, the food or service. our experience wasn't just a birthday dinner or family night out. it was truly memorable thanks to the staff and food at echo & rig. i look forward to returning for their weekend brunch and dinner again soon.", 
            "my wife and sister ate here for sunday brunch yesterday; it was my first time at the joint.  \n-the overall decor and design of the entire restaurant was very well done; utilizing natural wood grains and marble as the two major materials.  seating upstairs had a great view, the breeze and air circulation was perfect; not too stuffy and not completely exposed to the outdoors.\n-my food was really a set of good choices.  to begin, we all split an order of the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>, which are flash fried and lightly breaded and come with a pesto aioli dipping sauce.  i was surprised with my first bite, when the mushroom yielded a crispness and a snap!  they were delicious.  my individual dish was the short rib hash, which was absolutely awesome!  the potatoes, peppers, and onions were all uniformly cubed very small, allowing them to become intensely flavored with the drippings from the braised short rib.  as for the short rib itself, they generously pulled large pieces of the meat and centered it among the large pile of hash veggies.  it was topped with two perfectly poached eggs with a zesty lemon hollandaise sauce.  c'est magnifique!  \n-server was not on her game; she forgot almost everything we asked for, didn't check on our food and had other servers bring the food to us (with mistakes), and yeah...she was just blah.\n--overall.............the short rib hash is a must!!!", 
            "found in tivoli village, echo and rig is a meat lover's dream.  come here for the slabs of meat you can buy, stay for the delicious dishes they serve.  echo and rig will have your taste palates running wild like hulkamania and your stomach bursting like the chestburster from alien.  \n\na few of us went on a friday afternoon.  our friend's wife's cousin was the executive chef at the place.  he wanted to stop by and say hi.  we all followed and thought it would be best we stuff our faces at this place.  \n\nfrom the outside, you can see the various meats hanging and placed around the freezer room.  it was a sight to see.  when we went inside, the butcher welcomed us with open arms.  not only was he super friendly, but he was super handsome (just like me).  he kind of looked like james purefoy (from the t.v. series rome), but with more facial hair.  man, i'm probably way off with the look.  maybe he sort of had a brad pitt-esque facial structure.  wait...why am i talking about him?  let's talk about meat...no....not his meat, i'm talking about the restaurant meat!\n\nso, james purefoy (we'll just name the butcher that) led us into the freezer room and schooled us on the different types of meat on each animal, how you can combine each part to make something delicious, and told us some other fun facts.  did you know vikings used every single part of the animal?  thanks for the info, james!\n\nas we left the freezer room, he began to give us a little history lesson about echo and rig.  while he dropped some history on us he gave us some samples of headcheese and liver.  it was my first time having these delectable delights.  actually, i can't say they were delectable before trying them.  the thought of headcheese and liver made me dry heave.  however, i summoned enough courage to try them out and it wasn't bad at all.  the liver tasted a little salty, but i was able to down it no problem.  the headcheese tasted just like ox tail.\n\nafter mr. purefoy entertained us, we were escorted to the upstairs patio area for lunch.  we were served by the most pleasant waitress i've ever come across.  kind, gentle, sweet-- just like me on a first date.  \n\nmy friend's cousin gave us appetizers on the house.  they were <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> and fried cauliflowers.  man, hmm...hmm!  the sauces t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> these fine appetizers were also great.  i've had <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> before, but this takes the cake and smashes it in everyone else's face.\n\nfor lunch, i got the <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark>.  the <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> had short rib, white cheddar and parmesan in it.  my first bite was ecstasy-- the gooey cheese was pure bliss and the short rib was nothing short of fantastic.  if i had 20 hands i'd give this sandwich 20 thumbs up.  and don't get me started on the chips t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> with the sandwich.  the freakin' chips, man.  i need to wipe the tears from my face because i'm reminiscing about the good times i had with those chips.  i'll be sure to pour some liquor on the street because i do miss those chips. \n\necho and rig is the spot for great food and a euphoric atmosphere.  check the place out because you won't be disappointed.  and i should point this out, just because mr. purefoy would want us to:  support your local butcher!!!!",

            "2 hour wait. i was expecting a wait, but 2 hours was a bit much. was it worth 2 hours? definitely not, sorry to say! i would think t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> my hunger and grumpiness i would like anything i ate, but t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> not the case. \n\non a positive note, i liked hoe the butchers were cutting steaks and you could talk to them and sample some <mark>Sausage</mark> and such. personally, i am not a sausage fan and did not like w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> had to sample, but i believe my hubby liked this sampling. i liked the displays of meat and opportunity to interact with butchers. \n\nonce we were seated (pretty area upstairs by the way), i already knew i wanted the rip eye cap and the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> so i was ready to order. well, come to find out they were out of the rib eye cap! \n\nat t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> we had to ask for recommendations. i was a little confused by the steak choices. they had rib eye steak on the menu and rib eye steak t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> buy from precut slices t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> butchers were cutting downstairs. apparently there is a difference in the quality of them. there is also a difference in the price, major difference. i just found it weird. i mean options are great, but this was a little bit too much for me to decide. i think they should just stick to w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> they feel would taste the best. the waiter almost made the rib eye from the menu sound like something i could have bought myself at the supermarket. he was really \"selling\" the ribeye/steaks t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> brought out raw on a platter. maybe to some people they would appreciate this and it did remind me of my experience at gordon ramsay steak, but the prices were almost the same as strip prices for those cuts of meat. it almost felt like we would be making a bad choice if we chose the steak from the menu. again, why not just have one type of meat on your menu?\n\nhe claimed the fish was brought in from fisherman t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> day and i did not understand how t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> even possible?\n\nbased on the waiter's recommendation, i ordered the slow roasted short ribs with castelvetrano olives, celery, walnuts, and horseradish. i'm not going to lie, these toppings did not seem like they would go well with short ribs, but the waiter was saying it was excellent so i got it. the olives, celery, and walnuts literally looked like they were sprinkled on top after the short ribs were cooked. i don't think raw celery, uncooked olives, and chunky walnuts compliments short ribs at all! i was hoping it was maybe chopped up small and possibly cooked in some way. i've ordered short ribs often at restaurants and just never saw it made this way. it was presented on a piece of paper and board (similar to how a charcuterie would be served), also weird. i think of short ribs as having a yummy sauce t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> would want to pair with mashed potato or rice or something to enjoy the sauce with and some sort of cooked veggies. instead, the sauce was dripping off of the paper. weird presentation. \n\nmy husband's ribeye steak was good and so was the mushroom. he also enjoyed the bone marrow (i did not try it) and i liked the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>. the waiter was quick to move around and seemed to be good (except for his recommendation).\n\noverall t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> rib and the long wait did not leave me wanting to come back for more.",

            "by far, the best butcher shop in town. top quality meats from top quality farms. if you don't feel like cooking the best steaks you can buy, go upstairs to the restaurant and have a great job.  \n\ndefinitely order the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>... those are awesome.  could be a trendsetter. \nany of their sandwiches are fantastic... the blt and porchetta sandwich are my favorites\nthe crown jewel of the brunch menu is the short rib hash. \n\nthe real specialty of echo & rig is the butcher shop.  not cheap, but by far, the best quality meat you can buy in las vegas. makes the bb or vm&w look like walmart's meat case by comparison.  \n\nthey also make their own pate, sausage and other charcuterie which changes daily. always something new or unusual you don't see anywhere else.  butchers will cut to order just about anything for you as long as they have it in stock.  if you want super thin sliced shabu-shabu style, or a 50oz (4-5 inch thick) bone in ribeye... they will cut it for you.\n\nwhen i ordered pork chops, the butcher went back and brought out a whole side of pork, then broke it down by hand and hand carved some 1.5in thick rib chops, rind off, but fat ring still on.  just incredible when grilled over oak charcoal.  the fat from the niman ranch pigs is so rich and flavorful and is very soft to the bite. whereas supermarket pork chop fat ring can be tough and hard and usually have to cut it off at the plate.\n\ndefinitely buy their hamburger patties... because it is ground from their prime steak trimmings after cutting the steaks for the restaurant.  usually always available.", 
            "where to start with perfection?!  we were here in march for a worldwide catering convention and had this restaurant recommended by someone. we had 9 people in our party and were sat next to the kitchen and could watch, and hear, all the action on a busy night. \n\ndon't remember all t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> ordered but as chef was announcing the order to the kitchen he stopped and made a comment to the kitchen t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was the perfect order, we all had ordered nothing more than medium rare. \n\nwe started out with the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> and sweetbreads and as a professional chef, with 2 other chefs at the table, they were excellent!  several at the table had never had sweet breads before and are now huge fans. \n\ndinner couldn't have been better with the steaks cooked perfectly and flavored exquisitely.  well done chef!  \n\nhaving been in both the restaurant and catering business for over 25 years i understand the importance of a well trained and enthusiastic wait staff. i think t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> service and professionalism we had were among the best i have ever had, i trained for 3 years in europe at several michelin star restaurants and they could learn from the server we had. \n\ni will recommend echo and rig to everyone and will return often!",

            "after glimpsing over the online menu a few times, i was super excited to meet my friend here for girls night out yesterday. we arrived around 7:00 and expected a wait since it was friday. we were seated at a smallish table t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> and a bus buy was immediately sent over with shims to fix it. perfect. the waiter explained the menu, offered his recommendations and we were off to a normal las vegas steakhouse experience.... until the service sputtered and crashed. interestingly our section started clearing out after we ordered so i can't say it got busier for them. the first issue was the bread we were told about never came. fine. we had the amazing <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> to munch on anyways. getting water glasses refilled was a constant struggle throughout the visit. next, out steaks arrive, without steak knives. i asked for one but my friend didn't think to, assuming they'd bring for both of us. out comes one steak knife, just one. we ask for another. it comes. she had to remind the server to bring her wine. oddly, he never asked if she'd care for another glass...? look, the food is delicious, the concept is wonderful but the staff needs more training. you can't compete in a service-centric town like las vegas with mediocre wait staff. i live in the southeast so tivoli village is a hike for me. i'd give the place another shot, but maybe after they've had more time to find their service niche.", 
            "came to this place for dinner. interesting set up they have there. the bar, hostess stand, retail shop, and butcher shop is downstairs and they restaurant is upstairs. down stairs they have the bar where you can get really decently priced cocktails starting at about $8 which is great since most bars have speciality drinks starting at $12 and up. they do offer happy hour but there are only three food items on the menu so we never tried it. they have a retail store where you can buy products they use in the restaurant, and a butcher shop to buy fresh meats. there's also only one bathroom in the place and it upstairs in the dining area. there is also outdoor patio seating t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> our into the fountain of tivoli village. they also seem to have a juice bar where you can order fresh pressed juices. \n\nside plates are on the smaller side so don't expect to get full off of those. which is good because it saves your appetite for the main course. \n\nitems ordered:\n\nappetizers:\n<mark>Portobello Fries</mark>: the best <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> have ever had! the waiter swears by them. the breading they use is not bread crumbs like we expected. instead it was a smooth outer shell with a nice crunch to it. the mushroom was cooked perfectly on the inside and not mushy, underdone or burned. the aioli t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> with it for dipping is just the perfect mixture to compliment this fry. \n\n\nasparagus and a fried egg: came with i believe about 4-5 pieces of  asparagus with an over easy egg on top of it. \n\nmaryland lump <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark>: about 3-4 pieces on this plate. pretty good\n\nentrees:\nbavette: good piece of meat not to fatty. \n\nblack spaghetti pasta: delicious! the broth/sauce was so good t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> had to slurp it with every bite! a good serving portion and didn't taste overly fishy. i was a little skeptical ordering this because of the squid ink but it was delicious.",

            "finally!!! i have been lusting over echo & rig since they opened, but hadn't had a chance to visit until this weekend. i'd say t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> in all, they pretty much live up to the hype. echo and rig is located in a prime location in tivoli village. it is a beautiful restaurant.  the downstairs level has the bar and butcher shop, while the upstairs has the kitchen, dining room, and a balcony which also seats diners. the dining area is on the smaller side, but it is all very open and airy.\n\nwhen we arrived, we were informed t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> wait was about an hour. yikes! granted, it was 7:20 on a saturday night, but i wasn't expecting so long of a wait. but we were there, we were hungry, and we were not to be dissuaded from our plan. so, we moseyed up to the bar for a cocktail. i enjoyed the strawberry bliss, while my companion had the <mark>White Peach Sangria</mark>. both of the drinks were very well crafted, and all of the bartenders were really friendly and personable. i always enjoy when i can see them muddling ingredients and putting drinks together with care. my companion made an off-handed comment about the sangria being full of ice and not enough drink (because it was so good), and the bartender fixed him another at no charge! it wasn't even a complaint, and we certainly weren't expecting that.\n\nthe wait only ended up being about 35 minutes, and we were escorted upstairs to the dining room by the hostess. we were seated in a very cosy corner with the booth portion accented by lots of cute (and comfy) pillows.  our server, ramon, was very nice and made some recommendations for us. he was also serving a very large party near us, so service was on the rather leisurely (slow-ish) side.\n\nthe bread wasn't anything special, but it was soft in the middle, which i appreciated. it was served room temperature.  we initially started our meal with the octopus, which was one of ramon's picks (he talked us out of the calamari). unfortunately, it wasn't w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> expected and it wasn't exactly to our liking. it actually was like an octopus salad, with white beans and a light vinegar sauce. the octopus didn't have much flavor and was rather chewy.  this was the only negative portion of our meal. we mentioned to ramon t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> didn't really like it, and he brought out an order of calamari at no charge. the calamari was delicious! hot, lightly breaded, and had two sauces t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> equally good.\n\nthe main course.... steak! i got the ribeye, medium-rare, while my companion got the spencer steak, medium. both steaks are served with a large mushroom with breadcrumbs in it and chips. the chips seemed rather unnecessary, but they were fine. the steaks... absolutely delicious! they were highly seasoned (if you don't like salt, this may not be the right choice), and cooked perfectly. we also got a side of the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> (essentially deep fried mushrooms). they were very tasty, but i don't know if i'd order them again.\n\nthroughout our meal, one of the managers circulated to check on every table and make sure everyone was enjoying their meal, which was a nice touch. \n\necho & rig had so many yummy sounding things on their menu, t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> definitely would love to return to try some more of their offerings.",

            "i took my boyfriend here for his birthday. when we first arrived, i could barely get him to keep walking to the door as he admired all the fresh cuts of meat in the window. we had a reservation and were seated quickly. our water came out quickly as well; i chose flat, and my boyfriend chose the complimentary sparkling water. after this, the waiter took his time to come back and get our drink and appetizer orders. about fifteen minutes after our appetizer order was taken, a small loaf of bread finally came out. considering how long it had taken, i assumed the bread would be hot and fresh - but it was not. the drinks came a few minutes after; i felt they really took too long for a simple loaf of cold bread and a single cocktail.\n\nas appetizers we had the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> and <mark>Fried Spinach</mark> salad. in retrospect we probably shouldn't have had two fried things together, but t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> our fault not theirs! both appetizers were delicious and the flavors were well balanced. \n\nfor the main course, i ordered sides only as i am a vegetarian. i found they had fairly unique vegetable dishes; i didn't have to settle for a salad and baked potato like at a lot of steakhouses. i had a spicy cauliflower dish and black tuscan kale. both were excellent. my boyfriend ordered a medium ribeye and reported it was cooked perfectly.  we also shared the baked brie and sourdough with stone fruit; i really enjoyed this at first, but after it cooled the bread became tough and chewy. if you get this, make sure to eat it while it's fresh! \n\nthey brought out a complimentary caramel ice cream for the birthday boy. \n\noverall we had a great experience, but the service was slightly lacking. we both felt the initial wait for drinks and bread took too long. our waiter also seemed rushed and slightly inattentive. the busser enrique was constantly smiling and courteous; it's a little sad i remember his name but not the waiter's name! enrique certainly made more of a positive impression.   \n\noverall we gave the service 3 stars and the food 5 stars. the price was very reasonable. we will be back to try it again, but hope to have a different waiter!",

            "wow. i don't know where to begin. well, here goes nothing. \n\nthe place is beautiful! in the heart of tivoli, it's the perfect date spot. there is a bar downstairs as well as a butcher / meat shop! reminds me of home. we sat down for dinner and we were greeted by last name  by our server. for a steakhouse, it is fairly priced! the small plates (appetizers) are larger than expected! the kale, <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>, and every other small plate were perfect. we had a bottle of tempranillo ($45) and it was amazing. our steaks came out in good time and cooked perfectly. i don't recommend using their sauces, because the meat is delicious. \n\ni visited twice within 4 days. if t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> anything. \n\noverall this place, the food, and it's staff were all 5 stars to me. will be back very soon!", 
            "amazing service and we loved the outside balcony area. we had the cauliflower dish, which was amazing! the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> were really good, but very heavy, so perfect if you want to share amongst friends. the grilled octopus salad... well let's just say i still dream about it. the octopus was grilled to perfection- was not chewy at all. my favorite dish had to be the carne asada bone marrow- however, i have had it twice and they varied greatly on portion size. of course the steaks are w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> you go and they don't disappoint. they are cooked to perfection and melt in your mouth. we had the carmel turtle dessert which was also amazing... just when i thought i couldn't eat anymore i was eating this dessert. all in all, one of my favorite places off the strip!",

            "from the food to the service, this place is amazing. this is the only restaurant t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> left t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> of impression on me. our waiter (i missed his name because i went to the restroom lol) was very helpful and explain the whole menu to us. it was our first time, so it's nice when they take the time to explain the menu rather than say \"everything is good here\". for our starters, we had the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>-which is how i want my fries from now on, steak tartare-so yummy!, and the bone marrow carne asada-best one i've had! for our entrees, i had the spencer steak and it was cooked perfectly! i couldn't finish it all, but i wish i did. \n\none of the things t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> stood out to me was the service. our waiter was very helpful and really sweet. the manager, sam was very attentive. i went with my boyfriend and his friend, both of them are le cordon bleu graduates, and when his friend asked about possibly staging there, sam actually went and asked rather than just brushing it aside. we even met the butcher i believe and he talked to us during our meal! \n\ni would definitely be coming back again. this restaurant is doing everything right.", 
            "this place is a gem! an amazing destination for steaks and seafood. i've dined here 3 times and each time, everything has been impeccable. my first time was for lunch, and i am surprised the inside was packed during lunch time. but don't let t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> you, they also have a very cozy patio area with heaters if you want to go al fresco. \n\non the next 2 occasions, we made reservations because we had a large party of 8 and we were whisked right in. servers are always very courteous with plenty of recommendations if you ask. in these trips, i have tried a crazy array of their food and all of it is amazing! for appetizers, you have to get the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>. they are the best fries (potatoes and other vegetables included) t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> have ever eaten. i dream about these babies and would come here just to eat 3 orders of fries and leave (don't judge me). \n\nother noteworthy mentions include the spinach salad (not healthy, <mark>Fried Spinach</mark>, but the texture of it is incredible) and brussel sprouts. wow. their brussel sprouts are so tasty with each leaf peeled off individually and a lemony tang and crunch from pistachios. they are a must-have to offset all the protein you're about to ingest.\n\nfor proteins, we've had the filet, spencer, rib-eye, skirt, brisket, salmon, and butterfish. each protein is cooked perfectly to your request and the quality of the meats are obvious. there is no chewy stuff you have to cut off and pile onto the side of your plate. knives cut through everything in one foul stroke. although the sign of a good steak is not needing to have any condiments, they have the best condiments if you want to shake it up. i personally love the chimichurri and horseradish. lastly, it was my first time trying butterfish this week from echo & rig, and let me tell you t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> is my new favorite fish. if you're not in the mood for steak, get the butterfish!!\n\ntheir dessert menu is simple with everything being ice cream. i would like more variety, but will not complain because i still love t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> turtle sundae. if you haven't been in awhile, go back. they have added many new signature items in their menu. if you're a vegetarian, don't be afraid to come here. there are so many vegetarian and vegan options on the menu t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> will leave stuffed and happy. i love echo & rig and think it is an amazing gem in suburban las vegas with the perfect price point and atmosphere. don't even think about going to the <mark>Chai</mark> steakhouse down the street when you can be receiving great quality for the same price.", 
            "i really wanted to like this place, my boyfriend and i had been wanting to try it out for months, some were excited to give it a shot. we were seated quickly, but ignored after t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> about 15 minutes, when the waitress finally came to take our drink orders, she blamed the hostesses for the wait, kind of annoying. my boyfriends ice tea came out pretty quickly, but my glass of wine took forever, so did the water for the table, so i was left without any thing to drink for quite a while. it also took forever for the server to come back and get our order, in fact, the server didn't come back, another person came and took our order, odd but, okay. they finally brought us some bread, which wasnt even warm and was nothing special, but it made no matter because the server took it away before we could finish it, weird! the appetizer of <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> was good, probably the best thing we ate, though the portion was quite small, and once again it was taken off the table before we could finish, kind of awkward. the arugula salad was next, and poorly dressed, with whole peppercorns lurking beneath, waiting to bust a tooth, hah. my boyfriend had the horseradish crusted butterfish with roasted veggies. the butterfish was not horseradish crusted nor did it really seem to be butterfish, it was cooked well, but had zero taste. the roasted veggies were still raw and unpleasant to eat. i had a filet, which came out so overcooked some portions of the crust were burned, also, the meat was flavorless. the garlic chips were flavorless, the  stuffed mushrooms garnish was also flavorless. the garlic mashed potatoes were okay, but seemed as though we were served the bottom of the barrel, because they were lumpy and cold. the squash with maple and rosemary was okay, but there were parts t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> so overly roasted t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> were hard and completely inedible. i was picking pieces out of my mouth. yuck! we didn't bother with desert. all in all, the service was lack luster and inattentive and the food was bland, and overpriced. we left wishing we had eaten at honey salt.", 
            "there aren't many places t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> my socks off or blow my hair back...but this is one of them. the ambiance is top notch for a new age bar with a classic and sophisticated vibe. \n\ni figured t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> to a butcher/meat restaurant t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> would be looking for a steak or a sandwich with some meat on it. i asked my waiter (who pretty much lived up to every  expectation t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'ve ever had of a waiter, his name was jeffrey and he's worth requesting) w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> favorite sandwich was. he admits t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was a meat junky but his favorite sandwich was the <mark>Drunken Goat</mark> and it didn't even have meat on it. it was legit and worth the drive from downtown las vegas. the brussel sprouts and the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> were great. the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> are a super up version of salt, cheese, and lightly battered shrooms that, once dipped in the aoli sauce will leave you wishing you had more...and for $5, com'on man!!!",

            "i went to sw steakhouse at the wynn last night ( i will post a review shortly) and echo & rig was so much better, i felt i owed it to them to post a review. \nfirst, it has been a long time since i have received service like we did at e&r. the hostess was very polite and friendly, but at the time i just assumed she was bubbly. little did i know t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> entire staff was going to be t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>. although it was packed, our waiter came over taking drink orders and introducing himself. water and bread were there immediately. the manager came over, introduced himself, thanked us for coming, and told us to let him know if we needed anything. and the service didn't stop. suffice it to say the waiter and bus people were as attentive as any, without bothering us--meaning they kept an eye on us to make sure we didn't need anything, and to get it if we did.\nfor starters, we my wife had baked brie. it was delicious. i had <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark>. they were good; my wife thought they were some of the best she's had. we also shared an order of <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>--they were addicting. definitely get them. my wife had the butterfish for her entr\\u00e9e. she thought it was going to be like sea bass, very flaky and buttery, but thought it was much closer to halibut in taste and texture. she enjoyed it, thought it was prepared perfectly, but was expecting something else-not e&r's fault. i had rib-eye cap which was great and cooked perfectly. we also had broccolini--very tasty--and garlic mashed potatoes--just right. for dessert we had ice cream t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> as good as any you will have anywhere. \nfinally, the manager returned, thanked us again, gave us his card, and told us to call if we ever need anything. it really felt like an old style vegas gourmet room where they treat everybody like a high roller. it was awesome.", 
            "w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> pleasant surprise.  i've been to echo & rig only once, but the overall experience will undoubtedly keep me coming back.  \n\nfor starters, the service is excellent, from the host to the asst. gm.  the staff is not only friendly, but passionate about their food.  the dishes we selected on our own were good, but the dishes t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> recommended to us were exceptional.  another important attribute, the prices are reasonable for w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> produce.  \n\non to the meal:\nthe restaurant offers complimentary purified still or sparkling water.  this is a nice touch, one i wish more restaurants would adopt.\n\n<mark>Portobello Fries</mark> & herb aioli\nthey call this one of their signature dishes and it was the first item t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> recommended to us.  we were not let down, the fries were delicious. they're not too greasy/heavy and the aioli is a perfect accompaniment.  \n\nsteak tartare\ni love a good steak tartare and echo and rig deliver a great version.  the dish is well balanced and the <mark>Toast</mark> bread is a good vessel to deliver the meat with just the right amount of crunch.  the caper/beef combo is so delicious.  \n\nbrussels sprouts, pistachio & fresh lemon\nthis was probably the most basic item we ordered, but t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> no way is a criticism.  in comparison to other dishes, the flavors were simple, which i often welcome in a vegetable dish.  great crisp in the leaves, just the right amount of citrus.\n\n<mark>Fried Spinach</mark>\nwe were about to order the arugula salad, but knowing we were open to recommendations, the server steered us towards the <mark>Fried Spinach</mark>.  this is one of my favorite dishes of the night.  flash frying the spinach, gave it a kale-chip like texture.   throw in the chile-lime vinaigrette and thinly-sliced red onions and you have harmony on a plate.  the vinaigrette was almost sweet, but just the right amount to play off the spinach and onions.  bravo.\n\ncauliflower, chili de arbol, crispy shallots & onions\nanother impressive and inventive dish.  the cauliflower almost tasted candied.  there were so many layers of flavor and texture, i'm not sure i can do a technical description any justice.  \n\nthe spencer steak\nthis was an excellent cut of meat.  cooked to perfection, the steak was tender and smokey (they say their steaks are cooked over red oak).  we sampled three of the steak sauces - charred onion, red wine demi and brandied mushroom, which i liked in t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>.  i didn't always taste the garlic in their garlic-chips, but they were tasty nonetheless. the mushroom rockefeller was so good.  \n\ndessert - caramel turtle\nanother staff pick, the salted-caramel sundae topped with peanut brittle, whipped cream, bourbon sauce, etc. was quite good.  their dessert menu is entirely sundaes or an option for seasonal berries and sorbet.  \n\n\non top of everything, the restaurant contains a full bar and wait for it...  a butcher shop!  i don't know about you, but this is exciting for me.  it's a very smart concept and one t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> adds to the culture of the restaurant.  on my next visit, i'll likely take home some cuts of meat and wood (assuming it's red oak), for my home bbq.  \n\ni look forward to returning to try some of the other dishes t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was simply too full to order.", 
            "ambiance: 5 - this place is pretty fancy. it was nice from the bottom to the top. you walk from a curved staircase at the bottom into the eating area located at the top. it's fairly romantic inside at night, and everyone is either dressed fancy or in their casual, yet appropriate sunday clothes. \n\ni would suggest this for an intimate date night. 3rd or 4th date, maybe? it's a \"will you be my girl?\" or a \"fancy some dinner after work, dear?\" kinda place. \n\nservice: 5 - like i have said many times before, no one knows service like summerlin does. this place is just excellent. the servers basically treat you like you are the only table they have. he was quick and efficient, except at the end, where he took a while to get us our check. it was just so refreshing to have amazing service for once. probably the best service i have received at a restaurant in my life. \n\nfood: 2 - we ordered the spencer steak, the rib-eye cap, calamari, <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>,  <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark>, and pork belly. \n\ni thought my spencer steak and pork belly was a little dry. the pork was definitely overcooked and a bit hard. i don't know if it was just t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>, but i was pretty disappointed..it just wasn't as great as i thought it would be. \n\nthe best thing i had t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>. don't let the rest of the review fool you. the fries were really good. they should have given me two! <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> for life!!",

            "the outside of our tomahawk steak was burnt and the inside undercooked. the outside crust was not done right and the service was subpar with our server non attentive and even a bit passive aggressive. perhaps it was because my partner and i were dressed casually in a tee shirt and jeans but with the bill hovering around $160 i still expected good service.\n\nthe fried calamari is dismissible and not fried crispy. the bacon is delicious however and i would recommend their <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>. it's just disappointing t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> steak was cooked wrong and rather tasteless. perhaps it was the thickness of the cut, but it's still surprising considering that's their main offering. will likely not be coming back or recommending others to dine here. the venue and bathrooms are nice though.",

            "i just created a yelp account for the sole purpose of raving about this restaurant. i would give it 6 stars if i could. \n\nfirst of all, the ambiance was beautiful. all of the dining tables are upstairs where you have the choice of eating inside or outside on the patio. we chose outside and every single table had a beautiful view of the giant fountain below with pretty lights hanging tastefully to give it the right mood. and to top it all off, they have their own private butchery downstairs where you can buy all the meats they cook at a very reasonable price. \n\nnow, my fianc\\u00e9 and i both worked many years in the fine dining restaurant service industry in south florida, and those of you who are \"in the biz\" know we have unreasonably high standards when it comes to service in a restaurant because we're fully aware of w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> best of the best constitutes. well, with t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> mind, the service staff at echo & rig completely surpassed my unreasonably high expectations. arriiana (who, if you read on, is already yelp-famous) was so cute and friendly; she just set a great mood for the rest of the dining experience. as soon as we sat, we were welcomed by xavier, the manager, who was extremely likable and helped to make sure we were taken care of the entire night. also, w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> out to me and impressed me the most about xavier is that (because i'm overly observant) he made sure to be a friendly, helpful presence to not only us, but every single table in t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>! i watched as he seemed to effortlessly make a connection with every table while at the same time having great synergy with his staff, which shows a true understanding of w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> is. \n\nnot only that, but the service staff was obviously trained very well. we had sam as our server, who was friendly and very knowledgable of the menu.  sam was also t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> balance of attentive but not overbearing. we never got the feeling of being ignored or pushed out of our table, which can often time ruin your experience. we will definitely be asking for sam again.  \n\nnow for the food! (sorry this is so long, but if you're like me, these details are important when you're looking to try out a new restaurant)\n\ni wanna start out by saying everything we ordered was beyond delicious. i felt like i was a judge on the season finale of top chef and the chef contestants were making it impossible for me the choose a winner. \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> and baked brie for starters. my fianc\\u00e9 ordered the bavette cut steak and i ordered the skirt steak. we shared a side of broccolini and garlic mashed potatoes and then shared the caramel turtle ice cream for dessert. \n\n...i'm going to have a hard time not ordering t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> combination of food every time we dine here because it was so amazingly good. \n\nit's safe to say this is my new favorite restaurant!!",

at a mere fraction of the cost.\n\nnow approaching its third year in business, and outlasting concepts from several more 'celebrated' chefs with nearly universal accolades arriving from locals since opening its doors, echo & rig pairs the all-too-common farm-to-table concept with in-house butchery in the style of a steakhouse and leveraging the later knowledge of sourcing and artisan cuts to curtail costs the restaurant happily outstrips the likes of nearby flemming's while retaining a local sort of feel, the two-story building upscale yet extremely comfortable with a feel t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> welcoming whether one is seated in a jacket inside or sporting sandals with a glass of wine in hand under misters on the second-floor patio outdoors.\n\nadmittedly known to the restaurant as a result of reaching out to management with questions regarding the concept and thoughts pertaining to the echo & rig's longterm success in a complex where little else has thrived, it was on arrival t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> party was escorted to a sizeable four-top at the top of the stairs and greeted by a handful of the restaurant's sizable staff the evening started out with a comprehensive rundown of the menu followed by a complimentary plate of housemade charcuterie joining warm bread and butter as cocktails were sipped and an order was put forth.\n\nserved largely by a man named brian, first described as the restaurant's best waiter and later as a 'brand ambassador,' it was not long after ordering a first course of food t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> plates began to arrive and treated to a bowl of crispy cauliflower tinged in spice along with the items t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'d ordered one would be hard pressed to name a single bite t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> not shine, the signature <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> probably the weakest of the items as seasoning seemed to obscure more earthy notes while both the housemade sausage and ricotta with fruit and honey were entirely irresistible, the same to be said of vegetables t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> simple yet satisfying while the '<mark>Grilled Cheese</mark>' was every bit the crowd pleaser t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> would contend.\n\nalready questioning an order t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> quite large when accounting for portion sizes and enticing presentations t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> it difficult to resist finishing each plate, entrees saw four prime proteins paired to a trio of sides and although the \"santa maria rub\" unfortunately served only to overwhelm one friend's tri-tip, the quality of an enormous pounded pork cutlet and both the spencer as well as the cap were undeniable, the sides a bit of a mixed bag with both corn and potatoes pleasant amidst their accoutrements while the mac & cheese featuring \"seven cheeses\" was nothing more than run of the mill.\n\nunfortunately short-selling on desserts, an odd choice for a place going so far as to bake their own bread, it was in a duo of sundaes t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> bites were invested and although both were well comprised of high quality ingredients one can't help but wonder how much better the experience could be with a dedicated pastry chef, or even a cheese board considering the fact t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> brie is featured amongst the side plates while candied fruits served with the ricotta were also quite good.", 
            "came here for a late lunch with some friends and i have to say i really enjoyed myself. we started with the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>, parfait, then had the <mark>Eggs Any Style</mark> which had eggs, bacon, sausage, potatoes, and toast. let's just say we had leftovers and our bellies were well filled by the time we got home. granted this restaurant is off the strip, but definitely well worth driving out to. enjoy!", 
            "echo & rig, even though off the strip, presents the best t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> has to offer when it comes to steakhouses. our party of 7 had 4 newbies to the restaurant, and, to no surprise, e&r lived up to the hype t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> discussed.\n\nwe had two sets of appetizers for the table, including:\n- <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> (with an incredible aioli)\n- roasted cauliflower (perfect blend of heat and breading)\n\ni also ordered the blood and bourbon, a great cocktail to start off the dinner. for the main entree, most of us had the rib eye cap. a unique cut, the steak basically melted in your mouth.  there aren't too many steaks t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> up with e&r's cap. \n\necho & rig has become a staple every time we come to vegas now. the service is top notch - thanks to xavier, brian, frank and crew!",

'nuff said.\n\ndessert...\ncappuccino sundae - pound cake!!! yes, there's pound cake in the bottom! it also has chocolate shavings and fudge!\n\ncaramel turtle sundae - bourbon and salted caramel ice cream. that's all you need to know about this dish!\n\nthe service was spectacular. they changed our utensils everytime a new dish came out. filled our water everytime it was empty. i felt bad t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was making the servers work. oh well. great service!\n\nbottom line: would come here again.",

            "went to echo & rig after having walked by it hundreds of times while i was at tivoli village with my fianc\\u00e9. made a 6:15 reservation, we arrived nearly on time and maybe waited 5 minutes for our table? we were seated on the covered patio and it was lovely, comfortable furniture, pleasant views and several misters t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> it nice and cool though it was quite warm out. \n\nthe manager came over and greeted us and introduced himself, welcoming us to our first time there and introduced our waiter, i believe the waiter was ari and the manager was jason. very friendly and though i knew they have a thing for trying to make you feel like family (i had read reviews t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> it) it did not come as fake or contrived. \n\nwait staff was very good, they made sure our water glasses were never less than half full and cleared dirty plates very quickly. though some could have smiled a bit more, they all looked so serious. our waiter made a point to ask about food allergies and took the time to explain where they get all their proteins and vegetables, which is always appreciated. he also explained t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> do not charge a corking fee if you want to bring your own wine. i know of many places t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> and rarely see anyone bring their own bottle while almost every table t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> seated around us had indeed brought their own wine. \n\nfood was absolutely great. they have a somew<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> up where there is appetizer section but they have \"small plates\" which act as sides and appetizers.  we ordered the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> and they were fantastic. they were crispy and thankfully were not t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> as mushrooms tend to be and the basil aioli was delightful. \n\nmy fianc\\u00e9 got a rib eye and i had the filet tenderloin. both were cooked well (we ordered them rare and medium rare) we also got the avocado toast and lamb cigars as sides and we were not disappointed at all. steaks were tender and juicy and the sides were cooked perfectly with a lot of flavor. \n\noverall it was an excellent experience and we will definitely be returning soon to try more of the wonderful food.", 
            "everything about this place deserves 5 stars. we sat outside on the patio and it's kept so cool, i almost forgot we were in vegas. i recommend asking to be seated outside, the ambience is great. the food was so good, from the appetizers to dessert. we started the meal off with <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> & calamari, the dipping sauces were delicious! for my my entree i ordered the lasagna which exceeded my expectations. (this isn't an italian restaurant and they quite obviously specialize in steaks) for dessert we had the seasonal sorbet & berries, apple pie & the caramel turtle. all amazing. will definitely be back soon. the service was also extremely great, everyone was so kind and helpful. if you're looking for more than a meal, go here.. it's a great experience.", 
            "i took my girlfriend here for dinner the other night and i have to say it was hands down one of the best dining experiences i've ever had... ever. the food was amazing and the service was exceptional.  you must try the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>, that's all i have to say.", 
            "great service, great food, great atmosphere.  if you haven't tried this local gem, you're missing out.  today we had the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> and split a burger.  everything was perfect.", 
            "my parents found this place the last time they were in vegas and they wanted to show it off to the family on this trip. we made reservations for our first night in vegas. we got here a little early for our reservation and hung out downstairs for a little bit. i checked out the butcher shop they had downstairs and they had some nice looking pieces of meat. it's super smart for them to have a butcher shop right down stairs, lets you know t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> meat is super fresh. when everyone arrived we went up to our table. we were seated in the back away from most of the customers, it was much appreciated t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> got our own little private area. we brought a bottle of wine and the host t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> us joked t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was a $100 corkage fee, it gave some of my relatives a heart attack, but then she told us she was just kidding around and said they didn't have a corkage fee. i don't think i've ever been anywhere t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'t have a corkage fee so t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> gracious of them. i really liked the style of this place, it was fancy, but a little rustic. the room balanced itself out, nothing too over the top, except for maybe t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> chandelier in the center of it all, but hey this is vegas. \n\nour server, ramone, was exceptionally helpful. he recommended t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> all share their 42 ounce tomahawk because they slice it up and make it family style. i wanted to try the duck, but the rest of my family decided to share the steak so i went with it. we also ordered a few appetizers to start, they all sounded incredible. i picked the pork belly with slaw and the chile cauliflower. the rest of my family also ordered the carne asada bone marrow, grilled octopus and <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>. it didn't take too long for our appetizers, and they all came at the same time. we each got a small portion of every appetizer. the cauliflower wasn't as spicy as i thought it would be, it was actually more on the sweet side. we asked ramone w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> the dish sweet, he told us there were pieces of garlic t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> caramelized in brown sugar. even though the dish wasn't as spicy as i expected it to be, it was still wonderful. those caramelized pieces of garlic were and unexpected delight. the cauliflower was roasted and had a nice bite to it. my mom loved the cauliflower dish, it was her favorite. the pork belly was marinated in a savory soy sauce and served on top of cabbage slaw. the pork melted in my mouth and the slaw gave the dish a refreshing crunch. the carne asada bone marrow was really innovative and unique. i've never seen another bone marrow dish like it. the addition of the citrusy carne asada and red onions gave the bone marrow more than just one note. it really freshened up a normally rich and heavy dish. the octopus was grilled to perfection and the sauce was tangy and clean. lastly the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>, the dish t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> thought i would like the least actually turned out to be my favorite. i'm not a big mushroom fan and i especially don't like portobello mushrooms, but i could eat these all day. they had an excellent crispy coating t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> seasoned well with freshly chopped basil and parmesan cheese. i'm not sure w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> sauce was, but it was thick, bright green and very addicting. i would come back just for t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>. next came the salads, which i didn't order or try, but they all looked good. \n\ni did use the bathroom a couple times here and it's lovely, clean and has a lot of space. i liked the single couch they had in the front of the restroom, it gave the room a charming touch. i also noticed they had a balcony with seats. they had a good view of the elegant round about and other shops and restaurants. next time i want to sit out there. \n\nlastly our glorious steak came along with a couple of sides. the steak came with house made potato chips and stuffed mushroom. we also ordered the broccolini side. the steak was cooked medium rare, but it was more rare on the inside pieces. no one seemed to mind though because it was just melt in your mouth, meaty deliciousness. we also got some sauces with our steak. everyone ordered separate sauces and we got them all free with our steak. the favorite was the red wine demi-glace. i soaked my steak in demi and got some thick and creamy horse radish sauce on the side. i also had a couple potato chips and a small serving of broccolini. the steak was unbeatable, it was obviously treated with love and care. the demi was like a gravy and the horseradish brought some zest. the chips were thin and s<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> like glass in between your teeth. the broccolini had a nice bite. it was served with whole cloves of cooked, soft garlic and was seasoned with red pepper flakes which brought some spicy heat. i love broccolini and they did this vegetable right. everything here was absolutely delicious. \n\nnot only was this place amazingly delicious, but the prices were low. the steak t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> shared was just $100 and each appetizer was under $10. this is definitely our new to go place in vegas, such a special find.", 
            "everything is so amazing. i always get the tri-tip with the caramelized onion sauce. <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> are amazing. the grilled cauliflower is amazing. the seabreeze drink is amazing. everything is amazing. come here all the time. the new blonde manager was extremely friendly and introduced herself, the seabreezes made me forget her name. our waiter was very attentive as was the buster t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> constantly cleaning the table. \n\non a side note, the hostess was extremely professional. there was another lady ahead of us t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> complaining about waiting for 10 minutes  to be seated and was extremely snarky and rude to the hostess. the hostess just smiled and apologized and remained professional. \n\nwe will be back, as always!!!", 
            "this place was very, very nice. one of the nicest places i've been to in a while and my dad and his lady took my boyfriend and i out to dinner. we had an amazing sunset dinner, on the balcony. i had a piece of skirt steak i believe it was just alright i wasn't crazy about it and side of asparagus.\n\nthe setting, the food, and the atmosphere really made this an enjoyable dinner while visiting in town for the week. \n\nour table ordered everything from the steak tartare, to the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>, to the  <mark>1/2-inch Thick Grilled Bacon</mark> with bbq sauce which the bacon was made in house ( it was the best bacon i've ever had). my boyfriend loves the oysters too, and the men had the butterfish and were raving about it.", 
            "i've lived in vegas for years and went here for the first time with some work associates for dinner.  decor is good, but their is nothing to dampen sound (carpets , partitions, etc.) so it is extremely loud when it gets busy which it was.  very difficult to carry on a conversation, felt like i was at a concert almost.  \n\nwaitstaff and manager beth were very attentive and very eager to please.  forgot our server's name but he had this attitude like he certainly didn't want to be there which became evident throughout the night.  he showed us some large plate of meat cuts and i never understood w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was for as his explanation was very lacking and the large cuts of steak he showed us weren't on the menu.  \n\nwe ordered and our food came out within a normal time frame.  <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> were amazing, steak tartare was ok, appearance was average but it was drenched in some kind of sauce.\n\nour main course arrived and everything looked good, however my friends \"medium well\" filet was definitely not even close to that.  once it was cut into it was plain to see it was on the rare side of rare.  we found out t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> member of the table had ordered the same thing and the serving staff had served the wrong food to both of them.  beth offered another steak to replace it and after we had all finished eating her replacement steak arrived.  it was supposed to be \"medium well\" but they barely managed to get it to \"medium rare\".  \n\nwe ordered some dessert and again the wait staff mixed up orders and served the wrong item to the wrong person. nothing like paying to serve your own food. \n\nwe asked for separate checks and after an extraordinary amount of time our server ensured to point out multiple times t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> gratuity was not included on the checks.  he seemed to be hovering over us as we signed our bills as he scooped them up almost immediately - can we get a little privacy or peace please?  sheesh.\n\noverall - meh.  waitstaff is attentive but unable to properly serve food.  for being a steakhouse, the kitchen can't seem to cook a steak properly.  cost is far too much for the level of service received and quality/portion size of the food.   definitely more than $$ place. \n\ncross this off the list places i will go again.  i don't mind paying for great service and great food, prefer it actually but there are plenty of other steakhouses in town worth paying this much for ok service and improperly cooked steaks (think outback).", 
            "this place is the ultimate spot for lunch or dinner, but their brunch is out of this world. \n\nthe brunch menu offers both savory and sweet options, from benedicts to <mark>Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes</mark>. i started my order with a classic bloody mary (a bloody mary isn't on the menu but they will make one for you t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> fresh and still has a great kick.) we also ordered the restaurants <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> served with a herb aioli ($9) as a starter. the fries are a signature item for the spot and they go through more portobello mushrooms than any other restaurant in las vegas. the breading was light and the mushrooms were sliced at a great size, plus i'm a sucker for any aioli.\n\nin addition to being a restaurant echo & rig is also a butcher shop which made savory an easy decision for my main brunch plate. i decided on the short rib hash ($15) and i was so glad i did. the short rib was perfectly cooked and the potatoes and peppers were diced to the perfect consistency. plus the hollandaise sauce had a dash of paprika on top which i was obsessed with. my friend got the same hash as me and my other friend got the <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> ($12) which was also stuffed with short rib and was equally unreal.  \n\ni capped off brunch with a final cocktail from their signature cocktail menu. i got the echo gimlet ($9) which was beyond refreshing, sweet and delicious! it was a vodka based cocktail with peach and mint, definitely one of the better cocktails i've had in my brunch explorations. they also offer bottomless bubbly ($16) if that's your thing, which it totally should be.\n\nif it's a beautiful day (hello, las vegas) take advantage of their outdoor balcony seating offering lovely views of tivoli village. \n\nlove this spot, a favorite for lunch and weekend brunch. i will absolutely be coming back for dinner soon.",

            "i came in without a reservation, but it was a wednesday night and a bit slow, so the maitre d got us seated quickly and courteously. they messed up on the guest note and put \"mr.\" down on my girlfriend's name, which was funny because they addressed me by my girlfriend's name, but that's not a big deal, especially considering how great of a time we had.\n\nquick note on the restaurant layout: the restaurant itself is upstairs and the floor is lovely with plenty of spacing between tables and a nice view of the tivoli roundabout. not loud. very pleasant.\n\nour server was ricky and he was amazing. so friendly, funny, and he gave us such a great overview of the menu and explanation of specific items. we started with two cocktails: the le passion, which was great, very well balanced, and the white lightning, which was way too sweet for my taste, but maybe i shouldn't have chosen a cocktail with brown sugar in it. then ricky recommended the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> as a starter and they were a revelation. you must try them.\n\nfor our meal we had the kale salad, which was sweet, light, exactly w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'d expect, then followed with tie-dye salmon, which was incredibly moist and went perfectly with the asparagus one coconut rice its served with. the kitchen also sent us a cauliflower and chile dish gratis, but i can't remember the name of it. it was incredible, a perfect balance of sweetness and spice. i'll certainly order it when i'm back.\n\nwe finished with sundaes: one with all three sorbets and the other and apple sundae, which tasted like an apple a la mode. both were absolutely delicious, but also enormous. i expected them to be medium in size like the other dishes we had, but no, these things were enormous. definitely meant to be shared. \n\noverall it was a great night. i'd highly recommend this place. and if you call in a reservation, ask for ricky as your server.", 
            "i made reservations for my boyfriend's birthday - dinner for us. they have contact information to make reservations ahead of time on their website, but i wanted to try my new app, and it worked successfully! the restaurant had our reservation with no hiccups. \nwe had gotten there about 15 minutes earlier than the reservation time 'cause i figured there'd still be a night crowd on a sunday, and i had read previous yelp reviews about patrons still having to wait even though reservations were made. anyway... we get there, and i was right. there were 2 large groups and a few couples already waiting at the hostess' podium. i think i overheard someone say t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was helping another group settle in, but no biggie. she was nice and c<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> it up with us when showing us to our table, and it only took us about 10 minutes to get to our table after checking in. in t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> frame, the boyfriend got to look around the butcher shop which he found cool and unique for a vegas restaurant. \nshortly after being seated, the manager, lisa, introduced herself and wished my boyfriend a \"happy birthday.\" t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> quite thoughtful of her. also noticed t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> checked on other patrons throughout the night as well. now t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> impressive for a manager 'cause i rarely see that. our server ramon and his assistant was just as friendly and helpful/knowledgeable when it came to answering my boyfriend's questions about the menu. they checked on us repeatedly throughout the meal, making sure we were happy with the food and drinks, etc. i didn't think they'd do anything else beside wishing him a \"happy birthday,\" but they brought us ice cream with a birthday candle to share. lol. no wonder ramon's assistant conveniently forgot to bring us a dessert menu. thank goodness they don't sing to their patrons! t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'ve been mortifying! xd onto actual food and drinks... \nwe had ordered the lamb cigars & tzatziki sauce t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> extremely yummy, especially with the sauce, but really potent when you mix in the pickled onions(?). then comes the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> & herb aioli -  breading gives it enough crunch to match the texture of the portobello and the sauce pairs so well! he couldn't stop eating those, and he was hesitant at first. there was also roasted garlic mashed potatoes & white cheddar - wanted more of that, but the boyfriend limited w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> shared with me. we both ordered the rib-eye, cooked differently, and the chefs had made 'em right! love the char on it, but i love how tender the meat was overall. i didn't really have to struggle cutting through it (t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> or as leftovers). oh my gah... the salted caramel ice cream they brought out with a candle was amazing! it wasn't overly sweet, and i love the candied peanuts it was topped with. i'm not really a fan of caramel, but t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> an impressive find! \nafter dinner, they didn't rush us to leave or make us feel guilty for taking our time talking more, which i like and appreciate. the cool ending was t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> manager wished us a good night and hoped to see us for another celebration. not gonna lie, but i'm seriously contemplating it for sooner rather than later. food and service is worth going back here.", 
            "wow.... \nmeat lovers paradise. \nwe experienced echo & rig in a celebration of our son entering his 20s, and couldn't have picked a better spot. walking up to the door and you're face to rump with a pig hanging in the window. fantastic! my kids raised pigs so this was awesome to see. we had made reservations so didn't have a wait, although i feel as though we missed out on the atmosphere and goings on at the bar area. we were met by the maitre d once seated, who then introduced us to nick, our waiter. after talking to nick, he brought out the tray, steaks with bones..including the flintstone or as they call it a tomahawk. impressive...but far too much meat. we all ventured on a spencer (you'll know when you go) with different sauces. we also shared a cesar salad and the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>. again...fantastic! our glasses never emptied, which was nice. for dessert nick recommended the salted turtle sundae, which we shared and he also brought out a complimentary birthday sundae. we had a great time, and enjoyed our wait staff and appreciate the service they provided. \nalso....my husband enjoyed the bath salts and was happy they had them in the wash room. now i have to get some for him.\nlooking forward to our next visit to echo & rig, i want to try the burger or the blt...so it will be in the near future.\nenjoy!!!", 
            "pretty good steaks and sides. i liked the arugula salad, <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>, lamb cigars, and blue and black margarita. my steak was rib eye cap and it was tasty. i will go back for the tomahawk steak.", 
            "excellent service, the  <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> are must to try, i went for my birthday  last year and this year was even  better, now they  have oysters, i ate a full dozen and they were delicious,  beth stop to our table to wish  me happy  birthday,  everything  was amazing  like always,  thanks  to everyone  and thanks  to chef sam marvin", 
            "great deal for drinks and mini apps during happy hour at the bar (starts at 3pm.)\n\naside from that, i've always had great service and food whenever i come here. the prices are not too shabby at all when you consider w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'re getting.\n\nthe tomahawks are, heck, pretty much anything from the steak specialties are bomb. great sides too, like their grilled octopus or <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>.\n\nvery nice restaurant/butchershop on the local side of vegas.", 
            "i should be biased to be writing a review of a steakhouse since i'm not one to love steak. anyways, this place alone deserves the greatest praise for customer service. customer service is everything when it comes to dining in to a fancy restaurant. a group of us were here for dinner during our last weekend in vegas as suggested by our friends who live here to try this place out as it raves awesome reviews. \n\nfrom beginning to end, service was impressive. the waiter offered us water (with a complimentary choice of still or sparkling) all around and the way t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> all presented themselves in pouring our drinks were quite the service. our waters were constantly filled even when it was only half way. they even poured the rest of my cider when i drank just enough to fill up my cup again. the waiter who served us brought different cuts of meat and explained the different types of meats we could get. he offered recommendations as well to preferences we may have had. very informative to any questions we had. \n\neveryone else on my table got steak but me of course. i got the <mark>Roasted Chicken</mark> sandwich with a side of <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> & herb aioli. all our entrees came with potato chips as a side. as much as i love potato chips, these were too salty for me. the chicken was tasty, the sauces made the sandwich more flavorful. the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> is a must! it was really good with the aoli sauce t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> the perfectly battered crisp fries.  it was the highlight of my meal. it has a unique taste to it but its full of flavor. \n\nbut really, if you're a steak lover, this would be the place for you as it's well known for their steak cuts. they also came out with a complimentary dessert for our friend who was celebrating her birthday and so we all sang for her. i would recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a nice place and atmosphere to celebrate something special. \n\nbtw, use the sea salt scrub in the bathroom, it's makes your skin so soft! fancy bathroom for a fancy restaurant. the view outside overlooked the big beautiful christmas tree out in the courtyard. go outside and take a picture as it makes for a great background during the holidays!", 
            "been here a few times. the bone marrow soup was excellent and so is the duck with forbidden rice. beth the manager couldn't be a better hostess. and the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>?! to die for. must go", 
            "was invited here for a birthday dinner. we had a large party and to my surprise we were seated outside. it was a tad chilly outside, but they had heat lamps so it wasn't too bad. not too fancy and big menu selection with decent prices. (small salads: $9.30 & $11.40, soups $5.90, sandwiches $12.40, seafood dishes $21.70, entrees $19.60, side dishes $5.90/8.20/9.80, and various steak prices from $25.70-34.80) \n\nstarted out with the first thing t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> our eye on the menu: portabello fries & herb aioli. so incredibly delicious! deep fried giant slices of mushrooms t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> to die! if they weren't about 10$ an order, i think we would have gladly ordered 5 of those alone! \n\nfor him: he ordered the colorado lamb porterhouse chops t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> with peewee potatoes, dried apricots and violet mustard. well cooked and flavored, okay size for a $20 steak. he asked if there was a way to get a side of rice and they said no... even though i swear i saw rice included with a few of the entrees. but he devoured the whole thing easily and was overall satisified.\n\nfor her: i ordered the jumping beef which were filet mignon tips, roasted tomatoes, red onions, crispy potatoes and peruvian demi-glace. very flavorful i must say, but was a little disappointed with only 4 little pieces of meat and the \"crispy potatoes\" it was topped with were french fries. i did enjoy the roasted tomatoes! luckily i wasn't too hungry from already eating the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> and bread with butter, otherwise i don't think this meal would have filled me up ordinarily. \n\noverall, a good dining experience. wasn't too happy about being outdoors in the cold weather (and i would complain about t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> if i wasn't dressed warmly t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> with a long sleeve sweater & thigh high boots) and would have loved to dine inside, but the service was excellent and food was flavorful! wouldn't say it's a place i would want to eat at often, but definitely nothing negative to say either. definitely a place to try if you are a steak enthusiast!"

            "my family and i thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant. we were celebrating my brothers birthday, and despite not having a reservation, they were able to accommodate our party of 7 adults and 4 kids with no problem. we sat on the terrace, which was quite lovely. the service was great! we are kind of an intimidating bunch, but the waiter did a great job of taking care of us. being italian, we order our own dishes, but immediately start passing around bites of everything when our food arrives. \n\nthe food:\napps/small plates\ngarlic shrimp - this was very tasty! the shrimp are swimming in a buttery garlicky concoction, which we enjoyed dipping our bread in after. \n\n<mark>Portobello Fries</mark> - these little buggers were addicting! none of us could decide if we loved them or not, but they went so fast, i have to say we did. \n\n<mark>1/2-inch Thick Grilled Bacon</mark> - not t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> feel there is anything left to say after bacon, but this was the highlight of the meal! despite having ordered 3 orders of the bacon, we opted for a 4th, and at the request of the pickiest eater at the table no less!\n\nmain courses\nst louis ribs - the rub on these things were to die for! there are several sauces t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> can dip it in, and each was delicious. \n\nshort rib <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> - phenomenal! \n\nfilet (bone out) - very well seasoned and cooked. this was the dish my youngest brother ordered. he ordered it medium well, and it came out more medium. he actually discovered t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> liked it better t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>. \n\nlamb chops - while delicious, my brother is a big boy, and the serving size was smaller t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> expected. \n\ndessert\nberry shortcake and caramel turtle - both desserts were top notch! \n\nall in all, a great night out. we would definitely return!", 
            "i said i'd give them another chance, i did, and it warrants a new review and additional star.\n\nmy visit was for brunch again and this experience was much better. i didn't have a reservation this time, but the hostess was very enthusiastic about seating us and gave us a 15-minute wait (we received a table within this time frame, however, we were not given an option to sit outside). \n\n<mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> benedict ($17): smoked wild salmon, poached eggs, cr\\u00e8me fra\\u00eeche, red onion, saut\\u00e9ed spinach, and hollandaise sauce on <mark>Potato Pancakes</mark>. the elements of this dish were good, but there were issues. the spinach was a tad salty and the flavor managed to overpower the salmon. the menu says 'saut\\u00e9ed greens,' so they may serve something besides spinach t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> complement the salmon more? we really didn't like the spinach with the <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark>. so, i just ate them separately. the hollandaise was fantastic. the <mark>Potato Pancakes</mark> were all right. it seemed like they were just piles of hash brown. also, i'm not sure w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>, but i didn't see any cr\\u00e8me fra\\u00eeche or red onion..?\n\nshort rib hash ($15): prime short rib, yukon gold potatoes, bell peppers, shallots, herbs, two poached eggs, and smoked paprika hollandaise sauce. great hash! w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> it was the delicious hollandaise with the smoked paprika - it added nice flavor. the diced potatoes were perfect and the short rib was very tender.\n\nwe had some small plates as well and they were really wonderful. i highly recommend ordering them and i'd love to try the others during another visit.\n\n<mark>Portobello Fries</mark> ($9) with a herb a\\u00efoli. if you fell in love with these fries at bottega louie in l.a., you'll be thrilled t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> have them in vegas now! i love the large cuts of portobello, the light and flavorful batter, and the great a\\u00efoli t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> it all together. yum!\n\n<mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark> ($9) served with red pepper coulis and lime wedge. this is one of the best <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark> i've had and i loved the coulis with it. the cake has a light cornmeal exterior and large chucks of crab meat. great flavors. you'll wish there was more than one cake per order!\n\nthe 1/2-inch <mark>1/2-inch Thick Grilled Bacon</mark> ($8) is amazing. it comes with a housemade bbq sauce and trust me, you don't need it! the bacon has the best of both worlds - smoking and grilling. the two flavors mend together to make a really tasty piece of meat.\n\nservice was great, as it was last time. waters refilled frequently and many check-ups from our server. we had a great time. also, the food was delicious and satisfying. i certainly enjoy this spot for brunch for its atmosphere and fun sharing dishes. i'd love to dine on the outdoor patio. perhaps i'll even brave another steak and/or dinner in the future.\n\nside note: the '<mark>Steak Frites</mark>' is now served with new york strip rather than ribeye (online menu does not reflect this change yet). i'm not a fan of ny strip, however, it may be a better fit for this particular dish seeing t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> did not enjoy the ribeye i was served during my previous visit.", 
            "our first visit to e&r was about a year ago for my wife's birthday, and it was very disappointing overall. the food was decent enough, even for the price, but the service was horrible. it took over 3 hours to have dinner due to waiting, order issues and having one of the worst waiters you could possibly imagine. but i refrained from ever finishing my review and decided to give them another shot. it took a while, but we came back and chose a sunday to check out their pretty highly praised brunch.\n\nright off the bat, things were starting out way better than our first visit, and was quite possibly some of the best service i've ever gotten. we walked in at about 10:30am, the hostess took our name and got us seated in less then 10 minutes. they were able to get us a nice seat on the patio and just moments after being sat down we were greeted by the manager, who knew our names. shortly after that, our waiter (who also had our names by the way) came to take our drink order. he asked if we'd dined at e&r before, and when we told him only for dinner, he went through the brunch menu and explained some of their most popular items. during our whole brunch, every person who came to our table knew our name and were as friendly as could be. it was very impressive and a complete 180 from prior experience, but then the food came...\n\nas per the waiters suggestion, i ordered one of their signature dishes, the short rib hash. for $15 you get a healthy portion of short rib, finely diced potatoes and veggies, poached eggs and a smoked paprika hollandaise sauce. w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> the dish so disappointing was the fact t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> of it seemed to have sat under a heater or something for too long. basically half of the plate was excellent...the short ribs were moist and tender, the potatoes had a nice little crisp to them, and the egg was poached perfectly. then i got to the other half of the dish. all the meat was dry and crispy, and the egg was way overcooked. it was nearing hard boiled egg, complete with a cooked yoke. for me, those things combined just through the dish way off and was such a major let down compared to the other half i'd just eaten. \n\nwe also ordered a side of their thick cut bacon, which rings in at $8. they bring out a nice stack of <mark>1/2-inch Thick Grilled Bacon</mark> served with a side of bbq dipping sauce. this bacon is definitely thick, and has a nice charred flavor and texture from the grill. it was fatty, tender and even though i'm not a huge bbq sauce fan, it complimented the overall flavor nicely. it's something i'd definitely order again.\n\nfor w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> & rig is, their inconsistency issue are crazy. we had a great steak with terrible service once, and then came back to less then <mark>Stella</mark> food, but impeccable service. obviously this restaurant is a bit on the \"higher end\", but if you're going to charge $15 for a breakfast hash, you better be able to properly poach an egg. i can only speak for myself, but half a decent dish and a tasty side of bacon certainly isn't going to get me to come back alone. and because we had such a bad experience during dinner, i'm not so sure a 3rd visit for any meal would be a charm.", 
            "all i can say is wow!!! the second visit was even better than the first. first time around they were out of the <mark>1/2-inch Thick Grilled Bacon</mark> t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> were dying to try and the service was okay. this time around derek made our experience more than memorable! being a transplant from florida he was more than experienced in recognizing the customers desire for a good meal and service required to keep us coming back. my husband and i are not flashy or well to do by any means, but we were treated as paying customers t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> worth the time which was extremely appreciated!\n\nwe had the <mark>1/2-inch Thick Grilled Bacon</mark> with barbecue sauce which was very yummy, but the sauce was taken away right before our last savory bite. the black and white salad was a perfect combination of intriguing yet comforting appetizer. my husband had the crusted butterfish t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> perfectly cooked and complimented with perfectly tasting parsnip. i had the rib eye cap which was flavorful all by itself but even more tasty with the blue cheese sauce, which was not overpowering as it can sometimes be! i would have eaten the entire piece but some was a little more rare than medium. we were also treated (on the house), to cauliflower which i have never eaten in my life but would definitely order again!\n\ni saved room for a couple of bites of the caramel turtle dessert, which was sweet but not too sweet! definitely loved by my husband who left maybe a bite. highly recommended by us vegas locals and we will definitely be back for more!\n\nneedless to say t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> highly recommend echo & rig for locals, tourists and anyone looking for a pleasant dining experience without all the uptight snobby persona. real good food for real people, for half the price of the strip!", 
            "i really like this place. a couple of friends and i came here for brunch on sunday. \n\nupon entering the lobby area, the butcher shop was on the right, and the hostess and bar, to the left. i loved the modern-rustic decor and the ambiance of the place. we were seated upstairs in the loft. there are elevators to the right, if you do not want to take the stairs. there is also balcony seating, but a bit too windy for me, so inside was nice. \n\nwe had the <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> benedict, <mark>Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes</mark>, the waffle, and a side of the 1/2-inch <mark>1/2-inch Thick Grilled Bacon</mark>. everything was cooked perfectly and tasted delicious! the only complaint would be the bloody mary; it was a bit too bland for me. they could probably spruce it up by adding a square piece of bacon with the olive. they are a butcher shop, after all. anyway, service was very good and there was a \"brand ambassador\" walking around making sure guests were happy (i think that's code for general manager). overall, i recommend this place and look forward to coming back for dinner. i can't wait to try their steaks!", 
            "i'm going to start of by saying i was a bit disappointed t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark> are not fresh here i was looking forward to having one but due to my allergies i could not because they are pre made. but regardless a brunch here is a great choice to make worth the amazing options they give you. also give the <mark>1/2-inch Thick Grilled Bacon</mark> a try super tasty and the flavor is mild enough to go with other dishes trotted the ceviche also but it was a bit lackluster to say the least i expected more citrus in the dish. my entree was the ny breakfast sandwich very well put together great flavor profile loved it.  my gf got the rainbow breakfast which she said was very tasty so withe would be a good option for you to try. i would also like to put out a big thank you to brian rosenthal the brand ambassador for making us feel so welcome and taking the time to share some stories with us while we waited for our order it made our experience a memorable one.we look forward to our next visit for the dinner service.", 
            "this place was very, very nice. one of the nicest places i've been to in a while and my dad and his lady took my boyfriend and i out to dinner. we had an amazing sunset dinner, on the balcony. i had a piece of skirt steak i believe it was just alright i wasn't crazy about it and side of asparagus.\n\nthe setting, the food, and the atmosphere really made this an enjoyable dinner while visiting in town for the week. \n\nour table ordered everything from the steak tartare, to the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>, to the  <mark>1/2-inch Thick Grilled Bacon</mark> with bbq sauce which the bacon was made in house ( it was the best bacon i've ever had). my boyfriend loves the oysters too, and the men had the butterfish and were raving about it."

            "came here on a tuesday night with a party of 6. we were warned t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was their busiest night but we didn't expect to wait for a table for over an hour. however, t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> us time to check out the butcher case and speak with one of the butchers, kilan. he offered us a bite of some beef jerky they made the previous night, which was delicious. also, the butcher working the cold meats section near the stairs took pity on us and offered a little appetizer which was also good.\n\nwe finally got seated at our table. unfortunately, it was right next to the kitchen and in a draft zone. whenever someone opened the door to the patio, the cold air swept in. again, manage my took pity on us and tried to warn their servers to close the door behind them. sometimes they forgot so we had to get up ourselves to shut the door. \n\nwe ordered the calamari and <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark> for appetizers and they were both delicious. the aoli for the calamari was perfect. i had a couple of bites of my friend's over-the-rainbow salad and i wanted to order one for myself since it was so good. i ordered the skirt steak with a chimichurri sauce for my main course. my steak was cooked perfectly but was a bit on the salty side. i also ordered a side of roasted cauliflower which was fantastic. on the other hand, my boyfriend ordered the jumping beef which was apparently filet mignon with peppers and onions and a kind of light gravy. it came a little too well done when he had asked for it to be medium rare so he only ate a few bites. the coffee dessert was a nice ending to my meal and everyone else enjoyed their desserts. \n\nservice was great, everyone was exceptionally friendly. food was ok/good with the exception of the well done beef, which was comped along with a few of the desserts. i would come back and give this place another try.", 
            "i rarely give a place 3 stars, but i think it deserves a 3.5 based on 1st experience. i came to vegas for a mini vacation to hangout with some close friends & family, not really for the nightlife but more for hanging out and good company, so t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> said they took me to this fancy restaurant. i've been to 5 star restaurants before with $50 plate menus, so not foreign to the type of environment. right away we saw several snobbish people, usually \"old money\" material, heads turn as we walked. just a few groups of snobs, not the whole restaurant, don't get me wrong. fine establishment but we could sense the eyes glaring into the back of our heads with each step we took. it was ok for me though, always use to classism. we laughed about it. same story different neighborhood.\n\nambiance: a little noisy but not bad at all. very nice and fancy. they had the see through glass where you could see w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> butchers were upto. the balcony over looked the mall and vallet service. nice touch.\n\nservice. ***beware***sneaky. well just our waiter, jason, and his choice of vocab for the night \"sexy.\" he kept persuading us to buy the more expensive steak cuts, which were \"sexy\" and more off of the menu the whole night. just like a kiosk salesman who oversells a product. our table found it very annoying. we asked the price per pound for the suggested meat and we asked for the lesser of the two. on the bill he gave us the more expensive cut, and we ordered two of those! it being $210 on the bill, basically half the bill. wtf. it was good but he changed our order up, ordering the biggest of the two tomahawks. \n\nbefore the steaks came out, he was like \"i got you guys my favorite salad as you wait,\" we thought, oh w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> good guy until we saw t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> added it on the bill as well! we didn't order t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>*t! we didn't even know w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was to even order it! ha.\n\nthe service was split between a team. jason and about 3 other people. the 3 others we saw the most and did all the work. when it came to paying our check we saw jason again and he started to compliment one of our friends, shaking his hand, telling him \"i see you a lot here and i got you guys next time...blah...blah...blah\". this was actually our friends 2nd time here. so we paid the check, he thought we were gonna pay him a fat tip for the $350+ menu we racked up due to his \"sexy\" waiter skills, nope! \n\nout of all the places i've been to this was the most unprofessional i've seen due to him alone. he stood there hovering over us to see w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> would tip him and then after signing and tipping he took our bills with the quickness. i remembered i was in mid sentence and then *snatch* the bill was in his hands. he crumbled the originals for the customers to keep then rudely said \"i'm missing one.\" we told him we split it 3 ways and he left angry. like he really deserved a fat tip. as we walked by him he didn't say good bye or anything but had the nerve to talk sh*t behind our backs to his coworker. very \"sexy\" of him. so one of my friends said, make sure he's on your yelp review. got em!\n\nfood: ok now let me talk about the food. haha. very delicious. very fancy/gourmet. presentation was excellent. we ordered calamari, <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark> (which jason hinted to us the whole time), portabella french fries w/ aioli sauce, and bone marrow. everything came out delicious. \n\nour tomahawk steaks came out plate sized humongous. ordered it in medium, it came sliced and detached from bone, which we devoured the meat on their too. we got 5 different dipping sauces which were unique and enjoyable. the meat was juicy and very pleasing. after a few bites we found it overwhelming and ended up taking the rest home. \n\ni'm definitely coming back here every year, maybe check up on my favorite waiter. ha. service is one of the most biggest factors when it comes to trying out new places. it's all about the experience you share with good company. \n\nyou only get one chance to make a good first impression! #sexy\n\n***start to look for fake accounts or friends of server popping up trying to <mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> on w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> wrote about this place. this is basically my experience here, everyone has their own. \n\nplus, i guess since my other reviews consist of tattoo parlors and snack shacks then this review should be taken with a grain of salt. ha! sike! according to miley p. (fake yelp acct, but nice profile pic. ha. is it used to attract more yelpers to agree with your review?). the only review she got on her profile and it seems to go against everything i said. yelper page created in november of 2013 (the month i wrote the review) interesting & very fishy... ha.", 
            "spraggle!!!  you heard me right, the food at echo & rig is spraggle!  this is one of my favorite spots for the $$!  i have been here a few times now and each time i have been completely satisfied with the excellent quality they consistently put out and the reasonable price.  i'm not saying t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'s my favorite steakhouse, but again, for the money, it is certainly one of the best around!\n\nthey are a butcher and a steakhouse.  this makes for a unique feel as you enter, but there's more... the steakhouse means t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> have several regular cuts of meat on their menu all the time...the butcher part means t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> can order from the shop to-go...but it also means t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> additional cuts are available routinely t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> not on the menu but sold per ounce.  steaks are seasoned well and cooked beautifully.  i would not hesitate to order with confidence any cut t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> fancy on or off the menu.\n\nthe real standouts for me are the small plates.  they have 30 different veggie and small plates t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> from $5.50 - $9.30.  on this list you will find such taste-bud copulations as grilled octopus w/ gigante beans, bone marrow carne asada, maryland lump <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark>, asparagus & fried egg, and their now famous <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> w/ aioli...start with these, then venture out to the sweetbread nuggets, steak tartare, brussels sprouts, and mussels mainiere...looks like i need to try more of their veggies next time!\n\nif you are here with a group of 6 - 8 you might want to see w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> tomahawks they have (or if you happen to eat on your own like a thunder cat.)  this cut receives nice flavor from the bone and marbling, and slices up nice to share.  all of their steaks come with the option of the following sauces: blue cheese, red wine demi, green pepercorn, bernaise, charred onion, horseradish cream, or lemon chimichurri...i'm a succker for the more traditional bernaise.\n\ne&r is a great place to take a date and share some of the small plates...or come with a group and order by the ounce!  did i mention t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> don't have a corkage fee here?...well they don't, so bring in your favorite bottle of vino.\n\nthey also have some incredible looking happy hour prices, but i have not sampled any of these options. i have however tried the wonderful boutique hand creams in the restrooms, and i'm a fan!...hey echo, let's keep some hand towels in there though ...2 out 4 times you've been out...\n\ncome here for remarkable food for the price point!\ncome here with a group open to sharing and trying a lot of options!\ncome here for fancy hand creams in the bath room!\ncome here and close-the-place-down drinking wine at the bar while conversing with the most stunning woman you know!\ncome here for a trendy date spot with a modern distressed interior!\neither way...you should come check it out!\n\n\n#200threview  #onlytakesmethreetimesaslongasnelsonqtoget200done", 
            "my wife and i tried out this place last night.  it was a nice find.  the layout is upstairs and downstairs which was a little strange but space is a premium.  the service and menu was awesome.  most steakhouses you will drop an easy $100 / person, it was refreshing to go one in the city t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> not trying to rob you.  they serve 1/2 glasses of wine so we were able to try 6 different wines.   had the bacon, <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark>, pork belly, kale salad, and turtle sundae.  everything was very flavorful.  the only thing t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> of been better was the seasoning of some of the dishes.  we will definitely go back.", 
            "amazing! the meat case at the front is impressive! i have wanted to try this place since a pal of mine, jason, starting working here as a chef. i have heard/read mixed reviews. the most recent article i read was in the desert companion magazine. after eating here, i find the magazine's review offensive.\nthe nice young lady at the front told us it would be 30-40 minute wait. we made our way to the bar where scotty was waiting to take care of us. he was outstanding! knowledgeable, friendly, and entertaining. i can't even tell you how long we waited bc we didn't mind, we enjoyed our time at the bar. sangria made w/sav blanc so it wasn't too sweet. kentucky peachtree was a little herbal for my husband, who is a straight whiskey kind of guy. admittedly we were a little sad when our table was ready, scotty said next time we could eat at the bar with him. prices at the bar weren't bad, 1can beer, one glass sangria, one shot whiskey, one kentucky peachtree and a glass of wine, $37.\nso glad we went to the table. our service was on point. ram\\u00f3n brought out a plate with raw cuts of meat to explain the menu and help us with our selections. we ordered nearly one of everything. he asked how we would like the meal timed. we chose to go with \"whenever its ready, bring it out.\" as we received our dishes we slowly realized we may have over done it.\nanyway! w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> ordered.... just my husband and i....  and our rating(1-10), don't judge, we like to try everything!\nsmall plates- \ntuscan kale-9, perfectly seasoned,\nasparagus & fried egg-11 the asparagus had slight grilled char t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> perfect  with the creamy egg, \nmac n cheese-11 soo cheezy it was wonderful,\nsteak tartare-favorite! salty, fresh, quality ingredients you can taste\nfried calamari-7 light breading very fresh\n<mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark>-5 plenty of crab but not my favorite <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark> (im a cc snob)\nbutcher's sausage-7 a little spicy but tasty\nbrussels sprouts-9 lemony fragrant and fresh\n<mark>Steakhouse Chop</mark> salad-10 big chunks of filet lightly dressed perfect\nspencer steak-10 meat was perfectly cooked tender and juicy\ni will be back to this restaurant very soon!! thank you scotty, ramon and jason for a memorable date night!!!!!", 
            "came to this place for dinner. interesting set up they have there. the bar, hostess stand, retail shop, and butcher shop is downstairs and they restaurant is upstairs. down stairs they have the bar where you can get really decently priced cocktails starting at about $8 which is great since most bars have speciality drinks starting at $12 and up. they do offer happy hour but there are only three food items on the menu so we never tried it. they have a retail store where you can buy products they use in the restaurant, and a butcher shop to buy fresh meats. there's also only one bathroom in the place and it upstairs in the dining area. there is also outdoor patio seating t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> our into the fountain of tivoli village. they also seem to have a juice bar where you can order fresh pressed juices. \n\nside plates are on the smaller side so don't expect to get full off of those. which is good because it saves your appetite for the main course. \n\nitems ordered:\n\nappetizers:\n<mark>Portobello Fries</mark>: the best <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> have ever had! the waiter swears by them. the breading they use is not bread crumbs like we expected. instead it was a smooth outer shell with a nice crunch to it. the mushroom was cooked perfectly on the inside and not mushy, underdone or burned. the aioli t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> with it for dipping is just the perfect mixture to compliment this fry. \n\n\nasparagus and a fried egg: came with i believe about 4-5 pieces of  asparagus with an over easy egg on top of it. \n\nmaryland lump <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark>: about 3-4 pieces on this plate. pretty good\n\nentrees:\nbavette: good piece of meat not to fatty. \n\nblack spaghetti pasta: delicious! the broth/sauce was so good t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> had to slurp it with every bite! a good serving portion and didn't taste overly fishy. i was a little skeptical ordering this because of the squid ink but it was delicious.", 
            "best. restaurant. in town. \n\nforget the strip. forget fancy restaurant. forget places adorning the names of celebrity chefs. if you want delicious food, melt in your mount steaks, amazing service and delicious cocktails, echo & rig is where you go. \n\nby far the best meat for your money is the bavette. delicious. if you're wanting more meat, they sometimes offer a butchers cut of a 36oz porterhouse! all of the sides are delicious, but make sure you try: the watermelon tomato & cucumber salad, the bacon, the octopus salad, the <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark>, and the asparagus with egg. \nand the deserts. omg, if you want a sundae/apple pie you'll never forget, they make it here. and order several, because trust me, you want to try them all...and won't want to share ;)", 
            "have you ever done something, where you knew you were making a mistake, and then did it anyway?\n\nthat's how i have to describe my experience at echo and rig. \n\nnow, in all fairness, my doctor has banned me from eating red meat. i am not a vegetarian, vegan, or health nut. therefore since i did not try their steaks, my review will be based on my experience of service and hospitality.\n\nmy wife had been here before, and just said it was \"so-so\". why did we go here? because my first choice didn't open for another 45 minutes, we felt brio was less than medicore, and the other places in tivoli were sandwiches, crapes, or gringo mexican,  and not real fare for dinner.\n\nwe were greeted by a very nice hostess, who took us upstairs, and wanted to seat us near the kitchen. since the place was empty, i asked if we could be seated by the window. i was told t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> \"a table for four\". after i showed signs of leaving, she reluctantly seated us here.\n\nour waiter, jackson, started out okay, until we informed him we did not want any wine, and were not interested in alcoholic beverages. the \"air seemed to go out of his tires\", as we were not going to order items t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> the check and the corresponding tip.  after t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> seemed like we were \"branded\" as \"undesireables\".\n\ni told the waiter i was craving a large salad. he suggested the arrugala salad.\n\nmy wife ordered the <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark> and trenne pasta.\n\nthe <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark> was decent. better than w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> served at  the palm, and far better than w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> try to pass off at the yard house.\n\nmy wife's pasta and meat dish, was \"a cut above\" the speghetti factory. pasta was over cooked, and the accompanying ingridients, an after thought.\n\nmy salad was very disappointing. poor presentation, and very small portion. \nhad the waiter, jackson, said, the salads here are meant for appetiziers, i would have ordered something elese. \n\nwe also got a nasty stare, when we asked the food server for more bread. \n\nthe saving grace, was the manager, xavier. very polite and doing his best to please. when i complained the salad was not a satisfying meal, as the waiter told me it would be, he offered to take it off the check. since i had consumed it, i said t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> not be fair. \n\nhe also offered to have the chef, \"send something out\", but by then, the cold feeling we were left with by other staffers who looked at us like, \"you're not w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> want here\", left us feeling unwelcome. \n\nxavier is a good person, and tried to salvage the situation, by giving me his card, and telling me to contact him prior to coming back. i appreciated his thoughtfulness.\n\nagain, in all fairness, this place is noted for its meat, not salads and pasta, and my friend phillip, who i usually agree with, gives it a good rating. however, i was left with the impression t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> staff \"judges a book by its cover\".\n\nwe were not dressed in designer clothes, and didn't have t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> look when we walked in. the staff acted like we did not belong, and that's how we felt.\n\nmy wife might go back with her girl friends, but after getting the feeling t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> staff  was looking at me with the thought of, \"why don't you go back to the suncoast buffet where you belong?\", i am done with this place.", 
            "i have dined here twice now and i can easily say i am addicted. all of their steaks are from grass fed usda cattle and are fresh cut daily in the butcher shop downstairs. the menu offers a wide variety of cuts as well as daily specials t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> off the menu.  i highly recommend the filet, hanger, of the spencer steak.  the appetizers have never disappointed either.  my favorite from the appetizer menu had to be the lump <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark>, it is a single <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark>, but the flavor was amazing!  the filet chop salad was a must as well, it comes packed with steak and other cold cuts, and a bunch of different veggies for only around $10.  for a steak house of this quality, they prices are very fair. anywhere else in town i easily pay 2-3x the price for similar quality.  the staff is extremely friendly and on point. we were kindly greeted by the manager when we say down, who knew we were returning guests. our wait team never let my glass get half empty and they were constantly checking on us to ensure we had our needs met.  needless to say, go here for a nice date night for any occasion, you will not be disappointed.", 
            "i loved this place. i'll give the negatives first because there are few. first, it was noisy, and our table was right next to the kitchen, so traffic by our table was frequent. and, ... that's it.\n\npositives: (1) service from jason and derek was impeccable. (2) food was phenomenal. (3) no corkage fee, so we brought our own wine for no extra charge.\n\nwe had arugula salad t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> delish. i had a 27-oz. porterhouse t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> amazing with tasty white cheddar chunky mashed potatoes. oh, and the <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark> and calamari appetizers were awesome! whew...i'm so full now. this place was expensive but still excellent value.\n\nthor in the butcher shop downstairs was a really nice and knowledgeable guy as well. highly recommend e&r!", 
            "i have been here several times now for both brunch and dinner. whenever i go, the service is always the same - perfect. from the moment you sit down until you leave, you are greeted promptly with a smiling face. i always get the steak hash for brunch time and <mark>Hanger Steak</mark> for dinner. the <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark> are really good too - the sauce they use is so good. the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> and corn are also delicious. the bathroom hand soap/scrub is amazing - i even bought a couple mason jars of it. it leaves your hand so moisturized and soft. please wash your hands haha", 
            "another excellent meal here, came here with a huge group this time.  service is awesome as usual, very attentive and friendly from the host to the server.\n\nso to the food:\n\nbrussel sprouts - excellent tasting, the nice lemon flavor and crisp brussel sprouts.\n\ncauliflower with peppers - if you like a little spicy kick and cauliflower this is a good side dish.\n\nspicy sausage - not bad, not too spicy but good flavors.\n\n<mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark> - decent, not a huge <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark> fan but still good.\n\noctopus salad - octopus was a little dry t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> got, but the flavors were good. \n\nbone marrow carne asada -  awesome!  this is surprisingly really good.  the combination on top of a nice <mark>Toast</mark> bread.\n\npumpkin squash - a bit sweet, but i believe it's the sweetness of the squash.  like a small grilled pumpkin.\n\nportebello fries - excellent appetizer, great pick as usual.\n\npork belly grits - not bad, pretty unique tasting.\n\nstir fry kale - not bad, nothing t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> out.\n\nstuffed portebello - decent, but didn't stand out compared to the other stuff.\n\ntomahawk ribeye - pretty tasty, cooked pretty tender.  a great thing we did get with this is a selection of the sauces, you need to ask for it though.  7 sauces tonight.\n\nblack spaghetti - delicious!  still one of my favorite dishes here.  nice lemony flavors with the sun dried tomatoes and seafood mix.  highly recommended.", 
            "i said i'd give them another chance, i did, and it warrants a new review and additional star.\n\nmy visit was for brunch again and this experience was much better. i didn't have a reservation this time, but the hostess was very enthusiastic about seating us and gave us a 15-minute wait (we received a table within this time frame, however, we were not given an option to sit outside). \n\n<mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> benedict ($17): smoked wild salmon, poached eggs, cr\\u00e8me fra\\u00eeche, red onion, saut\\u00e9ed spinach, and hollandaise sauce on <mark>Potato Pancakes</mark>. the elements of this dish were good, but there were issues. the spinach was a tad salty and the flavor managed to overpower the salmon. the menu says 'saut\\u00e9ed greens,' so they may serve something besides spinach t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> complement the salmon more? we really didn't like the spinach with the <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark>. so, i just ate them separately. the hollandaise was fantastic. the <mark>Potato Pancakes</mark> were all right. it seemed like they were just piles of hash brown. also, i'm not sure w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>, but i didn't see any cr\\u00e8me fra\\u00eeche or red onion..?\n\nshort rib hash ($15): prime short rib, yukon gold potatoes, bell peppers, shallots, herbs, two poached eggs, and smoked paprika hollandaise sauce. great hash! w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> it was the delicious hollandaise with the smoked paprika - it added nice flavor. the diced potatoes were perfect and the short rib was very tender.\n\nwe had some small plates as well and they were really wonderful. i highly recommend ordering them and i'd love to try the others during another visit.\n\n<mark>Portobello Fries</mark> ($9) with a herb a\\u00efoli. if you fell in love with these fries at bottega louie in l.a., you'll be thrilled t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> have them in vegas now! i love the large cuts of portobello, the light and flavorful batter, and the great a\\u00efoli t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> it all together. yum!\n\n<mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark> ($9) served with red pepper coulis and lime wedge. this is one of the best <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark> i've had and i loved the coulis with it. the cake has a light cornmeal exterior and large chucks of crab meat. great flavors. you'll wish there was more than one cake per order!\n\nthe 1/2-inch <mark>1/2-inch Thick Grilled Bacon</mark> ($8) is amazing. it comes with a housemade bbq sauce and trust me, you don't need it! the bacon has the best of both worlds - smoking and grilling. the two flavors mend together to make a really tasty piece of meat.\n\nservice was great, as it was last time. waters refilled frequently and many check-ups from our server. we had a great time. also, the food was delicious and satisfying. i certainly enjoy this spot for brunch for its atmosphere and fun sharing dishes. i'd love to dine on the outdoor patio. perhaps i'll even brave another steak and/or dinner in the future.\n\nside note: the '<mark>Steak Frites</mark>' is now served with new york strip rather than ribeye (online menu does not reflect this change yet). i'm not a fan of ny strip, however, it may be a better fit for this particular dish seeing t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> did not enjoy the ribeye i was served during my previous visit.", 
            "i went to sw steakhouse at the wynn last night ( i will post a review shortly) and echo & rig was so much better, i felt i owed it to them to post a review. \nfirst, it has been a long time since i have received service like we did at e&r. the hostess was very polite and friendly, but at the time i just assumed she was bubbly. little did i know t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> entire staff was going to be t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>. although it was packed, our waiter came over taking drink orders and introducing himself. water and bread were there immediately. the manager came over, introduced himself, thanked us for coming, and told us to let him know if we needed anything. and the service didn't stop. suffice it to say the waiter and bus people were as attentive as any, without bothering us--meaning they kept an eye on us to make sure we didn't need anything, and to get it if we did.\nfor starters, we my wife had baked brie. it was delicious. i had <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark>. they were good; my wife thought they were some of the best she's had. we also shared an order of <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>--they were addicting. definitely get them. my wife had the butterfish for her entr\\u00e9e. she thought it was going to be like sea bass, very flaky and buttery, but thought it was much closer to halibut in taste and texture. she enjoyed it, thought it was prepared perfectly, but was expecting something else-not e&r's fault. i had rib-eye cap which was great and cooked perfectly. we also had broccolini--very tasty--and garlic mashed potatoes--just right. for dessert we had ice cream t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> as good as any you will have anywhere. \nfinally, the manager returned, thanked us again, gave us his card, and told us to call if we ever need anything. it really felt like an old style vegas gourmet room where they treat everybody like a high roller. it was awesome.", 
            "ambiance: 5 - this place is pretty fancy. it was nice from the bottom to the top. you walk from a curved staircase at the bottom into the eating area located at the top. it's fairly romantic inside at night, and everyone is either dressed fancy or in their casual, yet appropriate sunday clothes. \n\ni would suggest this for an intimate date night. 3rd or 4th date, maybe? it's a \"will you be my girl?\" or a \"fancy some dinner after work, dear?\" kinda place. \n\nservice: 5 - like i have said many times before, no one knows service like summerlin does. this place is just excellent. the servers basically treat you like you are the only table they have. he was quick and efficient, except at the end, where he took a while to get us our check. it was just so refreshing to have amazing service for once. probably the best service i have received at a restaurant in my life. \n\nfood: 2 - we ordered the spencer steak, the rib-eye cap, calamari, <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>,  <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark>, and pork belly. \n\ni thought my spencer steak and pork belly was a little dry. the pork was definitely overcooked and a bit hard. i don't know if it was just t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>, but i was pretty disappointed..it just wasn't as great as i thought it would be. \n\nthe best thing i had t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>. don't let the rest of the review fool you. the fries were really good. they should have given me two! <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> for life!!", 
            "this is, by far, the best restaurant for locals in las vegas. with its chic and welcoming ambiance, an incredible staff, and out-of-this world food, nothing beats echo & rig. \n\nthe restaurant itself is gorgeous, and just flat out cool. the butcher downstairs is an immediate indicator t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> restaurant is different, and augments its already urban and unique vibe. if you ever want to cook steak at home, buy your steaks here! they are less expensive (and way more delicious!) than those from whole foods. \n\nbesides the amazing food, the best part of echo & rig by far is the staff. every server we have ever had was kind, friendly, knowledgeable, and welcoming. xavier, the manager, has gone out of his way every single time we have visited to make us feel t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> were taken care of. there is not a single restaurant in vegas, including all of those on the strip, t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> better service. \n\nand now, the food! echo & rig's menu is t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> combination where you have plenty to pick from, but the concept feels connected. everything is to die for, but i especially recommend the <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark>! it is the best one i've ever had. \n\nall in all, echo & rig is an incredible restaurant and has done great things for summerlin. i couldn't recommend it more!", 
            "hospitality here is amazing! really memorable experience, and the food was excellent.  the location is a few miles off the strip which is great, because it gives you a chance to drive out and forget you're in one of the most touristy destination places in the western world.  it's a newly developed plaza, so it may not show up on older gps maps as i found out.  better to use your phone instead.  \n\nso you pull up to this sprawling italian influenced shopping center, tivoli village, complete with huge center fountain.  the restaurant is prominently located at the entrance across from a popular italian restaurant and sports bar, near the fountain.  there is plenty of free parking if you don't want to valet.  when you enter echo & rig, it looks like an upscale butcher's, with fresh meat and <mark>Sausage</mark> on display.  the hostess is extremely friendly, and got to know our party a little before selecting our table (where we were from, if it was our first time, etc).  they had tables out on the patio and a larger, beautiful dining area inside, next to the kitchen.  we sat inside, which was perfect.\n\nthe hostess took us upstairs via the elevator although there is a winding grand staircase, and she really makes us feel at home.  once seated, we were greeted by i think the m'aitre d, derrick, who welcomes us and thanks us for coming.  our waiter, raoul, then walked us through the menu and the specialty items, going through the ala carte menu as well which you can also order as appetizers.  there are so many small tapa like items to order, we got the lamb cigars and <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark> which i highly recommend.  the small dishes range from $6, $8, and $10.  i also ordered a baked potato, which wasn't on the menu (although there is a baked sweet potato) but they happily made anyway t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> with the steak.\n\nfor the main entrees, they have surprisingly a large variety of choices besides steaks.  there's several chicken dishes, seafood, pork, and even duck.  of course, they are known as a steak house and their choice of cuts is superb.  i got the rib eye cap (the best part of the ribeye) and was not disappointed.  each entree came with homemade chips and potato cakes.  every cut is, i believe, 10 ounces and was plenty big.  grilled to perfection too, of course.\n\nyou can't go here without noticing the excellent service and modern technology implemented.  derrick who i think is the m'aitre d again came out to c<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> us after our appetizers came out to make sure everything was to our satisfaction and asked if there was anything we needed.  i ordered a beer and then less than a minute later someone from downstairs comes up and delivers my beer.  how did t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> so fast?  also, we noticed t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> were a couple of people with ipads just walking around making sure and double checking t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was being done, which was somew<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>.  the level of communication and service here was extraordinary and worth another visit just to observe!  \n\nfinally, the gm of the restaurant came out to visit after the meal to invite us back and make sure everything was exceptional, which it was.  he even mentioned t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> were planning to open another echo & rig in los angeles by next year and t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> owner already owned a popular italian steakhouse in dtla, botega louie which i now want to try.  we were too full for dessert, but i would have to assume it would have been awesome.", 
            "i'm going to start of by saying i was a bit disappointed t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark> are not fresh here i was looking forward to having one but due to my allergies i could not because they are pre made. but regardless a brunch here is a great choice to make worth the amazing options they give you. also give the <mark>1/2-inch Thick Grilled Bacon</mark> a try super tasty and the flavor is mild enough to go with other dishes trotted the ceviche also but it was a bit lackluster to say the least i expected more citrus in the dish. my entree was the ny breakfast sandwich very well put together great flavor profile loved it.  my gf got the rainbow breakfast which she said was very tasty so withe would be a good option for you to try. i would also like to put out a big thank you to brian rosenthal the brand ambassador for making us feel so welcome and taking the time to share some stories with us while we waited for our order it made our experience a memorable one.we look forward to our next visit for the dinner service.", 
            "where should i start? 5/5 all over, the food, service, everything!\n\nordered the following items:\nappetizers....\ntomato, cucumber, watermelon and red onion - my friend wanted this dish because she loves watermelon during the summer season. i was like, let's give it a try cause i like cucumbers. this dish was very refreshing, sweet and hint of onion-y taste. 5/5!\n\nasparagus and fried egg - i. love. asparagus!!! yes, it does make things smell funky when you're in the restroom but hey this vegetable is stalk-y and green! they grill the asparagus to perfection where you can eat the bottom (the white end). crunchy and delish. \n\ngrilled octopus, gigante beans and green olives - i love octopus. i thought it was weird mixing octopus, beans and olives altogether. i was wrong!\n\npork belly and spicy slaw - ok so the slaw wasn't spicy but the pork belly was surprisingly porky! good marinade and cooked well.\n\nmaryland lump <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark> - the crab in this <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark> tastes so fresh out of the water! 5/5!\n\nceviche \"peruvian style\" - i'm torn between the two seafood i had but this one was the home run in my tummy. fresh. lime-y. spicy. amazing 6/5!\n\n<mark>Portobello Fries</mark> and herb aioli - i'm a fan of mushrooms...portobello specifically. the portobello was cut into wedges so they looked like steak fries. i wasn't paying attention eating it, thinking it was, seriously, french fries. but omg portobello!!! the sauce was amazing!\n\nmain course...\nthe spencer steak with brandied mushroom sauce - i named my steak steven, i wanted to marry him cause he was so soft, pink and delicious. but i ate him. 'nuff said.\n\ndessert...\ncappuccino sundae - pound cake!!! yes, there's pound cake in the bottom! it also has chocolate shavings and fudge!\n\ncaramel turtle sundae - bourbon and salted caramel ice cream. that's all you need to know about this dish!\n\nthe service was spectacular. they changed our utensils everytime a new dish came out. filled our water everytime it was empty. i felt bad t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was making the servers work. oh well. great service!\n\nbottom line: would come here again.", 
            "visiting the area and staying at the jw marriott, we were seeking a unique place to enjoy a birthday dinner. on a suggestion, we decided on echo & rig and so very glad we did! \n\nconveniently located with valet service, this butcher shop/restaurant was an instant hit when we walked in the door. an open concept with a trendy feel, the immediate impression from the receptionists were warm and welcoming!\n\nwe sat at the bar for pre dinner drinks and enjoyed a sampling of the homemade beef jerky! it was fantastic! \n\nwe requested a balcony table because the inside seating was rather loud. we hoped to hear each other throughout the dining experience and it would be a challenge inside.\n\nbecause we asked for balcony, we had to wait a bit longer but we didn't care. the bar drinks, jerky and conversation were keeping a smile on all of our faces. nevertheless, the manager approached us to apologize and presented us with complementary appetizers - tuna poke and watermelon & cucumber salad. both were so light, fresh, and awesome! \n\nnow i was even more excited about dinner!\n\nwe sat down and our waiters were attentive, funny, and professional - we could tell things were only going to get better. \n\nthen, the waiter did it. he brought a wooden tray t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> the massive cuts of beef available for purchase and boy, were they pretty!  the menu was loaded with so many tasty looking things we decided to make a buffer between the 4 of us. \n\nwe ordered a 40oz steak which arrived on the bone and was cooked perfectly! our table also held all of the following: bone marrow, risotto, <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark>, <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark>, brussels sprouts, stuffed mushrooms, grilled corn, and bottles of wine. everything was fantastic!\n\ni would definitely return! w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> fun dining experience with a great view and table setting. awesome service from everyone we met as soon as we walked in the door.  only downfall - noise level inside, but t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'t keep me away if we are in the area again. that <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> with braised short ribs is calling my name!!", 
            "my boyfriend and i have been here once for dinner and once for brunch! both times it was delicious. for dinner we ordered, the 35 oz porterhouse, maryland lump <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark>, white risotto, thick cut bacon, and brussels sprouts. everything was delicious. however, we ordered the porterhouse medium rare and it came out with a cold center. t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> our only complaint. the small plates were all so good. my favorite was the risotto and the thick cut bacon. my boyfriend really enjoyed the <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark>. overall, this was a great dinner and we would definitely come back. \n\nnow for brunch, we ordered the <mark>Eggs Benedict</mark> and the <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> benedict with a side of thick cut bacon, obviously. my boyfriend had the bloody mary and he loved it. both of the benedicts were amazing. i especially loved my <mark>Smoked Salmon Benedict</mark>. the best brunch in las vegas. i can't wait to come back and sit outside in the patio!"

            "this place is a gem! an amazing destination for steaks and seafood. i've dined here 3 times and each time, everything has been impeccable. my first time was for lunch, and i am surprised the inside was packed during lunch time. but don't let t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> you, they also have a very cozy patio area with heaters if you want to go al fresco. \n\non the next 2 occasions, we made reservations because we had a large party of 8 and we were whisked right in. servers are always very courteous with plenty of recommendations if you ask. in these trips, i have tried a crazy array of their food and all of it is amazing! for appetizers, you have to get the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>. they are the best fries (potatoes and other vegetables included) t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> have ever eaten. i dream about these babies and would come here just to eat 3 orders of fries and leave (don't judge me). \n\nother noteworthy mentions include the spinach salad (not healthy, <mark>Fried Spinach</mark>, but the texture of it is incredible) and brussel sprouts. wow. their brussel sprouts are so tasty with each leaf peeled off individually and a lemony tang and crunch from pistachios. they are a must-have to offset all the protein you're about to ingest.\n\nfor proteins, we've had the filet, spencer, rib-eye, skirt, brisket, salmon, and butterfish. each protein is cooked perfectly to your request and the quality of the meats are obvious. there is no chewy stuff you have to cut off and pile onto the side of your plate. knives cut through everything in one foul stroke. although the sign of a good steak is not needing to have any condiments, they have the best condiments if you want to shake it up. i personally love the chimichurri and horseradish. lastly, it was my first time trying butterfish this week from echo & rig, and let me tell you t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> is my new favorite fish. if you're not in the mood for steak, get the butterfish!!\n\ntheir dessert menu is simple with everything being ice cream. i would like more variety, but will not complain because i still love t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> turtle sundae. if you haven't been in awhile, go back. they have added many new signature items in their menu. if you're a vegetarian, don't be afraid to come here. there are so many vegetarian and vegan options on the menu t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> will leave stuffed and happy. i love echo & rig and think it is an amazing gem in suburban las vegas with the perfect price point and atmosphere. don't even think about going to the <mark>Chai</mark> steakhouse down the street when you can be receiving great quality for the same price.", 
            "my husband surprised me tonight with dinner, our first time here, there is a different set up, check in downstairs at the hostes desk, there is a bar, the butcher shop, and some general cooking tools and cook books for sale.\n\nyou dine upstairs going by stairs or elevator, apon arriving, you can see right into the kitchen and the dinning room. \n\nthe dinning room is actually very big with outside seating as well.  tables are a generous size, we eat alot, so instead of a small table for two, we enjoyed the larger one for four, big comfortable <mark>Chai</mark> and plenty of room!\n\nwe tried a few 'sides' as apps, khale beet and goat cheese salad, thick cut bacon, and the yams in maple glaze. all very good and generous portions, one of my favorites was the beet salad!\n\nfor our entree we  both got the jumping  beef, loved it, tender beef with veggies, potato squares, but the demi glaze made it!\n\nof course we had to have dessert, salted carmel and chocolate cherry. both excellent. service was good, food was excellent and the experience was extremely good, so it's on our return list for sure!", 
            "you will find echo & rig's bright sign shining across from brio and next to the david barton gym in the roundabout area inside the beautiful tivoli village.\n\nthis place seemed busy from the get-go. my family and i had arrived 10 minutes late for our 8 o'clock reservation and was sat after a 15 minute wait. \"the first floor included a bar area (only enter if you are over 21 with an id) and some round tables and <mark>Chai</mark>. it seemed like a waiting room. the music was already loud. there's a butcher shop downstairs as well.\n\nservice 5/5\nwhen we arrived at our table, we were quickly greeted by the manager, jason, who was very friendly and explained t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> liked introducing himself to people who have never ate at echo & rig before. cool beans! \n\nwe were offered our choice of sparkling or flat water, complimentary, for each person at the table. jason came back to explain the concept of the restaurant and a rundown of the menu and source of food (everything is fresh, basically!) great information to know :)\n\nsam was our server and was very friendly as well. not sure w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> dad had asked, but sam left and came back with a giant trey full of raw meat for the steak options. we ordered the tomahawk steak, medium rare. \n\nfood: 4.5/5\nnot sure if they forgot the bread until last minute but the bread came a while after we ordered everything, very close to when the appetizers arrived. anyhow it was still good as i was starving. the bread comes with very creamy butter. \n\nour appetizers came shortly after the bread. per sam's suggestions, we ordered the watermelon tomato salad and portobello mushroom fries. \n\nthe salad was very different -- yellow and red tomatoes mixed with sweet watermelon pieces topped with a vinaigrette sauce (reminds me of the sauce on mozzarella salads). i didn't love it but found it pretty good. may have to try it again for a real opinion.  the fries were delicious! the green sauce for the fries had a buttery taste to it t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> fits perfectly with the mushroom fries. \n\nnext came our entree. the tomahawk steak was done at the most perfect level of \"medium rare\" i have ever seen. my arms had hurt this today (lol arm day!!) so i had a weak grip on everything. yet without using force, the steak was easily cut into pieces. the four choices of sauce were in the cutest little gravy cups. great to have these four choices -- my family and i were able to try all the different sauces! the two dark ones i didn't enjoy too much (one was red wine i believe and the other had an a1 sauce flavor to it). the two light ones were better (one had a slight cheesy flavor and the other had a very rich flavor i couldn't explain, but this yellow one was my favorite). \n\naccompanying the steak were the side dishes: grilled corn, roasted airloom carrots, and some chip dish i didn't particularly enjoy. the grilled corn was very rich in herbal flavor (something my mom didn't like at all). i'm indifferent about it... would be wary with ordering this if you don't like strong herb tastes. the carrots were really good, fluffy and soft, with a slight burnt taste t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> the overall flavor oddly delicious. \n\nwe ended our meal with one of each seasonal sorbet (and for us, the flavors were peach, blackberry, and grapefruit). topped with real fruit, i loved this! on the downside, i came here for my birthday but i wasn't able to get a special dessert or anything :( but i can't get everything haha. \n\nwe shared all these dishes between four people perfectly and it was around $40 per person. not too bad for the price!\n\ncolor me impressed! my first experience with echo & rig was quite positive. you can count on me to come here again for another occasion and bringing a fellow steak-lover.", 
            "where do i begin.. i made reservations and brought my husband here for fathers day along with our two teenagers. everything was going great until they sat us at our table. there was food on my <mark>Chai</mark>, about 3 tablespoons of crap. i should've said something but didn't. i brushed it off with my hand to the floor. i smelled something dirty and couldn't figure it out. \n\nthe busser filled our glasses with water. my husband took a drink and said his glass smelled foul. i immediately picked up my glass and figured out that's where the smell was coming from. the glasses where dirty. i looked at my glass a little closer and there was food particles floating in there!!!!!! omg!! my kids glasses were dirty too. \n\ni told our waiter and he replaced them with clean ones (so we thought). the new glasses were hot. he took them out of the dishwasher. he walked away and a few minutes later came the busser and filled with water. i touched the glass and it was rough and you could scratch off the particles of food on it. as the water sat in the glass it loosen up the food from the inside of my glass and again more \"floaties\" i think their dishwasher is broken or someone in the back is not doing their job right. \n\nmanagement please look into it. we paid our $200 bill and just left. i will never go back. our waiter was awesome but nobody wants to eat on dirty dishes. i just can't believe nobody else noticed. i've never expect to go thru this with this place but it happened. i've been to many restaurants and never had an experience like this."

            "let me start by saying i'm not a fan and i doubt i will ever be back to echo & rig.  we came here late afternoon and there was one other party in the restaurant.  we were brought our <mark>Black <mark>Green Iced Tea</mark></mark> quickly and it was refilled frequently while we were there.\n\ni had looked at the menu online and i took some time to decide once there.  for a starter, we ordered their <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> which were served with an herb aioli.  this was the first i noticed t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> garlic or should have had garlic (herb aioli) had no garlic taste at all.  the herb aioli was good but missing the garlic flavor.\n\nmy wife ordered the tri-tip steak--medium--even though i suggested she get medium rare and i ordered the <mark>Hanger Steak</mark> blue.  she was drawn to the tri-tip because the menu said lemon and garlic neither of which was evident in any way.  garlic fail number 2.  all their steaks come with garlic chips (no garlic flavor here either--garlic fail #3) and a mushroom rockefeller, a breadcrumb stuffed mushroom cap.\n\nthe portobello mushroom was wonderful with the light coating and the cheese shreds.  then we waited.  we saved some of the mushrooms fries for our steak, and then we waited some more.  approximately 20 minutes later, our server said the steaks would be right out.  he took our small plates and silver away.  about 5 minutes went by and he stopped by once again and said the steaks would be right there.  about 5 minutes later, he stopped by to say they'd be out in about a minute.  this time, he was right.\n\nwhen the steaks arrived, i noticed t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> had been cut in slices and i just cringed.  i absolutely <mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> it when this is done.  maybe that's why so few places do it.  i asked if there was a culinary reason and the server said he'd ask.  when he came back he told us t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> chefs said it was to make the steaks more tender.  my steak was good, but it was cooked a little more than i would do it at home.  my wife's steak was less tender and because of her medium order, which they did, the steak was less juicy and there was a fair amount of sinew t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> wouldn't expect.  she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.  but above all, i'd say, please don't cut my steak.  i'm not a two year old and i'm not infirm.  i googled this when i got home and found t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> only reason (perhaps) to do this was to cut the steak against the grain the right way.\n\nwe each had a sundae for dessert.  they were ok.\n\ni left echo & rig very disappointed.  the length of time from ordering to getting our mains was ridiculous when the place is less than 1/10 full.  it was a tuesday afternoon--not date night usa at 8 pm.", 
            "we dined here on 3/25/14 for my wife's birthday.\nlet's begin!\n\natmosphere:  it wasn't crowded; very nice.  super clean and visually relaxing.  i love the smell of their california red oak smoking in the distance.  beautiful decorations, even the bathroom was impressively decorated; they offer sugar scrub soap for your hands!\n\nservice:  justin served us t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>, and serve well he did!  he made awesome recommendations regarding salad-entree pairings and suggested a great porterhouse cut for myself.  our glasses were always kept full, he never forgot one thing he promised and always seemed to be no further than earshot when we needed him.\n\nfood:  my posterhouse was cut within minutes of cooking; it was seasoned and cooked to perfection.  i was very pleased with the high quality taste and fat marbling; you can't beat grass fed...didn't even need sauce (i recommend the spicy horseradish and green peppercorn).  the steak comes with a stuffed mushroom, which was good, and fried potato chips; i was so full from my 24oz porterhouse i didn't even notice the sides.  one of the best tasting steaks i've ever had.\n\nprice:  you get w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> pay for here, no foo-foo frills like the food on the strip; here you can get locally sourced game meat that's been dry aged before your eyes...and that's the standard for pretty much all the meats.  the red oak used to cook the meat is a real plus as well; it yields exceptional flavor to the food.\n(2 9oz filets, 1 24oz porterhouse, 2 salads, 1 <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>, 1 cocktail, 1 <mark>Black <mark>Green Iced Tea</mark></mark> = $170)  \n\nperks:  during \"happy hours\" they offer $1 house made, all beef hot dogs using their dry aged beef and $2 steak & eggs, using their dry aged new york...you can't beat that!  they do offer meats from their small butcher shop downstairs near the entrance.  \n\ntip*****try and avoid on the weekends unless you have great patience; wait can easily exceed a few hours, especially towards the evening."

            "my first visit here i came for brunch. it was just before the seasons changed (you know, summer and winter) so it was still warm enough to sit outside on their patio, which is situated on the second floor of the restaurant overlooking the valet turnstyle of tivoli.\n\nso we decided to try a couple different sanwiches instead of going with breakfast food. \n\nburrata- english peas, green onion and mint. this was terrible. i won't even bother explaining.\n\n<mark>Portobello Fries</mark>- not sure w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> the fuss is about. they weren't all that.\n\n<mark>Hanger Steak</mark>- with roasted anaheim chilies, spinach and lemon aoili chimichurri.\nthe steak was so raw, i couldn't eat  it. i asked our waiter if this was normal, the blood coming from the meat made the roll soggy. he replied t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> is supposed to be rare (it doesn't state this on the menu). anyways, i couldn't eat it, and he didn't offer to replace it with a different meal.\n\n<mark>Grilled Cheese</mark>- short ribs, gruyere, parmesan and white chedder. this was definitely the table favorite. the short ribs really gave it an extra flavor to the awesome combo of cheeses.\n\n<mark>Smoked Salmon</mark>- it never gets old. still one of my favorites\n\nthe best part about brunch? the $16 <mark>Bottomless Mimosas</mark>.\n\nback for dinner the next week, and i had the colorado lamb chops. these were good, but nothing to write home about. i enjoyed my cocktails more than my meal.\nheat of the moment is an excellent drink, and at $8 you can't help but have a couple.\n\n bring your patience with you, they don't except reservations, so it can be an hour wait at time.",

            "i love this place. there are some tiny flaws here and there, but probably my favorite restaurant in vegas.\n\nyummy list:\n- black and <mark>Black & Blue Mojito</mark> - awesome yummy flavor\n- all the steaks have been yummy and cooked with probably the best consistency possible. i've grilled many steaks and it's very tough to consider width/height of steak then to figure out how long to cook at w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>\n- lemon chimichurri sauce - the odd thing is i don't think this belongs with steak, but damn is it tasty. maybe it belongs with grill shrimp. there's a <mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> fusion of flavors in this sauce, but i don't suggest it with steak.\n- brandied mushroom - awesome!\n- steak tartare - great value compared to other fancy establishments!\n- caulifower, chili de arbol, crispy shallots & onions - in my original review i raved about it, i'll raved about it again! so yummy, so <mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> in flavor. a must order, a must order on repeat visits\n\ndecent no compaints:\n- bourbon & blood cocktail\n- bearnise sauce\n- fried calamari\n- roasted broccolini\n\ngood but missing a bit of the echo & rig magic (it's tough to have so much magic, and i'm not docking points here because each item was still decent):\n- <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> - maybe it needs a peppery flavor added?\n- bone marrow carnde asada - the bone marrow was awesome in size, but it seemed to need another element of flavor, the lemon on the side helped to add flavor but more is still needed\n- steak tuna - it was a little bland\n- dessert - the ice cream sundae is somew<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> compared to the awesome dinner. oh well :)\n- brussel sprouts, pistachio & fresh lemon - there's so much here, but the <mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> flavor isn't. did i miss something? oh well it was still decent\n\n\nrating (1=poor, 10 =perfect)\nfood flavor rating: 9.6\nfriendly service: 10\nambient sound: 7\nambiance: 8"

            "i'll admit, when my friend suggested we go here for dinner, i wasn't too excited. i've only been a few times before, and i had only \"ok\" experiences. nothing bad, nothing great. i hadn't remembered the food being good enough to return. well, i was proven wrong last night. \n\nmade a reservation for 10 people, when we arrived the hostess greeted us, made sure to see who the person the reservation was made under, and then c<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> with us as we made our way up the stairs. she asked is we had dined here before, i said yes. just as we had sat down, the manager came over and asked \"ms. t.....\" (he said my last name wrong, but i'll let him slide, he was cute) and then thanked me for returning. i thought this was pretty a nice gesture. i asked if they removed a drink off the menu t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> had here before called the <mark>Hot Mess</mark> (it's delicious by the way, if you like jalepe\\u00f1o type drinks) and he said they would still be able to make it (another bonus). \n\nonto the food. i started out with the lamb cigars. these were so good, i could've eaten a few more rounds and called it a night. but i didn't, i ordered the horseradish crusted butterfish. i had never had butterfish before (from w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> can recall) this was delicious. so moist and flavorful and the potato au gratin was served almost like al dente, it was different than any way id had them before. most of my friends had ordered steak, and they all finished their plates clean. \n\nservice and food really made up for my previous visits. i will for sure return again."

            "let me start by saying i only take the time to review a restaurant if it's worth reviewing.  t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> said, echo & rig, culinary-wise, might just be in my top 3 favorite restaurants in las vegas.  their downfall is 80% of the staff and service! \n\ni started going there a couple if months ago and my first experience was amazing!! since january i have been back at least 10 times and have been disappointed most of those times.  i return because the food is t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> (t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>, if i receive it, or if the kitchen staff cares to sear the meat right). \nfirst time i went, it was during lunch.  the server was casual but his recommendations were spot on.  lunch was delicious and server was helpful friendly.\n\nreturned several times after that (a couple nights back to back).  there are two evening hostesses t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> remember us, which makes us feel welcome.  however the staff upstairs acted too busy or were overwhelmed with tables.  only a few times we were offered bread when we sat.  offered the cuts of the house only once since i've been there.  once they mixed the sparkling water with the still water.  found a hair in our soup and they did nothing but take it off the check, did not offer a replacement or an apology.  one waiter made us feel bad about not ordering an alcoholic beverage.  waiters seem rushed or impatient.  management seems unconcerned.  complained to a manager who did absolutely nothing and appeared completely uninterested.\n\nwent for lunch once and, i kid you not, there were approximately 4 other tables there.  ordered the portabello fries (yum by the way) had a view of the kitchen and watched as it sat for 30 min while i ate the rest of my meal, all the while the cooks, waitstaff and management walked past it many times without a single person commenting who's dish was sitting out under the warmer.  also asked for a coke, which didn't arrive.  at the end of the meal (fries still up in the warmer) i was presented with a check t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> had the fries and coke.  mind you there were only 4 other tables present. \n\nalso have issues with getting my table bussed, usually plates pile up before someone comes and clears them.  also they'll take your silverware before you're even done.  \n\npositive notes: food is amazing.  flat iron steak is my favorite and 9 out of 10 times it's seared right and cooked perfectly.  portabello fries are always a favorite, carne asada bone marrow delish.  love the grilled octopus but every so often it's tough.  black spaghetti used to be my favorite until they changed the scallops to mussels.  crispy bacon is decadent.  <mark>Ultimate BLT</mark> was one of the first things i tried and nothing short of amazing but have had it since and it didn't quite measure up (the bread seemed old).  decent wine selection, <mark>White Peach Sangria</mark> is tasty, cocktail selection is ok.  they used to have a chaucuterie board t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> really good but i no longer see on their menu.  downstairs has fresh squeezed juices t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> should put at least on their lunch menu, i am always curious about them but never know w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> have.  steaks are amazing, i have had several different cuts and all are tender and delicious (they should be, they're a butchery!) and prices are great, especially compared to a steak house on the strip.  all their meats or all natural grass fed.\n\nhave been hesitant to return because of service, have returned solely because of the food, only 2 stars because of overall experience.  this restaurant definitely deserves better.", 
            "on a recent trip to vegas, i was looking for tasty food t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'t break the bank. i found echo & rig on yelp and decided to take the 25 minute trek from the strip with my boyfriend. i'm so glad we did. i adored my dinner. it was delicious. i had the black spaghetti, watermelon salad, chocolate cherry sundae, and <mark>White Peach Sangria</mark>. everything was delicious. the spaghetti wasn't fishy at all, the acidity of the sauce balanced everything out. the watermelon salad was crisp and refreshing. the sundae was pretty standard, but still yummy. the <mark>White Peach Sangria</mark> was delicious and refreshing as well. the prices were absolutely incredible as well. i wish echo & rig was closer to los angeles because i would absolutely visit more if it was.", 
            "finally!!! i have been lusting over echo & rig since they opened, but hadn't had a chance to visit until this weekend. i'd say t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> in all, they pretty much live up to the hype. echo and rig is located in a prime location in tivoli village. it is a beautiful restaurant.  the downstairs level has the bar and butcher shop, while the upstairs has the kitchen, dining room, and a balcony which also seats diners. the dining area is on the smaller side, but it is all very open and airy.\n\nwhen we arrived, we were informed t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> wait was about an hour. yikes! granted, it was 7:20 on a saturday night, but i wasn't expecting so long of a wait. but we were there, we were hungry, and we were not to be dissuaded from our plan. so, we moseyed up to the bar for a cocktail. i enjoyed the strawberry bliss, while my companion had the <mark>White Peach Sangria</mark>. both of the drinks were very well crafted, and all of the bartenders were really friendly and personable. i always enjoy when i can see them muddling ingredients and putting drinks together with care. my companion made an off-handed comment about the sangria being full of ice and not enough drink (because it was so good), and the bartender fixed him another at no charge! it wasn't even a complaint, and we certainly weren't expecting that.\n\nthe wait only ended up being about 35 minutes, and we were escorted upstairs to the dining room by the hostess. we were seated in a very cosy corner with the booth portion accented by lots of cute (and comfy) pillows.  our server, ramon, was very nice and made some recommendations for us. he was also serving a very large party near us, so service was on the rather leisurely (slow-ish) side.\n\nthe bread wasn't anything special, but it was soft in the middle, which i appreciated. it was served room temperature.  we initially started our meal with the octopus, which was one of ramon's picks (he talked us out of the calamari). unfortunately, it wasn't w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> expected and it wasn't exactly to our liking. it actually was like an octopus salad, with white beans and a light vinegar sauce. the octopus didn't have much flavor and was rather chewy.  this was the only negative portion of our meal. we mentioned to ramon t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> didn't really like it, and he brought out an order of calamari at no charge. the calamari was delicious! hot, lightly breaded, and had two sauces t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> equally good.\n\nthe main course.... steak! i got the ribeye, medium-rare, while my companion got the spencer steak, medium. both steaks are served with a large mushroom with breadcrumbs in it and chips. the chips seemed rather unnecessary, but they were fine. the steaks... absolutely delicious! they were highly seasoned (if you don't like salt, this may not be the right choice), and cooked perfectly. we also got a side of the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> (essentially deep fried mushrooms). they were very tasty, but i don't know if i'd order them again.\n\nthroughout our meal, one of the managers circulated to check on every table and make sure everyone was enjoying their meal, which was a nice touch. \n\necho & rig had so many yummy sounding things on their menu, t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> definitely would love to return to try some more of their offerings."

            "w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> great night for a bone in steak. we ended up at our usual spot-echo & rig-for one of our indulgent dinners for the month. we dined and had cocktails, ending on a high note--complimentary dessert--their turtle sundae. \n\ni tried their rib cap, flat iron, sirloin, and <mark>Hanger Steak</mark>. this was the first go at the bone in ribeye.\\u00a0 nicholas, our amazong server, helped us choose a great xut. the chef cooked it perfectly, simply seasoned to allow the quality cut to speak for itself. i tried a dip in the peppercorn, charred onion, and red wine sauces, but they are unnecessary with the steak. it's succulent, sexy, and the salty fat crust t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> into a heavenly cracker on the sides of each slice made my eyes roll back in ecstasy with every bite. \n\ni began <mark>A Love Affair</mark> with this restaurant since their doors opened, and continue to return for the surprises in every meal, the quality, the impeccable service, and the fact t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> costs 5 bills on the strip is readily available in the neighborhood. with great cocktails and amazing meats, i return to their open arms for moments like the one this steak provided.", 
            "i carelessly throw around the \"l-word\" & this review will not be spared its usage. \n\necho & rig was recommended by a family member who clearly knows great food & with confidance, i can now also vouch for e&r's deliciousness. \n\ni love love love t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> are over 30 \"small plates\" on the menu. grazing is my eating style, & if i weren't hell-bent on having filet, i would've ordered more than the superb portobello mushroom fries & herb aioli. tried a bite from his stack of thick-cut bacon w/ bbq sauce -- smokey, fatty, more like baked ham than bacon. \n\nlove love t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> get a (free!) sauce with your steak. his \"charred onion\" paired beautifully with his rib-eye cap, & my horseradish cream pick elevated an already lovely filet. say yes to their garlic mashed potatoes. \n\nand finally, love t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> service issue was immediately & professionally addressed. my filet arrived medium after we'd waited 40-minutes for our steaks. they whisked it away with sincere apologies, & the filet was returned well done as i had ordered. desserts & coffee (as if we could eat anymore!) were comped for our troubles (carmel turtle sundae is a must.) \n\nroom for improvement: though i love (lust) t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> pour ketel one, my cocktail, <mark>A Love Affair</mark>, delivered zero buzz, & tasted like a weak lemonade. \n\nprovided they don't make a habit of making customers endure excessive wait times for their steaks, e&r's extensive menu deserves a second look the next time we're in charming tivoli village."

            "i am not like a moon orbiting a massive radiant planet-called tivoli village. few cobblestones and a courtyard doesn't  transform it to an italian village. there is no eatery t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> healthy and ethnic enough to make my visit worthwhile. the shops mostly cater to women and w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> is there for men is overpriced junk or for teenagers on a sled. having said that, echo & rig, is a valid reason to visit. this newest steak house by chef and owner sam marvin (who is busy opening few more steak houses-one more coming to vegas next year- i was told.) the concept is unique-even for vegas ! a butcher and steak house. buy your meat and eat it too!\n\ni love a good steak like london broil and pepper steak,  t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> used to imbibe in chicago, but none of the chefs here know to how to cook london broil, not to mention the meat should be extra lean like sirloin beef or knuckle beef with fat less than 5% as opposed to a porter house steak t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> close to 50% fat. not only the steak houses don't have t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> of lean meat but there is no butcher on the premises. \n\nat echo & rig. the meat is displayed on your right as you walk in glassed freezer-the biggest walk in freezer-at a temperature of 32 degrees at all times and you can order knuckle steak or burger or sirloin steak.  next to the freezer is the biggest solid butcher block (on a broad day light when no one is looking i intend to take this to my kitchen.) \n\nyou can also get wagyu beef from wyoming or kobe beef  from kobe, japan. the beef is from grass fed cows with no steroids or antibiotics and the sirloin cut of meat (which is on display but not the knuckle beef, which has to be ordered 24 hrs before the cooking time) can be cooked as steak or burger..\n\nthe master butcher, by the name of trevor, is lean and healthy looking and  conscious of nutrition, unlike most of the chefs who are ruddy faced and rotund  like orson wells or hitchcock (by the way alfred hitchcock, who liked to be called hitch, was a prolific eater and he believed t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> good eater also had a good libido and imported meat, lamb and dover sole from england and claimed he served the best steak in in la at his own house.) they serve w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> people ask for and choose. the steak starts at $22.50 but this kind of meat in some gourmet houses are selling at three or four times the price and few of the chefs serving raw meat from unknown butcher.\n\nthe echo and rig is located in the circle where the fountain is, with the valet parked cars around the fountain (generally speaking, valet's are first cousins of mario fittipaldi and they have racing streak in them. they park my car at 45 miles an hour. i saw a valet in la changing tires at 60 miles an hour. the seat and mirror are adjusted to a midget driver.) this is one complimentary gesture t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> will not make use of.\n\nthere are two patios, one on the ground floor facing the alta drive and the other on the second floor facing the fountains, which is perfect for private parties. the ambiance is good but there is lot of wasted space.and the one mini bar with waitresses carrying full glasses of wine up the stairs-is a disaster to happen. the bar only serve draft beer and i was not a <mark>Santa Fe Happy Camper</mark>, since they have no beer mugs or tall frosted beer glasses (one downgrade) the glasses are the kind you find in a biker bars or bars on main street or the english pubs.\n\nhowever, they do have half / full glass of wine which is a great idea and they are reasonably priced, on my next visit better the red wine be chilled (and not las vegas room temperature of 120 degrees, as the master somme-liars! tell them to serve) if not i will downgrade another point. the also sell organic beef jerky, cast iron skillet and other items.\n\nthere is no theme here, with antlers head poking out of the wall or mahogany wood or some gimmick to make it look like it is inhabited by macho men or men with fat cigars and fake display of wealth with borrowed bmw's. good healthy steak is the theme. better the other steak houses follow the theme and pricing or they will be extinct..along with the antlers head !", 
            "hello echo echo & rig.  we finally get a taste of w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> buzz is all about.\nwe knew t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> took no reservations, but coming in at 6pm on a saturday night (which we thought was early), we didn't expect to have to wait over one and a half hours for our table.  it was chaos up front.  and the hostess was polite, but lacking a sincere warmth.  good thing we loaded up with wine and tapas next door.  if you detest waiting, come at an odd hour.  if you don't, then be patient to get a table, and even more patient for the food to arrive.  \nthe restaurant is beautiful... tall ceilings, beautiful meat greeting your appetites at the door, and a masculine but comfy bar to wait, load up and people watch. \nwhen your table is finally ready, you get whisked upstairs to a gorgeous space t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> around a whimsical chandelier.  it's one of those great hangouts for a hot date or the whole family because any baby cries would be drowned out by the noise of the crowd.  there is also a well-heated dining balcony area for fans of the outdoors or cigarettes.  \nget to the food woman!  ok ok, were they worth all the wait?  it was quite divided at our table.  were the cocktails fabulous?  yes.  the food was good, but i'm not sure i'd like to wait t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> for steak i can get elsewhere without a wait.  eeep, but that's the truth.  \nwe did enjoy the food.  we had the portabella mushroom fries with herb aioli (definitely a must-try), the bibb salad with radicchio blue cheese and balsamic dressing (a great pair up with the meat), the sea bass a la plancha which comes with an olive-oil sauce (nothing else), the lamb chops with a wee bit potatoes and apricots, and finally the rib-eye steak which come with 1 quite bland stuffed mushroom and pretty good potato chips.  \ni love how they organized the menu - steaks, salad, small plates divided into price categories.  all of which i am pretty sure will please any palette and wallet.  but my biggest beef with the main entrees is (and i am a petite woman who enjoys sushi) the main meals itself are a little lacking... either in weight or side dish pairings.  make my meat cuts larger, or give me more substantial sides with my main entr\\u00e9e, and i will be one <mark>Santa Fe Happy Camper</mark>... who will still order your small plates.  i promise.  \nt<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> the servers told us they had introduced 20 new items to the menu which were causing delays in the kitchen.  this restaurant is still working out its kinks, but overall, we had a good dining experience.  definitely try it out and gauge for yourself if it deserves a repeat."

            "so how does one start a review of a restaurant/butcher shop???? i tell you how, with a comment a good friend said as she was looking at all the meat cuts, wow,  w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> great alternative to wf's!  i can come here order my meat and have a martini while i wait until they cut it up fresh!  t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> how i am starting my review of echo & rig.  and the patience and care the 23 year old butcher, yup t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> not a typo, t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> care of her, while in slicing her meat was ...frankly in today's world amazing - t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> call customer service.\n\nt<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> does not end there, it only begins there.  jason and courtnee  are polite without being pushy, knowing the menu items and making the correct recommendations; friendly but professional, comparable to the 5 star restaurants i have eaten at in las vegas - t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> the service we received at echo & rig, not once, but two nights in a row.  not to mention michael , who is just so excited to have the restaurant open - well michael you are not the only one, we of vegas and especially summerlin, cannot be happier, to have a premier, delicious, vivacious, restaurant with great energy opened in our backyard.  welcome to the neighborhood!\n\nand now for the food -  omg, delicious.  <mark>Fried Spinach</mark> salad, kale with baby yellow beets, gratin caramelized onion soup with pumpkin squash (i would come back just for that), <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>, brussels sprouts with pistachio and fresh lemon, black spaghetti with seafood and roasted peppers, butter fish, sea bass, skirt steak, prime rib, caramel salted ice cream and short cake and berries with ice cream.... yup t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> more, not one bad item, not one complaint from me or in two days from the 6 people i ate with.  the people around us ate different items and could not stop complementing them, such as the bone marrow and carne asada.  if you are a meat eating you will love this place, if you are conscious of farm to table eating, you will love this place, if you are a vegetarian, there are plenty of choices.  so let me recap: great atmosphere, great food, amazing service and prices, beyond reasonable.  least i forget to mention the cocktails; they do know how to make a drink. so w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> this mean, you need to go and try echo & rig at tivoli village, make your reservations , book your parties, bring your friends, stop by for a drink, you are not going to regret it!  and they have only just gotten started so it is only going to get better!!", 
            "i am not like a moon orbiting a massive radiant planet-called tivoli village. few cobblestones and a courtyard doesn't  transform it to an italian village. there is no eatery t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> healthy and ethnic enough to make my visit worthwhile. the shops mostly cater to women and w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> is there for men is overpriced junk or for teenagers on a sled. having said that, echo & rig, is a valid reason to visit. this newest steak house by chef and owner sam marvin (who is busy opening few more steak houses-one more coming to vegas next year- i was told.) the concept is unique-even for vegas ! a butcher and steak house. buy your meat and eat it too!\n\ni love a good steak like london broil and pepper steak,  t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> used to imbibe in chicago, but none of the chefs here know to how to cook london broil, not to mention the meat should be extra lean like sirloin beef or knuckle beef with fat less than 5% as opposed to a porter house steak t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> close to 50% fat. not only the steak houses don't have t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> of lean meat but there is no butcher on the premises. \n\nat echo & rig. the meat is displayed on your right as you walk in glassed freezer-the biggest walk in freezer-at a temperature of 32 degrees at all times and you can order knuckle steak or burger or sirloin steak.  next to the freezer is the biggest solid butcher block (on a broad day light when no one is looking i intend to take this to my kitchen.) \n\nyou can also get wagyu beef from wyoming or kobe beef  from kobe, japan. the beef is from grass fed cows with no steroids or antibiotics and the sirloin cut of meat (which is on display but not the knuckle beef, which has to be ordered 24 hrs before the cooking time) can be cooked as steak or burger..\n\nthe master butcher, by the name of trevor, is lean and healthy looking and  conscious of nutrition, unlike most of the chefs who are ruddy faced and rotund  like orson wells or hitchcock (by the way alfred hitchcock, who liked to be called hitch, was a prolific eater and he believed t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> good eater also had a good libido and imported meat, lamb and dover sole from england and claimed he served the best steak in in la at his own house.) they serve w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> people ask for and choose. the steak starts at $22.50 but this kind of meat in some gourmet houses are selling at three or four times the price and few of the chefs serving raw meat from unknown butcher.\n\nthe echo and rig is located in the circle where the fountain is, with the valet parked cars around the fountain (generally speaking, valet's are first cousins of mario fittipaldi and they have racing streak in them. they park my car at 45 miles an hour. i saw a valet in la changing tires at 60 miles an hour. the seat and mirror are adjusted to a midget driver.) this is one complimentary gesture t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> will not make use of.\n\nthere are two patios, one on the ground floor facing the alta drive and the other on the second floor facing the fountains, which is perfect for private parties. the ambiance is good but there is lot of wasted space.and the one mini bar with waitresses carrying full glasses of wine up the stairs-is a disaster to happen. the bar only serve draft beer and i was not a <mark>Santa Fe Happy Camper</mark>, since they have no beer mugs or tall frosted beer glasses (one downgrade) the glasses are the kind you find in a biker bars or bars on main street or the english pubs.\n\nhowever, they do have half / full glass of wine which is a great idea and they are reasonably priced, on my next visit better the red wine be chilled (and not las vegas room temperature of 120 degrees, as the master somme-liars! tell them to serve) if not i will downgrade another point. the also sell organic beef jerky, cast iron skillet and other items.\n\nthere is no theme here, with antlers head poking out of the wall or mahogany wood or some gimmick to make it look like it is inhabited by macho men or men with fat cigars and fake display of wealth with borrowed bmw's. good healthy steak is the theme. better the other steak houses follow the theme and pricing or they will be extinct..along with the antlers head !", 
            "w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> concept: 5 star food at 3 star prices! seriously affordable awesomeness here, with eminently sharable plates starting at $5.\n   everything is made from scratch, which makes everything from sausage to designer cocktails amazeballs great. we had the rib eye cap steak... taken from the most tender part of the rib eye area (i'm not a meat expert! but they are). it was seriously the best steak we've ever eaten, and at $22, are you kidding me? they had a choice of 8 sauces, but none tasted as good as the naked steak. also amazing was the lighter-than-air \"over the rainbow\" chopped salad (quinoa, citrus, veggies in a champagne vinaigrette dressing), $8. and the crispy fried <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> with aioli dip was a knockout, don't miss them w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> you do.\n   we bought an awesome roast and some amazing breakfast sausage (made t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>!) at the butcher shop downstairs, on the way out. meat so awesomely fresh t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> can tell you the story of each kind of meat... where the cow came from, how it was raised, how it lived (on the farm, grazing naturally), no hormones no preservatives, none of that. and super reasonably priced, just like our meal was upstairs. we'll be back, just for the butcher shop.\n   sorry to run off at the mouth, but echo & rig should not be missed.\n   great service, too... intuitive but not interruptive. ask for patrick!", 
            "schizophrenic but promising. \nas with any new restaurant, bugs to be worked out. the downstairs check-in/bar wait area appears really disorganized, probably more so than it is. the huge entry seems to be a huge waste of space, especially when you see how cramped some of the areas upstairs are. the butcher area is cool, but i need to see if the selection and quality are up to the hype. \n\nmy biggest issue was with the menu. it is poorly laid out at best. they claim to feature their small plates and \"butcher cuts\", yet they are some of the smaller sections on the menu, compared to salads? and lunches??\nalso, the pitch the waiter gives about the specialty cuts being so unique-tri tip, sirloin, flank steak???\nhaving said all that, the food was good, some of it very good. the sides were terrific (cauliflower, kale, bone marrow,asparagus, etc). the hangar steak is terrific. \nhowever, they also offer 3 cuts \"by the inch\"-ny strip, ribeye, filet. the \"inch\" was more like a half and the meat was ok. just ok. tender but not t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> and disappointing. \none great thing-bring your own wine-no corkage fee. \n\nas soon as this place decides w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> really wants to be, it will improve dramatically. i'd love to think they'd move away from trying to be all things and really emphasize the small plates and specialty cuts. vegas, and the neighborhood, needs w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> and rig could be.", 
            "so far i've only attended the trial runs, so i'll be brief. everything my girlfriend and i tried was exceptional (and we tried a lot of food and drinks). i see great things for this place and it's a very welcome addition to our area. chef marvin has come up with an excellent plan and his exec chef aaron is seeing it through with great attention to both how the food looks and tastes. i'll write a true review when i've paid for a meal or two......or three. because with service and food like t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'ll be back time and again", 
            "dinner (the appetizers, steak and side dishes) was great. jason, our waiter, was excellent. however, there is lots of training and fine tuning to be done. i could have died of thirst waiting for my cocktails before dinner and wine with dinner. the bar is downstairs and the dining area upstairs. not a goos configuration. my second drink (i asked for a twist) came without it even though the first drink had one. go figure. the worst part was t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> had to run my bill three times before they got it right, t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> really strange. all in all, the place will be a hit as soon as they fix all the issues and figure out how to get the drinks from the first flor to the second floor a bit faster.", 
            "me wife and i visited for the first time last night. great service, food and very reasonable pricing for a upscale steakhouse. we shared the burratta with peas and the sausage, beans and escarole as appetizers, both were marvelous. my wife had the <mark>Hanger Steak</mark> and i decided to try the black spaghetti, both of those dishes were very good. the restaurant is clearly laid out much differently than most. they greet you upon arrival, take down your name and escort you to the 2nd floor dining area. i found the dining area little noisier than expected and had a little difficulty hearing my wife from time to time. but other than that, i found it a very pleasant dining experience. and btw, we enjoyed the fresh sausage so much t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> bought a pound at the butcher shop on the way out! can't wait to fire up our bbq for another taste of their sausage!", 
            "i usually will wait until a 2nd visit to review a place, however if the place is really bad or amazingly good i'll write a review when i get home from the place. this is one of those reviews.\n\ni don't often make it up to tivoli village but on the trips i did i would always peek in the windows and see how things were going at echo & rig. tonight i finally got into the place and it was great.\n\nwhen we entered they walked us through the lower level, we got to check out the butcher shop, the deli/charcuterie counter, and the bar before heading upstairs to the dining room.\n\nthe layout is a little random with the bar/butcher shop downstairs, and the dining room & kitchen upstairs. the dining room is very open and there's some room between the tables. there is a patio off the dining room and an exhibition kitchen along the entire south wall of the dining room.\n\nthe servers were attentive, the hosts were friendly, the bussers were quick to refill the water glasses (complimentary sparkling or still water), and bringing the proper weapons(utensils) to make sure we could properly enjoy our meals.\n\nthe food was really, really damn good. we had several things off of their expansive (over 90 item) menu. the hardest part of the entire meal was selecting which items on the menu to try and which to keep for another visit.\n\nthe meal started with a bread basket, it was a pretty basic looking basket with 3 slices of bread and no butter, at first i thought it was odd, but after trying the bread i realized butter wasn't needed.\n\nnext up was our small plate \"appetizers\". first up was the thick cut bacon and bbq sauce. the bacon was grilled which added a great flavor, the bbq sauce was ok, but i mainly ate the bacon plain and it was good. we also had the bone marrow carne asada, yes you read t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> it's not only \"gods butter\" bone marrow it also comes with carne asada as well a perfect combo on the toast.\n\nafter t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> the charcuterie plate, prosciutto, 3 different salamis, pate, and head cheese all were delish, but the prosciutto was my favorite.  next was grilled octopus, now i myself am not an octopus guy, but this dish was amazing and made me rethink my <mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> for octopus. we also had the mushroom soup, it was creamy and delish.\n\nnext was the entree course, i had the butcher's cut ribeye which was a 14oz steak cooked medium rare (possibly a touch over), served with garlic chips and mushroom rockefeller. this would have been enough on it's own, but not for us. we also added <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>, mashed potatoes, and heirloom carrots for bonus eats. the potatoes and carrots were amazing, but the steak was the stand out item of the meal. i'm not a fan of steak sauces, but if you are, unlike most places t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> $5-7 for a sauce, echo & rig includes one free sauce with your steak, which is a nice touch.\n\nas if all this food wasn't enough the waiter told us about the dessert menu. they  only serve ice cream sundaes. and after hearing him say \"salted caramel ice cream\" i was getting the turtle sundae. it was the perfect end to an amazing meal.\n\ni can't wait to get back and try the rest of their menu. i really am looking forward to their late night menu for a late bite before heading to la casa down the road for the a cigar.\n\nalso the have free wifi for all your food porn posting needs which is a great added bonus", 
            "back in the day, butcher shops had meats hanging and in cold cases with shelves of spices and oils on a wall, some with tables in the middle of the shop for patrons to eat the smoked meats and bread they just picked up. now forward t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> to the 21st century and you have echo & rig in las vegas. this is the genius of a few great men, two years of planning, nine months of hard work and dedication to open up at tivoli village in a prime location--right at the center where the patio seating feels like lunch in europe. \n\nfrom the moment i stepped into this place i was taken by the open butcher area at the front behind the hostess counter-slash-cashier. there is a great counter with seating for the charcuterie quick lunch, a bar for a great cocktail (or three)\" and the second floor houses their delectable restaurant. \n\nthe menu is beautiful and almost feels like a take on the bottega louie menu style: small plates, salads, soups, steaks, entrees, and drinks. the back of the menu houses their extensive wine collection. i love having the option of grabbing small plates as sides and apps.  \n\nsince this was my first experience as well as my husband's, we ordered three small plates--charcuterie, mashed potatoes, and fried chicken with a red wine reduction. we also indulged in to steaks--the spencer cut for myself and the hangar steak butcher's cut per the suggestion of our excellent server, michaela. we also dabbled in a bottle of naked riesling. \n\nthe fried chicken and bread arrived first after a five or six minute wait. the fried chicken is different; it is cut up after frying, apparently, so at first i thought it wasn't actually fried chicken. we are so used to heavy coatings or tempura battered chicken t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> one looked too different to be great. \n\ni was dead wrong. \n\nnot only is their fried chicken juicy, the skin is so crispy t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> my fork into it made a crackling sound. t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> the sound of heaven. the reduction was amazing. it was so good t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> wished we ordered one per person instead of one to share. the reduction was sweet and bold, sticky and full like the wine it's made of. it was so good t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> used the bread to sop up w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> left of it in the plate. out of all the fried chicken in town this has to be one of the top three if not the best. \n\nthe charcuterie was so good t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> failed to photograph the plate. the head cheese is made in house and is absolutely silken divinity on a plate. we also had melt-in-your-mouth proscuitto aged 24 months, along with a beef and pork rillette. it was served with pickles, toast points, and whole mustard. amazing. the sour pickle with the hearty mustard on all the rich meat made for a perfect bite every time i dug in. \n\nthe main event--our steaks--were the jewels of the meal. both were done medium to preserve the beautiful flavors and juices if the meat and they were cooked to perfection. served with garlic chips and a mushroom rockefeller, the entire dish was hearty, meaty, as it should be. the meat was tender, full of flavor and had no need for any sauce or salt and pepper. it's nakedness was all t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> necessary because of the quality and care in cooking. every bite made me want to raise my fork and cry out like a caveman! that's how meaty goodness should be praised. those steaks justified my love of red meat and is one of the best steaks i've had in five years living in vegas. \n\nif all t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> wasn't enough, a cabernet sorbet was required. it's deep and rich, sweet in all the right ways, and with a bite of mint leaf with each spoonful, it was sheer heaven. it's the perfect palette cleanser. with a glass of ros\\u00e9 and riesling, the ending to this culinary adventure was a sweet one. \n\nin the end we walked out with a few things from the shop downstairs-some balsamic salt t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> make in house, walnut oil, beef jerky, and some candy. i cooed at the cases of meat on display and look forward to coming back for some prime cuts. \n\nwith excellent service, impeccable food and a butcher shop to die for, i will come back to echo & rig just to sit at a table near the kitchen to hear the echo, and to admire the rig downstairs as the cut the meats.  this is one of the best off the strip neighborhood restaurants in the entire city and i look forward to eating through their entire menu in the months to come.", 
            "this is the best steakhouse off the strip.  and even with that, echo & rig has so much more going for it!\n\ni came here with a 8 adults and 4 kids for my wife's birthday dinner on a very busy saturday night.  even though they normally don't take reservations, the manager i spoke with on the phone the day before (cheryl) was very helpful as i had my eye on the big long striped wooden table t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> pictured on their site and they saved it for us.  we arrived a few minutes before and were treated to passed hors d'oeuvres of their homemade salami and smoked chicken.  yum freakin yum.\n\nwith so many small plates offered, echo & rig is meant for groups so everything can be shared.  we split 3 salads and they all threw curveballs to the palate.  the kale salad with yellow beets, <mark>Toast</mark> hazelnuts and goat cheese was really nice.  their \"over the rainbow salad\" was an explosion of flavor featuring farro, quinoa, red, yellow & orange bell peppers, corn, red onion, asparagus, cherry tomatoes, almonds, herbs & champagne vinaigrette.  that's a vegetarian's dream right there.  and the <mark>Fried Spinach</mark> salad with red onion, cauliflower, broccoli was fantastic with the chile-lime vinaigrette was probably my favorite of them all.  the crispness of the spinach combined with the heat from the dressing was quite a combination.  \n\nwe ordered a bunch of small plates and the standouts for me were the cauliflower with chili de arbol, crispy shallots and onions and the roasted garlic mashed potatoes with sharp white cheddar but the description didn't do t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>.  it was almost like a super hash brown with a really nice dijon sauce.  i was also able to sample the burnt peas, pumpkin squash, grilled thick cut bacon with bbq sauce (no sauce needed), butcher's sausage and mac and cheese.  all of them were solid options and everything was devoured by the group.  \n\ni got the \"spencer steak\" which was one of the 3 ribeye cuts offered.  each steak comes with a complimentary sauce and i went with charred onion but sauce just isn't necessary when the meat is awesome.  my medium rare cut was closer to rare but it was probably better t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>.  it was everything you wanted in a steak...tender, juicy and flavorful.  my wife's rare filet mignon was cooked perfectly and just got better bite after bite.\n\nthen there's the freakin value of it all!!  the priciest entree is only $35!  no corkage fee (we brought 3 bottles), no cake fee (got a cake from patisserie manon) and they lit the candles and brought it out.  the total bill for 8 adults and 4 kids came out to what 2 people would spend at carnevino.  total wine and more is just across the way in boca park so pick something up there.  \n\ni cannot wait to come back since there are so many other dishes i must try like bone marrow carne asada and hawaiian cowboy.  i also can't wait for them to bust out their brunch and late night menus.  they also have tables set up on a balcony overlooking the tivoli village fountain which would make for a terrific date night.   \n\nthe staff was top notch from beginning to end and the experience here wouldn't have been as wonderful as it was without their great work.  they earned their tips and then some! i'm ready to go back for lunch.  \n\nsay hi to the pig heads outside!!", 
            "good steak; they marinate cheaper, tougher cuts of beef & make it taste good by charcoal grilling. the side of cauliflower was excellent. we enjoyed the skirt and <mark>Hanger Steak</mark>. the caesar salad was good but  the dressing did not taste like it had garlic in it. the waitress was the ditziest i have ever experienced..every 3rd word was yummie..gr8 english vocabulary she had, dah..poor vegas education or just an absolute ditz. when we asked about the sides..well, her comment was they are all so awesome & yummie with no description of any. we finally got bread as we finished our entrees. the tuscan bread was the saltiest i have ever had..absolutely inedible.  we will  return for the steak & sides. they are quite disorganized with so many employees t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> poorly trained or just poorly educated young kids. poor on the service side. definitely not even close to t bones in red rock. the meats in the butcher shop are off the chart expensive & they raise the per lb price almost every day. no way is a lousy tough ny strip steak worth $27./lb.  the whole carcusses are hanging in their window as are 2 whole headless pigs and their heads are on the top shelf. t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> enough to turn anybody off. very attractive restaurant but extremely loud with marble-like hard floors. the restaurant is on the 2nd floor. nice outdoor dining if it is not too hot outdoors.",

            "hands down one of the best steak houses in town!  best value $22 for a steak - how does this place make any money?!!\n\nit was packed and we had to wait an hour but we had no problems since we sampled a dozen items while we were waiting including lamb sausage, bolognese, sirloin steak, pork sandwich, and much more.  with all the sampling they provide, i'd actually prefer to arrive at a busy time for the freebies.\n\nno corkage fees and when the manager saw t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> had our bottle in hand while we were waiting, she took it to go get it chilled and brought it out immediately when we were seated.  \n\nwe ordered the spencer steak (specialized rib eye) and the lamb chops which was some of the highest quality and best bang for the buck steaks you can get.  this was accompanied by <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> fried perfectly with a little crisp and all the fresh umami meatiness from the mushrooms.   the cauliflower you could practically feed to kids...so delicious.\n\nwe will definitely be back.   i stll dont know how this place makes any money but we'll continue to go back.  with the free wine corkage and ridiculously cheap prices, i dont know how you could ever go on the strip.   echo and rig is a must!", 
            "i was excited to check out e&r for the first time. i read excellent reviews, which we found be be partially true the night we went for dinner. they do not take reservations so the wait was an hour and a half.  our server was very friendly and helpful. we let her order our meal. we has a little of everything. the owner sam was expediting dishes and the food came up pretty fast.  the negatives were it was extremely noisy. my steak was a little over cooked. we ordered wine and it was  served in the cheap small glasses vs the larger wine glasses t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> use when ordering full bottles. i asked for a new glass and was accommodated quickly.  they haven't been open long and are still getting some of the bugs out. i will be returning as we really did enjoy our meal", 
            "i tried echo & rig 3 times. i will never go back. lunch food is so so and dinner is better at other summerlin restaurants. steaks are sometimes 4 star but skip the dry <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark>. since they don't take reservations be prepared to be insulted as i heard one of the owners, michael, tell a couple you can leave if you don't want to wait 45 minutes. the previous time there i overheard him chastise a lady with her friends she could leave after she paid her bill because someone told him, she was unhappy with the service. she got her salad during her companions dinner and received her appetizer after the salad. w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> happened to keeping your customers happy? be sure to keep away from the host, pavlav. he is too busy to help you since he is too busy chasing the girls in tight dresses. not professional front of the house people. food is nothing special. sam has a lot of kinks to work out.", 
            "i am curious know of how much they have paid for pr.,,. from my experience, along with others, nothing there has been quality. staff has been extremely under trained.  i have seen the right ups in the paper along with reviews and wonder how such accommodations have been acquired.  this is not a restaurant t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> last in the \"suburbia\" of las vegas...", 
            "amazing. the food was fantastic. the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> were so good just order an extra aioli. get the spencer cut. it's kind of like a fillet and ribeye mix, but don't be crazy, you have to order it medium rare. the horseradish cream sauce and the charred onion sauce were bomb too. the mac and cheese was pretty good and the cauliflower also. just watch out for the little brown chunks in the cauliflower because it's brown sugar. beer is draught or can which is fine because they have a good draught selection. the only complaint i have is t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> bar is downstairs and the restaurant is upstairs which means the wait staff takes a while to bring you a drink. downstairs is a butcher shop and a little sandwich stand. both are pretty cool. the butchers seemed pretty knowledgeable and personable and the prices weren't horrible either. probably cheaper than whole foods. the hostess was very nice and respectful and fun to c<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>. all in all this place is most likely my favorite steak joint and will recommend it to all of my friends. keep up the good work!!!", 
            "the best restaurant to come along in quite some time. they don't take reservations, but it gave me time to go check out the specialty cocktail menu. for $8, these drinks are a preview of how reasonable the rest of the menu is. i tried the bourbon peach tree cocktail and it was heavy on the alcohol. besides the bourbon, all you can taste is the mint. it was not well balanced, but for someone who likes their brown liquors, this is great. i still liked it. the hot & bothered was my favorite though. the mixture of spicy and sweet was phenomenal. the mango syrup was not too overbearing and the spice lingered on your lips. \n\ni sat in the lounge for 20 minutes before someone came to get my guest and i. we were taken upstairs to our table. within minutes our server came by to introduce herself and i tried to get a few recommendations. with such a spectrum of items being suggested, it did not make it any easier. \n\nw<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> ended up deciding on was astounding. for starters, we got the \"over the rainbow\" salad and the bone marrow carne asada. holy cow are they amazing. the best contrast of something healthy with a heart stopping appetizer. the mixture of grains with corn and veggies had me shoveling it down. the fatty goodness of the bone marrow had me wanting more. a squeeze of orange cuts the fat. as our protein, we went with the spencer steak. $25 for a ten ounce steak with housemade chips and a mushroom rockefeller. w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> deal! when we got it, it was cooked to a perfect medium rare. with that, you get a choice of sauce. initially, we ordered the green peppercorn thinking it would pack some bold heat. it is more creamy and possessed little flavor. afterwards, we asked for the chimichurri and t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> much better. the capers in it had me scooping it up. adding the crispy cauliflower tossed with chili de arbol and portabello fries was more than enough for two. if i had to choose between the two again, i'd go with the former. the sweet and spice of the florets had me wanting to plan another visit. the meatiness of the fries were good, but the aioli was w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> them. we were dipping anything we could get our hands on in it. i was ready to tap out, but sarah marie wanted to see the dessert menu. they don't have one, but our server broke down all of their desserts for us. they only have sundaes. i was a littl surprised by that, but i am a huge ice cream fan. we ended up with the salted turtle sundae. the roasted peanuts, toffee pieces, salted caramel, chocolate sauce, and salted caramel ice cream was to die for. we were filled to the brim, but t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> did not go to waste. \n\nall in all, it was the best dining experience i could have asked for. we ended up hanging out there for quite some time. their timing was perfect. i didn't even realize t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> had a three hour dining experience because they always had something in front of us and the pace was so controlled.", 
            "probably would have been five stars, but when we arrived shortly after the opening time of eleven a.m. on a saturday morning, there was no one to seat us.  my wife and i just stood the looking around the empty room waiting for some assistance, while a small staff meeting congregated on the other side of the room.  not one one person acknowledged us with a \"we'll be with you in just a minute\" or any other indication t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> even existed.  we turned to leave, and just as we did someone who appeared to be a manager or owner very apologetically and courteously showed us to a table, and from there on the experience was great.\n\nlove the menu selection...some good small plate selection...interesting without getting overly cute.  the marrow bone carne asada is an excellent example of that (although a couple more pieces of toast would have been helpful).  also tried some ravioli in hazelnut brown butter and fried sage.  this is a favorite of ours, and echo's version definitely measures up.  our server, anna,, was very helpful and attentive without being overbearing.  and the wine list is very accessible and affordable while still offering some really nice wines (four graces is always a plus).  when we chose a wine t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> were out of, they brought us two or three bottleas as alternatives and offered them at the same price...\n\nwe're looking forward to return trips, and to the brunch menu they'll soon be offering.  i was told t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> owners are also the owners of bottega louie in l.a....and excellent spot downtown t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> had experienced before.  i wold strongly recommend echo and rig to anyone.", 
            "so sad t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> had an awful experience. i am giving 2 stars because the menu is wonderful, prices seem fair but we never got our food! we were bombarded with people the minute we walked in and had a hard time finding a nice atmosphere due to the blinding lighting (it was 7 pm) and it looked like broad daylight. we got our starter within 10 minutes but after 45 minutes and watching other, newer bar mates receive their food we asked about ours.the bartender said \"do you want me to check on it?\"... t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> have been the first warning. he came back and waited  on other guests and we finally got his attention to ask if he found out about our food and he said yes, 10 more minutes, when we said it it had a long time so he said the kitchen was backed up ( there were 2 others at the bar and 2 other 2 tops in site). we then waited more than 10 with no word or apology so we asked for the check (twice). we couldn't pay until the bartender got his manager and he came over saying our food was coming but we were literally trying to leave at this point. i am most sad t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> wanted so badly to eat here, the food looked great and other than the horrible lighting in an otherwise nice atmosphere the restaurant was just a compete miss, we won't be back and really hope they can get it together so others can enjoy a potentially great restaurant. shame, shame. summerlin needs a good restaurant t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> stick around. unfortunately, i don't think they can cut the mustard. this is bad for all of us.",

            "with all of the hype and the paid advertisement in urban daddy, i thought i might make the trek off the strip to echo and rig.  it was advertised as butcher shop where you can pick your meat and they will cook it for you.  all the meats are grass fed and come from california.  upon walking in, you see the butchers in action slicing meats, making <mark>Sausage</mark>, and grinding beef for meatballs and hamburgers.\n\nthey don't take reservations, so expect to wait a little bit before getting a table.  the good thing is t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> have a bar with 3-4 bartenders slinging up craft cocktails and making a great impression.  the bartender even gave us some complimentary shots of jalapeno infused tequila which seemed to improve our moods.  the drinks were $8, which is reasonable compared to $15-$18 drinks on the strip, so t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> well for us.  \n\nafter a 15 minute wait, we got a table and a great personable server.  they presented us with the selections of meats on a platter, which were supposedly steaks for 2 people.  i could have easily eaten their ny strip which was 24 ounces and sold by the ounce ($2.29/ounce).  so yea, it would have been a $50+ steak. \n\nwe opted for for the hangar steak with chimichurri ($22.5) and the ribeye ($34.50) along with a couple of appetizers of <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> and a charcuterie platter with assorted meats.  the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> were delicious and the charcuterie platter was a very good.  then the main course came.\n\nmy ribeye was about 10 ounces for $34 and was maybe 3/4 inch thick.  it was well cooked, but one of the worst ribeyes t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> have eaten in a long time.  i get better meat at sam's club.  the hangar steak was charred on the outside and chewy as all hell. the portion size of the hangar steak was probably about 5-6 ounces and even though it is probably the correct amount of food per dietary guidelines as a serving, it was small and we did not leave feeling full, but left with a bill of over $150.\n\ni would try it again, but i wouldn't go back for dinner.  maybe their sandwiches and lunch selections will be a bit better.", 
            "first i want to say t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> who gave this place a bad review is full of crap. i can see this becoming my favorite restaurant of all time. the ambiance on the patio was spectacular. our server was so very nice. the food was unbelievably perfect. portions were big so we brought enough home for a second meal. \ni cannot wait to go back again.",

(this does not seem like a typical thing so don't expect it.)  there is a small bar t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> crowded for a thursday and a small appetizer bar t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> the charcuterie plate, sausage plate and a few other items.\n\nwe were seated upstairs where our waiter brian explained the menu to us.  the menu consists of small plates (appetizers or sides or combine a few to make a meal) and steaks.  unlike the traditional steak restaurants t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> on ny and ribeye and filet, echo has a wide selection of variety steaks like spencer steak (essentially a boneless ribeye without the cap), ribeye cap, hanger, flatiron and more.  you can also get the traditional steaks.  i enjoy the pick your own sauce option and was extremely glad when the sauce came as a side so i could decide how much to put on.\n\ni asked for the flatiron steak medium rare.  the service took a long time and in afterthought, i would have them bring the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> (portobello mushroom, lightly breaded and fried with an amazing aioli.) as an appetizer so we didn't feel like the wait was long.  brian was very attentive in an old school waiter type way, remembering my name, ushering me to the restroom when i had to go, and making sure our water was filled.\n\nsparkling and flat water are available gratis (free).\n\none of the best parts of this place is the price - portion ratio.  the flat iron steak runs at $17.00 and is a 7 oz portion. (note, they can make a ribeye as large as 64 oz if you really must eat t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>).  one of my biggest complaints about the traditional steakhouses is the steaks are usually 12-16 oz.  i almost never finish them and i cannot think of anything else t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> so easily ruined by overnight refrigeration and reheating than a good medium rare steak.   here, the 7 oz was just enough to fill my tummy and not make me feel overstuffed.\n\nwe also loved the asparagus and fried egg appetizer and the spencer steak.\n\nso why not 5 stars you ask?  1) presentation was boring. essentially steak on a plate surrounded by some potato chips. i don't need fancy but there was a pile of chips on the left side of my plate, the steak in the center and about 1/3 the plate empty on the right. and 2) the service time was long as the place did not seem very crowded.\n\nsome other interesting facts about echo & rig are 1) you can bring your own wine with no corkage fee!!!! and 2) they make their own ribeye jerky.  even their glass prices for wine are reasonable.\n\nenjoy!", 
            "the highlight of this place is, without a doubt, t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> serve grass-fed steaks at legit prices! i ordered the <mark>Hanger Steak</mark> and the wife had the spencer steak. both were absolutely excellent. they were cooked and seasoned almost perfectly. the atmosphere is great, the staff is great, the bar downstairs has a great sangria. overall, i think it's my new go-to steakhouse. the prices for the quality of food you're getting is just amazing.\n\naside from our main dishes, we had the mashed potatoes and the asparagus with fried egg. both were also amazingly delicious. one of the waiters came by and asked out of curiosity why i'd ordered the asparagus and i had to admit it was a legit question. not usually two things t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> ever would have thought to put together. my answer to him was, \"well, i like eggs and i like asparagus, so i figured i couldn't lose.\"  i was right. it's a combination i never would have thought of t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> together very well. the sauce on the plate is also delicious, and the flavors all just go together.\n\nthey brought out bread while we waited for our appetizers, which i usually don't eat. i made an exception this time and ended up eating all four pieces. it was very very good, and apparently very high quality because i didn't feel terrible after eating it. i have found t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> higher the quality of ingredients in a few foods i avoid --\\u00a0like bread, for example --\\u00a0the less terrible i will feel. i still shouldn't have eaten it and felt the effects later, but i don't regret it. the bread was delicious and was high quality.\n\nthere are three things t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was not too happy with during the meal. one, i ordered the bone marrow appetizer and the waiter came back about 10 minutes later to tell me t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> were all out of bone marrow. i wish he would have known t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> i ordered it, and i wish they wouldn't have run out! not a big deal, since this is w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> me order the asparagus and egg which ended up being delicious also. two, the <mark>Hanger Steak</mark> was cut incorrectly. a steak like this needs to be cut across the grain of the meat, otherwise the fibers in the pieces are very long and it makes the steak chewy. thankfully, the steak was cut in such a way t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> i made the pieces smaller i was able to cut them across the grain myself and the steak was definitely cooked just right so it was perfect when properly cut. third, and this was the case for both my and my wife's steak, the char on the outside was a bit heavy on the ends. two small bites of each steak on the ends was very charcoal-like, with t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> texture and bitter taste. it doesn't extend too far into the meat so you're just losing the nice seared exterior of these two very small parts of the meat, and i ate them anyway. just something t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'d like to see them be more watchful of.\n\nthis place is definitely a 5-star-worthy steak house, and if you're trying to eat paleo you can  just chow down on grass-fed steak and a bunch of paleo-friendly appetizers and have a great night out.\n\npro tip: a spencer steak is s boneless ribeye; also called a delmonico steak in some places, but really it's just a ribeye. the spencer steak here is ~$10 cheaper than the bone-in ribeye. you get the same great cut of meat and more for your money by weight, but you miss out a bit on the little something extra of flavor t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> bone imparts.",

            "echo & rig... first of all, it has a cool name. i admit, this is one of the first reasons i was interested. tonight is the second time i've dined here, and the food was just as delicious as the first time!!! one of the best things about the place, besides the food, is the no-corkage policy... what?! craziness t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> will continue to take advantage of (just make sure you are proper about it and offer your server a taste). the staff is great as well. ramon was our server the first time around; we weren't seated in his area tonight, but he recognized us and came to say hello anyway and still managed to sneak in some extra service for us. even if the food was mediocre, i would still come just for ramon!!! why only 4 stars?? well, i've been witness to just a few minor hiccups, which i'm sure will iron themselves out soon... really rooting for this place and hoping i can update to 5-stars soon!!", 
            "it was yelp family night checking out new spot although for suzy h already been but thankfully had someone too guide us. mahalos! the best thing about eating with yelpers is its buffet of food samples on table. yay!! between the four of us ordered bunch of apps too start just about ran out of room for my pasta course. it would take too long too mention all the apps but the bone marrow app was amazing (loved the fact something t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> see on any restaurants menu, the bone marrow cooked perfection spread it like butter on the bread came with or straight up bone marrow heaven on spoon), oyster slider (mini po boy), portabello fries (truly all its hyped too be! it nice crispy on the outside and the aioli comes with its tasty more so order more till the last fries), mac and cheese (another solid solid dish), and forgot order bunch more stuff. those things stood for me. \n\nmy entree order the bolognese. honest all the things i tried it was average. i know asked for it not getting steak the thing most known or trademark dish. i not in steak mood. the process if you where too order one is pretty interesting. they literally show you the cut of meat t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> too cook for you on really nice sliver platter and also literally butchered t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> or hell if i know maybe t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>. in the front of the restaurant they have open butcher shop t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> see all the cuts of meat. one of the things known for is fact they get in whole carcass and break everything down. no joke it comes too getting fresh cut of meat here at echo and rig. maybe the next time i come in will get my steak onnnn.\n\nthe service was good. although sharing long family style table with another group of four seem odd too me. the hostess told us before and had no problems with the idea. not sure great way too get repeat customers knowing another party literally on the same table. they had our servers all out of whack thinking which side of the community table does this go too.\n\nit interesting t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> restaurant is upstairs but yet the bar is located downstairs/butcher shop. i love the fact they have little patio area on the first floor and second floor. it great place too people walking around trivolli village. it pricey but could be lot worst if you went steakhouse on the strip. if looking for high end steakhouse not on the strip echo & rig is awesome spot! now only if i could afford too eat like this everyday. dam it.", 
            "i was very happy with my experience here and will be going back.  there is something i have found at so many restaurants - for all the cooks t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> how to prepare steak or chicken well, many don't know how to bring out the best in vegetables.  so, i was very happy to find the best dishes i sampled here were from their small plates selection - cauliflower browned with chili and crispy shallots and the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>.  both were fantastic.  \nthe wine list gets a gold star for some very reasonable prices both for bottles and by the glass.\nour server was painfully new and slightly awkward, but his heart was in the right place, so any missteps were forgiven. a missed order was quickly corrected and comped, though i thought t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> unnecessary, they were obviously aiming for good customer service, which is more than i have experienced at some of the other restaurants in t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> area (t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> you honey&salt, ahem).\nfor my main course, i had the rib eye cap at a truly reasonable $22.50.  it was served with garlic chips and a stuffed mushroom.  my steak was good and cooked exactly right.  it came with one complimentary sauce - i chose chimichurri.  i had mixed feelings about part of this: i tried both the chimichurri and the horseradish sauce and they were equally bland.  i also didn't really enjoy the chips or mushroom much, but considering t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> steak places no longer give you anything with  your steak - any sides are usually $7 or more, i thought it was nice to have something with it.\ni finished off with a turtle sundae and left happy.  all t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> for $50 per person (before tip) = happy diner.", 
            "had dinner at echo & rig last night and i have to say it was a lovely experience.  the staff was very friendly, knowledgeable and attentive.  atmosphere was classy without being pretentious.  it was busy but not overcrowded.  all of t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> great but the real show stopper was the food!  i had the spencer steak with a side of the black tuscan kale.  i'm generally picky about my steaks.  i want them to be flavorful and tender but i <mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> big chunks of fat.  this steak was perfect!  it was juicy, tender and delicious (no easy task considering i ordered it well done).  it came with a stuffed mushroom on the side t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> very tasty and some chips t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> done just right.  my side of kale was very good as well although i was too full to eat much of it.  overall it was a great meal and i can't wait to go back.",

            "i rarely give a place 3 stars, but i think it deserves a 3.5 based on 1st experience. i came to vegas for a mini vacation to hangout with some close friends & family, not really for the nightlife but more for hanging out and good company, so t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> said they took me to this fancy restaurant. i've been to 5 star restaurants before with $50 plate menus, so not foreign to the type of environment. right away we saw several snobbish people, usually \"old money\" material, heads turn as we walked. just a few groups of snobs, not the whole restaurant, don't get me wrong. fine establishment but we could sense the eyes glaring into the back of our heads with each step we took. it was ok for me though, always use to classism. we laughed about it. same story different neighborhood.\n\nambiance: a little noisy but not bad at all. very nice and fancy. they had the see through glass where you could see w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> butchers were upto. the balcony over looked the mall and vallet service. nice touch.\n\nservice. ***beware***sneaky. well just our waiter, jason, and his choice of vocab for the night \"sexy.\" he kept persuading us to buy the more expensive steak cuts, which were \"sexy\" and more off of the menu the whole night. just like a kiosk salesman who oversells a product. our table found it very annoying. we asked the price per pound for the suggested meat and we asked for the lesser of the two. on the bill he gave us the more expensive cut, and we ordered two of those! it being $210 on the bill, basically half the bill. wtf. it was good but he changed our order up, ordering the biggest of the two tomahawks. \n\nbefore the steaks came out, he was like \"i got you guys my favorite salad as you wait,\" we thought, oh w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> good guy until we saw t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> added it on the bill as well! we didn't order t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>*t! we didn't even know w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was to even order it! ha.\n\nthe service was split between a team. jason and about 3 other people. the 3 others we saw the most and did all the work. when it came to paying our check we saw jason again and he started to compliment one of our friends, shaking his hand, telling him \"i see you a lot here and i got you guys next time...blah...blah...blah\". this was actually our friends 2nd time here. so we paid the check, he thought we were gonna pay him a fat tip for the $350+ menu we racked up due to his \"sexy\" waiter skills, nope! \n\nout of all the places i've been to this was the most unprofessional i've seen due to him alone. he stood there hovering over us to see w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> would tip him and then after signing and tipping he took our bills with the quickness. i remembered i was in mid sentence and then *snatch* the bill was in his hands. he crumbled the originals for the customers to keep then rudely said \"i'm missing one.\" we told him we split it 3 ways and he left angry. like he really deserved a fat tip. as we walked by him he didn't say good bye or anything but had the nerve to talk sh*t behind our backs to his coworker. very \"sexy\" of him. so one of my friends said, make sure he's on your yelp review. got em!\n\nfood: ok now let me talk about the food. haha. very delicious. very fancy/gourmet. presentation was excellent. we ordered calamari, <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark> (which jason hinted to us the whole time), portabella french fries w/ aioli sauce, and bone marrow. everything came out delicious. \n\nour tomahawk steaks came out plate sized humongous. ordered it in medium, it came sliced and detached from bone, which we devoured the meat on their too. we got 5 different dipping sauces which were unique and enjoyable. the meat was juicy and very pleasing. after a few bites we found it overwhelming and ended up taking the rest home. \n\ni'm definitely coming back here every year, maybe check up on my favorite waiter. ha. service is one of the most biggest factors when it comes to trying out new places. it's all about the experience you share with good company. \n\nyou only get one chance to make a good first impression! #sexy\n\n***start to look for fake accounts or friends of server popping up trying to <mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> on w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> wrote about this place. this is basically my experience here, everyone has their own. \n\nplus, i guess since my other reviews consist of tattoo parlors and snack shacks then this review should be taken with a grain of salt. ha! sike! according to miley p.

            "i came here for dinner with my family and friends.  the place was packed on a thursday night.  the dining room is sleek and modern, but it is very loud because there is no carpeting in the restaurant.  we had a hard time hearing each other across a medium-sized round table.  we ordered a rainbow salad, sauteed spinach, apple and fennel salad, pork belly, bone-in new york strip (you  pay extra for this), <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> sandwich (has shortrib in it), and a hamburger.  all the small plates were ok - nothing to write home about.  the pork belly was very sweet for our taste.  the hamburger came out cold and was sent back.  the second time it came out, it was overcooked and cold.  the third time it came out, it was good.  t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>, our friend did not get the burger until we all had finished our meals.  the waither, however, did bring our friend a cup of mushroom soup to tide him over until the burger was ready. the steak was good, but i felt the meat was oversalted.  the sauces and mushrooms t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> with the steak were good.  my brother enjoyed the <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark>.  to compensate for the burger problem, t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was comped, and we got two free desserts - a turtle ice cream sundae and a berry sundae.  both were quite good.  \nservice here is very attentive and friendly.  i think they might have had an off night when we were there.  overall, i would come back and would try a different dish next time.", 
            "there are many good and great places in vegas to eat. good establishments are consistent and treat their guests very well. great places go above and beyond in all areas of service. t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> far is echo and rig.\nwe stopped by to check out the butcher shop and get some advice. the staff was friendly and eager to help. the place is kind of unique in the downstairs bar, sandwich and juice bar and butcher shop separated from  the large open dining room upstairs.\nwe decided to eat and the first thing you notice is they record you name in a ledger downstairs and then the server greets you by name (great point 1). the menu is a mixture of so many items you could get dizzy trying to decide which way to go. they had a small but diverse pasta selection (my favorite) and their butcher fresh meats and chicken, fish, sandwich and salad offerings (great point 2). they also have a large selection of \"small\" plate selections and again a lot of choices.\nthey also on the menu back have a good selection of wines and liquors.\nmy wife had the <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark>/short rib sandwich selection and on our servers advice the portobello mushroom/parmesan fries (do not pass those up).\nmy pasta was served nice and hot very well done and a great bolognese meat sauce. it was a very good selection. my wife's sandwich while a good combination was somew<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> for her taste and she picked at half the sandwich. we mentioned this to our server and she apologized for her not liking the entree. she stated she would mention it to the chef for his knowledge (but we have heard t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>).\nseveral minutes later keith the manager came over to c<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> us about our meal. this was not a casual sorry have a nice day c<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> he was concerned about our experience (great point 3). he told us t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> selection was a greasy type of combination, but if she didn't like it t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> all t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>. he spoke with us for about 10 minutes and then removed the entree from the bill (great point 4).\nthis is w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> good from great, making sure the customer is always satisfied and their concerns addressed. this is not our last time to go and we look forward to trying other menu offerings in the future.", 
            "i'm on the fence about this place.  my first visit, our little group of 3 got seated immediately at around 9pm on a friday.  we ordered a few appetizers and ribeyes off the menu.  stand out appetizer was the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>, as many other reviewers attest.  the steaks were cooked to perfection, cut like butter, and tasted great.\n\nthe next time i went alone with the husband.  we arrived around 8:15 on a saturday and had to wait about 20 minutes, which was fine.  wait staff was quick to get our drink orders.  this time we decided to take the advice of others and selected a bone-in rib eye to share. appetizers came out quickly, but our steak took near 45 minutes to make its way from the kitchen.  apparently, our expectation t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> steakhouse should never mess up steaks was asking too much.  we asked for medium rare and got well done instead.  for w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> reason, i don't like to send food back.  we ate a few bites, and even at well done, it wasn't bad, which is a testament to their cuts, but our ribeye's pre-cooked weight was 26oz and cost ~$2.50/oz ($65).  i couldn't sit still for a $65 piece of meat, so we called our waiter over.  he saw our plate, instantly recognized t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> meat was overcooked, and called the manager to come over.  while we were waiting, the couple next to us sent back their salmon for the same problem.  the waiter's reaction seemed to indicate t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was happening all night long.  \n\nthe manager was professional about the situation.  he told us t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> would comp the steak and asked if we would like another.  we were already running late for a movie, so we opted for just the comp. \n\nwe ended up missing the movie.  although the manager handled the overcooked steak in a most appropriate way, i do think it is a sin for the kitchen staff to mess up, w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> to be, multiple orders.  it's a relatively new restaurant, so i'll give them one more chance, but if they screw up steak again, there is no way i could recommend this place to anyone.", 
            "this place was excellent. took a group of 8, including 2 vegetarians for a post-conference dinner. we waited only 15 minutes even though we had a large party and it was busy. the space is beautiful - modern, clean lines and sharp-looking staff. i appreciated t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> were offering samples of the charcuterie in the bar area while we waited. \n\nservice was quick, pleasant, informative, and accommodating. we got to see the special cuts of the day, which was a lot of fun. one recommendation i have to improve the experience a bit more would be to have visuals of the regular cuts as well - we had some steak novices at the table who would have benefitted, and it would enhance the experience.\n\nfood was excellent. my steak was cooked perfectly, and we got a mix of sauces so i got to try 4 of them. my favorite was the wine sauce, which was not much on it's own, but once on the steak it really popped. the wine selection also highlighted the food. i had a spanish tempranillo t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> lightly sweet, fully of cherry and some vanilla. my friend went with a california merlot t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> dark, bold, and spicy. flavors of honey and an acid balance t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> well with the richness of the beef. i did not have the mushroom rockafeller because it had bread crumbs (i am allergic to wheat), but reports were they were also tasty. \n\nwe sampled small plates as well. the bacon was smoky and thickly-cut. it was balanced well with the tangy spice of the bbq sauce. cauliflower was well-spiced, and still managed to not overpower the nutty flavors. the salt and pepper fries were crisp on the outside without being over done, and the dipping sauce was light and flavorful. i also liked t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> fries were not greasy at all. \n\ndessert was a major treat. i had the turtle sunday, and it was both a flavor and texture dream. i appreciated the smoky, salty, and nutty crunch t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> the sweetness of the caramel. presentation on desserts was excellent. \n\nthis place is fantastic, and i highly recommend.", 
            "love this place. newest pick for a dinner place t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> nice & trendy but not packed or overpriced like the tourist spots tend to be.\n\nthe space itself is beautiful, with high ceilings, modern decor and the butcher feel that's just plain cool (sorry, i know i sound lame, but it's the best word to describe it). i love the hot dog and cheese area you can order from while you wait, as well as being able to stare at all the awesome cuts of meat before heading upstairs. the bar also looked great and very cozy, but i didn't sit down since the wait was only a few minutes.\n\nonto the food - i ordered the steak sandwich ($12) and my grandparents the burger ($12) and skirt steak ($22). everything was delicious, and the sides we got (mac & cheese and brussel sprouts, $7 each) were divine. great wine and beer and cocktail selection. wish we weren't so stuffed from the meal and had room for dessert!\n\nthe service was great, if not a little new. some waiters were unaware of the menu and order of food delivery, and my grandfather's burger came without cheese and undercooked at first, but really it was quite enjoyable overall.\n\ni was shocked at how affordable this place was. even if you ordered a ton of food you could have a fantastic dinner for well under $50 each. the steaks, the sides, the drinks...everything. really a fantastic new spot. can't wait to return soon!", 
            "i came for dinner with my group of friends for family dinner. they've been here twice while i was out of the country, it was my first time (don't they know they can't do anything without me?!). it was a friday and they do not take reservations, it's a first come first served place which is hard with large parties.\n\nit's a bit busy so we placed our name and then went out to the patio and had drinks and snacks there. normally i would think it's a bad idea to wait over 90 minutes to be seated but since we hung out there it wasn't so bad as we waited for the late straglers to our party. just keep t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> mind coming here on dinner peak hours and don't come starving! or do come starving and get a charcuterie plate and a drink downstairs to start.\n\nwhile waiting i had some of the cauliflower with chili de arbol which was nicely spicy and cooked in a way t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> veggies addictive for snacking. we also shared a <mark>Drunken Goat</mark> sandwich which was rather lovely and i really liked the fennel salad on the side of it. i got a cocktail whose name escapes me currently, but i thought it was decent though my two friends who got the same thing said it was better made last time. \n\nso last time my friends were here, they effed up with some stuff with their apps and the bill and our server said they would make up for it this time around so they comped a few apps and dessert.  \n\nthey placed onto our table some portobello mushroom fries which had a lovely crisp and the herb aioli was very fresh and addictive. we also got slices of pork belly with a homemade bbq sauce which had a nice smoky flavor. the watermelon, tomato, and onion salad is simple and refreshing. i really like their house bread t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> place on your table.\n\nsteakwise i got a medium rare ribeye cap and the red oak it was cooked over definitely shows through and the meat quality was great.  i got some of the chimichurri sauce and tasted a few of my friends sauces a well. my choice turned out to be my favorite with the ribeye cap. the mushroom and chips t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> comes with is alright, but i am just one of those people who needs sides. i got the burnt peas, mushroom, onion and saffron on the recommendation of our server. the sizes of the sides are sharable as i was quite full trying to eat t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>. i also tried one of my friends burrata which was lovely as well. \n\ndessert we had various ice creams with different garnish from caramel apple with chocolate and berries. \n\nservice was fantastic. he was friendly, attentive and didn't have to hook it up for the mistakes from last time everyone was here for family dinner. i really, really enjoyed my dinner here and i had high expectations as i'm a big fan of bottega louie in la. definitely a great steak and i will be back very soon!", 
            "wher do i start, this place is unique and unusual. a high end gourmet butcher where you take a walk into the meat locker to discuss curing and cuts with a personal expert. step out of the meat locker, and you'll see a bar which also has a chef making sandwiches and other treats. \n\ni should mention t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> & rig is located in a very upscale shopping area where most of the cars are high end showroom exotics and the people walking around are all well buffed, shined, and jeweled with the finer things t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> buys.\n\nso for most people going here is a high end rare treat, not the kind of place us mere mortals eat at often. my family and i showed up here after a long day hiking and we really were not dressed to be here. we also had a few small kids with us, embarrassed we asked to be seated outside even though it was a cold night.\n\nthe staff could have been rude, or ignore us for our honestly dirty and sweaty clothes, but we were treated with all the importance and respect as the well dressed wealth around us.we were seated outside on a third floor balcony with an amazing view over the fountains and view down the street of all the upscale shops and lights.\n\nthe balcony had very well placed gas heaters above us and the typical pedestals kind which gave our table a surprising warmth absorbed by the heat making the cold patio perfect even in the cold of a winter's night.\n\nwe had two waiters, one who never spoke to us but kept the bottled spring, and sparkling water flowing (which is included without charge) and wonderful bread. he kept our table clear but was never intrusive or interrupted our conversations, in fact we were surprised how rarely we noticed him. our second waiter was the spokesmen as well as server. he brought out the most beautiful and huge cuts of meat and described how they were aged. the meat he presented would be your actual cuts they would grill for you. because i had a very large group with me, and i was buying for all we opted to stay away from the $75 dollar steaks and went for  burgers, sandwiches and other items. even so we were treated like kings. we also ordered a few appetizers.\n\nour waiter also brought out several things to try t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> did not order and were not asked to pay for. he was great about educating us and describing each perfect treat he brought out.\n\neveryone was pleased with w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> ordered, even ordering a few things to take back to our hotel rooms. if we lived in lv this would be high on our list for date nights and special occasions. we were served with such expertise and professionalism even as we were so poorly presented t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> can't wait to go back!\n\nand yes all the food was great, it's a couple weeks later and we are still talking about it, this meal was the highlight meal of the week long trip for all of us.", 
            "to sum this place up: high quality grass-fed beef at reasonable prices! \ni've been here a couple times now, located in tivoli village, and the service is always great, very impressed. as you walk in, you have a bar to the left (serves wonderful sangria) and the butcher to the right. yes, they butcher their own meat!!! as you head upstairs to be seated, it's in an open space t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> like a comfortable setting. \n\ni've had a couple of the different grass-fed cuts - hanger, spencer - both delicious and cooked perfectly. i've also had a couple of the small plates: asparagus, mashed potatoes, and especially the bone marrow carne asada - amazing. \ni also learned after the fact t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> can bring in your own wine... as many bottles as you want. i will definitely incorporate this into my meal next time. \nthis is definitely my new favorite steak house!", 
            "my first visit here i came for brunch. it was just before the seasons changed (you know, summer and winter) so it was still warm enough to sit outside on their patio, which is situated on the second floor of the restaurant overlooking the valet turnstyle of tivoli.\n\nso we decided to try a couple different sanwiches instead of going with breakfast food. \n\nburrata- english peas, green onion and mint. this was terrible. i won't even bother explaining.\n\n<mark>Portobello Fries</mark>- not sure w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> the fuss is about. they weren't all that.\n\n<mark>Hanger Steak</mark>- with roasted anaheim chilies, spinach and lemon aoili chimichurri.\nthe steak was so raw, i couldn't eat  it. i asked our waiter if this was normal, the blood coming from the meat made the roll soggy. he replied t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> is supposed to be rare (it doesn't state this on the menu). anyways, i couldn't eat it, and he didn't offer to replace it with a different meal.\n\n<mark>Grilled Cheese</mark>- short ribs, gruyere, parmesan and white chedder. this was definitely the table favorite. the short ribs really gave it an extra flavor to the awesome combo of cheeses.\n\n<mark>Smoked Salmon</mark>- it never gets old. still one of my favorites\n\nthe best part about brunch? the $16 <mark>Bottomless Mimosas</mark>.\n\nback for dinner the next week, and i had the colorado lamb chops. these were good, but nothing to write home about. i enjoyed my cocktails more than my meal.\nheat of the moment is an excellent drink, and at $8 you can't help but have a couple.\n\n bring your patience with you, they don't except reservations, so it can be an hour wait at time.", 
            "so this place isn't overrated at all. with all the hype. with all the glowing reviews from fellow yelpers. echo & rig still managed to impress.\n\nour party of four included one e&r veteran. so we let her order and we dined family style. everything was delicious. over the rainbow. cauliflower. <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>. trenn\\u00e9. rib eye cap. delicious, delicious, delicious. if i can make something t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> comes close to that \"over the rainbow\" at home, i'll be golden.\n\ni also tried their gin gin echo mule mule. tasty cocktail t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> down way too easily. their draft beer selection is decent. i followed up with a glass of speakeasy payback porter.\n\ndarren with two rs and an e provided us with excellent service. we were outside on their patio and it ended up getting very cold. the manager was great in moving us to a warmer part of the patio. their ceiling heaters are surprisingly effective.\n\nthe only downside is t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> had run out of the butternut and burrata ravioli. i guess t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> means we need to go back.", 
            "their butcher stand is located on the main floor along with a small bar, charcuterie stand and hostess area. you have to wait in this awkwardly laid out area with not enough seats for the hostesses to run up and down the stairs to the main seating area of the restaurant, one party at a time. my visit was on a quiet saturday afternoon, yet we still managed to wait a solid 10 minutes to be seated with only two parties ahead of us. when we got upstairs i was pretty confused by how long we had to wait based on how empty the dining room was, hopefully they figured out a better system during busy hours! then our waiter took the orders for the 10 person table near us and disappeared for a good 5 minutes before finally coming back to take our drink and food orders at the same time. plus we pointed out t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> of our water glasses were dirty so he swapped them with two from the table next to us, which got immediately placed back into t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> setting. yum! the dining room is a bit strange, very minimally decorated and doesn't seem too thought out. their brunch menu is fairly decent, with a handful of salads, sandwiches, breakfasts, small plates and sides. there is a different dinner menu t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> slightly different. i would also note t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> burger is listed under the sandwiches section, for those t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'t think a burger is a sandwich...\n\ntheir burger, in this case the <mark>Butcher Blend Burger</mark>, comes with usda prime beef, bibb lettuce, brandywine tomato and red onion. the bun was a little dry, but the meat was cooked to medium rare as ordered so it wasn't much of an issue. if this was a well done burger it would have been a vacuum of moisture. the meat had excellent flavor; it was very juicy, peppery and delicious. you could definitely tell this wasn't cooked with a frozen, pre-made patty. the sharp cheddar i added was flavorful and melted well, the tomato was colorful but didn't have a strong presence with the meat and oniony mystery base under the patty. i'm not quite sure w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was as t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'t a listed item on the menu, but it was quite tasty.\n\nsadly the burger comes with chips, fries would have been extra. the chips were good; crunchy and of your kettle variety but not the fries i want with a good burger. overall this was a pretty great deal for $12, but could have been way better with fries instead of chips. w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> this not such a great meal was the experience at the beginning and our service overall. i <mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> to say it but our waiter sucked, he was non-existent for much of our meal, never took away our table setup plates so our two-person table was a little crowded, and we sat for a full 10 minutes after our meals were done before he returned. we spotted him rolling silverware in the kitchen area while we sat around, and all the managers were having a little powwow to the side. the food seemed pretty good, but service like this is unacceptable even during quiet hours. i would probably have given my burger a better score based on the quality, but we walked out with such a bad feeling after this t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> have to go by my overall experience. if you're in this area and want a great burger, stick with honey salt.", 
            "this review is based on two dinner outings.  the first was somew<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> than the second.\n\non my initial visit, i reveled in an excellent small appetizer plate of meatballs with mixed flavors and straight ahead red tomato sauce and fresh grated parmesan cheese brought on request.  french onion gratin soup with caramelized onion, roasted pumpkin squash, sage, and domestic swiss cheese was great and somew<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> served in a staub metal pot.  a side of butternut squash & brown sugar was also excellent.   sweet fire cauliflower was rather spicy but sweet at the same time.  mushroom rockefeller was interesting and tasty.  garlic shrimp featured 5 jumbo shrimps.  and, garlic chips were light on garlic and very good.   on the first occasion, these were offered to us to savor as snacks while we waited to be seated despite arriving on schedule.  but, on the second, during a delay t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> about 15 minutes to be seated after the time of our reservation, we were offered nothing.    \n\nthere was a long wait between consumption of starters and delivery of our entrees during the first dinner service.  when entrees did finally arrive, i enjoyed a medium rare filet mignon t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> in fact almost rare, with a good red wine demi glace and excellent bearnaise sauce.  this meal ended on a very upbeat note with great moist strawberry shortcake and assorted berries along with a turtle espresso sundae provided gratis by the manager to make up for our delayed entrees.  a yummy finish! \n\nboth times after our arrival, the period of waiting to be seated was a little unusual, as my party of four had to stand on our feet and awkwardly mill about with other strangers in the sleek tiled atrium until we were called.  the only diversions were observing butchers at work or looking at cuts of beef, chicken, lamb, and pork, and various <mark>Sausage</mark> in the on site butcher shop t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> staggering prices for each offered item.\n\non the second occasion just over three weeks after the first, wild mushroom soup with a touch of cream was even better than the french onion gratin soup experienced earlier.  complimentary bread was very tasty.  garlic shrimp were juicy, tasty, and extra fine.  a steak salad with large cannelini beans, medium rare hunks of tender beef, pepperoni, white onions, red bell pepper, pepperoncini, and zucchini was a very good chopped salad, but almost a meal in itself.  and, another 8 oz. medium rare filet was very tender and buttery (again almost rare), enhanced by a good green peppercorn sauce and again an excellent bearnaise sauce.  moist skin-on redskin mashed potatoes were very good, just as again were homemade garlic chips (if you like potato chips with your steak, which i don't).  the only food item i didn't find appealing on this occasion was a side of too hard, falling apart brussels sprouts.  and, a fellow diner announced t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> did not like her shaking beef entree.\n\nwhile the food served here both times was generally praiseworthy, the second dinner was marred by a cluster of service errors: one bowl of wild mushroom soup (mine) was missed, and then the server forgot to bring it to the table again; no steak knife was provided until requested; refilling water glasses was very intermittent; bearnaise sauce was initially forgotten; and grilled seabass was proferred with skin on after the server declared t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> would only arrive at the table with skin off, and being told \"good!\" by the diner who ordered this dish.  my steak was also cold by the time i finished this delayed entree, after dispatching the salad and belated soup courses.  the decor here is modern but rather austere, and feels somew<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>.  the capacious upstairs dining room can also become very loud when it fills up, as it did both times i was here.\n\nbut to me, food is paramount.  although this restaurant still has a few kinks to work out, it offers much promise.  based on my two experiences to date, i rate it 4-1/2 stars overall.", 
            "3 stars for the food! we will get to the service later...\n\nstarted out with the mache salad. o-m-g. it was sooo good. consisting of avocado, mache, celery, <mark>Roasted Chicken</mark>, and green onions. and only god knows the recipe to this slad dressing. \nthen we had a few apps.\nfavorite- burrata, english peas, mint and onions. i will make this my personal goal to replicate this dish. it was so light and fresh. sometimes burrata can me on the oily side, not here! it was perfect fluffy. so delish\nfried calamari- i only had a few bites because of my gluten issue but wow these were amazing. \ngrilled shrimp and scallop ceviche- this was pretty good as well.\n\nfor dinner my boyfriend and i each ordered a different steak. i had the filet and he had the spencer. i must say, the spencer won. w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> amazing cut of meat. after going 2 years without a bite or red meat im pretty happy i chose this meal to break my no red meat diet. when i saw this piece of beef melts in your mouth.. im serious. accompanied with their house chips this dish was pretty outstanding. we also had the horseradish creme to go a long with it. yum! \nand the wine... wow. we had about 6 bottles for the table of the emblem cab. this wine went perfect with everything. it was so drinkable.. too drinkable. i highly suggest it.\n\nim going to keep the \"bad\" short and sweet since the meal itself was so amazing. jason, our server was a total amateur. my bf and i had to wait to eat anything because he didnt know if there were nuts in anything the table ordered. since we shared everything family style almost everyone was done with sides/apps/salads before we were able to start eating. it was very frustrating. next time we come in it will probably be to sit at the bar instead. and when i asked to see the manager (because i actually knew him) jason said he told him to come over. this ended up not true at all. \n\nother then t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> meal was amazing. i highly recommend this place over any other in tivoli village... or summerlin for t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>.",

            "let me start by saying i'm not a fan and i doubt i will ever be back to echo & rig.  we came here late afternoon and there was one other party in the restaurant.  we were brought our <mark>Black <mark>Green Iced Tea</mark></mark> quickly and it was refilled frequently while we were there.\n\ni had looked at the menu online and i took some time to decide once there.  for a starter, we ordered their <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> which were served with an herb aioli.  this was the first i noticed t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> garlic or should have had garlic (herb aioli) had no garlic taste at all.  the herb aioli was good but missing the garlic flavor.\n\nmy wife ordered the tri-tip steak--medium--even though i suggested she get medium rare and i ordered the <mark>Hanger Steak</mark> blue.  she was drawn to the tri-tip because the menu said lemon and garlic neither of which was evident in any way.  garlic fail number 2.  all their steaks come with garlic chips (no garlic flavor here either--garlic fail #3) and a mushroom rockefeller, a breadcrumb stuffed mushroom cap.\n\nthe portobello mushroom was wonderful with the light coating and the cheese shreds.  then we waited.  we saved some of the mushrooms fries for our steak, and then we waited some more.  approximately 20 minutes later, our server said the steaks would be right out.  he took our small plates and silver away.  about 5 minutes went by and he stopped by once again and said the steaks would be right there.  about 5 minutes later, he stopped by to say they'd be out in about a minute.  this time, he was right.\n\nwhen the steaks arrived, i noticed t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> had been cut in slices and i just cringed.  i absolutely <mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> it when this is done.  maybe that's why so few places do it.  i asked if there was a culinary reason and the server said he'd ask.  when he came back he told us t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> chefs said it was to make the steaks more tender.  my steak was good, but it was cooked a little more than i would do it at home.  my wife's steak was less tender and because of her medium order, which they did, the steak was less juicy and there was a fair amount of sinew t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> wouldn't expect.  she was quite disappointed although some blame needs to be placed at her door.  but above all, i'd say, please don't cut my steak.  i'm not a two year old and i'm not infirm.  i googled this when i got home and found t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> only reason (perhaps) to do this was to cut the steak against the grain the right way.\n\nwe each had a sundae for dessert.  they were ok.\n\ni left echo & rig very disappointed.  the length of time from ordering to getting our mains was ridiculous when the place is less than 1/10 full.  it was a tuesday afternoon--not date night usa at 8 pm.", 
            "first visit to echo & rig and we were pleasantly surprise!\n\nwhen we arrived, this man was giving away free beer sample (ballast point <mark>Sierra Nevada <mark>Ballast Point Pale Ale</mark></mark>).  there is also a charcuterie  area, tables and <mark>Chai</mark>, a bar, it was quite nice.  the hostess took us upstairs where the dining area is.  it looked very classy and chic.\n\nwe were immediately greeted by our server and they have a pretty good memory on our complimentary selection of flat or sparkling water.  our table shared/tasted the following:\n-<mark>Portobello Fries</mark>: slices of thick portobello were lightly battered and served with a green aioli.  yum.\n-bone marrow:  a must try!  we all enjoyed this appetizer.\n-octopus with gigante beans and green olives: very refreshing.\n-lamb chops: seasoned to perfection and was very tender.\n-trenne: our server nicholas recommended this but for us to keep in mind t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> is not like the typical pasta.  i loved it!  i liked the crispiness and charred taste to some of the trenne.  the prime rib eye was super tender as well.  the black kale went so well with it.\n\nwe tasted nelson's hangar steak and oh boy, t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> seasoned very well and again, super tender.  e&r sure knows how to cook up a piece of meat.\n\nwe ended the meal with the berry shortcake and the caramel turtle sundae.  caramel turtle sundae was the winner of the two.\n\nour entire dinner service was <mark>Stella</mark>.  nicholas was super attentive.  even after we had paid our bill, he still made sure t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> are ok, and t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> water is topped off.\n\nwe have already made plans in the future to return for brunch!", 
            "this could be my new favorite vegas steakhouse.  we started off at the downstairs bar while waiting for our table.  i have to praise their liquor selection; they even had a couple bottles of rip van winkle bourbon, which i have been struggling to locate for a while now.  \n\nwhen it was time, we were walked upstairs to the dining area.  our server, justin, was able to remember not only our names, but the names of my friend's two dogs as well.  this place does not have a corkage fee, so i would recommend bringing your own wine.  we didn't do t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> time, but the wine list was also very moderately priced (i usually google an establishment's wine on my smartphone to see w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> markup is).\n\nmy party of four ordered a few small plates to start: octopus, pork belly and grits, watermelon salad, apple and fennel, and charcuterie.  all of these dishes were exceptional, but my favorite was the pork belly and grits.  the fatty part was crispy on the outside, and melted in your mouth.  the meat was as tender, and the grits were on par with w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'d get from an authentic cajun restaurant in new orleans.  \n\nfor our entree, three of us split a 41 oz tomahawk ribeye steak, while the other member of our party got the black spaghetti.  i had a bite of the pasta, and it was nicely cooked, with a good chew.  it also came with a very generous assortment of seafood.  by the way, this dish was like 13 bucks -- w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> steal.  the massive ribeye came out with a beautiful sear t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> your mouth water.  a cross section of the steak revealed a perfect mid rare.  no unsightly grey band.\n\nall in all, an excellent meal.  excellent service, and much more affordable than a steakhouse on the strip.  5/5.  can't wait to go back!",

            "about a month ago, myself and 4 of my friends showed up at echo&rig on december 19th, just before christmas. we came in, excited, and ready to enjoy. we sat at the table closest to the bar. we ate and drank as any group in their early 30s would. shared apps, steaks, cocktails. nothing out of the ordinary. a young woman waited on us, who i will not name. as our time at e&r came to an end, we asked for the check. the bill was placed on the table and was left for us to figure out. we did, over $360 in cash, was put in a pile on the table. we continued to finish our drinks and our plates of food. moments later, the female server came over and set down another check. one of the guests in our party explained t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> paid it already, as she looked for the money. the server insisted we had not paid. the group immediately asked for management. after a brief description of the situation to management, the manager spoke with our server. he then came over to us moments later and brought 3 of us out on the patio, adjacent to the bar. he explained t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> server accused one of the members in our party of stealing and he pointed out who the server felt committed this crime. i want to preface the rest of this story by saying, everyone in this party has been friends for more then 10years, minimum. we enjoy holidays together, know one another's family intimately, and have even been in weddings together. i trust everyone from t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> implicitly. t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> said, we finally called out the accused guest to the patio. we explained the situation and he immediately took off his shoes, coat, shirt, belt, pulled out his pocket. he was one article away from being naked. imagine the horror? in front of strangers, guests, and friends, being accused of stealing and having to defend yourself in t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>. everyone else in the party followed suit and we asked the manager to please check the cameras. he explained he could not, only ownership had access to the cameras. really? w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> of policy is this? obnoxious.\nwe politely obliged the managers request for a day to resolve the issue. he then asked us to pay the bill again. the audacity! we did, begrudgingly, as we knew the next day the group would be vindicated and the money returned. wrong. \n      over the next week and a half i called the restaurant almost daily. everyday it was a different excuse as to why they haven't checked the cameras. either \"the owner's are working on it\" or \"they are close to a resolution\" or \"the manager you need isn't here\". this team of managers and owners passed the buck and i think it only peaks to their character as adults and people who run a business. finally, after 15 days, i received an answer. the verdict? the camera was bad and they can't see the angle. it was tough to tell. i implored them to spare my feelings and please tell me if it was one of our diners who committed the crime, so t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> could rectify it personally and i could apologize to echo&rig. the manager on the other end explained, \"it's not that....\" he would not elaborate. they basically said \"that's it\" no invite back in, no free dessert, no handshake, no sincere apology. they were just glad it was over. i will never set foot in t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> again and i suggest you do the same. we paid over $700 for one meal, do to the inept and dishonest nature of the staff, management, and ownership.\n     to conclude my review, i will say that, i work in the food and beverage sector myself. i work for a renowned chef on the las vegas strip. the rest of the party, also works for either the same chef or others of similar ilk on the strip. we told this story to every person we could in the last few weeks, in order to gauge if our behavior and actions were appropriate. we feel we handled it in the most proper manner. e&r did not. i realize t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> like this can cost people their jobs, so i do not take a review like this lightly at all. i realize the brevity of a tool such as yelp. if you are an honest, hardworking, decent person, i believe their are better places to spend your money, right here in our community of summerlin.", 
            "service was good but steak was way over done. i thought i had ordered a $35 ny but instead got a $60 ny with bone in even though i pointed to the menu item and was fairly certain the waiter understood... i'd like to think this was just a miscommunication, but when the food was brought out it was painfully obvious t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> steak was close to beef jerky so the waited apologized and offered to comp it. i did not want to delay the remainder of our party so i kept it. at the end of dinner the waiter asked how it was and i told him very disappointing. with t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> comped a dessert and said sorry... not the comp i was expecting.  given the vast competition of steak houses in vegas i would recommend skipping this one. hope this is a helpful post for anyone t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> about to spend a couple hundred dollars to be completely satisfied with a phenomenal vegas quantity meal!",

            "echo & rig = one of my favorites in vegas!!!\n\nmy boyfriend and i happened to walk by this restaurant a few months ago and were intrigued by the fresh meat and butchering demonstrations in the window. we went in and met the butcher / chef. aaron and he was very friendly and informative. he even gave us a personalized crock pot receipe and some fresh ingredients!\n\nafter that, we knew we had to go back and try the dining experience. we went back this weekend and there was a 40 minute wait, but it flew by. we enjoyed a glass of wine at the bar downstairs and c<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> with the aaron again while he was breaking down some meat for the evening. \n\nnow for the food - - amazing! first we started with the sausage and peppers and the portabella fries. now, i don't like mushrooms but the waitress said we had to try them so we did and they were great! the breadding was light and crunchy and not at all greasy and the dipping sauce complimented them superbly. for entrees my boyfriend had the new coulotte steak and i had the <mark>Roasted Chicken</mark> sandwich (i know, i know a sandwich at a steak place? but the balsamic onions had me at hello). for sides we had the cauliflower and fries. the steak was scrumptous, perfect crust with just the right amount of seasoning to let the natural flavor of the meat shine. the cauliflower was unlike any vegetable i have ever had. it was sweet and spicy and all the different flavors popped in my mouth with each bite. a must try! the sandwich was great too - the bread was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside and the onions, arugula and onions merried perfectly with the chicken. \n\nwe brought in our own wine to take advantage of free corkage so the total bill was only $60!! we couldn't belive it. for food t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> its own against some of the steak greats like mastros, flemmings and mortons the value was unlike any other. one of the best restaurant experiences in vegas!", 
            "i owe them a review... i failed to review them after my first visit somehow and after going again this week and now realizing i didn't review it before, i felt it necessary to make up for it. echo & rig has won over many fellow yelpers and locals alike and you can count me on this list. at first, i was skeptical about the location as every time i go to tivoli village i feel like i'm being punked and there are really hundreds of people there who are going to jump out and do a flash dance.... sadly, it's just empty streets. yet echo & rig was packed the first time and had a nice crowd the second time i went.\ni won't bore you with stories of delicious steaks, fantastic sides and tasty pasta dishes. .. instead i'll focus on the service which has been excellent both times. coincidentally, we sat in the table right next to the one we were at the first time which put us right near the kitchen. i love being next to the kitchen where i can enjoy first hand watching the artists at their craft. but back to the service... very attentive, helpful with menu choices and not overbearing. they've cracked jokes, shaken hands and provided my friends and i with one very memorable prank on a table of friends dining nearby.\nwe had a hiccup with the bread on our first visit but it turned into a funny memory more than anything for the simple fact t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> asked about 3 or 4 different people for bread and each told us it would be right out as they had fresh stuff coming up. and each time someone else seemed to grab the bread before our guy was able to. he absolutely made up for it though and i'm happy to report t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> our next visit the bread came out right away.\nif you have not made it to tivoli village yet or have and were also afraid you were being punked... make it a point to go back and enjoy a meal at echo & rig. you can thank me later.\n\nthus concludes my story... thank you... goodnight.", 
            "i wasn't sure.  you know the space is more than a little awkward (looks like it should be a furniture store of clothing boutique).  but it's good, actually really good.  service?  good.  food?  good.  management?  treated us like kings even though we showed up with no rez in our walking clothes and a stroller with baby in it.  servers were incredibly patient as my wife tortured herself with the overwhelming number of small plate options.  and the ones she chose were pretty good.  and the steak (the spencer steak) was excellent.  best $25 steak i can remember.  \n\nthis is w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> hoped ogden's would be.  a place worth visiting within walking distance of our house.  i think i'd like this place even if it wasn't within strolling distance, but maybe an extra star for that.  but it's not like it's an easy walk, so don't discount my review.  we gotta head up oakey and then once we get to cimaron we can cut through the 'hood.  when we get to durango it's a bit of risky, more like 'mad', dash across durango.  once you've safely navigated (jay walked) to the other side of 6 lanes of stupid, probably drunken, traffic (think frogger with a stroller), you can cut behind the guitar center to avoid the inevitability of being flattened by some kohl's shopping ingrate.  assuming you make it through t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>, dark alley you can take a right to approach sahara and cross at w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> be a protected cross-walk to the boca park shopping center, only this is vegas so you can press the button for the signal (which by design is a really fancy one t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> addition to a walk sign and in case you're blind should at some point announce \"walk sign to cross sahara\"), which in the last year has never given us a walk sign no matter how many cycles you wait through, but it doesn't really matter anyway because this is vegas and signs don't matter because it's a 24-hour town and at any time of the day you've got people getting off their shifts and hitting happy hour and driving home drunk and on ambien or loratab, so with your head on a swivel, charge into traffic and cross when you see the left turn arrow and as you get to the other side you will notice a melting pot fondue restaurant, so if you're light on ambien, loratabs or blow you could probably score there as long as the employees haven't gotten too twisted - not on fondue - on t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> evening and used up their whole supply.  so now you're basically in the back of boca park.  t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> be a relief and, if you hit the melting pot fondue restaurant, maybe you're a little \"emboldened\" at this stage of the walk.  it's probably good to be emboldened because now you've got another half-mile, unlighted stretch behind the office max and down a construction road with no sidewalk.  keep your head on a swivel because occasionally someone leaving cheesecake factory restaurant will come roaring up behind you and because there is no sidewalk you may have to employ some evasive maneuvers to make it to alta where you can ride the sidewalk and enjoy a protected cross-walk into tivoli village.  my family enjoys this walk frequently.",

            "horrible experience!  i was looking forward to my \"date night\" with my husband and time with friends.  we went on a friday night with a reservation for 14 people at 6:30.  they had to seat us at 2 separate tables.  we were seated within 5 minutes of arriving and it was a good 15 minutes before our drink order was taken.  our server kept coming by our table and saying \"take your time-no hurry\", well we were ready the first time.  drinks took about 10 minutes once we ordered them and then we had to make the effort to ask for additional drinks t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> just as slow as the first.  it was about 25 minutes till we received bread and they took our order.  needless to say we had 8 people at our table and they only brought enough bread for each person to have one very small piece and only one very small thing of butter.  it took 30 minutes to get our appetizers and we had to request 4 additional bread refills because we were all sitting there starving...plus each time i had to ask for additional butter.  25 minutes after our appetizers the main dishes arrived.  my husband's porterhouse was over cooked and had way to much sinew.  i only got a <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> so really no need to comment on that.  however, most meals came with a side of \"garlic chips\"...these were homemade, deep fried slices of potatoes with absolutely no taste.  complete blah with no hint of garlic or any seasoning.  the mushroom served with all meals was plain and stuffed with very dried bread crumbs...  they must have felt bad for making us wait so long for our dinner because they threw in a complimentary deep <mark>Fried Spinach</mark> salad...way to much oil on that!  ooops, almost forgot--i ordered a side of brussel sprouts which they never brought so i had to request they remove t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> my bill.  over all this dinner dragged on and on and was not relaxing nor enjoyable.  only great or memorable thing was my husband's drink- kentucky peachtree, very good!", 
            "we were walking around looking for a place to eat at tivoli, and we stumbled upon this restaurant. at first we just thought it was a butcher shop and we only went inside to check it out. we were surprised to find t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was also a bar and restaurant. \n\ni had the blt, and it was to die for! the bacon was crispy, the tomatoes were a variety, and i can't say enough about how wonderful it was. he had the seafood pasta (i don't remember the exact name of the dish). i'm so glad i didn't order that! while the seafood in his was good, the sauce and pasta with squid ink was not for me. it wasn't for him either, as he left most of it behind!\n\nwe love to dine slowly and sit and talk, and i did feel like they were hovering around wondering when we were going to leave, even though there were lots of tables available. t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>, we will be back!", 
            "this place is a solid 4 stars. came and sat on the terrace and it was so lovely. had a couple glasses of wine and tried a bunch of dishes. everything sounded amazing and i will definitely have to come back to try some of the other items. \n\nwe got the rainbow salad (grains, nuts and veggies). it was outstanding. so simple and clean. could have used a little more salt. we got the grilled octopus. the flavors and other components of the dish were uber delicious, but the octopus itself was overlooked, chewy and burned in some places. there was a small completely charred tentacle in there t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> like a rat tail... gross. had the butter fish, which was cooked perfectly. it was amazing, but the sauce broke and we were surprised t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was still served to us like that. lastly, the charred peas, which were a nice side dish, although a little boring. \n\ni feel like this place could be epic. it has all of the right things, the execution is just a little off. \n\nlastly, the heater outside on the terrace was intense. recommendation to management to maybe put the setting a little lower.", 
            "this place has been mentioned quit a bit in the food scene in summerlin, maybe because of low menu prices. you get w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> pay for. the room has a real cold feel to it almost like a high end cafeteria. service is a little sub par both times we were in. the food was average at best and that's being nice. so much better quality around town. and if you want a great butcher shop check out the butcher block.",

            "found in tivoli village, echo and rig is a meat lover's dream.  come here for the slabs of meat you can buy, stay for the delicious dishes they serve.  echo and rig will have your taste palates running wild like hulkamania and your stomach bursting like the chestburster from alien.  \n\na few of us went on a friday afternoon.  our friend's wife's cousin was the executive chef at the place.  he wanted to stop by and say hi.  we all followed and thought it would be best we stuff our faces at this place.  \n\nfrom the outside, you can see the various meats hanging and placed around the freezer room.  it was a sight to see.  when we went inside, the butcher welcomed us with open arms.  not only was he super friendly, but he was super handsome (just like me).  he kind of looked like james purefoy (from the t.v. series rome), but with more facial hair.  man, i'm probably way off with the look.  maybe he sort of had a brad pitt-esque facial structure.  wait...why am i talking about him?  let's talk about meat...no....not his meat, i'm talking about the restaurant meat!\n\nso, james purefoy (we'll just name the butcher that) led us into the freezer room and schooled us on the different types of meat on each animal, how you can combine each part to make something delicious, and told us some other fun facts.  did you know vikings used every single part of the animal?  thanks for the info, james!\n\nas we left the freezer room, he began to give us a little history lesson about echo and rig.  while he dropped some history on us he gave us some samples of headcheese and liver.  it was my first time having these delectable delights.  actually, i can't say they were delectable before trying them.  the thought of headcheese and liver made me dry heave.  however, i summoned enough courage to try them out and it wasn't bad at all.  the liver tasted a little salty, but i was able to down it no problem.  the headcheese tasted just like ox tail.\n\nafter mr. purefoy entertained us, we were escorted to the upstairs patio area for lunch.  we were served by the most pleasant waitress i've ever come across.  kind, gentle, sweet-- just like me on a first date.  \n\nmy friend's cousin gave us appetizers on the house.  they were <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> and fried cauliflowers.  man, hmm...hmm!  the sauces t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> these fine appetizers were also great.  i've had <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> before, but this takes the cake and smashes it in everyone else's face.\n\nfor lunch, i got the <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark>.  the <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> had short rib, white cheddar and parmesan in it.  my first bite was ecstasy-- the gooey cheese was pure bliss and the short rib was nothing short of fantastic.  if i had 20 hands i'd give this sandwich 20 thumbs up.  and don't get me started on the chips t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> with the sandwich.  the freakin' chips, man.  i need to wipe the tears from my face because i'm reminiscing about the good times i had with those chips.  i'll be sure to pour some liquor on the street because i do miss those chips. \n\necho and rig is the spot for great food and a euphoric atmosphere.  check the place out because you won't be disappointed.  and i should point this out, just because mr. purefoy would want us to:  support your local butcher!!!!",

            "first time here and have to admit t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was pleasantly impressed with the service, knowledge of the staff and attentiveness. got the <mark>Fried Spinach</mark> salad, awesome, by the way. sides of burnt peas with garlic and the broccolini. decided to order the t-bone porterhouse steak (31oz) to share (wasn't on the menu, waiter showed us the daily cuts). paired with red wine. dinner was exquisite. ambiance and overall experience will make me come back for more.", 
            "happy to give this place another chance! tried it out for brunch today and they are well on their way back to being w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> were. we were greeted not only by the host but also the chef in the butchery...we explained t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> had not been in a while but heard there was a new management team so we wanted to come back. they were both grateful. we were quickly sat outside the patio has the best heaters in town...i wasn't cold once. bottomless\nmimosa for $16 is a great price...i'm not a fan of the wycliff but add enough orange juice and it's fine. short rib hash was an a+ but the rest of the breakfast was just good.\ncan't wait to go back for dinner and get a steak....that's w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> place is about!", 
            "the food here is delicious (def if your a meat lover).  the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> are super good.  i like how they have seating at the balcony (super romantic).  the ambience apart from the balcony is a little strange, it reminds me of a school cafeteria.\n\nservice was good and would definitely come again cause the food is t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> yo!", 
            "i can't speak any higher about this place! i visited from out of town (dallas) and celebrated my birthday at random at this restaurant. i don't usually yelp but i was so blown away by the food, atmosphere and service t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> had to right a review. \ni'm in the industry and so i have high standard offood & service.....sam was an awesome server. if i could recruit him to dallas i would- totally professional and knowledgeable. \nsteaks were tender and cooked accurately. charcuterie shouldn't be missed! especially the mousse de foie pate...omg.....i'm going to have vivid dreams about t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>. a meal i will never forget!!!", 
            "well, i was extremely pleased to see t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> chef sam marvin took the time to reply to my post from shortly over a month ago. needless to say i've always raved about the menu at echo and rig and being a local in the hospitality business ( bartender on the strip) i always take the time to inform my guests about great food. chef marvin's reply was an unexpected gesture t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> made me willing to try the restaurant again in hopes service has improved.\n \nok so last night we returned to echo & rig in hopes of a better experience and let me say they didn't disappoint! let start by saying the fact t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> two hostesses are always above and beyond they've remembered us by name which is a nice touch and are always smiling and always helpful to our needs ( we have 3 little ones ) then we so lucky to sit in ricky's section ( 2nd time we've been served by him ) ricky remember us from our last visit and welcomed us back. knowing the kids can be uneasy and impatient at times he asked if we'd like to get the children started and took our appetizer and cocktails order as well. like i've stated in my previous post we've been here many times so we know the menu so ordered our main course shortly after as he poured us water. food as always was amazing and i can't say enough about the services as it was the best experience yet! echo and rig has restored our faith in the service and we'll keep spreading word-of-mouth to all our friends and family about this wonderful overall experience.", 
            "let me start by saying i only take the time to review a restaurant if it's worth reviewing.  t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> said, echo & rig, culinary-wise, might just be in my top 3 favorite restaurants in las vegas.  their downfall is 80% of the staff and service! \n\ni started going there a couple if months ago and my first experience was amazing!! since january i have been back at least 10 times and have been disappointed most of those times.  i return because the food is t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> (t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>, if i receive it, or if the kitchen staff cares to sear the meat right). \nfirst time i went, it was during lunch.  the server was casual but his recommendations were spot on.  lunch was delicious and server was helpful friendly.\n\nreturned several times after that (a couple nights back to back).  there are two evening hostesses t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> remember us, which makes us feel welcome.  however the staff upstairs acted too busy or were overwhelmed with tables.  only a few times we were offered bread when we sat.  offered the cuts of the house only once since i've been there.  once they mixed the sparkling water with the still water.  found a hair in our soup and they did nothing but take it off the check, did not offer a replacement or an apology.  one waiter made us feel bad about not ordering an alcoholic beverage.  waiters seem rushed or impatient.  management seems unconcerned.  complained to a manager who did absolutely nothing and appeared completely uninterested.\n\nwent for lunch once and, i kid you not, there were approximately 4 other tables there.  ordered the portabello fries (yum by the way) had a view of the kitchen and watched as it sat for 30 min while i ate the rest of my meal, all the while the cooks, waitstaff and management walked past it many times without a single person commenting who's dish was sitting out under the warmer.  also asked for a coke, which didn't arrive.  at the end of the meal (fries still up in the warmer) i was presented with a check t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> had the fries and coke.  mind you there were only 4 other tables present. \n\nalso have issues with getting my table bussed, usually plates pile up before someone comes and clears them.  also they'll take your silverware before you're even done.  \n\npositive notes: food is amazing.  flat iron steak is my favorite and 9 out of 10 times it's seared right and cooked perfectly.  portabello fries are always a favorite, carne asada bone marrow delish.  love the grilled octopus but every so often it's tough.  black spaghetti used to be my favorite until they changed the scallops to mussels.  crispy bacon is decadent.  <mark>Ultimate BLT</mark> was one of the first things i tried and nothing short of amazing but have had it since and it didn't quite measure up (the bread seemed old).  decent wine selection, <mark>White Peach Sangria</mark> is tasty, cocktail selection is ok.  they used to have a chaucuterie board t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> really good but i no longer see on their menu.  downstairs has fresh squeezed juices t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> should put at least on their lunch menu, i am always curious about them but never know w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> have.  steaks are amazing, i have had several different cuts and all are tender and delicious (they should be, they're a butchery!) and prices are great, especially compared to a steak house on the strip.  all their meats or all natural grass fed.\n\nhave been hesitant to return because of service, have returned solely because of the food, only 2 stars because of overall experience.  this restaurant definitely deserves better.", 
            "ok hope this one sticks around for a bit....\ntried echo and rig by default, since hops and harvest closed and poppy den not open for lunch anymore...booo!\n\nreally glad we tried it, wonderful experience\na bit early for steak, so we enjoyed drinks and a few small plates on the patio/balcony for a nice lunch\n\nhad the bacon, <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>, bone marrow carne asada plates to start with to accompany our drinks....nice mixology!\n\nthe bacon was just ok, not bad, but nothing special\nif you are a mushroom fan, make sure to order the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>, can make an entire meal out of these. they do them spot on here, not overly done, just right!\nthe bone marrow carne asada was good, a bit different with lime and cilantro flavors, but good none the less!\n\nwe then decided to at least try a dish, so went with the butterfish.....\nagain, a home run! prepared just right, and the fingerling potatoes t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> them were spectacular....yeah, never thought i would rave about a potato, but these were prepared so they retained a bit of crispness and sweetness, almost like an apple!\n\nfinished off our meal with an apple pie sundae and the dark cherry one as well\nour vote would be for the black cherry....\n\nwe will definitely return!\nthanks for choosing tivoli village guys, need more like this", 
            "was here a few weeks ago and had an exceptional time so we went again.  arrived kinda late (10pm) and the hostess was very warm and welcoming.  \n\nunfortunately the service beyond getting sat was the main issue throughout the meal.  the server would leave the table for extended periods of time and we had to flag him down  for beverage orders.  were told they ran out of bread... so no bread service.  clearing for each course took a long time.  \n\nthe entree arrived and they forgot our cheddar mashed potatoes!  then told by the waiter it was the food runners fault for not communicating to us they were out of t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> well..?  the server seemed kinda rushed to leave for the evening and it was apparent during service.  he did buy us a glass of wine t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> said repeatedly he paid for by himself for the inconvenience...unfortunately it wasn't the wine t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> ordered....\n\nthe manager touched the 3 tables except ours in the restaurant.  mgmt feedback:  always attack issues with the tables and deal with the problem head on.  don't avoid addressing issues in the dining room.\n\nthe 3 stars goes to the hostess and the food at echo and rig which is outstanding!   we want to go back but i am afraid of the inconsistencies in service.", 
            "2 hour wait. i was expecting a wait, but 2 hours was a bit much. was it worth 2 hours? definitely not, sorry to say! i would think t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> my hunger and grumpiness i would like anything i ate, but t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> not the case. \n\non a positive note, i liked hoe the butchers were cutting steaks and you could talk to them and sample some <mark>Sausage</mark> and such. personally, i am not a sausage fan and did not like w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> had to sample, but i believe my hubby liked this sampling. i liked the displays of meat and opportunity to interact with butchers. \n\nonce we were seated (pretty area upstairs by the way), i already knew i wanted the rip eye cap and the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> so i was ready to order. well, come to find out they were out of the rib eye cap! \n\nat t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> we had to ask for recommendations. i was a little confused by the steak choices. they had rib eye steak on the menu and rib eye steak t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> buy from precut slices t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> butchers were cutting downstairs. apparently there is a difference in the quality of them. there is also a difference in the price, major difference. i just found it weird. i mean options are great, but this was a little bit too much for me to decide. i think they should just stick to w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> they feel would taste the best. the waiter almost made the rib eye from the menu sound like something i could have bought myself at the supermarket. he was really \"selling\" the ribeye/steaks t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> brought out raw on a platter. maybe to some people they would appreciate this and it did remind me of my experience at gordon ramsay steak, but the prices were almost the same as strip prices for those cuts of meat. it almost felt like we would be making a bad choice if we chose the steak from the menu. again, why not just have one type of meat on your menu?\n\nhe claimed the fish was brought in from fisherman t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> day and i did not understand how t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> even possible?\n\nbased on the waiter's recommendation, i ordered the slow roasted short ribs with castelvetrano olives, celery, walnuts, and horseradish. i'm not going to lie, these toppings did not seem like they would go well with short ribs, but the waiter was saying it was excellent so i got it. the olives, celery, and walnuts literally looked like they were sprinkled on top after the short ribs were cooked. i don't think raw celery, uncooked olives, and chunky walnuts compliments short ribs at all! i was hoping it was maybe chopped up small and possibly cooked in some way. i've ordered short ribs often at restaurants and just never saw it made this way. it was presented on a piece of paper and board (similar to how a charcuterie would be served), also weird. i think of short ribs as having a yummy sauce t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> would want to pair with mashed potato or rice or something to enjoy the sauce with and some sort of cooked veggies. instead, the sauce was dripping off of the paper. weird presentation. \n\nmy husband's ribeye steak was good and so was the mushroom. he also enjoyed the bone marrow (i did not try it) and i liked the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>. the waiter was quick to move around and seemed to be good (except for his recommendation).\n\noverall t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> rib and the long wait did not leave me wanting to come back for more.", 
            "awful service. i only would have given it a 2 because its nice to look at. but its way too hyped. if youre going to do fancy and simple do it right.  its quite pricy for the portions.  and i think t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> place t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> in meat should at least cook a med rare steak right? and we got a charcuterie thinking it was going to be good. but the pate was not spreadable and everything was flavorless and tasted the same. bleh!!!!! lastly open kitchen means i can see your asses eating from the service station. i saw ever server, runner, and busser stuff thair face and then not wash their hands.", 
            "the upstairs northeast-facing patio here might be my new favorite neighborhood lunch spot. exceptional service from mickel(sp?) including sparkling water top-offs even after we got our check. the blt is super impressive from the looks of it (i didn't order it but saw 3 of them in passing) and will try it next time. i had the branzino ($18) which tasted great, but was more of a $$$ portion (smallish) and my lunchmates had the lamb chop pair ($18) which were wood-grilled and fantastic (i had a bite) and the trenne pasta ($12) which was a great effort as well, albeit not quite chef marc caliber, but still solid (and not chef marc priced).\n\nseems like some yelpers have resorted to dog-starring this place just to be contrarian, and maybe i just didn't run into any of the snafus t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> have run into. our waiter was knowledgable, friendly and helpful. the food came out quickly and well-plated. all of the staff was happy to see us. there is a cool all-around enthusiasm for food in the air here, and t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> going out for lunch fun.\n\ni want this place to do well. looking forward to the next experience, and hopefully a red-star upgrade! bon app\\u00e9tit, y'all.", 
            "i am not sure how they have such amazing quality ingredients (and chefs) for such low prices.  this is a great find away from the strip.  not really a tourist place, and t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> definitely a good thing.  absolutely worth checking out.", 
            "this is my favorite place to go.  i go there about once a week.  i cant get enough of there spencers steak with macaroni and cheese.  \n\nthey also have a great selection of wine.  we try something different every time.\n\ni heard t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> brunches are excellent will update review once i make it there",

            "amazing! the meat case at the front is impressive! i have wanted to try this place since a pal of mine, jason, starting working here as a chef. i have heard/read mixed reviews. the most recent article i read was in the desert companion magazine. after eating here, i find the magazine's review offensive.\nthe nice young lady at the front told us it would be 30-40 minute wait. we made our way to the bar where scotty was waiting to take care of us. he was outstanding! knowledgeable, friendly, and entertaining. i can't even tell you how long we waited bc we didn't mind, we enjoyed our time at the bar. sangria made w/sav blanc so it wasn't too sweet. kentucky peachtree was a little herbal for my husband, who is a straight whiskey kind of guy. admittedly we were a little sad when our table was ready, scotty said next time we could eat at the bar with him. prices at the bar weren't bad, 1can beer, one glass sangria, one shot whiskey, one kentucky peachtree and a glass of wine, $37.\nso glad we went to the table. our service was on point. ram\\u00f3n brought out a plate with raw cuts of meat to explain the menu and help us with our selections. we ordered nearly one of everything. he asked how we would like the meal timed. we chose to go with \"whenever its ready, bring it out.\" as we received our dishes we slowly realized we may have over done it.\nanyway! w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> ordered.... just my husband and i....  and our rating(1-10), don't judge, we like to try everything!\nsmall plates- \ntuscan kale-9, perfectly seasoned,\nasparagus & fried egg-11 the asparagus had slight grilled char t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> perfect  with the creamy egg, \nmac n cheese-11 soo cheezy it was wonderful,\nsteak tartare-favorite! salty, fresh, quality ingredients you can taste\nfried calamari-7 light breading very fresh\n<mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark>-5 plenty of crab but not my favorite <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark> (im a cc snob)\nbutcher's sausage-7 a little spicy but tasty\nbrussels sprouts-9 lemony fragrant and fresh\n<mark>Steakhouse Chop</mark> salad-10 big chunks of filet lightly dressed perfect\nspencer steak-10 meat was perfectly cooked tender and juicy\ni will be back to this restaurant very soon!! thank you scotty, ramon and jason for a memorable date night!!!!!",

            "directly from mccarran to tivoli village after a tiring 5-hour flight from newark, we figured on happy hour.  it was shortly after 10 p.m. on a tuesday, and i didn't expect our restaurant of choice to be closing up.  but the bartender there said t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> & rig was going to be the only game in town.  i'd been wanting to try it, so actually was happy with the suggestion.\n\ni sure wasn't about to scarf down a full meal, so we sat in the bar area.  happy hour had just kicked in, and our first waiter told me t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'s a ladies' drink and it's free.  w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> be better than free?  i think probably lots of things.  the drink, with muddled strawberries and w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> like grapefruit juice, was so tart t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was puckering up like a fish.  the bartender said there was another drink, a black betty, t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> could try.  it was a rum concoction with pineapple and oj, but that, too, was way too tart.  maybe these drinks solely exist to get ladies to order from the regular drink menu??  speaking of which, said menu has wines available by the glass, bottle, and half-glass.  half a glass of wine??  while the size of wine glasses has grown in direct proportion to the price of an entree at a given restaurant, the contents has shrunk just like your favorite roll of toilet paper.  i imagine half a glass of wine will equal two sips.  \n\nthe waiter recited the happy hour menu - shrimp cocktail or steak and egg(s) for $1.99, or a hot dog for $1.  i didn't think any of t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> going to hold us, so we ordered one steak and egg, an onion soup to share, and a <mark>Hanger Steak</mark> sandwich.  \n\nthe steak and egg was a cute little plate, with a child-size steak and a single fried egg.  not a lot to eat, but hell, it was 1.99!  we both loved the onion soup.  i was surprised to see the <mark>Hanger Steak</mark> sandwich served on a baguette-type bread, something t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> so hard to come by in vegas.  i just wish the bread had the crusty crunch t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> baguette sandwich should have.  the steak was on the rare side of medium, and the fresh spinach was good.  but it was all soooooo unnecessarily salty t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> didn't enjoy it as much as i could have.  i would have also appreciated a lot less salt on the otherwise-delicious chips t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> with the sandwich.\n\nthe bartender, jeff, was a delight.  he took over as our waiter, and sat down with and went through the entire menu for a future visit, letting us know which items he particularly recommends.  and they weren't all the priciest, either.\n\ni got to see the dining room upstairs when i passed through it on my way to the ladies' room.  the dining room - and the outdoor patio - are beautiful, but the bathroom is gorgeous!  loved the granite trough sink and the salt rub, which price i forgot to check out in their store.\n\ni definitely will go back to check out the regular menu, but next time will try to have them ease up on the salt.", 
            "i am torn writing this review because there is so much potential for this restaurant.  the food is amazing, the butcher shop is priceless, and the prices are reasonable.  my problem is with the staff.  i have been to this restaurant over a dozen times and, in the beginning when the restaurant first opened, the staff was very attentive and concerned t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> were taken care of.  i can't say t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>, especially in the bar.  i stopped at echo and rig recently to buy from the butcher shop.  it was only 4 pm.  i ordered the sausage i came for and went to have a hh drink. the bartender  -- a blonde woman -- was at the far right end of the bar talking to ladies intimately as if they were her friends. i sat on the left between two women and waited. then, another woman sits down to the left of me and the bartender comes over with a drink already made for her .. walks right past me and says nothing. apparently, another friend. then she walks past me again, not even a glance! eventually, she comes back to talk to the new woman who is definitely a friend. i interject, asking about hh. she tosses a flyer to me and keeps walking.  it's not busy at all so i'm beginning to think it's a girl's bar .....she was laughing with the ladies at the end of the bar.   i left. got my sausage from the wonderful butcher and went home.  i won't stop going to this restaurant.  but will only go for the butcher and for the food but, i won't be sitting at the bar any time soon.  i've heard similar complaints about the wait staff in the diningroom  from friends and i'm hoping beyond hope t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> isn't true", 
            "meat meat meat\n\nthe echo experience is one t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> a must try. tivoli has had its fair share of unique eateries t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> all had some sort of cool new age fusion or a gimmick t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> tried to separate itself from the rest and failed. echo & rig has also gone down this path but has succeeded.\n\n\nthe layout is a bar and butchery with a outside seating area downstairs. upstairs has your dining area.\n\nthere are plenty of reviews of echo & rig so i won't spend all day writing a review telling you the ins and outs but you must know this.\n\n1) it's a steakhouse with a butchery, this means the cuts of meat are pretty decent. \n\n2) the service is 9.5 out of 10\n\nand \n\n3) its kinda of an upscale kinda place, dress nicely. it isn't a flip flops and singlet kinda of place.\n\nok yelp said it was a $$, but it's a nice steakhouse, i'd probably say it's a $$$\nand not the $$ given.", 
            "i went to echo and rig on a friday night around 6:30pm. we were greeted by the friendly hostess and she took our name. she said t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> would be a 5 to 10 minute wait. so me and my date sat in the lounge, as we sat down the cocktail sever approached us and asked us if we wanted a drink while we waited to be seated. we waited no more than 5 minutes to be seated. the server greeted us within 2 minutes of getting to the table and asked us if we wanted some thing to drink. i ordered a porter, but i came to find out t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> were out of it. i am not a big fan of mushrooms but many yelper said t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> have to try the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> and they are right. my date didn't want to try them and even she was amazed my them. i ordered the filet medium rare with the onion sauce. i would have to say t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> steak was amazing by itself and it does not need any sauce. i ordered the mac and cheese as a side and there was nothing special about it. the service was probably some of the best t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> have had. the server was on point. i wish i remembered his name because i would ask for him when i go back. i would have to say t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> and rig is probably one of my favorite steakhouses in las vegas.",

            "30 minute wait for a patio table on a thursday.\n\nwe thoroughly enjoyed pretty much everything we ate, but the standout by far was the delicious \"grilled octopus, gigante beans, green olive vinaigrette\".  we ordered this as an appetizer while waiting in the bar.    it was so good t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> ordered another one as part of our meal.\n\nwe sat in a nice corner table on the upstairs patio, which is where i'd recommend sitting if you want something on the somew<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> setting;  the atmosphere inside was too open and felt more like a place for a group dinner.\n\ntheir specialty cocktail with jalapeno was disappointing to say the least; it tasted like a ton of sweet and sour mix with a dash of spiciness thrown in....the flavors didn't meld (i was hoping something more like the spicy pear cocktail from  the union kitchen & tap room in encinitas; now t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> a specialty cocktail).  \n\ni'd definitely recommend this place, but i personally would steer away from their specialty cocktails.", 
            "to clarify the hours, the restaurant upstairs is open until 11. there is a bar downstairs with only a few late night  food specials t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> open until 1am.\n\nthis place is carnivore heaven. with an in-house butcher shop supplying the restaurant, you can get pretty much any cut of meat you want.\n\ni appreciate t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> & rig proudly displays w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> their meat comes from. this is huge, i wish all restaurants had this level of transparency.\n\necho seems to source meat from smaller organic or all natural farms, something i am very happy to see and happy to pay a premium for.\n\non my first visit here i opted to share a massive 48oz porterhouse with my friend. when it came out pre-sliced i was worried, but all was good when i took a bite. it was properly rested before cutting, and so much easier to eat t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>. i'm now a fan of this style.\n\nthe steak was perfectly cooked, well seasoned, and good enough t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> has brought me back to echo & rig many times.\n\nthis is now the place i crave after too many visits to veggie house or when i need a little more (ok, a lot more) protein in my diet. \n\nall the main dishes i have tried here have been excellent, i have not been disappointed with a single one. notable highlights include the lamb porterhouse chops, summertime steak salad, horseradish crusted butterfish, and of course all the steaks. you can't go wrong with any piece of meat here, but the spencer steak takes the crown - it's lean but very tender and always cooks to an even, perfect medium rare.\n\none minor complaint, the potato chips and stuffed mushroom t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> with the steaks seem more like lunch items. these sides are not fit for dinner steaks and certainly don't add anything to the amazing steaks they are served with. i would prefer a choice of vegetable, roast or mashed potatoes, or even fries instead of the dry underwhelming chips.\n\nsome of my favorite sides are the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> & herb aioli, grilled octopus, charcuterie platter, <mark>Fried Spinach</mark> salad (perfect to share, ask for it to be split in half), and roast potatoes.\n\nthe no corkage policy is awesome, i hope it is here to stay.", 
            "i've dined at echo & rig 3 separate times. twice was for brunch, which was amazing and loved sitting outside on the upstairs patio. the service was great and the waiter/waitress were so pleasant. \n\nbut yesterday, i decided to go to their happy hour. i had heard about the great specials, especially the $1.99 steak & eggs and shrimp cocktail. \n\nwhile there were 2 bartenders, one of them seemed to be designated to getting the drinks for the waitstaff. while the other was strictly serving sitting at the bar. my boyfriend and i were 2 of maybe 6 people sitting at the bar. not once did the bartender ask me if i wanted another drink, while my empty glass sat there. and each time i tried to get his attention, he must have been in his own world and seemingly ignored me. he also carried on all his conversation with younger bus boy behind the bar with him, who hovered waiting to grab your empty plates/drinks before you were even done.\n\ni do enjoy the food, but the service at the bar left me with mixed feelings. i think most people would agree who enjoy sitting at a bar over a table in the dining room, t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> friendly attentive bartender can truly make your experience great.\n\ni felt t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was a nuisance for having to ask for my drinks/food. i do hope they focus more on customer service at the bar.", 
            "after glimpsing over the online menu a few times, i was super excited to meet my friend here for girls night out yesterday. we arrived around 7:00 and expected a wait since it was friday. we were seated at a smallish table t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> and a bus buy was immediately sent over with shims to fix it. perfect. the waiter explained the menu, offered his recommendations and we were off to a normal las vegas steakhouse experience.... until the service sputtered and crashed. interestingly our section started clearing out after we ordered so i can't say it got busier for them. the first issue was the bread we were told about never came. fine. we had the amazing <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> to munch on anyways. getting water glasses refilled was a constant struggle throughout the visit. next, out steaks arrive, without steak knives. i asked for one but my friend didn't think to, assuming they'd bring for both of us. out comes one steak knife, just one. we ask for another. it comes. she had to remind the server to bring her wine. oddly, he never asked if she'd care for another glass...? look, the food is delicious, the concept is wonderful but the staff needs more training. you can't compete in a service-centric town like las vegas with mediocre wait staff. i live in the southeast so tivoli village is a hike for me. i'd give the place another shot, but maybe after they've had more time to find their service niche.", 
            "came to this place for dinner. interesting set up they have there. the bar, hostess stand, retail shop, and butcher shop is downstairs and they restaurant is upstairs. down stairs they have the bar where you can get really decently priced cocktails starting at about $8 which is great since most bars have speciality drinks starting at $12 and up. they do offer happy hour but there are only three food items on the menu so we never tried it. they have a retail store where you can buy products they use in the restaurant, and a butcher shop to buy fresh meats. there's also only one bathroom in the place and it upstairs in the dining area. there is also outdoor patio seating t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> our into the fountain of tivoli village. they also seem to have a juice bar where you can order fresh pressed juices. \n\nside plates are on the smaller side so don't expect to get full off of those. which is good because it saves your appetite for the main course. \n\nitems ordered:\n\nappetizers:\n<mark>Portobello Fries</mark>: the best <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> have ever had! the waiter swears by them. the breading they use is not bread crumbs like we expected. instead it was a smooth outer shell with a nice crunch to it. the mushroom was cooked perfectly on the inside and not mushy, underdone or burned. the aioli t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> with it for dipping is just the perfect mixture to compliment this fry. \n\n\nasparagus and a fried egg: came with i believe about 4-5 pieces of  asparagus with an over easy egg on top of it. \n\nmaryland lump <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark>: about 3-4 pieces on this plate. pretty good\n\nentrees:\nbavette: good piece of meat not to fatty. \n\nblack spaghetti pasta: delicious! the broth/sauce was so good t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> had to slurp it with every bite! a good serving portion and didn't taste overly fishy. i was a little skeptical ordering this because of the squid ink but it was delicious.",

            "i've eaten at several steakhouses on the strip including carnevino and craftsteak, and can say without hesitation t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> and rig is by far the best steakhouse in las vegas.  i was particularly impressed by their commitment to sourcing food locally, and the selection and  quality of the meat offered was outstanding.  the service was impeccable.  our server, brian, was friendly and impressively knowledgeable about every item on the menu which he took the time to explain to my dining partner and i.  the ambience was sleek and modern, but relaxed and not the least bit pretentious.  shortly after we were seated we were offered the choice of flat or sparkling water free of charge and a tray of focaccia bread with butter was brought to our table.  my dining partner and i ordered the kennebec salt and pepper fries as an appetizer, and  the jumping beef and the bavette as our entrees.  all steak entrees are served with a stuffed mushroom, homemade chips and a selection of as many sauces as you'd like.  the accompaniments with the steak selections is certainly a rare find as most upscale steakhouses offer sides ala carte. we  finished off our meal with a decadent caramel and sea salt ice cream sundae t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> more than big enough to share. every dish was delicious, perfectly cooked and artfully presented.  we had all of t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> along with three beers and coffee for  $85.00.  there is no way a meal like t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> two people would have cost so little on the strip.  i highly recommend echo and rig to anyone who wants a wonderful meal, in a beautiful setting, with impeccable service at an extraordinarily reasonable price.  we will definitely be back.",

            "we arrived for a fairly early dinner (about 5:00 pm on a saturday evening). when you come in, you are struck by the butcher shop to your right and the bar area to your left. both very attractive. we were led upstairs to the patio area. this was an unusual night for vegas because it wasn't too hot or too cold and it wasn't windy - a perfect night to eat outdoors. the tables were very nicely spaced so you didn't have to hear the conversation of your neighbors. my wife and i decided to share the black spaghetti and a rib eye steak. because of the rave reviews for their portabello fries, we decided to give them a try as well. our waiter let us know the steak would take some time. not a problem. we told him to bring out the spaghetti first and the steak when it was ready. we waited a pretty long time. the steak came out first, then the spaghetti. the fries came out last. we asked for the steak to be pink in the center. it came out way too well done. we sent it back. it came back a second tome. again way too well done. however, we decided not to send it back again. despite being cooked too well for our tastes, the meat was delicious with an excellent rub. our waiter never did ask us if we wanted one of the sauces available. i only realized it when i heard him offer it to the folks at the next table who were ordering the same steak. don't get me wrong. the steak was delicious and didn't need a sauce. but it would have been nice to be asked.\nthe black spaghetti was incredible. this was cooked to perfection. there was a good amount of seafood mixed in (mussels, calamari, and more). all in all, one of the best pasta dishes i've eaten. and the portabello fries were incredible. the reviewers who recommended them did not lie. it is worth eating here just for the fries. \nat the end of the meal, the manager came out and apologized for the confusion on the meat preparation. we explained t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> we prefer our meat much rarer than the way it was served (ie pink throughout), we did eat it and enjoy it. however, he insisted on taking it off the bill.\noverall, a very good dining experience. i will return when i am in the neighborhood looking for a good steak meal (or a good pasta dish). if it weren't for the errors on the preparation of the meat, this would have been a 5 star review.",

            "echo and rig started out as a 5 star for me, however they have not kept up with the same standards t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> had originally started with in both aspects of service and quality. a dinner here will run you about 50pp with drinks and a few appetizers. \n\non multiple visits i have been served food t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> been sitting out. i am not one to send something back but had to on my last visit because i could not stand paying good money for w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was being served. the server happily took it back and apologized after he touched the plate and realized t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was right. \n\nregardless....\nthe layout of the restaurant is stunning. when you enter the restaurant you are checked in downstairs where you will find their butcher shop, then walked up the stairs by a hostess where you will find an open kitchen and dining area with a gorgeous patio overlooking the tivoli fountains (not much of a view, but they definitely worked with w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> had).\n\necho and rig is a great spot to have a casual lunch with a friend, date night with t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> someone, or celebrate a special occasion. i loved the concept t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> had going and the different menu items t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> tried to push, especially when it came to their smaller appetizer plates but if i had to spend 100+ on a meal i'd look for another spot.",

(the only reason it's not getting a 5 star) i just found it bothersome because there were a few flying around. i think an easy fix would be some sort of screens to block them from coming in. \n\nthe service was awesome!  our waiter was wonderful at providing great advice on the menu. i asked him , \"w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> would you recommend for the steak\"? he said, \"all of them\". i was a bit embarrassed to ask but i asked if i can have all of them with my steak. when my entree came out he brought out all of the sauces! i was in awe and tried every one of the sauces. i felt like a sauce boss! lol! my favorite sauce for the home made chips was the horseradish.  the consistency wasn't like w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> would find at arbys. it was cool and thick and had a mild kick to it. perfect for chips! i always like bernaise sauce but to get a different taste with each bite i dunked the peices of juicy steak into all the varieties i had in front of me.\n\nwe also ordered the brussel sprouts and mashed potatoes with our meal. they complemented the steaks well. i also loved the mushrooms t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> with my steak. \n\nwe ended the meal with berry shortcake. it had fresh berries with citrus shortcake, and vanilla ice cream. it was topped with whipped cream and a candied flower . it was a light dessert t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> perfect with the meal!",

            "i've had echo & rig book-marked as a place to try on my yelp for awhile, and we finally gave it a try today.\n\ncame here for lunch and there was no wait.  the layout of the restaurant is nice.  downstairs is the butcher shop area, the reception, and a bar.  upstairs is the actual dining area where there is indoor and outdoor seating.  i like how it's very spacious and airy upstairs.\n\nthe service we got was great.  our servers were nice and just attentive enough.\n\nnow on to the food.  my friend and i ordered:\n\nsweet first cauliflower - tasty!  just had the right amount of crunch and saltiness to it.  we really liked how the sliced chilis complimented the cauliflower.\n\nbone marrow asada - a-ok.  one of the <mark>Toast</mark> we got was burnt on the end (..boo! to them for not replacing it).  this was the first time i've had this type of dish before.  i saw the pictures on yelp of others raving about the dish.  but overall it was just ok.. not worth a repeat order.\n\nblack spaghetti - my main dish.  not quite w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was expecting.  the broth was a bit too tangy for me.  pasta itself as well as the seafood (which was shrimp, calamari, and mussels) was not bad.  but i was disappointed overall.  won't be order this again.\n\ntrenne pasta - this was my friend's dish.  much tastier than mine.  i had no clue w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> pasta is and therefore did not know it was suppose to be a crunchy texture.  i didn't care for the crunchiness of the pasta but i did like the prime rib eye and tuscan black kale t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> part of the dish.\n\noverall - i would go back.  the prices are overall are reasonable.  staff was nice and the restaurant itself is lovely.  next time i will order some  kind of steak.  t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> be the make it or break it deal of whether or not i will make future repeat visits.", 
            "may 31 2014. called ahead. said they couldn't take a reservation for 6 people. at 5:30 apparently there was no wait, but when we arrived at 6:30 it was 30 min, not bad on a saturday. the host crew was friendly and professional. upon being seated our waiter promptly introduced himself. bread water, sparkling and still, were served complimentary. our group experienced a bit of confusion with the menu; w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> to be sides, the waiter referred to as appetizers and as tapas. the one knock, our waiter seemed to be pushing for the up-sale. he seemed annoyed t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> didn't order from the bar and pushed hard for the larger steaks. some of their steaks were absolutely massive. \"sorry bud, we just ate a late lunch a couple hours ago and were out with the kids so no alcohol, nothing to get annoyed about.\" we were seated next to the kitchen, lots of energy. in our case it was entertainment, but if you want relaxing request a table away from the kitchen. our waiter didn't make frequent stops at our table, think we saw him a total of four times including the check. if you are reading this review do decide of you want to go here, i wouldn't let my mediocre service experience stop you. i'm sure it was a fluke as the rest of the staff seemed overly helpful. however it did stop us from ordering dessert. and it may stop me from returning. the food was good, see the photos  for the evidence. beware, the \"bavette\" is a skirt steak. good, if perhaps overpriced.", 
            "love this place! great place to have brunch and/or dinner. this is also our go to butcher when looking for a good piece of meat or advice/recommendation on preparation. it's in a nice location out in summerlin area in tivoli village.  prices and portions are really impressive so it's definitely worth the buck. \n\ntheir steak tartare by far is one of the freshest and best ones i've ever had. i truly enjoy their short rib hash that's on their brunch menu. only downfall are options with dessert because i believe all they offered were different types of ice cream sundaes. i personally am not a big fan of ice cream but i do admit i did try their salted caramel sundae and t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> delicious! \n\ni highly recommend checking this place out. :)", 
            "in one visit, echo & rig has become a place i cannot afford to miss whenever i visit las vegas.\n\nas soon as you enter, you'll see the place is unique, with a large butcher counter and organic juice bar on the floor level. the people behind the counters are smiling and engaging and are happy to tell you anything and everything about the sumptuous foods they're preparing. t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> where it came from as well as recipes for the specific cut you want.\n\nupstairs, via stairs or elevator, is the restaurant and kitchen. the kitchen is open for everyone to see with about a dozen cooks who really know their stuff. when i visited, the co-owners/head chefs, frank & sam, were both there and i got to meet them. they are genuinely nice guys. so nice in fact, they served us a complimentary lamb porterhouse steak, which wasn't even on the lunch menu! this was after i told them i came all the way from los angeles to try their lamb. it was so good, i nearly cried.\n\nall the food is delicious, we tried things from every portion of the menu: portobello mushroom fries, burrata (cheese), charcuterie plate (assorted pates and deli meats), pepper fries, arugula salad, cauliflower with spices, the <mark>Hanger Steak</mark> sandwich (super good!), and even some of their ice cream desserts. everything is made from scratch including all sauces, breads, deli meats, and desserts. they are primarily a butcher shop, so you can expect the highest quality of meat compared to anywhere. their signature cut of beef is the <mark>Hanger Steak</mark>, which is not easy to get at most places because a single cow only yields a few ounces of it. yet e&r has it at the ready and at a good price.\n\nthe service is good, it's much like fine dining with a team of very courteous people flying around the table, each with their designated tasks. the thing t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> win you over is the value. you get the same (if not better) food quality you would expect from a place like spago or mastro's, but it's half the price. yes, half.\n\nif there has to be a negative, it's t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'s a ways off of the vegas strip. about 15 miles (20 min) separates e&r from your favorite strip hotel, but in light of that, there's a valuable thing i learned by going here. the best food you can find in any city is intended for local customers, not tourists. so get away from the sparkly lights and overpriced, mediocre buffets and taste something so good, it might bring tears to your eyes!", 
            "the customer service at this place sucks.  it was just my wife and i and we were celebrating her birthday.  our waiter was apparently training another server.  my wife ordered her steak to be well done and she realizes t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'s <mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> when someone asks for the steak to be cooked well done but t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> the way she likes it.  they offered to butterfly the steak to ensure t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was cooked correctly and she agreed.  when the runner brought the meal out, a vast majority of the steak it was medium-rare at best.  she also ordered the heirloom carrots which most of them came out burned.  unfortunately, neither our waiter nor his trainee came out to check on us for at least 20 minutes after we received our meal.  my wife ate the part of the steak t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> cooked to her request and some of the unburned carrots.  we both ran out of water and she ran out of her soda and it sat empty on our table for at least 10 minutes.  luckily, we were sitting in the corner so i reached over and grabbed the bottle of water and refilled both our glasses.  our waiter walked near our table several times but never checked on us.  normally, i would have raised my hand and asked for something but after awhile, it became a test to see just how long this guy was actually going to go without even asking how our dinner was.  this was a saturday night during dinner and i understand t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was busy, and i understand t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> waiter was probably busier than normal because he was training the other guy but there is absolutely no excuse for not checking on our table for roughly 20 minutes after the meal is brought out.  when our waiter finally checked on us, i asked for the manager.  i explained to the manager t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> had 3 problems, 1) the steak was not cooked correctly  2) most of the carrots were burned  3) our waiter never came by to check on us and my wife's soda had been empty for most of the meal.  the manager left the table to go speak to the chef.  when he returned, he partially apologized but mostly he took the position t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> steaks are butcher cut not machine cut so it makes the steak thicker and apparently harder to cook.  this is total bs to say t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> chef is unable to properly cook a steak to the customer's request because it is thick, especially considering t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was butterfly cut.  he also stated t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> carrots are supposed to be charred but most of them were this way while the others were normal.  the charred carrots were cooked too much and tasted burned.  he offered to take the carrots off the bill but we stated t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> would not be necessary since my wife ate some of the unburned ones.  the waiter promptly returned with a soda while the manager was talking to us the second time.  probably the most shocking thing is t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> waiter never apologized.  i expected him to say t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was sorry and t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> is really busy tonight but he didn't say anything to us.  there is no doubt t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> knew exactly why we asked for the manager.  my dinner was fine so this experience was not entirely negative.  we also expected t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> they would comp a desert or do something to make the situation right but they did not (although i did decline to have the carrots taken off the ticket).  i realize t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> everyone on yelp loves this place, which is why we went there but i expected way more.  we spent nearly $100 for the two of us and i realize t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> is not the most expensive meal in the world but we should most certainly have a better customer service experience.", 
            "this place is fabulous! we typically come either friday or saturday. as busy as they are, the service by ramon is always phenomenal! top notch service. the food is just as outstanding. i love the wasabi crusted butter fish, spencer steak and the rib eye cap is great. actually there's nothing that's bad. calamari is average. the dessert menu could use more variety since all they do is sundaes. hand crafted cocktails...w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> can you ask for? we love this place as our neighborhood restaurant. upside, no corkage, downside, they don't take reservations.",

            "finally!!! i have been lusting over echo & rig since they opened, but hadn't had a chance to visit until this weekend. i'd say t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> in all, they pretty much live up to the hype. echo and rig is located in a prime location in tivoli village. it is a beautiful restaurant.  the downstairs level has the bar and butcher shop, while the upstairs has the kitchen, dining room, and a balcony which also seats diners. the dining area is on the smaller side, but it is all very open and airy.\n\nwhen we arrived, we were informed t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> wait was about an hour. yikes! granted, it was 7:20 on a saturday night, but i wasn't expecting so long of a wait. but we were there, we were hungry, and we were not to be dissuaded from our plan. so, we moseyed up to the bar for a cocktail. i enjoyed the strawberry bliss, while my companion had the <mark>White Peach Sangria</mark>. both of the drinks were very well crafted, and all of the bartenders were really friendly and personable. i always enjoy when i can see them muddling ingredients and putting drinks together with care. my companion made an off-handed comment about the sangria being full of ice and not enough drink (because it was so good), and the bartender fixed him another at no charge! it wasn't even a complaint, and we certainly weren't expecting that.\n\nthe wait only ended up being about 35 minutes, and we were escorted upstairs to the dining room by the hostess. we were seated in a very cosy corner with the booth portion accented by lots of cute (and comfy) pillows.  our server, ramon, was very nice and made some recommendations for us. he was also serving a very large party near us, so service was on the rather leisurely (slow-ish) side.\n\nthe bread wasn't anything special, but it was soft in the middle, which i appreciated. it was served room temperature.  we initially started our meal with the octopus, which was one of ramon's picks (he talked us out of the calamari). unfortunately, it wasn't w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> expected and it wasn't exactly to our liking. it actually was like an octopus salad, with white beans and a light vinegar sauce. the octopus didn't have much flavor and was rather chewy.  this was the only negative portion of our meal. we mentioned to ramon t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> didn't really like it, and he brought out an order of calamari at no charge. the calamari was delicious! hot, lightly breaded, and had two sauces t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> equally good.\n\nthe main course.... steak! i got the ribeye, medium-rare, while my companion got the spencer steak, medium. both steaks are served with a large mushroom with breadcrumbs in it and chips. the chips seemed rather unnecessary, but they were fine. the steaks... absolutely delicious! they were highly seasoned (if you don't like salt, this may not be the right choice), and cooked perfectly. we also got a side of the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> (essentially deep fried mushrooms). they were very tasty, but i don't know if i'd order them again.\n\nthroughout our meal, one of the managers circulated to check on every table and make sure everyone was enjoying their meal, which was a nice touch. \n\necho & rig had so many yummy sounding things on their menu, t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> definitely would love to return to try some more of their offerings.", 
            "went to echo & rig for a quick dinner before attending a performance at the smith center. the food at echo & rig is always good, but the spencer steak was exceptional this evening. the service was also impeccable. echo & rig has an exceptional waitstaff and has managers making sure t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> are satisfied. my daughter had ordered a seafood with black pasta dish. she was eating the dish but did not appear to be enjoying it and our waiter noticed. he immediately came over and offered to get her another selection without being prompted to do so. he also made sure the item was removed from the bill. t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> the type of exceptional service t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> echo & rig from other restaurants.  these guys \"get it\" with a reasonably priced menu and great food and service", 
            "i was here for their soft opening and many times since as i work in tivoli.  service has been hit and miss in my outings though the bar staff is superb.  \n\nfood here is very good.  part of t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> the butcher's attached to the restaurant.   i love t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> can buy meat here to take home or just rest assured t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> steak is fresh and quality.  \n\nprice is a little steep but again, high quality food so maybe you get w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> pay for.\n\nwe spend a fair amount of time at the bar (it's only a problem if it negatively impacts your life!) and i can't say enough good about the staff in the bar.  stop in, grab a cocktail and check out the happy hour.  good times to be had.", 
            "i've never really cared too much about steak houses because they are all the same to me.  it is always an overpriced small piece of meat and some sides t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> can easily buy at costco for a fraction of the price. \n\nbut, i love echo & rig! it is an atypical steakhouse with excellent customer service. the prices are great for the high quality all natural meat t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> give you. the best part is t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> don't have to have steak, there have tons of other options too. \n\nyesterday night i went there for dinner to celebrate a birthday, and everyone was happy with their food. edward salame was our waiter and he gave us 5 star service. he was knowledgeable and very charismatic. \n\ni got the trenne pasta dish, which was tasty. i love their over the rainbow quinoa salad, chopped steak salad, mussel, and octopus.", 
            "let me first start off by saying i am no stranger to top notch steak restaurants, echo & rig is by far the best experience at any steak let alone any restaurant i've ever visited.  from the minute we walked through the door till we got seated was very unique and pleasantly inviting. we were greeted by the manager robert who blew me away on level of knowledge he had on the details on different types of entrees available on the menu. on top of t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was perfect choice of management for this restaurant being very friendly, very bright and hospitable. our waiter edward was just as good, making sure we were taken care as if we were family with a great sense of humor. with the quality of food and atmosphere you would expect to pay at least $60-70 per entree but here we spent nearly half. we live in los angeles and come to vegas at least 10-20 times a year. i will definitely be coming back to echo & rig every time we visit vegas, this place is amazing.", 
            "have you ever done something, where you knew you were making a mistake, and then did it anyway?\n\nthat's how i have to describe my experience at echo and rig. \n\nnow, in all fairness, my doctor has banned me from eating red meat. i am not a vegetarian, vegan, or health nut. therefore since i did not try their steaks, my review will be based on my experience of service and hospitality.\n\nmy wife had been here before, and just said it was \"so-so\". why did we go here? because my first choice didn't open for another 45 minutes, we felt brio was less than medicore, and the other places in tivoli were sandwiches, crapes, or gringo mexican,  and not real fare for dinner.\n\nwe were greeted by a very nice hostess, who took us upstairs, and wanted to seat us near the kitchen. since the place was empty, i asked if we could be seated by the window. i was told t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> \"a table for four\". after i showed signs of leaving, she reluctantly seated us here.\n\nour waiter, jackson, started out okay, until we informed him we did not want any wine, and were not interested in alcoholic beverages. the \"air seemed to go out of his tires\", as we were not going to order items t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> the check and the corresponding tip.  after t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> seemed like we were \"branded\" as \"undesireables\".\n\ni told the waiter i was craving a large salad. he suggested the arrugala salad.\n\nmy wife ordered the <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark> and trenne pasta.\n\nthe <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark> was decent. better than w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> served at  the palm, and far better than w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> try to pass off at the yard house.\n\nmy wife's pasta and meat dish, was \"a cut above\" the speghetti factory. pasta was over cooked, and the accompanying ingridients, an after thought.\n\nmy salad was very disappointing. poor presentation, and very small portion. \nhad the waiter, jackson, said, the salads here are meant for appetiziers, i would have ordered something elese. \n\nwe also got a nasty stare, when we asked the food server for more bread. \n\nthe saving grace, was the manager, xavier. very polite and doing his best to please. when i complained the salad was not a satisfying meal, as the waiter told me it would be, he offered to take it off the check. since i had consumed it, i said t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> not be fair. \n\nhe also offered to have the chef, \"send something out\", but by then, the cold feeling we were left with by other staffers who looked at us like, \"you're not w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> want here\", left us feeling unwelcome. \n\nxavier is a good person, and tried to salvage the situation, by giving me his card, and telling me to contact him prior to coming back. i appreciated his thoughtfulness.\n\nagain, in all fairness, this place is noted for its meat, not salads and pasta, and my friend phillip, who i usually agree with, gives it a good rating. however, i was left with the impression t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> staff \"judges a book by its cover\".\n\nwe were not dressed in designer clothes, and didn't have t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> look when we walked in. the staff acted like we did not belong, and that's how we felt.\n\nmy wife might go back with her girl friends, but after getting the feeling t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> staff  was looking at me with the thought of, \"why don't you go back to the suncoast buffet where you belong?\", i am done with this place.", 
            "we sat outside... it was 104, but we asked before and they said the spritzers weren't up and running yet. we had a great view of the village. service was great! the staff welcomed us, our server was attentive and we had at least 5 people say good bye to us as we left. we ordered the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> and they were great...(and i <mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> mushrooms). we stopped in for brunch and it was a fine meal. i imagine if we had ordered the meat options it would have been better, but t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> may fault for ordering scrambled eggs at a steakhouse. bathrooms were clean with a <mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> salt scrub!!! good value and friendly staff :)", 
            "absolutely loved this place. from the moment we walked in we were greeted with wonderful service. we sat upstairs on the patio where they had just installed new misters for these hot vegas days. they even asked for our feedback on them, which was a nice personal touch. \n\nfood: <mark>Drunken Goat</mark> sandwich. yum. if i see the word brie, that's w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'m ordering. the sandwich had brie, goat cheese, thinly sliced apples, cranberry chutney, greens, and some sort of aioli (basil i believe), and came with the apple and fennell salad. all the flavors came together so well and it was absolutely delicious. portion was big but of course i ate the whole thing because it was great. they are known for their cauliflower which was delicious. it had a little heat to it from the peppers, but it really was the perfect amount of spice, and cooked perfectly. \n\nwe were celebrating a couple of special occasions which were recognized with some fabulous dessert, the turtle, and the berry/lemon. wow the salted caramel ice cream on the turtle was some of the best ice cream i have ever tasted.\n\nthank you nan for the great service, you made our experience an incredible one, and we will definitely be back to try more!", 
            "absolutely the best steakhouse in las vegas. but they're so much more, as they also have a full service butcher downstairs. \n\nservice was the absolute best i've had in vegas in 6 years. we were greeted by the manager who introduced himself and who the server would be, jackson. jackson probably could be a butcher himself with the extent of knowledge he possessed with the cuts and textures. very friendly and always offered an opinion on the best choices to make. \n\ni should also add the i drink a large amount of water. most places have a hard time keeping up with my refills. echo & rig appeared to have a dedicated busser/drink runner t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> disappointed. \n\nnot kidding when i say the service and good was top notch. \n\nfor the food, we had a rib eye cap (8oz), portabella fries, bone marrow asada. all of which were exquisite. let me put it this way, i will not waste my money on a steak from another place for as long as i love in las vegas. \n\nepic.", 
            "i have dined here twice now and i can easily say i am addicted. all of their steaks are from grass fed usda cattle and are fresh cut daily in the butcher shop downstairs. the menu offers a wide variety of cuts as well as daily specials t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> off the menu.  i highly recommend the filet, hanger, of the spencer steak.  the appetizers have never disappointed either.  my favorite from the appetizer menu had to be the lump <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark>, it is a single <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark>, but the flavor was amazing!  the filet chop salad was a must as well, it comes packed with steak and other cold cuts, and a bunch of different veggies for only around $10.  for a steak house of this quality, they prices are very fair. anywhere else in town i easily pay 2-3x the price for similar quality.  the staff is extremely friendly and on point. we were kindly greeted by the manager when we say down, who knew we were returning guests. our wait team never let my glass get half empty and they were constantly checking on us to ensure we had our needs met.  needless to say, go here for a nice date night for any occasion, you will not be disappointed.", 
            "my family and i thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant. we were celebrating my brothers birthday, and despite not having a reservation, they were able to accommodate our party of 7 adults and 4 kids with no problem. we sat on the terrace, which was quite lovely. the service was great! we are kind of an intimidating bunch, but the waiter did a great job of taking care of us. being italian, we order our own dishes, but immediately start passing around bites of everything when our food arrives. \n\nthe food:\napps/small plates\ngarlic shrimp - this was very tasty! the shrimp are swimming in a buttery garlicky concoction, which we enjoyed dipping our bread in after. \n\n<mark>Portobello Fries</mark> - these little buggers were addicting! none of us could decide if we loved them or not, but they went so fast, i have to say we did. \n\n<mark>1/2-inch Thick Grilled Bacon</mark> - not t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> feel there is anything left to say after bacon, but this was the highlight of the meal! despite having ordered 3 orders of the bacon, we opted for a 4th, and at the request of the pickiest eater at the table no less!\n\nmain courses\nst louis ribs - the rub on these things were to die for! there are several sauces t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> can dip it in, and each was delicious. \n\nshort rib <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> - phenomenal! \n\nfilet (bone out) - very well seasoned and cooked. this was the dish my youngest brother ordered. he ordered it medium well, and it came out more medium. he actually discovered t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> liked it better t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>. \n\nlamb chops - while delicious, my brother is a big boy, and the serving size was smaller t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> expected. \n\ndessert\nberry shortcake and caramel turtle - both desserts were top notch! \n\nall in all, a great night out. we would definitely return!",

            "this place gets a 5 star rating based off of the sheer value. rest assured, you will not leave this establishment hungry. i was part of a group of 6, and we were going to dinner to celebrate/mourn my departure from vegas after a month of visitation (my girlfriend lives here, and i'm on break from school). when we were seated we were greeted by one of the managers (i assume) who did an exemplary job of running through just about everything on the menu and w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> personal recommendations were. in addition, the waitress we had for the rest of the evening (her name was nina and was such a sweetheart) was very attentive and also very informative in regards to the cuts of steak and special bone-in options t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> available. +2 for knowledgeable wait staff. \n\nour group decided to split 7 appetizers, tapas-style before we each got our steaks. the highlights included grilled thick cut bacon with barbecue sauce, bone marrow carne asada (beef marrow bone garnished with carne asada, peppers, onions, and crostini...superb), sweetbreads with pickled cabbage, and butcher's sausage, and <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> with herb aioli (pretty much the best fried mushrooms you'll ever have). i'm aware that's pretty much 5 of the 7 appetizers, but they really were all t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>.\n\nthen came the steaks. as far as steakhouses go, i'm not very experienced. i got the rib eye with a green peppercorn sauce and though it was good, but not great. this is where the value comes in; the very reasonable price (35 dollars for ny strip, filet mignon, and rib eye cuts) makes it extremely hard to complain. my steak was also quite fatty (about 1/3 of the steak was gristle), but t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> to be somew<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> with a cut like rib eye. sides were also excellent (garlic mashed potatoes and broccolini). at the end of the meal, we were surprised by a complementary desert  of sea salt caramel ice cream and coffee from our waitress for the occasion. it was definitely appreciated.\n\nme and my girlfriend got our steaks and all the apps on our bill. total cost: 152 bucks....not bad at all for a relatively upscale establishment. totally 5 stars in my book, i would happily go back again.",

(medium rare). i had a lovely mushroom sauce to go with it.  the chips were light and crunchy with a nice garlic salt flavor, and the mushroom rocket fella was superb.  for texture eaters, this place is divine! the rocker fella consisted of a mushroom stuffed with bacon, crispy crumbs, and some type of filling. it was soft and crispy and crunchy... yum! my friend shared with me her cheesy garlic mashed potatoes, which were so soft and fluffy (as opposed to the usual starchy rough mashed potatoes at restaurants).\n\nto end, my friend was given her choice of a birthday sunday, and she chose the caramel turtle ice cream. the ice cream was rich and sweet, filled with candied nut morsels t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> absolutely wonderful.\n\nthe speed in which we got our food was fast! the attentiveness and teamwork of the staff was very impressive. if a waiter dropped a receipt, the manager immediately noticed and picked it up.  if a waiter didn't get bread to a table in a timely manner, another waiter would notice and tell him or do it for them.  everyone was friendly, helpful and attentive.  each time we needed more drink, or finished a plate, there was always someone there filling up our drinks, or taking away dirty dishes.\n\nthis was by far the best restaurant we went to in vegas.  the service was above and beyond, the price of the items were not bad at all, the food was outstanding with such mouth watering flavors and textures!  overall, the quality of this restaurant was impeccable! the ambience was also nice... modern decor and such a beautiful, classy, romantic atmosphere.",

            "i took my boyfriend here for his birthday. when we first arrived, i could barely get him to keep walking to the door as he admired all the fresh cuts of meat in the window. we had a reservation and were seated quickly. our water came out quickly as well; i chose flat, and my boyfriend chose the complimentary sparkling water. after this, the waiter took his time to come back and get our drink and appetizer orders. about fifteen minutes after our appetizer order was taken, a small loaf of bread finally came out. considering how long it had taken, i assumed the bread would be hot and fresh - but it was not. the drinks came a few minutes after; i felt they really took too long for a simple loaf of cold bread and a single cocktail.\n\nas appetizers we had the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> and <mark>Fried Spinach</mark> salad. in retrospect we probably shouldn't have had two fried things together, but t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> our fault not theirs! both appetizers were delicious and the flavors were well balanced. \n\nfor the main course, i ordered sides only as i am a vegetarian. i found they had fairly unique vegetable dishes; i didn't have to settle for a salad and baked potato like at a lot of steakhouses. i had a spicy cauliflower dish and black tuscan kale. both were excellent. my boyfriend ordered a medium ribeye and reported it was cooked perfectly.  we also shared the baked brie and sourdough with stone fruit; i really enjoyed this at first, but after it cooled the bread became tough and chewy. if you get this, make sure to eat it while it's fresh! \n\nthey brought out a complimentary caramel ice cream for the birthday boy. \n\noverall we had a great experience, but the service was slightly lacking. we both felt the initial wait for drinks and bread took too long. our waiter also seemed rushed and slightly inattentive. the busser enrique was constantly smiling and courteous; it's a little sad i remember his name but not the waiter's name! enrique certainly made more of a positive impression.   \n\noverall we gave the service 3 stars and the food 5 stars. the price was very reasonable. we will be back to try it again, but hope to have a different waiter!", 
            "in a word, \"meh.\". i honestly don't know w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> the hype's about with this place.  the food was decent, service was mediocre and the decor was not memorable.  we had the ribeye, lamb, <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>, acorn squash, etc.  it was all fine but i've had better elsewhere.  nothing made me want to come back.  it's a solid 3 stars for me.", 
            "wow. i don't know where to begin. well, here goes nothing. \n\nthe place is beautiful! in the heart of tivoli, it's the perfect date spot. there is a bar downstairs as well as a butcher / meat shop! reminds me of home. we sat down for dinner and we were greeted by last name  by our server. for a steakhouse, it is fairly priced! the small plates (appetizers) are larger than expected! the kale, <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>, and every other small plate were perfect. we had a bottle of tempranillo ($45) and it was amazing. our steaks came out in good time and cooked perfectly. i don't recommend using their sauces, because the meat is delicious. \n\ni visited twice within 4 days. if t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> anything. \n\noverall this place, the food, and it's staff were all 5 stars to me. will be back very soon!",

            "amazing service and we loved the outside balcony area. we had the cauliflower dish, which was amazing! the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> were really good, but very heavy, so perfect if you want to share amongst friends. the grilled octopus salad... well let's just say i still dream about it. the octopus was grilled to perfection- was not chewy at all. my favorite dish had to be the carne asada bone marrow- however, i have had it twice and they varied greatly on portion size. of course the steaks are w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> you go and they don't disappoint. they are cooked to perfection and melt in your mouth. we had the carmel turtle dessert which was also amazing... just when i thought i couldn't eat anymore i was eating this dessert. all in all, one of my favorite places off the strip!", 
            "we had a birthday part and i would not call this a steakhouse. the meat seems to be good quality but between the window and the plate there was a huge difference. for a place t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> there steaks the cook compleatly dried/burnt/ over cooked every single steak t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> out. the waiter had an ugly attitude and wouldnt stop sighing and shaking his head. there are no appetizers, i would greatly recomend to add t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> the menu...we ended up starting with some orders of sides, the cigars are awsome! \n\nthe only reason this is not a 1 star is the owner of the place seems to be a very nice man, came and sat in our table and told us a little about him and the place. second, the prices are fairly reasonable. \n\noverall, i dont think i would go again....might have been a one time glitch on many levels as i heard great stuff about these guys", 
            "let's begin with...\n\nsmall plates - although echo & rig is quite obviously a steakhouse, the menu has an eclectic, yet put-together feel. steak, salads, pasta dishes, did i say steak?, and small plates are found here. small plates have three price ranges. one could come here and simply eat off the small plates menu, or use the small plates menu to come along as sides with a steak. the variety is good, but not overwhelming. you can tell these items have been selected with the utmost care.\n\nbutcher's choice sausage - this sausage changes daily as noted by our incredibly helpful server, edward. when my friend and i dined it was a chicken sausage, within a pork casing, with a sweet tomato sauce, onions, and jalapenos. this sausage was quite possibly the best sausage i have ever eaten. cooked perfectly, with a snap to the outside, and a deep flavor without the \"taste\" of your normal run-of-the-mill grocery sausage (t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> is not good). \n\ncarne asada bone marrow - the sausage blew this small plate away. however, it was still good, presented beautifully, and a decent-sized portion (my friend and i shared). comes with onions.\n\nmoving on to main courses..\n\nas impressed as i was by the brilliant selection of steaks and the lesson the server gave us about each of the cuts i wanted to order more small plates, however, i was so mesmerized by the cuts of meat available i decided to have the hangar steak sandwich. this comes with roasted anaheim chiles, spinach, and preserved lemon chimichurri. i certainly picked a good dish as the steak was cooked to a velvety medium, the bread slightly <mark>Toast</mark>, and all the flavors melding together, plus a serving of crunchy potato chips.\n\nlastly, dessert. my friend and i chose a chocolate ice cream bowl t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> with candied pecan cookies, cherry gelee, and big, ripe, bourbon-soaked cherries, topped with w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> know was a freshly whipped-up whip cream. this little dessert was the perfect end to a perfect meal.\n\nother features... a decent wine listing with wines t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> and won't break your pocket book. service t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> immaculate, friendly, yet not too hoity-toity. our table was also visited by the manager of the night who was a very nice gentleman.\n\noverall i will absolutely return to echo & rig.", 
            "i was very impressed by this place. the food was absolutely delicious and the service was wonderful.  our steaks were cooked perfectly, and it was one of the best i have ever had. w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> it even better is the price. the steak doesn't cost $50 as it does as most steakhouses, it costs around $30. you cannot beat it.  i can't wait to go back and try other things.", 
            "i carelessly throw around the \"l-word\" & this review will not be spared its usage. \n\necho & rig was recommended by a family member who clearly knows great food & with confidance, i can now also vouch for e&r's deliciousness. \n\ni love love love t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> are over 30 \"small plates\" on the menu. grazing is my eating style, & if i weren't hell-bent on having filet, i would've ordered more than the superb portobello mushroom fries & herb aioli. tried a bite from his stack of thick-cut bacon w/ bbq sauce -- smokey, fatty, more like baked ham than bacon. \n\nlove love t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> get a (free!) sauce with your steak. his \"charred onion\" paired beautifully with his rib-eye cap, & my horseradish cream pick elevated an already lovely filet. say yes to their garlic mashed potatoes. \n\nand finally, love t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> service issue was immediately & professionally addressed. my filet arrived medium after we'd waited 40-minutes for our steaks. they whisked it away with sincere apologies, & the filet was returned well done as i had ordered. desserts & coffee (as if we could eat anymore!) were comped for our troubles (carmel turtle sundae is a must.) \n\nroom for improvement: though i love (lust) t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> pour ketel one, my cocktail, <mark>A Love Affair</mark>, delivered zero buzz, & tasted like a weak lemonade. \n\nprovided they don't make a habit of making customers endure excessive wait times for their steaks, e&r's extensive menu deserves a second look the next time we're in charming tivoli village.", 
            "we were going to be in the area so called and made reservations for a friday night. arrived and waited about 10 min, place was hella busy. the service was very good in spite of a full house, the manager even came over to introduce himself with a handshake, nice touch. the girls ordered drinks and both were tasty. for appetizers we tried the melted bree and the pork belly with grits. the bree was good, the pork belly was a home run. \nwifey had the rib eye cap and loved it. i tried the spencer steak and t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> great as well, our friend had the filet and she loved t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>. overall a great place, with only one complaint, it's just too goddamn loud. i know i'm being a bit old school, and i know it's \"trendy\" to have a place t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> industrial, but when you have to compete with shouting waiters and shouting people at the next table all trying to be heard, it's tough to want to return. with 3 cocktails and apps, dinner for 3 came out to $230 with tip. too much for a place t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> could not wait to get out of due to the noise level, other wise would be 5 stars, i guess i'm just not hip enough.",

            "another excellent meal here, came here with a huge group this time.  service is awesome as usual, very attentive and friendly from the host to the server.\n\nso to the food:\n\nbrussel sprouts - excellent tasting, the nice lemon flavor and crisp brussel sprouts.\n\ncauliflower with peppers - if you like a little spicy kick and cauliflower this is a good side dish.\n\nspicy sausage - not bad, not too spicy but good flavors.\n\n<mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark> - decent, not a huge <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark> fan but still good.\n\noctopus salad - octopus was a little dry t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> got, but the flavors were good. \n\nbone marrow carne asada -  awesome!  this is surprisingly really good.  the combination on top of a nice <mark>Toast</mark> bread.\n\npumpkin squash - a bit sweet, but i believe it's the sweetness of the squash.  like a small grilled pumpkin.\n\nportebello fries - excellent appetizer, great pick as usual.\n\npork belly grits - not bad, pretty unique tasting.\n\nstir fry kale - not bad, nothing t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> out.\n\nstuffed portebello - decent, but didn't stand out compared to the other stuff.\n\ntomahawk ribeye - pretty tasty, cooked pretty tender.  a great thing we did get with this is a selection of the sauces, you need to ask for it though.  7 sauces tonight.\n\nblack spaghetti - delicious!  still one of my favorite dishes here.  nice lemony flavors with the sun dried tomatoes and seafood mix.  highly recommended.", 
            "admittedly, i was leery of brunch at a steakhouse, but echo & rig was one of the better (non-vegas strip) brunches i can remember. fantastic service and affordable prices.\n\nbecause it was gorgeous october weather, my +1 and i sat outside to enjoy the sunshine. apparently prime brunch time in las vegas starts later than it does in san francisco. it was around 11 am and we were one of the few tables occupied. it makes sense, since nightlife in sin city doesn't really get going until 11 pm... guess t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> the locals sleep in a bit more? \n\nthere's an actual brunch menu, which has plenty of gourmet options to choose from. however, i was feeling adventurous and ordered a <mark>Drunken Goat</mark> sandwich (goat cheese, brie, herbs de provence, green apple) with a special request: a sunny side egg on top. it was the best of both worlds, the perfect midday meal. \n\nquite possibly the best part? our server let me order one blueberry pancake at half the price of the regular dish. if you asked a server the same thing in sf, they'd roll their eyes and make you feel stupid for even trying. one of the many differences between these two cities. vegas wins in the customer service department for sure!\n\nthe total bill for two people was less than $50, which was amazing. i forgot w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> costs outside of the expensive 7x7 confines of san francisco, too. so this is how the other half lives, huh? so jealous.\n\nworth the drive out to summerlin for sure. great food, nice view, free parking, and i appreciate our server accommodating my random requests.", 
            "located in a fancy strip mall, this place offers a superb level of service. having been in hospitality, i really appreciate the effort of higher service here. the hostess took my name and started calling my boyfriend mr. chan lol (also he is not asian so a little weird). however i appreciate the family environment they are trying to create. jay was our server who made the experience very pleasant- he was very informative, professional and not overbearing. it was brunch time so we tried the short rib hash, <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> and steak and fries. the short rib in the hash was killer tender and braised in house. the eggs were perfectly poached on top and drizzled over the perfectly sized potato cubes. this dish is obviously highlighted for a reason. the steak and fries were overly salted but was quickly fixed and perfected on the second serving. the best part of the wait was a complimentary tomato salad t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> the palate while the steak was grilling. the chef didn't want only one person eating at the table- very nice touch. to make the experience even better, the manager, xavier, sent out a salted caramel sundae t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> heavenly. who eats a sundae after brunch? anyone t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> served this sundae in particular. i will definitely be back for a dinner the next time i'm back in town. thanks echo and rig :)", 
            "man, oh man. i ate dinner here last wednesday (before thursday) with my family and i am so pleased we made t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>. first, this place is beautiful but classy with a sweeping staircase taking you from the large and well provisioned bar to the dining room upstairs. having heard the volume can be somew<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> and wanting a more intimate experience, we asked for the terrace. even though it is outside, the heaters were great! it was the perfect balance of being able to look over the beautiful tivoli and feel warm too. on to the service; it was perfect. we were given the \"spiel\" and the wine we brought was opened (with no corkage fee!!) and poured like we had just gotten the most expensive wine on the menu. after we ordered, it was like the water and wine fairy just kept our glasses filled without us even noticing. the food was also <mark>Stella</mark>, especially the pork belly and grits, the bacon and the brussels sprouts. we each had a different steak and they were all cooked perfectly and had lots of flavor which was just enhanced by the little sauces they serve on the side. overall, a great experience and i will be stopping by every time i am in vegas from now on.", 
            "went here for a friend's birthday on our trip in vegas. it is located in a very upscale mall about 15 minutes from the strip. we had a big group of 9 people and were seated outside t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> warm heaters on.\n\nlike many yelpers say, the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> were heavenly and also the pork belly was glorious as well. it does take awhile for the main steak to come out, so make sure to grab one of these appetizers to munch on. by the time we got the steak, we were already starting to get full, so it was quite a challenge to finish our steaks.\n\ni really want to emphasize on the excellent quality of service echo and rig provides for the customers. we were checked by the floor manager numerous times and every servers treated us like vips every time they came by. they certainly provide better service than most high-end restaurants without charging too much for the food.\n\nif you want to experience w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> service is for a reasonable price, go check out this place!", 
            "5 stars for service but 4 stars for food. \n\nok, overall i loved this place. i really appreciate a good ambiance and this was definitely a good one. \n\ni ordered the skirt steak. you get to pick a sauce (or 2 or 3) and i chose the red wine demi. the steak was done perfect and the sauce was phenomenal. the only thing i didn't really love was the steak was very sweet on its own. it must have been the marinade t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> on the steak. paired with the red wine demi, it was way too sweet, and i like sweet. so i ended up opting for the bernaise sauce because for the most part, it cut the sweetness. \n\nwe got <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> and calamari for an appetizer and those were both done perfectly. \n\nwe also received a free sundae of our choice for our moms birthday, it was a very nice dessert for being complimentary. \n\nthe service is great. she checked on us just enough times t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> wasn't overwhelming but it wasn't too sparse. our drinks were always full and they always offer more bread and butter. \n\ni would definitely go back but might try a different steak t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> wouldn't have t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> marinade.", 
            "we made a reservation and still had to wait 45 minutes. the decor is lovely and fancy and loved the meat porn glass display. we ended up getting drinks at the bar but waiting t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> with a reservation is ridiculous. why bother making one if you're going to wait? we ordered our food. it took another 30-40 minutes. the food was delicious (ribeye, portabella fries, butterfish) but i don't know if i would return somewhere you have to wait a really long time for a reservation and food brought to you. my friend went on a previous occasion and had to wait an hour for their food. i would probably give it five stars if it wasn't for the long wait.", 
            "outstanding!!!\nthis really is one of the best off the strip steak houses in the city! \n\nservice is impeccable! really.... impeccable!!!!\nour server, jason, was knowledgable, detailed, attentive without being overwhelming.\nhe helped guide our dinner choices in a wonderful direction!\n\n\nthe food:\npork belly and portabello fries were both delicious appetizers!\npork belly was my favorite though... this is a must!!! creamy dreamy grits with the super flavorful pork belly... yum!\nsouthern <mark>Southern-Fried Chicken Salad</mark>, was okay, nothing super special. flavors are good, a  little dry. i wish i had tried the over the rainbow salad...\nmy husband and i shared the 46 ounce tomahawk, garlic cheddar mashed potatoes, asparagus w/ fried egg, and kennebec french fries.\n\nman...i wish i had took pics!!!!\n\nthe presentation was amazing... but nothing in comparison to the taste!\nthe steak was perfect. medium rare... flavorful... served sliced, perfect for sharing!

            "one of my favorite restaurants!  have been here more times t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> can count on my fingers! the service and food is above and beyond superb. one server in particular always remembers us, i feel bad bec i can't remember his name but every time he serves us it's always awesome. always have to get the over the rainbow salad, pork belly and grits and <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> just to name a few. the spencer steak and the sea bass are so good. you can't go wrong with w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> entree you decide on. love the view sitting out on the patio too.", 
            "a good steakhouse in the 'burbs is rare, so echo and rig can easily lay claim to being one of the best. located in the perennially empty tivoli village, the modern, open two-story space features a butcher shop and bar on the first level and the main dining room and patio on the second. \n\nthe menu is dominated by appetizers and small plates. the best of the bunch might be the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> ($9.80) with their crispy, crunchy fried exterior. if you like fried foods, try the lamb cigars ($8.10) too. a thin, crispy egg roll-like wrapper covers a savory lamb mixture and is accompanied by a tzatziki sauce. less successful was an excessively oily gratin ($5.90) full of caramelized onions, roasted pumpkin squash, sage and gruyere. you may want to avoid the steak tartare ($8.10) as well. not only is it the least appetizing looking dish there, the mushy texture made it doubly unappealing. \n\ncraving a salad? they've got some good ones, like a kale salad ($8) with baby yellow beets, <mark>Toast</mark> hazelnuts, goat cheese and a citrus vinaigrette. if you want one with a little more substance the arugula salad comes with plenty of prosciutto and is large enough for two to share.\n\nas for main entrees, the spencer steak ($27.70) is a solid choice. it's a prime grade, center cut rib eye t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> a modest amount of charring and a savoriness t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> enhanced by their mushroom sauce -- a rich and earthy accompaniment t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> their other complimentary sauces.\n\nbrussels sprouts are all the rage these days, and their version ($8.10) was enhanced with pistachios t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> a nice crunch and salinity to the dish. even better was a grilled summer corn ($5.90) dish showcasing a char and smokiness t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> me of eating corn on the cob straight from the grill, but without the mess or random kernels stuck in between my teeth.\n\nnot to be overlooked is their <mark>Butcher Blend Burger</mark> ($12.40) - a great savory and juicy blend of chuck and brisket. topped with lettuce, tomato, red onions, and the optional sharp cheddar cheese, it's a simple burger that's well proportioned and executed beautifully.\n\nthey don't have a kid's menu, but were happy to strip down their <mark>Roasted Chicken</mark> sandwich ($12) to accommodate my son's tastes -- chicken and cheese on ciabatta.\n\nprices are reasonable for their location and while it's on the higher end of the spectrum of w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> may want to pay off strip, the solid and safe menu makes it a sure bet for most diners.", 
            "the first time we came here we were rather disappointed. we were told they don't take reservations but t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> in around 6 we should be ok and not have much of a wait. well, t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> totally wrong. we ended up waiting for over an hour for a table and were stressed out because we had people coming over to celebrate my husband's birthday and didn't know if we'd make it home in time. the frustrating part was t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> were told it would be a 45 minute wait and it ended up being closer to an hour and a half! and they didn't do a good job letting us know w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> going on. the meal itself was good but not exceptional. \n\nwe have been many times since for their happy hour which is really great. $2 steak & eggs, $2 shrimp cocktail & $1 hot dogs. plus they have drink specials. the other really nice thing is t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> have no corkage fee so you can bring your own wine :-)",

            "a local's gem!  we love this place and have never been disappointed in the food.  all the tapas,  as sides or appetizers,  are amazing.   their steaks are yummy and the staff knowledgeable and conscientious.  kudos to their cocktail program,  too.  every cocktail i've tried (i think 6-7 different ones) have been top notch creations.  being a meat and potato girl,  i can't believe t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> favorite dish here is actually the horseradish crusted butterfish.   it's delicious!!  try the ribeye cap and be sure to ask for\nthe upstairs patio for the best experience.\njust know t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> don't usually mean you'll be seated at t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>.   it always seems to be a wait,  no matter w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>.",

            "the environment is friendly and professional.  the manager comes over to meet first time guests, and the food is fresh and delicious. the only downfall i would say is t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> server didn't check back in a timely fashion. i would let this one point overcloud all of the great things.", 
            "i said i'd give them another chance, i did, and it warrants a new review and additional star.\n\nmy visit was for brunch again and this experience was much better. i didn't have a reservation this time, but the hostess was very enthusiastic about seating us and gave us a 15-minute wait (we received a table within this time frame, however, we were not given an option to sit outside). \n\n<mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> benedict ($17): smoked wild salmon, poached eggs, cr\\u00e8me fra\\u00eeche, red onion, saut\\u00e9ed spinach, and hollandaise sauce on <mark>Potato Pancakes</mark>. the elements of this dish were good, but there were issues. the spinach was a tad salty and the flavor managed to overpower the salmon. the menu says 'saut\\u00e9ed greens,' so they may serve something besides spinach t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> complement the salmon more? we really didn't like the spinach with the <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark>. so, i just ate them separately. the hollandaise was fantastic. the <mark>Potato Pancakes</mark> were all right. it seemed like they were just piles of hash brown. also, i'm not sure w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>, but i didn't see any cr\\u00e8me fra\\u00eeche or red onion..?\n\nshort rib hash ($15): prime short rib, yukon gold potatoes, bell peppers, shallots, herbs, two poached eggs, and smoked paprika hollandaise sauce. great hash! w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> it was the delicious hollandaise with the smoked paprika - it added nice flavor. the diced potatoes were perfect and the short rib was very tender.\n\nwe had some small plates as well and they were really wonderful. i highly recommend ordering them and i'd love to try the others during another visit.\n\n<mark>Portobello Fries</mark> ($9) with a herb a\\u00efoli. if you fell in love with these fries at bottega louie in l.a., you'll be thrilled t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> have them in vegas now! i love the large cuts of portobello, the light and flavorful batter, and the great a\\u00efoli t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> it all together. yum!\n\n<mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark> ($9) served with red pepper coulis and lime wedge. this is one of the best <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark> i've had and i loved the coulis with it. the cake has a light cornmeal exterior and large chucks of crab meat. great flavors. you'll wish there was more than one cake per order!\n\nthe 1/2-inch <mark>1/2-inch Thick Grilled Bacon</mark> ($8) is amazing. it comes with a housemade bbq sauce and trust me, you don't need it! the bacon has the best of both worlds - smoking and grilling. the two flavors mend together to make a really tasty piece of meat.\n\nservice was great, as it was last time. waters refilled frequently and many check-ups from our server. we had a great time. also, the food was delicious and satisfying. i certainly enjoy this spot for brunch for its atmosphere and fun sharing dishes. i'd love to dine on the outdoor patio. perhaps i'll even brave another steak and/or dinner in the future.\n\nside note: the '<mark>Steak Frites</mark>' is now served with new york strip rather than ribeye (online menu does not reflect this change yet). i'm not a fan of ny strip, however, it may be a better fit for this particular dish seeing t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> did not enjoy the ribeye i was served during my previous visit.", 
            "great spot for fine dining off the strip.  i've had dinner or lunch here multiple times, and the food is fantastic.  great steaks, the spicy cauliflower side is excellent, and the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> made my mom and i get into an argument over who got the last one.  the sandwiches at lunch can tend to be greasy, but they are delicious (especially the <mark>Drunken Goat</mark>).\n\nbut, the restaurant is not my favorite thing about this place.  the butcher shop is.  we come here to get all of our steaks.  the butchers are so nice, helpful, and friendly.  they make some excellent rillette if you can catch it before it sells out!  the steaks are high quality, and not much more expensive than buying them at the grocery store.\n\none other note: we have ordered thanksgiving to-go twice from them, and it is convenient, fast, and delicious.  i like how everything is ready to go for you, but you still get the \"thanksgiving smell\" like you've been cooking all day when you stick the bird in the oven to fully cook it.\n\ni took off a star for some small things t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> me, but may not bother others: i'm not a big fan of their cocktail list (but i like their wine list), the restaurant tends to get very loud (so i always sit on the patio when able), and sometimes i feel like we have 6 waiters because so many people come to the table to take orders and say hello (it's a bit overbearing for me, but i bet some people like all the service).", 
            "absolutely great dinning experience, both times i went with friends....in the same day, for brunch and dinner!\n\ni have been meaning to try this place out for a long time and it did not disappoint. brunch was absolutely delicious (had the <mark>Steakhouse Scramble</mark>) which i mean who can go wrong with filet in their eggs? a side of the watermelon tomato salad and the duck duck goose as my drink sealed the deal. not to forget about the desserts. wow. on a consensus both of my friends and i decided we were going back for dinner. \n\nfor dinner we shared small plates and a steak and it was not only delicious but just enough to save room for, um, more desserts. \n\nfood aside, the staff truly loves this restaurant and w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> do. everyone was incredibly nice and enjoyable to converse with. from being in the industry before, i have never seen such a passion and dedication to the food and service anywhere else. \n\ngoing back again this weekend, t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> explain it.", 
            "i have been to echo and rig 3 times and each time the service was exceptional.  this last time, however, ricky and xavier made us feel like royalty.  we were sat originally near a door but xavier thoughtfully offered to move us somewhere less drafty.  we decided a corner table on the patio under a heat lamp would be the most comfortable.  \n\nricky, our server, was very knowledgable on the menu and wine selection.  i am a server as well and i'll be honest.  i learned a thing or two from him.  we started with the pork belly which was out of this world.  for the main course my date went with ricky's recommendation, the spencer steak.  she found it delicious but we both agreed my lamb chops were the best dish of the night.  we were both so impressed with the lamb t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> put my knife and fork down and dove in with my hands.  we finished the night off with the shortcake and <mark>Cappuccino</mark>.  \n\nthanks again ricky and xavier!", 
            "one of the best  restaurant experiences you can have here. the best part is t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'s the kind of place t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> can frequent over and over without breaking the bank. we stayed out at summerlin for one night and decided to hang out the rest of the day so we could go back the next.  if they ever open in henderson we'll be regulars but until then we will probably have to keep venturing over to the west side.\n\nfood and service is top notch, and it's clearly not just any steak house. the chef varies the menu items to keep it interesting. starting with the bread - obviously baked in a wood oven, steaks are cooked to perfection, so was the fish i had.  very interesting and innovative sides they definitely take some chances here.\n\nthen there is the no corkage fee thing. oh my.... can they make it much better? when we arrived with our wines they brought out a decanter, and a cooler. t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> of service usually only happens in michelin star restaurants, and it is much appreciated. \n\nat any rate- we walk out with a smile every time, thanks.", 
            "love this place.  the quality of the steaks here is better than some of the well known steak houses on the strip, and nearly half the price.  i usually get the filet mignon which is around $35 and it easily beats out places like prime t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> $60+ .  the side dishes are excellent as well.  the service is phenomenal and professional.  this is my go too steak place to take people to in the neighborhood", 
            "yep - a fan. (thanks yelp for making the quickie comments easy!)\n\nonly one visit so far but will happily go back. the service as a whole was <mark>Stella</mark>, hostesses, sommelier - fab. our server specifically - could have been better. when dining on christmas eve...all is forgiven. \n\nmade resos three days before..thanks for accommodating us! \n\nthree diners this outing, we ordered for starters - <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> (great), pork belly, w/grits (ehh?) - maybe the menu should have said the reverse, w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> delivered was way more grits/polenta - so, this is how i think of this side. and mac & cheese - should have moved this to come with our main.\n\n*i was wrangled in :( on my ordering of sides..\n\nfor din din - broccolini with garlic and mashied potatios (mash pots - for the needy) both decent. \n\nour party of  our three, we ordered two caps and i ordered the strip. \nsteaks are \"wood grilled\" - okay, probably more char and a tiny bit more well done t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> would usually have, just listen to your server, t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> are here for. - my strip was good at medium rare, the caps (swanky butchers cut), was good. cap was better t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> at the restaurant, my leftover strip was better the next day (as leftovers, just saying!) \n\nhappily go back, hope this local endevour makes it - real output, real delivery. \n\nthe take home bags while extremely fancy, the bags themselves, reminds you..w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> have actually paid for, glamour, in packaging, but certainly worth the visit - happier experience, good, happy family, happy me.", 
            "from the food to the service, this place is amazing. this is the only restaurant t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> left t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> of impression on me. our waiter (i missed his name because i went to the restroom lol) was very helpful and explain the whole menu to us. it was our first time, so it's nice when they take the time to explain the menu rather than say \"everything is good here\". for our starters, we had the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>-which is how i want my fries from now on, steak tartare-so yummy!, and the bone marrow carne asada-best one i've had! for our entrees, i had the spencer steak and it was cooked perfectly! i couldn't finish it all, but i wish i did. \n\none of the things t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> stood out to me was the service. our waiter was very helpful and really sweet. the manager, sam was very attentive. i went with my boyfriend and his friend, both of them are le cordon bleu graduates, and when his friend asked about possibly staging there, sam actually went and asked rather than just brushing it aside. we even met the butcher i believe and he talked to us during our meal! \n\ni would definitely be coming back again. this restaurant is doing everything right.", 
            "i love meat. seriously. \nhence, it's no surprise t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> absolutely loved echo & rig :)\nsteaks here are top notch. amazing quality beef t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> cooked perfectly. i had the spencer steak medium and it was perfectly cooked with pink all the way thru. it was large enough i got to take home leftovers (and the steak was equally good the next day).\n\nbut not only was the steak great....the service was attentive and friendly, decor was elegant but understated, and they have this awesome hand-scrub-thingy in the restroom!!! you have to check it out, ladies ;)\n\ni had a great experience dining here with a group for a bday, and i will definitely return to try different steaks, and t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> <mark>Southern-Fried Chicken Salad</mark>...\n\nmuch like any other steakhouse, sides are extra, but sharable. it's a nice restaurant for either a date night or a large gathering :)", 
            "i've been drooling over the menu for quite some time- there's literally nothing on it i would not eat, all a matter of pacing to eventually get through all of it. the meats are obviously the highlight, but the rest of the dishes are done fairly well too. i especially appreciate the small plates setup, as that's how i prefer to order my meals.\n\nbone marrow carne asada: can we have a moment of silence for this dish? it was a spectacular start to our evening, my only wish is for more. loved the slight char to the crostini, the marinated red onions added the perfect acidity to cut through the fat.\ncauliflower, chili de arbol, crispy shallots & onions: such a great combination of flavors, but the toppings don't really stick to the cauliflower making it a bit difficult to actually enjoy the dish as intended. advise cooking the cauliflower a bit softer.\nbrussels sprouts, pistachio & fresh lemon: i love sprouts but didn't care for them in this dish, bf enjoyed them though. seemed under seasoned to me.\ntexas slow-smoked brisket, white grits & braised greens: thick-cut, smoked to deliciousness, brisket with a delightful barbecue sauce and some really great parmesan and garlic grits. really enjoyed the kale and onions. would order again! \ncaramel turtle sundae: salted caramel ice cream topped with peanut brittle pieces, bourbon sauce, bittersweet chocolate chunks, and whipped cream. an upscale take on a classic chocolate-and-caramel ice cream treat, beyond indulgent to begin with and also an enormous portion. loved the texture t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> brittle added.\n\nservice was on point, starting with an introduction by the owner and continuing with luke throughout the evening. sat on the heated balcony with a great view of the tivoli village fountain and the full moon in the sky, classy and romantic ambiance. \nwill be back to try more of the menu and update accordingly.", 
            "this place is a gem! an amazing destination for steaks and seafood. i've dined here 3 times and each time, everything has been impeccable. my first time was for lunch, and i am surprised the inside was packed during lunch time. but don't let t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> you, they also have a very cozy patio area with heaters if you want to go al fresco. \n\non the next 2 occasions, we made reservations because we had a large party of 8 and we were whisked right in. servers are always very courteous with plenty of recommendations if you ask. in these trips, i have tried a crazy array of their food and all of it is amazing! for appetizers, you have to get the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>. they are the best fries (potatoes and other vegetables included) t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> have ever eaten. i dream about these babies and would come here just to eat 3 orders of fries and leave (don't judge me). \n\nother noteworthy mentions include the spinach salad (not healthy, <mark>Fried Spinach</mark>, but the texture of it is incredible) and brussel sprouts. wow. their brussel sprouts are so tasty with each leaf peeled off individually and a lemony tang and crunch from pistachios. they are a must-have to offset all the protein you're about to ingest.\n\nfor proteins, we've had the filet, spencer, rib-eye, skirt, brisket, salmon, and butterfish. each protein is cooked perfectly to your request and the quality of the meats are obvious. there is no chewy stuff you have to cut off and pile onto the side of your plate. knives cut through everything in one foul stroke. although the sign of a good steak is not needing to have any condiments, they have the best condiments if you want to shake it up. i personally love the chimichurri and horseradish. lastly, it was my first time trying butterfish this week from echo & rig, and let me tell you t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> is my new favorite fish. if you're not in the mood for steak, get the butterfish!!\n\ntheir dessert menu is simple with everything being ice cream. i would like more variety, but will not complain because i still love t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> turtle sundae. if you haven't been in awhile, go back. they have added many new signature items in their menu. if you're a vegetarian, don't be afraid to come here. there are so many vegetarian and vegan options on the menu t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> will leave stuffed and happy. i love echo & rig and think it is an amazing gem in suburban las vegas with the perfect price point and atmosphere. don't even think about going to the <mark>Chai</mark> steakhouse down the street when you can be receiving great quality for the same price.", 
            "we had a dreadful experience at echo & rig.   i made a reservation because we were coming for a special occasion. i was dressed in my best suit and tie. we arrived on time at 5:30pm on friday evening.  we walked in just as another couple arrived and i opened the door for them and let them in first.  they were immediately seated even though they did not have a reservation.  after they were seated, i gave the hostess our name and was told t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> table would be available in a short time.  after about ten more minutes, two other couples came in without reservations.  the first was seated immediately while we were still standing there.  about five minutes later, the hostess approached the second couple and called them by our name.  they replied t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was not their name.  nevertheless, the hostess took them to w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> should have been our table.  i finally went up to explain t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> were still waiting and t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> had called the previous couple by our name and obviously had made a mistake.  the hostess acted very aggravated and snapped at me to stand away from the hostess station and our table would be ready shortly.  for the next several minutes, the hostess and the two ladies t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> there to seat guests talked with each other about personal things entirely unrelated to the restaurant.  after another seven minutes, our special occasion seemed ruined and i was wondering if we should just leave rather than spend a hundred dollars on a dinner t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> we would likely not enjoy.  the hostess realized t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> were looking at the door and finally came up and said she would seat us.  the dining room is upstairs so t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> cannot see it while you are waiting.  when we arrived at the top of the stairs, we were shocked to see t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> dining room was almost empty except for the couples t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> arrived with us or after us and who had now ordered and were eating their meals.  the couple whom the hostess had called by our name was seated at a wonderful table near the back corner along the window.  nevertheless, several desirable tables were still available in the quieter back and along the window and we hoped to be seated at one so t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> could try to resurrect our evening.  however, we were seated at the worst table in the restaurant right next to the cash register nearest to the kitchen door and right in the waiter traffic as far away from the window as you could be in the dining room.  my wife knew i was not happy and shyly asked if we could sit at another table.  the hostess became very upset and curtly said to my wife, \"well why don't you just pick your own table\" and refused to make any suggestion with us standing there wondering w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> do.  we finally went over and sat down at a table by the window as a manager walked up.  he did not say anything to us, but instead walked away with the hostess while she rolled her eyes and snickered to him out loud about us all the way across the restaurant.  at this point, we really could not stay and have a meal.  we walked over to the hostess and the manager and said t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> felt it was best if we just left.  neither the manager nor the hostess made any attempt to apologize or respond.  instead, they just raised their eyebrows, rolled their eyes, and stood there without saying a word.  so we left.  in over forty years of eating in fine restaurants in las vegas, this is the worst experience we have ever had.",

            "after seated on the patio we weren't quite sure who our server. a man in a suit came by a couple times but didn't introduce himself as our server so we were alittle confused. he ended up taking our order and gave us a tiny wine tasting so we could figure out w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> we wanted. \nafter a good 20 minutes our server finally came by. i think he was the only server on the patio cause he was backed up beyond belief, even other tables were complaining.\nthe guy t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> up taking care of us, alpheus (coolest name ever, like a greek god) was outstanding. some if the best customer service we've ever had. even the hostess arianna was great (which is always an awesome surprise haha) \n\nfood was outstanding!\nwe had;\nlamb cigars- tzatziki sauce was refreshing and very light\npork belly- fell apart in your mouth, full flavor\nthick cut bacon with homemade bbq- highly recommend \ncauliflower- light appetizer but bursting with spice!\nbrussel sprouts with pistachios- light and subtle flavor with alittle crunch\nskirt steak- carmelized with brown sugar, very juicy and full flavor\nbavette steak- popular european steak, similar to a rib cap cut. not as tender as a rib cap but full of flavor\n\nwash everything down with a bottle of malbec! yum!!",

            "one of the best things about this place is the pricing compared to steakhouses on the on the strip. its also a great place in t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'s a steakhouse but it also has other items, great for couples where one enjoys a good steak and the other is less of a carnivore!\n\nthe service was great and the hostess immediately asked if it was our first time or if we were celebrating something special. yes to the first, no to the second. but t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was clearly passed on, as our waited and a manager-type both acknowledged t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> had not been in before and took the time to explain the menu/food/ect. so there is a long line of communication going on between employees and that's a good thing. \n\nnow to the food: \n\nshort-rib <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> - order it! just do it. it comes with thick bread, egg battered and then grilled with tender, savory short-rib meat, gruyere cheese and white cheddar. it's savory, flavorful and filling. \n\nribeye - i'm not much of a steak eater, but i enjoyed the seasoning and flavors of this steak and the way it was cooked. \n\ngarlic chips - come with each entree and are the classic home-made style of kettle cooked potato chips. they are salty and garlicky and good. \n\nmac and cheese - pretty standard. creamy with breadcrumbs on the top. not the best mac and cheese you've ever had, but still good. \n\nbrocillini - pretty basic, but good. \n\nlamb cigars - almost like an eggroll, but with lamb filling. unique but worth trying. i could have done with out the wrapping and just had the strips of meat, but the eggroll aspect did give it a unique flavor and style t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> haven't had before. \n\nbaked brie - i'd probably skip next time. i love cheeses but this brie did not have much flavor and the bread was over cooked. just wasn't my favorite. \n\neach of those items plus a bottle of wine and the bill was about $150 which is a nice price when you compare it to w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> would pay at a steakhouse on the strip. the menu is large enough t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> could go back several times and never order the same thing. the service was great, food was high quality and well prepared and the atmosphere was nice.",

(i do like salt so i still devoured my steak). it was a thinner cut of ribeye than w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'m used to at restaurants, but for the deal you're getting it for it doesn't come as a surprise. my only advice would be to order rarer than you'd like. i like mine medium but because of it's thickness it came out closer to medium well. the steak also came out with homemade chips which was different to see paired with steak but nonetheless delicious. \n\ni was telling one of my coworkers who had also tried out echo & rig about how i thought their steak was a little salty and she thought t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> strange because she thought her steak could have used a little more flavor! different chefs? different cuts possibly? \n\ngood price for good quality meat, they just have to master t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> seasoning ;)",

(no one wants to go to a place if it's not the happenin spot in town) and this is it! the manager xavier met us for the first time and it felt like we knew each other for years. he is a great asset to my new favorite rest. our server jason was very informative and paid attention to every detail. even the young man t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> maintaining our table was superior.   i have dined all over the world and this was literally one of the best meals from top to bottom i have ever had. to the owner, you should be very proud of your establishment. \nplease try this place out and i guarantee, you will  not be disappointed. \njust ask for xavier!!", 
            "i went to sw steakhouse at the wynn last night ( i will post a review shortly) and echo & rig was so much better, i felt i owed it to them to post a review. \nfirst, it has been a long time since i have received service like we did at e&r. the hostess was very polite and friendly, but at the time i just assumed she was bubbly. little did i know t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> entire staff was going to be t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>. although it was packed, our waiter came over taking drink orders and introducing himself. water and bread were there immediately. the manager came over, introduced himself, thanked us for coming, and told us to let him know if we needed anything. and the service didn't stop. suffice it to say the waiter and bus people were as attentive as any, without bothering us--meaning they kept an eye on us to make sure we didn't need anything, and to get it if we did.\nfor starters, we my wife had baked brie. it was delicious. i had <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark>. they were good; my wife thought they were some of the best she's had. we also shared an order of <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>--they were addicting. definitely get them. my wife had the butterfish for her entr\\u00e9e. she thought it was going to be like sea bass, very flaky and buttery, but thought it was much closer to halibut in taste and texture. she enjoyed it, thought it was prepared perfectly, but was expecting something else-not e&r's fault. i had rib-eye cap which was great and cooked perfectly. we also had broccolini--very tasty--and garlic mashed potatoes--just right. for dessert we had ice cream t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> as good as any you will have anywhere. \nfinally, the manager returned, thanked us again, gave us his card, and told us to call if we ever need anything. it really felt like an old style vegas gourmet room where they treat everybody like a high roller. it was awesome.",

            "w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> pleasant surprise.  i've been to echo & rig only once, but the overall experience will undoubtedly keep me coming back.  \n\nfor starters, the service is excellent, from the host to the asst. gm.  the staff is not only friendly, but passionate about their food.  the dishes we selected on our own were good, but the dishes t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> recommended to us were exceptional.  another important attribute, the prices are reasonable for w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> produce.  \n\non to the meal:\nthe restaurant offers complimentary purified still or sparkling water.  this is a nice touch, one i wish more restaurants would adopt.\n\n<mark>Portobello Fries</mark> & herb aioli\nthey call this one of their signature dishes and it was the first item t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> recommended to us.  we were not let down, the fries were delicious. they're not too greasy/heavy and the aioli is a perfect accompaniment.  \n\nsteak tartare\ni love a good steak tartare and echo and rig deliver a great version.  the dish is well balanced and the <mark>Toast</mark> bread is a good vessel to deliver the meat with just the right amount of crunch.  the caper/beef combo is so delicious.  \n\nbrussels sprouts, pistachio & fresh lemon\nthis was probably the most basic item we ordered, but t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> no way is a criticism.  in comparison to other dishes, the flavors were simple, which i often welcome in a vegetable dish.  great crisp in the leaves, just the right amount of citrus.\n\n<mark>Fried Spinach</mark>\nwe were about to order the arugula salad, but knowing we were open to recommendations, the server steered us towards the <mark>Fried Spinach</mark>.  this is one of my favorite dishes of the night.  flash frying the spinach, gave it a kale-chip like texture.   throw in the chile-lime vinaigrette and thinly-sliced red onions and you have harmony on a plate.  the vinaigrette was almost sweet, but just the right amount to play off the spinach and onions.  bravo.\n\ncauliflower, chili de arbol, crispy shallots & onions\nanother impressive and inventive dish.  the cauliflower almost tasted candied.  there were so many layers of flavor and texture, i'm not sure i can do a technical description any justice.  \n\nthe spencer steak\nthis was an excellent cut of meat.  cooked to perfection, the steak was tender and smokey (they say their steaks are cooked over red oak).  we sampled three of the steak sauces - charred onion, red wine demi and brandied mushroom, which i liked in t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>.  i didn't always taste the garlic in their garlic-chips, but they were tasty nonetheless. the mushroom rockefeller was so good.  \n\ndessert - caramel turtle\nanother staff pick, the salted-caramel sundae topped with peanut brittle, whipped cream, bourbon sauce, etc. was quite good.  their dessert menu is entirely sundaes or an option for seasonal berries and sorbet.  \n\n\non top of everything, the restaurant contains a full bar and wait for it...  a butcher shop!  i don't know about you, but this is exciting for me.  it's a very smart concept and one t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> adds to the culture of the restaurant.  on my next visit, i'll likely take home some cuts of meat and wood (assuming it's red oak), for my home bbq.  \n\ni look forward to returning to try some of the other dishes t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was simply too full to order.", 
            "ambiance: 5 - this place is pretty fancy. it was nice from the bottom to the top. you walk from a curved staircase at the bottom into the eating area located at the top. it's fairly romantic inside at night, and everyone is either dressed fancy or in their casual, yet appropriate sunday clothes. \n\ni would suggest this for an intimate date night. 3rd or 4th date, maybe? it's a \"will you be my girl?\" or a \"fancy some dinner after work, dear?\" kinda place. \n\nservice: 5 - like i have said many times before, no one knows service like summerlin does. this place is just excellent. the servers basically treat you like you are the only table they have. he was quick and efficient, except at the end, where he took a while to get us our check. it was just so refreshing to have amazing service for once. probably the best service i have received at a restaurant in my life. \n\nfood: 2 - we ordered the spencer steak, the rib-eye cap, calamari, <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>,  <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark>, and pork belly. \n\ni thought my spencer steak and pork belly was a little dry. the pork was definitely overcooked and a bit hard. i don't know if it was just t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>, but i was pretty disappointed..it just wasn't as great as i thought it would be. \n\nthe best thing i had t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>. don't let the rest of the review fool you. the fries were really good. they should have given me two! <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> for life!!", 
            "i'll admit, when my friend suggested we go here for dinner, i wasn't too excited. i've only been a few times before, and i had only \"ok\" experiences. nothing bad, nothing great. i hadn't remembered the food being good enough to return. well, i was proven wrong last night. \n\nmade a reservation for 10 people, when we arrived the hostess greeted us, made sure to see who the person the reservation was made under, and then c<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> with us as we made our way up the stairs. she asked is we had dined here before, i said yes. just as we had sat down, the manager came over and asked \"ms. t.....\" (he said my last name wrong, but i'll let him slide, he was cute) and then thanked me for returning. i thought this was pretty a nice gesture. i asked if they removed a drink off the menu t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> had here before called the <mark>Hot Mess</mark> (it's delicious by the way, if you like jalepe\\u00f1o type drinks) and he said they would still be able to make it (another bonus). \n\nonto the food. i started out with the lamb cigars. these were so good, i could've eaten a few more rounds and called it a night. but i didn't, i ordered the horseradish crusted butterfish. i had never had butterfish before (from w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> can recall) this was delicious. so moist and flavorful and the potato au gratin was served almost like al dente, it was different than any way id had them before. most of my friends had ordered steak, and they all finished their plates clean. \n\nservice and food really made up for my previous visits. i will for sure return again.", 
            "our first visit to e&r was about a year ago for my wife's birthday, and it was very disappointing overall. the food was decent enough, even for the price, but the service was horrible. it took over 3 hours to have dinner due to waiting, order issues and having one of the worst waiters you could possibly imagine. but i refrained from ever finishing my review and decided to give them another shot. it took a while, but we came back and chose a sunday to check out their pretty highly praised brunch.\n\nright off the bat, things were starting out way better than our first visit, and was quite possibly some of the best service i've ever gotten. we walked in at about 10:30am, the hostess took our name and got us seated in less then 10 minutes. they were able to get us a nice seat on the patio and just moments after being sat down we were greeted by the manager, who knew our names. shortly after that, our waiter (who also had our names by the way) came to take our drink order. he asked if we'd dined at e&r before, and when we told him only for dinner, he went through the brunch menu and explained some of their most popular items. during our whole brunch, every person who came to our table knew our name and were as friendly as could be. it was very impressive and a complete 180 from prior experience, but then the food came...\n\nas per the waiters suggestion, i ordered one of their signature dishes, the short rib hash. for $15 you get a healthy portion of short rib, finely diced potatoes and veggies, poached eggs and a smoked paprika hollandaise sauce. w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> the dish so disappointing was the fact t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> of it seemed to have sat under a heater or something for too long. basically half of the plate was excellent...the short ribs were moist and tender, the potatoes had a nice little crisp to them, and the egg was poached perfectly. then i got to the other half of the dish. all the meat was dry and crispy, and the egg was way overcooked. it was nearing hard boiled egg, complete with a cooked yoke. for me, those things combined just through the dish way off and was such a major let down compared to the other half i'd just eaten. \n\nwe also ordered a side of their thick cut bacon, which rings in at $8. they bring out a nice stack of <mark>1/2-inch Thick Grilled Bacon</mark> served with a side of bbq dipping sauce. this bacon is definitely thick, and has a nice charred flavor and texture from the grill. it was fatty, tender and even though i'm not a huge bbq sauce fan, it complimented the overall flavor nicely. it's something i'd definitely order again.\n\nfor w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> & rig is, their inconsistency issue are crazy. we had a great steak with terrible service once, and then came back to less then <mark>Stella</mark> food, but impeccable service. obviously this restaurant is a bit on the \"higher end\", but if you're going to charge $15 for a breakfast hash, you better be able to properly poach an egg. i can only speak for myself, but half a decent dish and a tasty side of bacon certainly isn't going to get me to come back alone. and because we had such a bad experience during dinner, i'm not so sure a 3rd visit for any meal would be a charm.", 
            "went here for brunch one saturday afternoon. my waiter was nice but when it got busy, he stopped being attentive.  my short rib hash was cold and terrible.  i will say t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> ice tea was delicious.  overall, i'm sad the food wasn't good. the place is so beautiful.", 
            "so funny story... my husband and i travel to las vegas frequently and were recommended to have dinner at echo and rig. as i was eating the delicious portabello fries, i realized t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> had had them before in la (my home town). so i stated - out loud - these fries are just like the fries at bottega louie (my fave restaurant in la)! then the waiter says, it's the same owner! what. i honestly wasn't expecting that... especially in a different state!!! anyway dinner was amazing. i will be back for sure.", 
            "this was an amazing culinary experience.  i do recommend to everyone to enjoy the great food and amazing desserts.  but i do have some constructive criticism.  i only have 4 complaints.  the ambiance was incredible but i could barely hear my waiter.  i got the duck duck goose mixed cocktail.  amazing and refreshing but i got to different looking drinks... a little inconsistent.  i also witnessed a waiter cursing at other staff members.  a little inappropriate with costumers all around and finally, im not trying to nit pick but i had sparkling water and my wife had still.  without asking a helping waiter poured still water into my half full glass.  my wife and i will certainly return but hope we can have t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> night t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> have mentioned before us previously.", 
            "i didn't enjoy our first time there as much as our second. last night was our second, and i must say...\n\nservice from sam was on point. he was magnificent. \n\n54 oz tomahawk was delicious. sauces were yummy. favorites are the creamed horseradish and red wine demi. \n\n<mark>Portobello Fries</mark>, like the first time, were delicious. grilled corn & fresh marjoram. mmmmmmm. pork belly was good, but w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> yall do with the skin?! it was missing. \n\ngrilled octopus. t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> just ok. \n\nwill come back again. i won't write about our first time for brunch though. forgive and forget. \n\nbut thank you sam for incredible service!", 
            "all i can say is wow!!! the second visit was even better than the first. first time around they were out of the <mark>1/2-inch Thick Grilled Bacon</mark> t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> were dying to try and the service was okay. this time around derek made our experience more than memorable! being a transplant from florida he was more than experienced in recognizing the customers desire for a good meal and service required to keep us coming back. my husband and i are not flashy or well to do by any means, but we were treated as paying customers t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> worth the time which was extremely appreciated!\n\nwe had the <mark>1/2-inch Thick Grilled Bacon</mark> with barbecue sauce which was very yummy, but the sauce was taken away right before our last savory bite. the black and white salad was a perfect combination of intriguing yet comforting appetizer. my husband had the crusted butterfish t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> perfectly cooked and complimented with perfectly tasting parsnip. i had the rib eye cap which was flavorful all by itself but even more tasty with the blue cheese sauce, which was not overpowering as it can sometimes be! i would have eaten the entire piece but some was a little more rare than medium. we were also treated (on the house), to cauliflower which i have never eaten in my life but would definitely order again!\n\ni saved room for a couple of bites of the caramel turtle dessert, which was sweet but not too sweet! definitely loved by my husband who left maybe a bite. highly recommended by us vegas locals and we will definitely be back for more!\n\nneedless to say t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> highly recommend echo & rig for locals, tourists and anyone looking for a pleasant dining experience without all the uptight snobby persona. real good food for real people, for half the price of the strip!", 
            "the outside of our tomahawk steak was burnt and the inside undercooked. the outside crust was not done right and the service was subpar with our server non attentive and even a bit passive aggressive. perhaps it was because my partner and i were dressed casually in a tee shirt and jeans but with the bill hovering around $160 i still expected good service.\n\nthe fried calamari is dismissible and not fried crispy. the bacon is delicious however and i would recommend their <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>. it's just disappointing t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> steak was cooked wrong and rather tasteless. perhaps it was the thickness of the cut, but it's still surprising considering that's their main offering. will likely not be coming back or recommending others to dine here. the venue and bathrooms are nice though.", 
            "i've been here twice, and had an excellent experience both times! food was good, and you can bring wine with no corkage fee. w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was most impressed with though, was the experience. the staff really works together to make sure t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> need is met, and i left both times feeling like a million bucks. i can't wait to go back!", 
            "this rave review is only for the butcher shop. i have yet to experience the restaurant.  \n\ni purchased 2 whole chickens (cut up), 3 pounds of bacon, a pack of sweet italian sausage and a quart of beef bone broth. \n\ni am thoroughly impressed. the butcher t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> working at the counter was very very helpful. i had a few questions, and he was more than happy to help. he had no problem separating the chickens i purchased and even threw in the bones. (chicken bone broth!)\n\ni have already eaten some of the chicken, along with a bit of the bacon. it tasted fresh and tender. obviously the cooking method plays a role, but the quality of the meat was amazing. the bacon was flavorful and delicious. a great addition to my brussel sprouts. \n\nanyway, i will be back regularly. if anything, to just to grab reasonably priced pasture raised meat. i feel great about my purchase and i am so glad i found this place!", 
            "nice steakhouse off the strip. staff is very friendly. food was good, but average. nothing memorable. not bad but not great. i would give it another chance, being t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'ve only been there once.", 
            "summerlin is starting to overflow with yummy brunch spots! echo and rig is a high quality butcher and great dinner/brunch spot. \n1. if you have a dog, ask the butcher for marrow bones. your dog will love you for this. \n2. i had always wanted to make pulled pork and the butcher was kind of enough to butcher a pig for me and write out very detailed instructions for an upcoming dinner party t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> out to be a culinary success. \n3. order the short ribs on their brunch menu. it never disappoints.", 
            "i still can't get over w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> great experience we had at echo and rig restaurant last friday evening. we planned our wedding reception for the restaurant, and everything ran like a well oiled machine. i wanted an off-strip restaurant t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> be \"where the locals would go for a nice dinner,\" and i was not disappointed.  i could not have chosen a better location for our reception. \n\nthe staff were friendly, gracious, and ever-accommodating, making menu recommendations, and working tirelessly to ensure t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> 10 of us were satisfied (even the toddlers!) throughout the meal. i have to give a special shout out to our server, brian. he was friendly, knowledgeable, and did a fantastic job with everything. \n\nin terms of the review of the food, we started with the small plates - the knockout items were the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>, the ricotta and figs, and cauliflower. other really good ones were the squash and the macaroni and cheese. \n\nfor the mains, the texas brisket was one the best t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'ve ever had. i also loved t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> took the time to explain to us the origin on the spencer steak. several people in our party ordered it, and it was fantastic. just the right size, and cooked to perfection for everyone at the table (no small feat!). even the vegetarians in our midst were satisfied; with all the small plate offerings t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> vegetarian, in addition to the salads (the over the rainbow was great!), everyone was happy. the salad was so big, t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was shared! as the person who paid for it, i also have to say, the pricing is extremely reasonable, with options at a variety of price ranges for everyone. \n\ni'm sad to say t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> our wedding cake, we did not get to indulge in the e&r specialty ice cream sundaes, but i'm hoping t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> time (there will be a next time) we will be able to make sure t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>. we can't wait to recommend this spot to everyone, and come back again!\n\n#echoandrig #echo&rig #parmieuxadventures #restaurantreviews", 
            "a wonderful place!  i took my family there to celebrate my husbands birthday saturday evening.  we had reservations t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> ended up changing about 10 times throughout the course of the day (sorry guys) as everyone was getting prettied up and the party of people was increasing as well.  however, they were always very flexible and accommodating which was nice.  we finally made it there, 15 minutes late for our reservation.  still, nice and accommodating!  we were seated after about a 5 minute wait and although it was late evening saturday, and two of our party were stragglers, we didn't feel rushed.  the food was excellent!  my husband had steak and i stuck with the lamb.  the kids had w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> have, sandwiches but they seemed satisfied.  our guests enjoyed lasagna and we loved the appetizers and the variety as well.  the manager personally comes out to introduce himself and our server was wonderful as well.  we appreciate feeling like celebrities when dining out for special occasions.  it makes the experience t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> nicer.  thank you!\n\np.s.  i say not good for kids because although there were sandwiches and items such as t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> the menu, some kids are funny about bread types and such- therefore i would recommend for adults.", 
            "i just created a yelp account for the sole purpose of raving about this restaurant. i would give it 6 stars if i could. \n\nfirst of all, the ambiance was beautiful. all of the dining tables are upstairs where you have the choice of eating inside or outside on the patio. we chose outside and every single table had a beautiful view of the giant fountain below with pretty lights hanging tastefully to give it the right mood. and to top it all off, they have their own private butchery downstairs where you can buy all the meats they cook at a very reasonable price. \n\nnow, my fianc\\u00e9 and i both worked many years in the fine dining restaurant service industry in south florida, and those of you who are \"in the biz\" know we have unreasonably high standards when it comes to service in a restaurant because we're fully aware of w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> best of the best constitutes. well, with t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> mind, the service staff at echo & rig completely surpassed my unreasonably high expectations. arriiana (who, if you read on, is already yelp-famous) was so cute and friendly; she just set a great mood for the rest of the dining experience. as soon as we sat, we were welcomed by xavier, the manager, who was extremely likable and helped to make sure we were taken care of the entire night. also, w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> out to me and impressed me the most about xavier is that (because i'm overly observant) he made sure to be a friendly, helpful presence to not only us, but every single table in t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>! i watched as he seemed to effortlessly make a connection with every table while at the same time having great synergy with his staff, which shows a true understanding of w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> is. \n\nnot only that, but the service staff was obviously trained very well. we had sam as our server, who was friendly and very knowledgable of the menu.  sam was also t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> balance of attentive but not overbearing. we never got the feeling of being ignored or pushed out of our table, which can often time ruin your experience. we will definitely be asking for sam again.  \n\nnow for the food! (sorry this is so long, but if you're like me, these details are important when you're looking to try out a new restaurant)\n\ni wanna start out by saying everything we ordered was beyond delicious. i felt like i was a judge on the season finale of top chef and the chef contestants were making it impossible for me the choose a winner. \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> and baked brie for starters. my fianc\\u00e9 ordered the bavette cut steak and i ordered the skirt steak. we shared a side of broccolini and garlic mashed potatoes and then shared the caramel turtle ice cream for dessert. \n\n...i'm going to have a hard time not ordering t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> combination of food every time we dine here because it was so amazingly good. \n\nit's safe to say this is my new favorite restaurant!!", 
            "this is, by far, the best restaurant for locals in las vegas. with its chic and welcoming ambiance, an incredible staff, and out-of-this world food, nothing beats echo & rig. \n\nthe restaurant itself is gorgeous, and just flat out cool. the butcher downstairs is an immediate indicator t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> restaurant is different, and augments its already urban and unique vibe. if you ever want to cook steak at home, buy your steaks here! they are less expensive (and way more delicious!) than those from whole foods. \n\nbesides the amazing food, the best part of echo & rig by far is the staff. every server we have ever had was kind, friendly, knowledgeable, and welcoming. xavier, the manager, has gone out of his way every single time we have visited to make us feel t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> were taken care of. there is not a single restaurant in vegas, including all of those on the strip, t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> better service. \n\nand now, the food! echo & rig's menu is t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> combination where you have plenty to pick from, but the concept feels connected. everything is to die for, but i especially recommend the <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark>! it is the best one i've ever had. \n\nall in all, echo & rig is an incredible restaurant and has done great things for summerlin. i couldn't recommend it more!",

            "hospitality here is amazing! really memorable experience, and the food was excellent.  the location is a few miles off the strip which is great, because it gives you a chance to drive out and forget you're in one of the most touristy destination places in the western world.  it's a newly developed plaza, so it may not show up on older gps maps as i found out.  better to use your phone instead.  \n\nso you pull up to this sprawling italian influenced shopping center, tivoli village, complete with huge center fountain.  the restaurant is prominently located at the entrance across from a popular italian restaurant and sports bar, near the fountain.  there is plenty of free parking if you don't want to valet.  when you enter echo & rig, it looks like an upscale butcher's, with fresh meat and <mark>Sausage</mark> on display.  the hostess is extremely friendly, and got to know our party a little before selecting our table (where we were from, if it was our first time, etc).  they had tables out on the patio and a larger, beautiful dining area inside, next to the kitchen.  we sat inside, which was perfect.\n\nthe hostess took us upstairs via the elevator although there is a winding grand staircase, and she really makes us feel at home.  once seated, we were greeted by i think the m'aitre d, derrick, who welcomes us and thanks us for coming.  our waiter, raoul, then walked us through the menu and the specialty items, going through the ala carte menu as well which you can also order as appetizers.  there are so many small tapa like items to order, we got the lamb cigars and <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark> which i highly recommend.  the small dishes range from $6, $8, and $10.  i also ordered a baked potato, which wasn't on the menu (although there is a baked sweet potato) but they happily made anyway t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> with the steak.\n\nfor the main entrees, they have surprisingly a large variety of choices besides steaks.  there's several chicken dishes, seafood, pork, and even duck.  of course, they are known as a steak house and their choice of cuts is superb.  i got the rib eye cap (the best part of the ribeye) and was not disappointed.  each entree came with homemade chips and potato cakes.  every cut is, i believe, 10 ounces and was plenty big.  grilled to perfection too, of course.\n\nyou can't go here without noticing the excellent service and modern technology implemented.  derrick who i think is the m'aitre d again came out to c<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> us after our appetizers came out to make sure everything was to our satisfaction and asked if there was anything we needed.  i ordered a beer and then less than a minute later someone from downstairs comes up and delivers my beer.  how did t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> so fast?  also, we noticed t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> were a couple of people with ipads just walking around making sure and double checking t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was being done, which was somew<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>.  the level of communication and service here was extraordinary and worth another visit just to observe!  \n\nfinally, the gm of the restaurant came out to visit after the meal to invite us back and make sure everything was exceptional, which it was.  he even mentioned t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> were planning to open another echo & rig in los angeles by next year and t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> owner already owned a popular italian steakhouse in dtla, botega louie which i now want to try.  we were too full for dessert, but i would have to assume it would have been awesome.",

            "food is excellent, service is fantastic. the restaurant is beautiful, especially dining on the upstairs patio. go support this local, chef owned restaurant. the only comment i have to make is t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> is definitely not '$$'. this restaurant should be classified as $$$.", 
            "great staff, service and meal!  from a strangers recommendation to come with your own bottle for the best steak in vegas, we have decided tis true..     we started off with pork belly asian infused slaw appetizer t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> so tasty and finished off with a well done ribey cap cooked perfectly the first time....   this was a finisher to our elvis wedding renewal of or vows in vegas!!!", 
            "this is for dinner service, never been here for brunch.\n\none of the best valued steakhouses around. service is always top notch, the hostesses are nice and make small talk while taking you to your seat, and the managers always make a point to stop by and say hello. it's nice to have an establishment pay attention to little details like that. most servers are pretty awesome, there are a couple who really try to upsell you on different things - we just ask not to be seated in their section. \n\nwe love rib cap, and echo and rig is one of the few places t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> this cut in town (and for such a great price!!).  we have received our steaks overcooked a couple times, and they are always quick to re-fire a new one and bring it out asap (derrick, one of the managers, even boxed an overcooked one up for us to take home once, talk about superb service). we've only tried the steaks, so i can't say anything about the entrees. you can't go wrong with any of the cuts. the appetizers are generally pretty tasty, too. i love the baked brie in the garlic-butter brushed sourdough. it's perfect with the gooey cheese and tangy fruit compote on the buttery <mark>Toast</mark> bread. if in the mood for charcuterie, they do have one available and they make all the meats in house. it's not on the dinner menu, so you'll have to ask for it. (i wish they would add some cheese!) \n\ni'm a sucker for a great hendricks martini, and i promise you the bartender (i'm sorry i don't know your name) makes one of the best ones in town.  i've been all over looking for a good martini and places like picasso, sw, mandarin bar, olives, other mama etc etc don't even stack up. \n\nno corkage fee, and we take full advantage. we've even stopped by total wine a couple times before dinner to grab a bottle (just call me a lush).  don't forget to scrub your hands with the divine salt scrub in the restrooms too!\n\nmore like 4.5 - minus points for the couple of pushy servers and sometimes inconsistent meat temps.", 
            "it has been a few months since we at here so my memory may have faded. we arrived for our reservation early and i got a beer at the bar. bar staff was friendly and attentive. our hostess checked us in as we waited for friends and we were seated right away when our party was full. one of our party had a bad experience before and the staff remembered him so our service was remarkable. i got the pork belly spicy slaw as an app t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> shared at the table. i was impressed with the tangy, salty bite. i can say t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> can not go wrong with the new pork belly trend going on the dining world. my main meal was the spencer steak, a form of ribeye cut t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> not quite the size a a bone in but fortunately not as pricey but just as filling. from my past reviews you know how i can be about a steak i can do better at home. this i could not do better. perfectly cooked melt in your mouth tender. you must try this as an alternative to a big ribeye. the staff brought us lamb cigars as an app on them. i like these with the tzatziki dipping sauce a tangy bite to start your appetite going. we also had the salt and pepper fries which to me were not impressive. we did not eat many of those and in hindsight should not have ordered as we were getting pretty full. wife has the filet tenderloin with garlic mashed & white cheddar. steak was nicely cooked and the taters were on par with any upscale steakhouse. over all our dinner was good and lived up to reviews i have read. the atmosphere is open and it rather loud. hard to have a good conversation. i will eat here again and will recommend you try it. staff was on point and drinks filled on the regular.",

            "this was our first visit to echo & rig.  w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> this place worth a 5 star rating?  was our experience flawless?  no, however there were many factors t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> it worth 5 stars & a high recommendation for you to try & share your experience.  from the outside you see w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> to be an upscale establishment with a combination of a butcher shop.  you walk in & to the left you will find the hostess stand & beyond t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> bar with average seating but limited table seating.  to the right is just t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> butcher shop which allows you to look at a variety of meats you will have a choice of upstairs or to take home.  lets go back outside to where it says on the window, where they proudly display they serve grass fed beef,  free range chicken,  natural, all the key words one likes to hear.\n\nwe were greeted by the hostess who took us upstairs to the restaurant area.  as you go up the stairs you cannot help noticing the amazing chandelier & then it opens into a large marble floor area with several tables throughout & a balcony area with several tables.  the balcony was full so we elected to be seated inside.  it is kind of strange but this is vegas, it can get loud in there like a cafeteria, but the ambiance is high quality even though you see some who respect that & others in shorts & jeans, vegas...however, once you look at the prices, this is right up there in ambiance with the best of the best on the strip with the exception of the price, it is beyond reasonable.\n\nxavier the manager came over & introduced himself as soon as we were seated, introduced himself & welcomed us.  our server alpheus was one of the best we have had in this town, personable, knowledgeable & takes a lot of pride in his knowledge of food which he does have.    so lets get down to food....\n\nthe menu takes a little time to cover & has a lot of choices.  if you want they will bring you a plate with all the cuts so you can make your choice t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>.   we decided to start with the arugula salad & the tomato, cucumber, watermelon & red onion.  the arugula which came with pear & prociutto was really good but could have used more seasoning or dressing.  it was still very fresh & good.  the watermelon plate they use a red wine vinegar which was refreshing but it lacked the pop factor.  adding salt made it better however some fresh balsamic would have put this dish over the top.\n\nwe decided to split the ribeye which at $34 you wonder w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> are going to get.  this ribeye was prepared, seasoned & tasted better then anything else we have had in this town.  w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> had, the quality, the taste you will normally pay upwards of $60 or more.  the ability of the butcher shop allow them to serve amazing steaks at an even more amazing price.  i have paid 3 times as much & have not enjoyed it as much as w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> have here.\n\nwe also ordered brussel sprouts, pistachio & fresh lemon, as well as cauliflower, chili de arbol.  the cauliflower was amazing, the brussel sprouts lacked flavor.   they were not roasted & soft but had a lot of crunch to them.   the server asked our thoughts on the meal & when we shared we felt they missed the mark on the sprouts, he told us to wait & brought us a side of bacon with a bbq sauce t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> the sprouts dish over the top.  this is w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was lacking.\n\nnormally i do not do dessert however our serves felt it necessary to insist we have one on the house since they missed the mark on the sprouts.  he brought a carmel turtle sunday which was out of this world.  much appreciated but really was not necessary.\n\nlastly, they have an extensive wine list here but they do not charge a cork fee so if you desire to bring something in with you, they will gladly serve you.  echo & rig is amazing and if you have not tried them, give them a try.  if you have tried them & had a bad experience, go back & share your last experience with xavier, he takes a lot of pride & personal desire to ensure everyone has an amazing eperience.  you cannot please everyone but he will certainly try.  this is a place we will go back to & bring friends with.", 
            "straight hit, no miss.\n\nlocated in the tivoli center off of rampart and alta, this meat house could not be in a better spot. vallet is right outside, the butcher shop next door, and a beautiful shopping center to browse around. this is a 2 story restaurant with balcony seating upstairs.\n\nthis was a belated wedding dinner from our lovely maid of honor and best man aurora and michael, and i admit  a great choice. we walked in and was greeted by 4 hostess. already reserved for a 6-oclock dinner, our table was well and ready upstairs  by their huge windows. perfectly spaced tables, medium  low ambiance lighting, and uptempo music set the mood to the room. servers were on their toes being attentive to their tables always on the move. mellow fast paced. \n\nproud to say t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was the perfect server. aurora and michael got us a (nothing bundt cakes) wedding cake, and for no charge ramon took it to the kitchen where it was kept for us until dinner ended. ramon also gave us the 101 on all their different types of meat cuts and boy did we get a full run down.  \n\nw<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>:\nfrom the steakhouse cuts\n2 rib-eyes 1 medium well (mike), 1 medium rare (for me)\n1 rib-eye cap medium rare (wife)\n1 horseradish crusted butterfish\n\nsides/appetizers:\nasparagus & fried egg\nfried calamari\n<mark>Portobello Fries</mark> & herb aioli\nbone marrow carne asada\n\ncalamari, bone marrow, and fried portebello fries were served to us first. oh my, the fries. who would have thought t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> make a good fry. served with w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> like a avacado sauce, this app. was amazingly tasty. the marrow, mmmm mm mmmmm! the starters so far have set a great tone. \n\ntables cleaned after apps. were finished. new plates were set, new cutlery for the steaks, and yup, dinner is served. \n\n\"do you see the size of these asparagus?\" thick, perfectly grilled/seared, with a perfect sunny side up egg to blanket them. the rib-eye nicely rubbed, served with house chips and a side stuffed portabello. at this point my shirt was soaked from all the drool coming from my watery mouth. lol.... the first cut into the rib-eye was buttery, and red just like i ordered, and t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> bite, oh my! the kitchen had to put me in the freezer after i melted onto their floor. it was t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>. in fact the moment of silence throughout our table spoke for itself as to how good the food was. their house chips by the way is \"a maze zing!!\".  all i can say is, i asked for a side of ranch/buttermilk, and this is the first time i eliminated a full rib-eye, side , and its flaky friends without having to dip. \n\nfamily + great food + ramon + awesome service = 5 stars\n\nneed to get your caveman on? this is your place.", 
            "i wish i could give it a 4.5 out of 5, because it wasn't absolutely flawless, but it was still pretty great in almost every way. i would highly recommend this place.\n\nmy boyfriend and i went to dinner at 9 pm on tuesday night, and although we were there two hours before closing, we were still one of two tables inside. the patio seemed decently full though. upon sitting down, the manager jason came by to welcome us back as we had dined their before and basically thank us for choosing echo & rig. after jason leaves, our server arrives and goes over the menu. we ordered a caesar salad to start, a glass of wine and flat water. \n\ncaesar was very good, our server even split it for us instead of us having to share the same plate. the dressing is very rich, but none the less, still good. \n\nafter our app is cleared, we order our dinner. i ordered the filet (medium), and my boyfriend orders the ribeye, medium as well. as for sides, we ordered the black tuscan kale and the macaroni and cheese.\n\nmy only real issue t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was our steaks. my steak arrives, it's cooked perfectly. it's definitely a more sad piece of filet, as there was a tendon running through it, but it was cooked perfectly and flavored amazing. ultimately, i give the filet a 4.5 out of 5.\nmy boyfriend's ribeye, completely well. nowhere near medium. maybe near medium well, and that's generous. however, our server was more than willing (and it didn't seemed bothered or annoyed) to send his ribeye back to get it recooked.  a short time later, his steak arrives, cooked basically perfect. we were happy. we enjoyed our dinner as the sides were amazing. the macaroni and cheese is gooey and great, and the tuscan kale is my favorite side dish in this city.\n\nwhen the dessert menu is presented, the manager stops by one more time and informs us t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was on the house due to the mistake with the steak. we were absolutely thrilled. not only did the replace the steak promptly, but they really went above and beyond to make sure our experience was exceptional despite the hiccup. \n\nultimately, i think this is a great more fairly priced steakhouse. it's not the upscale steakhouse where the atmosphere is stuffy. at 35 dollars for a 7 oz filet you can't be mad at all. sides are priced fairly, and portions are good. they have a gorgeous patio that's great for these nice summer nights, and it's great to get away from the strip. i would definitely recommend, and i will be back!", 
            "3 and 1/2 stars. almost 4. great atmosphere. upper level balcony over looks to tivoli. great service. nice sour fresh lemonade. spencer 8 oz. center cut steak was tender med rare but a bit smoky for my taste. broccolini side was good. chips t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> with steak were not bad. enjoyed the arugula pear prosciutto salad was nice. sea bass wasn't bad but not as light as i typically like. very good carmel turtle desert w salted caramel ice cream. the berry shortcake was very good also. would come just to get dessert. i would give this place 4 stars as there is a lot to like but i also felt for the price point i would expect more out of a place where you're likely to spend 75 or more easily.", 
            "we had our son's 30th birthday at echo & rig...by far the best dinner experience we have ever had.  when deciding where to have it, we went and talked to the manager, cheryl and the head chef sam.  they made us feel so comfortable there and felt good having 17 of our friends and family join us.  let me start with the food....amazing!  their appetizers were really different from other places and i can't even describe how good it was.  my steak came out a bit too cooked and they immediately took it back and with minutes had a perfectly cooked steak in front of me.  the steaks were superb and melted in your mouth.  now for the customer service....if this rating had 10 stars, this would be 10 star status.  ricky, our waiter and his crew were on everything!  we had a group of people behind us t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> a bit loud, without even mentioning it to ricky, he brought us out some horderves for the inconvenience t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> out of this world.  \nhands down, the best restaurant i have ever been to!  best dining experience.  we will drive to vegas just to dine at echo & rig!  \nthank you to the staff at echo and rig for making our sons birthday really special...", 
            "been here three times and all three times i really enjoyed it. first time, mainly because i was with my two awesome girlfriends i have not seen in years and we always manage to order the best dishes together and have a blast. \n\nother two times were with my man and the dog and well.. i could be eating a frozen chicken drumstick in an nyc subway stop and have the most awesomest time ever. \n\nother than great company, the food is also pretty good. i love a good off the strip steakhouse.\n\nthey used to have this gazpacho t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> just ridiculous. it's off of the menu now. i recently \ne-mailed the gm asking for the recipe and they gave it to us! my love and i had an amazing time preparing it at home. got loaded on some first class whites and enjoyed this amazing, cold and crisp treat. just perfect. thank you guys so so much!! i made two gallons of it, probably. gazpacho for days, people.\n\nthe <mark>Fried Spinach</mark> salad is pretty amazing. great texture paired with tangy and sweet asian vinaigrette.\n\nthe grits and pork belly is just amazing. my steak was as pretty damn good too. everything was lovely except the ceviche.... interesting flavor, off putting color. did not care for it, but only because i was craving the traditional chopped shrimp, onion, cilantro, lime situation. \n\nsit on the patio, the evening and nightfall are great :-)", 
            "dinner was awesome, my second time here. service was great. rib eye was yummy and cooked medium just the way i like it. it was hard to decide which sauce i wanted to try, luckily the waiter brought out all 6 so t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> can try all of it. i think the mushroom sauce was my favorite.", 
            "after having echo and rig's sunday brunch bookmarked for long time i finally got the opportunity to visit to celebrate my 3 year wedding anniversary.  reservations for a 12:30 brunch was easy (thank you open table).  all of the staff was wonderful and welcoming.  we were seated inside right away next to the window overlooking tivoli village and were given the choice of complementary sparking or flat water.  the space was open and not too noisy.\n\nnow about the food:\n\nportobello mushroom fries - probably the highlight of our meal.  this dish was jam packed full of flavor and perfectly battered and fried.  it went amazingly well with the aioli dipping sauce.  this is a definite must if you visit.\n\n<mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> benedict - one of the more expensive brunch menu items, but oh so worth it.  the eggs were perfectly poached and i loved t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> came with a potato pancake instead of the usual english muffin. <mark>Smoked Salmon</mark> and healthy portion of spinach were great as well.  it was filling and tasty and i would recommend it to others \n\nsteak scramble - this dish was unfortunately disappointing.  the server said it was one of the two most popular dishes (the other was the short rib hash).  the portion was smaller than expected and flavor wise it just couldn't keep up with the other dishes.  \n\nsince we were celebrating our anniversary we were given a complementary dessert and we choose the chocolate cherry sundae. it was such a nice treat and such a sweet way to end our meal.\n\nit was a lovely restaurant and i hope to be back in the future to try more of the menu.", 
            "i love echo & rig so much it's almost hard for me to put into words. this is absolutely the best steakhouse off the strip. you can't beat the food, the service, or the atmosphere. the restaurant is just so beautiful...this place is really amazing.\n\ni've been here for dinner and for brunch - both are spectacular. my first echo & rig experience was dinner - my husband and i came to celebrate our anniversary and they made it really special for us. champagne upon seating and the salted caramel sundae after dinner were really nice touches! our server explained the menu in detail and brought out the different cuts of meat for the day so we could choose. we started with a caesar salad which was fresh and delicious, and for our entree, we ended up doing a tomahawk ribeye for two with roasted garlic mashed potatoes with white cheddar (on the side was this mushroom gravy...it was the most delicious gravy i've ever tasted), and macaroni and cheese. easily the best dinner i've ever had in las vegas! they have an awesome wine list and we had a malbec - delicious and the perfect complement to dinner. the staff t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> us was awesome and couldn't have been more accommodating - nicholas, jared, and jay m., you guys rock and made our anniversary so special. we just moved and didn't want to do a big trip for our anniversary so we kept it low-key...to have such awesome service, food, and wine made it a really unforgettable night.\n\nsince then, i've enjoyed brunch once at echo & rig and it was also amazing. i went with friends and we sat outside to enjoy a beautiful day - their balcony is so beautiful. my friends had breakfast and i chose lunch - i had the <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> with short ribs, gruyere, white cheddar & parmesan. it was the best <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> ever! if you're feeling something super indulgent, get that. i can't remember our server's name, but beth, the manager came out to say hi and she was amazing. \n\ni can't wait to come back to echo & rig. definitely recommend for brunch, dinner, date night, or a special occasion...w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> it is, they will make it memorable.", 
            "love echo and rig. this is our go-to place for a nice relaxing dinner or a weekend brunch. we have been for every meal - including happy hour. the upstairs features an indoor dining room as well as a large balcony area with plenty of seating - and heaters when it's cool. the staff is so friendly and helpful and always going above and beyond for the guests. \n\nwe have gone to echo and rig with kids before, but it's not really a restaurant t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> too kid friendly. the atmosphere is laid back and quiet and kids usually get bored pretty quickly with no tvs to distract them or other activities going on. echo and rig is a great steakhouse for a date night or a family brunch.", 
            "you will find echo & rig's bright sign shining across from brio and next to the david barton gym in the roundabout area inside the beautiful tivoli village.\n\nthis place seemed busy from the get-go. my family and i had arrived 10 minutes late for our 8 o'clock reservation and was sat after a 15 minute wait. \"the first floor included a bar area (only enter if you are over 21 with an id) and some round tables and <mark>Chai</mark>. it seemed like a waiting room. the music was already loud. there's a butcher shop downstairs as well.\n\nservice 5/5\nwhen we arrived at our table, we were quickly greeted by the manager, jason, who was very friendly and explained t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> liked introducing himself to people who have never ate at echo & rig before. cool beans! \n\nwe were offered our choice of sparkling or flat water, complimentary, for each person at the table. jason came back to explain the concept of the restaurant and a rundown of the menu and source of food (everything is fresh, basically!) great information to know :)\n\nsam was our server and was very friendly as well. not sure w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> dad had asked, but sam left and came back with a giant trey full of raw meat for the steak options. we ordered the tomahawk steak, medium rare. \n\nfood: 4.5/5\nnot sure if they forgot the bread until last minute but the bread came a while after we ordered everything, very close to when the appetizers arrived. anyhow it was still good as i was starving. the bread comes with very creamy butter. \n\nour appetizers came shortly after the bread. per sam's suggestions, we ordered the watermelon tomato salad and portobello mushroom fries. \n\nthe salad was very different -- yellow and red tomatoes mixed with sweet watermelon pieces topped with a vinaigrette sauce (reminds me of the sauce on mozzarella salads). i didn't love it but found it pretty good. may have to try it again for a real opinion.  the fries were delicious! the green sauce for the fries had a buttery taste to it t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> fits perfectly with the mushroom fries. \n\nnext came our entree. the tomahawk steak was done at the most perfect level of \"medium rare\" i have ever seen. my arms had hurt this today (lol arm day!!) so i had a weak grip on everything. yet without using force, the steak was easily cut into pieces. the four choices of sauce were in the cutest little gravy cups. great to have these four choices -- my family and i were able to try all the different sauces! the two dark ones i didn't enjoy too much (one was red wine i believe and the other had an a1 sauce flavor to it). the two light ones were better (one had a slight cheesy flavor and the other had a very rich flavor i couldn't explain, but this yellow one was my favorite). \n\naccompanying the steak were the side dishes: grilled corn, roasted airloom carrots, and some chip dish i didn't particularly enjoy. the grilled corn was very rich in herbal flavor (something my mom didn't like at all). i'm indifferent about it... would be wary with ordering this if you don't like strong herb tastes. the carrots were really good, fluffy and soft, with a slight burnt taste t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> the overall flavor oddly delicious. \n\nwe ended our meal with one of each seasonal sorbet (and for us, the flavors were peach, blackberry, and grapefruit). topped with real fruit, i loved this! on the downside, i came here for my birthday but i wasn't able to get a special dessert or anything :( but i can't get everything haha. \n\nwe shared all these dishes between four people perfectly and it was around $40 per person. not too bad for the price!\n\ncolor me impressed! my first experience with echo & rig was quite positive. you can count on me to come here again for another occasion and bringing a fellow steak-lover.",

            "we live in the neighborhood and finally decided to try echo and rig.  will definitely be in our rotation now.  the menu accommodates those who want steak and sides but also if you want a salad (steak salad was perfect) or even a sandwich for dinner.  food i would give a 5/5.  service was great.  we were there early so t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> have helped but everything was perfect.  \nbrussel sprouts with lemon, mashed potatoes, sweet potato for sides were large servings.  more than enough for the 3 of us along with steak salads for dinner and my husband got a steak.  so glad we finally decided to head to tivoli.  saw t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> bar has a happy hour and they have an oyster bar downstairs.   for better weather there is outside dining on an upper terrace.  tables are far enough from each other t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> don't hear conversations.",

            "wow. i was referred to this place via a chef friend. i searched the menu on line and it looked incredible along with their in house charcuterie. we were seated in the dinning area and i noticed a few things t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> put me on high alert. the wait staff situation seemed chaotic. i saw some dishes sitting under lights for a long period of time and just a bit of general uncertainty. usually warning signs to me. \n   however the floor manager managed to ensure our service was prompt and took the orders himself.  the menu was simple but everything sounded so good it was hard to make a decision. i ordered the kale salad, with goat cheese, the salt and pepper ff and brussel sprouts. my friend got the bravett cut steak. our food arrived hot, and in a timely fashion. i am thinking about going back today for the salad it was so good. the ff and aioli were just perfect. the steak ..... seriously one of the best tasting and perfectly cooked steaks i have ever tried. please try this place if you like steak.  \n    the only reason it got 4 stars was the chaotic feeling around the open kitchen and the stuffed mushrooms t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> up with the steak. two small details t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> it less than perfect but t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> tho!",

            "the restaurant came very highly recommended, so my wife and i ate there for our anniversary. the atmosphere was nice (not great) and we were promptly seated. we had a very nice and attentive server and the menu was reasonably priced. my only complaint about the place (which is unfortunately a big deal for me...a steak eater) is t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> absolutely massacred the ribeye steak i ordered. i like my steaks medium to medium well, but w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> served me was completely unacceptable. i was served a steak so raw it was purple...the look of almost completely uncooked meat. after sending the plate back, i then received the same steak back (not a new one) t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> completely charred. the only thing i could taste was this burnt, charcoaled flavor. the young and polite matrodie (or w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> title he held) noticed my displeasure and asked me how my meal was. after i showed him, it was obvious he was concerned.....but he didn't offer me a new steak! they removed the charges from the bill, but i would have rather paid and received w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> went to the place for. i ended up leaving the place hungry.  very, very dissapointing.",

            "steakhouses are a dime a dozen in vegas so you better be on your a game. echo & rig really missed the mark last night. it started off great with james the manager coming by to welcome us to the restaurant along with our waiter sam. sam explained the menu and brought our their specialty steaks on a platter. \n\ni went with the 19 oz prime bone-in new york and our table shared the mac & cheese and roasted garlic mashed potatoes with white cheddar. the rest of our table ordered their entrees and t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> be the last time we saw sam for a very, very long time. one thing i like at e&r is t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> can order 1/2 glasses of wine if you want to sample a couple different glasses.\n\nthe drinks and bread came out pretty quickly, brought by two different people. the entrees and sides came out a little later, again served by someone else. i took my first bite and the steak had no flavor, i had to add salt and pepper. after a coulple more bites my jaw was actually getting tired of chewing. it was one of the worst cuts of meat i have ever had. full of gristle and really chewy. for a \"prime\" cut it was terrrible. the others at the table were enjoying their filets and fish however the garlic mashed potatoes were very bland as we didnt taste roasted garlic or white cheddar. i thought the mac & cheese was good though. \n\nsam never returned to check on us to make sure everything was ok and prepared properly. we had to flag down james and let him know about my steak. \n\njames apologized and had a medium rare filet out to the table in about 1 minute. excellent service which i truly appreciate. he also returned to make sure it was satisfactory which it was. the filet was very tender and had great flavor (and cost much less than my prime ny). still no sign of sam.  we all finished our dinners, had our plates cleared and were just sitting there waiting for the dessert menu. again we had to flag someone down to find sam for us. i ordered the salted caramel turtle sundae which was excellent. \n\nsam brought out the bill and i was a little surprised to see i was charged for the filet. i have absolutely no problem paying for w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> ate, but in my business if a customer is unhappy you do everything you can to change that. i almost never send food back, so when i do it's a bad sign. although i appreciate james quickly replacing my steak, the quality of the prime ny, the mediocre potatoes and the total absence of our waiter was a big let down.", 
            "where should i start? 5/5 all over, the food, service, everything!\n\nordered the following items:\nappetizers....\ntomato, cucumber, watermelon and red onion - my friend wanted this dish because she loves watermelon during the summer season. i was like, let's give it a try cause i like cucumbers. this dish was very refreshing, sweet and hint of onion-y taste. 5/5!\n\nasparagus and fried egg - i. love. asparagus!!! yes, it does make things smell funky when you're in the restroom but hey this vegetable is stalk-y and green! they grill the asparagus to perfection where you can eat the bottom (the white end). crunchy and delish. \n\ngrilled octopus, gigante beans and green olives - i love octopus. i thought it was weird mixing octopus, beans and olives altogether. i was wrong!\n\npork belly and spicy slaw - ok so the slaw wasn't spicy but the pork belly was surprisingly porky! good marinade and cooked well.\n\nmaryland lump <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark> - the crab in this <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cake</mark> tastes so fresh out of the water! 5/5!\n\nceviche \"peruvian style\" - i'm torn between the two seafood i had but this one was the home run in my tummy. fresh. lime-y. spicy. amazing 6/5!\n\n<mark>Portobello Fries</mark> and herb aioli - i'm a fan of mushrooms...portobello specifically. the portobello was cut into wedges so they looked like steak fries. i wasn't paying attention eating it, thinking it was, seriously, french fries. but omg portobello!!! the sauce was amazing!\n\nmain course...\nthe spencer steak with brandied mushroom sauce - i named my steak steven, i wanted to marry him cause he was so soft, pink and delicious. but i ate him. 'nuff said.\n\ndessert...\ncappuccino sundae - pound cake!!! yes, there's pound cake in the bottom! it also has chocolate shavings and fudge!\n\ncaramel turtle sundae - bourbon and salted caramel ice cream. that's all you need to know about this dish!\n\nthe service was spectacular. they changed our utensils everytime a new dish came out. filled our water everytime it was empty. i felt bad t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was making the servers work. oh well. great service!\n\nbottom line: would come here again.",

(1. asparagus & fried egg 2.grilled octopus, gigante beans & green olives)\n\nthe bouillabasisse was delicious! i'm definitely getting this sometime again. ask for extra free bread to dip in the yummy sauce!\n\nthe alaskan cod was flawed. the meat was a bit rubbery, i suspect caused by the cooking technique of leaving too much liquid in the pan while cooking. the dish overall looked good and put together with effort, but maybe a one time mistake? how come i didn't knock off a star or two for this? because the other items were so amazing!",

            "this is one of those pricey high-end steakhouses that's just ok. like a lot of restaurants like this, they place too much attention on the ambiance and flair, and less on just making a great steak. the result is t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> pay through the nose but just get an ok product.\n\nthe service is good and the waitstaff is friendly. the location itself is pretty good in tivoli. i just feel like they don't make a steak that's more than mediocre but they want to charge as if it's the best in the world.",

            "i want to start by saying t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> rating is for my entire experience at this establishment not just the food. \n\ni visited echo and rig with my family to celebrate a birthday, after a friend recommended we try it.  i went it with high expectations as the other reviews i read were good and this friend suggested t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> had great food. well the food was great however it is the service and overall experience t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> myself and everyone in my party disappointed. upon calling to make a reservation and entering the restaurant you are treated like you are a regular and the staff interactions are positive. i was assured by the manager on the phone prior to dining t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> dairy allergy would not be a problem and they would easily be able to accommodate it. \n\nthe service simply went downhill from there. i will keep it short as no one wants to read a review full of complaints but i want to share my experience so others are aware. we were rushed, not checked on regularly by our server, the staff were constantly whispering in the corner and pointing at tables, and above all the staff is not educated about and does not handle food allergies appropriately.\n\na few examples about the service:\n- our waiter seemed annoyed with the ordering process and instead of helping us - a larger party who had not dined there previously he rushed us into ordering. he spoke so quickly t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> one could understand or hear w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was saying. in addition when the person paying the bill tried to order another side for the table he stopped her and said \"i think we are good on sides\". if she wants to order the whole menu t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> not be a problem for you the server who will benefit from a higher bill in the end. if you think it is too much food then there is a way to say it to the party but at the same time if someone wants one of everything t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> be up to them. \n\n- the manager who was very nice when we walked in did not stop at our table once throughout the time we were there. he walked around the restaurant looking at tables and refilling waters but failed to ask our table how everything was or if there is anything we needed. in addition he stood constantly in plain view of all tables talking with staff and pointing and glaring at certain tables. this felt awkward and rude. in my opinion all of this is restaurant management 101. \n\na note for anyone dining at this restaurant with a food allergy. be careful and explicit when you order because it seems the waitstaff are not knowledgable or worried about allergies. any time i have dined at a steakhouse i have had no problem with staff accommodating my dairy allergy. whether it is by sharing items with me t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> not made with dairy, talking to the chef or manager about w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> be made to accommodate me or as i have had at many establishments the manager or chef come speak with me directly to come up with a fabulous meal t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> could enjoy. none of t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> here. i had to have a plain steak and a salad while everyone at the table enjoyed the food (t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> and smelled wonderful). and the kicker was t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> i physically went to find and check with our server about my order to double check t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> food would not contain dairy (because i felt like he rushed me at the table) he said to \"just don't eat the mushroom t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> be placed on my plate as it will contain dairy\". furious at this point i explained to him t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> plate should not have anything dairy on it!!! the cherry on top was at the end of the meal he had the balls to make a comment which i interpreted as passive aggressive t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> should be sure to come back to visit again and make sure to see him so he can accommodate my allergy. \n\noverall the food was good but the service left much to be desired. in the future i will likely choose to visit one of the many of the other fine dining establishments in the area.",

            "i never met a rib-eye i didn't like. although i suspect the opposite may be true for the rib-eyes.\n\ni have, however, had some rather unsavory characters come between me and my rib-eye and i don't like it (more on t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>).\n\ni have said this many time before, sometimes it takes a few visits before one can get a good feel for a place. of course, the opposite is also true and those places typically get w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> deserve. \n\nwhen it cam to echo & rig, i was determined to take the time needed to formulate an honest and straightforward review. which is why it has been several months and several visits before i sat down to write this.\n\nthe breakdown:\n\nthe happy-hour: is amazing. plenty of people have already exalted it's greatness, so i feel i have nothing to add on the subject.\n\nthe butcher shop: is rather spendy, considering they will cook the darn thing for you for nearly the same price. still, as vegas is desperately lacking in good butcher shops, i am delighted to pay a few bucks more to save the trip to the other side of town. plus the quality of meat is pretty good. oh hell, it's worth it.\n\nthe bar: is a friendly enough place and the bartenders are usually very attentive. i like t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> can order dinner there, sometimes a guy doesn't want to sit at a table all alone. i am very disappointed in the selection of tap beers. there are way too many of w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> would consider very hoppy brews. despite everything mr. koch from sam adams would like you to believe, the whole world is not mad about hops. how about a nice amber lager? and what's up with all the \"goofy\" beers, aren't those better suited for bottles?\n\nthe restaurant: is very open, which is not always my style, but the patio is always good place if there's room available. the decor is simple, but well lit, which is great because some of us like to see w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'re eating.\n\nthe food: is excellent. echo & rig care about the quality of the meats and it shows. there have been a couple of occasions where the kitchen completely mucked up the beautiful relationship i share with my rib-eye (one-sided though it may be). if you're a steakhouse, getting steak prepared correctly is crucial. do you really need me to explain to you pittsburgh blue? \n\nthe staff: is sometimes great and sometimes disappointing. i don't know if there is a pattern to figuring it out, but i hope they do soon. there is a lot of standing around and talking going on. i would think some of the other reviews on yelp would have alerted the staff to the need for better attention to the customer.\n\nthe price point: is the real winner at this place. these steaks would cost you twice as much down on the strip, even the other steak house close by (flem-something or other) charges one and half times the price for a lower quality cut.\n\ni think this place can honestly make headway toward a 5 star rating, and in fact there have been occasions when it has, but there are still times when it falls short. \n\nuntil then, i will continue to make regular visits to echo & rig. maybe they let me step back in the kitchen and teach them how to make it pittsburgh blue. :-)",

            "i had heard some really good comments about this place from my friends and was very much looking forward the evening. i called ahead for reservations thinking saturday night would be a busy night. it was even busier than i thought. reservations or not, we still had to wait 15 minutes for a table and watched someone who walked in 5 minutes after us get seated before us.....(?) one wonders when they set their reservation for.\n\nupon being seated, i saw a table open on the patio and inquired about it. we were told t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> is not available and took our seats where the young lady sat us. about 5 minutes later a couple of ladies were seated next to us and when i looked over 5 minutes later they were not there anymore. well, i think you can guess where they were sitting now.....yup, the very table i had asked about. no good for us, but fine for them.........\n\ni will say the waiter was pleasant. all business, but when you show up on saturday night at the time we did, you have to understand the balancing act. he did a good job while still maintaining his pace. i can appreciate this kind of waiter as my family owned a restaurant for 72 years. kudos, sam.\n\ncocktails were fine, nothing special, but definitely drinkable. still, when making a mojito, please just bruise up the mint. the idea is just to release the oil to infuse the drink, smashing it until it crumbles will insure every sip is filled with broken mint leaves. (this was one of their specialty drinks?)\n\nappetizers were fine (we ordered three), but once again, not especially praiseworthy. the portabella fries were good enough for a mention, though. crisp and tasty, i might have to try making them myself.\n\nentrees......this is where a so-so experience totally fell apart. we ordered our steaks medium, we like pink throughout, but not raw or cooked to ash. our steaks arrived and one cut determined they were still 85% raw. seared less than 1/4 inch outside and completely undone inside. japanese call this tataki and if i had ordered that, it would have been fine, but i did not. we called the waiter and he immediately took them back and said t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> would have them cooked to order. when they came back, they were charcoal.\n\nsince the waiter was not the one who brought them back, i don't hold him responsible. he knew w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> had ordered and i am sure if he had seen them, he would not have brought them out to us. another member of his team brought them and one look told us all we needed to know. still, we cut them to check; leather and brown all they way through, ash on the outside. i like char, but this was two fine pieces of meat ruined beyond eating.\n\nit needs to be said t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> and rig is a butcher shop and their specialty is meat. hmmmm?\n\ncuriously, and this may not have anything to do with anything, but i wonder w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> of grill they use since there was no cross-<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> on the steaks. since they sell books on grilling and have charcoal also for sale, doesn't t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> they cook over open flame with wood, too?\n\nwe called the waiter and said politely t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> were done here and could he bring us the check. i told him i would not pay for the steaks, but t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was willing to pay for everything else. he apologized and tried w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> could to fix the situation, but one little thing after another ending with this total fail was enough for us. he called the manager derrick and he also apologized and said he would like a chance to fix the evening, so invited us back another time and made sure his fellow manager xavier was aware of our situation.\n\ni'm not sure we will take them up on the offer, but the fact t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> offered was appreciated. thank you gentlemen and kudos to our waiter, sam. (i hope i got your name right, because i'm trying to forget this experience)\n\nstill, until we give them another try (read \"if\" here), i cannot give them anything other than the \"one star\" t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> experience was. sorry guys maybe next time?",

            "my parents found this place the last time they were in vegas and they wanted to show it off to the family on this trip. we made reservations for our first night in vegas. we got here a little early for our reservation and hung out downstairs for a little bit. i checked out the butcher shop they had downstairs and they had some nice looking pieces of meat. it's super smart for them to have a butcher shop right down stairs, lets you know t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> meat is super fresh. when everyone arrived we went up to our table. we were seated in the back away from most of the customers, it was much appreciated t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> got our own little private area. we brought a bottle of wine and the host t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> us joked t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was a $100 corkage fee, it gave some of my relatives a heart attack, but then she told us she was just kidding around and said they didn't have a corkage fee. i don't think i've ever been anywhere t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'t have a corkage fee so t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> gracious of them. i really liked the style of this place, it was fancy, but a little rustic. the room balanced itself out, nothing too over the top, except for maybe t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> chandelier in the center of it all, but hey this is vegas. \n\nour server, ramone, was exceptionally helpful. he recommended t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> all share their 42 ounce tomahawk because they slice it up and make it family style. i wanted to try the duck, but the rest of my family decided to share the steak so i went with it. we also ordered a few appetizers to start, they all sounded incredible. i picked the pork belly with slaw and the chile cauliflower. the rest of my family also ordered the carne asada bone marrow, grilled octopus and <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>. it didn't take too long for our appetizers, and they all came at the same time. we each got a small portion of every appetizer. the cauliflower wasn't as spicy as i thought it would be, it was actually more on the sweet side. we asked ramone w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> the dish sweet, he told us there were pieces of garlic t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> caramelized in brown sugar. even though the dish wasn't as spicy as i expected it to be, it was still wonderful. those caramelized pieces of garlic were and unexpected delight. the cauliflower was roasted and had a nice bite to it. my mom loved the cauliflower dish, it was her favorite. the pork belly was marinated in a savory soy sauce and served on top of cabbage slaw. the pork melted in my mouth and the slaw gave the dish a refreshing crunch. the carne asada bone marrow was really innovative and unique. i've never seen another bone marrow dish like it. the addition of the citrusy carne asada and red onions gave the bone marrow more than just one note. it really freshened up a normally rich and heavy dish. the octopus was grilled to perfection and the sauce was tangy and clean. lastly the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>, the dish t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> thought i would like the least actually turned out to be my favorite. i'm not a big mushroom fan and i especially don't like portobello mushrooms, but i could eat these all day. they had an excellent crispy coating t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> seasoned well with freshly chopped basil and parmesan cheese. i'm not sure w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> sauce was, but it was thick, bright green and very addicting. i would come back just for t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>. next came the salads, which i didn't order or try, but they all looked good. \n\ni did use the bathroom a couple times here and it's lovely, clean and has a lot of space. i liked the single couch they had in the front of the restroom, it gave the room a charming touch. i also noticed they had a balcony with seats. they had a good view of the elegant round about and other shops and restaurants. next time i want to sit out there. \n\nlastly our glorious steak came along with a couple of sides. the steak came with house made potato chips and stuffed mushroom. we also ordered the broccolini side. the steak was cooked medium rare, but it was more rare on the inside pieces. no one seemed to mind though because it was just melt in your mouth, meaty deliciousness. we also got some sauces with our steak. everyone ordered separate sauces and we got them all free with our steak. the favorite was the red wine demi-glace. i soaked my steak in demi and got some thick and creamy horse radish sauce on the side. i also had a couple potato chips and a small serving of broccolini. the steak was unbeatable, it was obviously treated with love and care. the demi was like a gravy and the horseradish brought some zest. the chips were thin and s<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> like glass in between your teeth. the broccolini had a nice bite. it was served with whole cloves of cooked, soft garlic and was seasoned with red pepper flakes which brought some spicy heat. i love broccolini and they did this vegetable right. everything here was absolutely delicious. \n\nnot only was this place amazingly delicious, but the prices were low. the steak t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> shared was just $100 and each appetizer was under $10. this is definitely our new to go place in vegas, such a special find.", 
            "wow!  this place is amazing!  i was in town for work with a group of ladies, and we made a last minute run to this restaurant - knowing it might be difficult to seat five with no reservation.  the friendly hostesses told us it would be a short wait, but they would find a table for us.  we were seated quite quickly, and visited by xavier, the manager, and jason, our server.\n\nwhile we saw beautiful cuts of meat being displayed for tables all over the dining room, we quickly decided to dine tapas-style and order lots of small plates to share.  and while the cocktail menu looked fabulous, we decided sharing a bottle of wine would be more fun.  our wine was delivered quickly, and our small plates started being delivered to the table.  we ordered the cauliflower, thick-cut bacon,  lamb cigars, butcher's sausage, baked brie, ahi poke, and the grilled octopus.  the conversation waned at t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> because we were all thoroughly enjoying our food.  xavier also kindly brought over an order of the <mark>Fried Spinach</mark> salad for us to try.  it's something i had never heard of and would never think to order, but it was insanely good!  we ran out of wine pretty quickly, and our amazing server jason recommended a red blend from browne family - one of his favorites.  we insisted t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> pour himself a glass and spend a moment with us, which he did in between running around attending to his other tables.\n\nall in all, five stars - for the food, the atmosphere, and the service.  we travel to las vegas for work regularly, and we will definitely be back!",

            "everything is so amazing. i always get the tri-tip with the caramelized onion sauce. <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> are amazing. the grilled cauliflower is amazing. the seabreeze drink is amazing. everything is amazing. come here all the time. the new blonde manager was extremely friendly and introduced herself, the seabreezes made me forget her name. our waiter was very attentive as was the buster t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> constantly cleaning the table. \n\non a side note, the hostess was extremely professional. there was another lady ahead of us t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> complaining about waiting for 10 minutes  to be seated and was extremely snarky and rude to the hostess. the hostess just smiled and apologized and remained professional. \n\nwe will be back, as always!!!", 
            "w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> cool concept, it is a butcher shop and bar on the first floor and a full restaurant upstairs with an outdoor heated patio.  there were 5 of us and we opted to try 4 different cuts of beef and shared them family style. the calamari and the portabello mushroom fries were both a tad salty but the mushroom fries, were so good and worth the salt splurge.  the steaks were cooked perfectly, highly recommend the rib eye.  ask for an assortment of sauces to taste them all.", 
            "w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> great experince. from the minute we arrived we felt welcomed. we arrived about 20 minutes early, and we got the opportunity to speak with the butcher down stairs. he was very helpful and shared his knowledge about the meats. once we were seated our server was very friendly and knowledgeable of the menu. my mother-in-law had the butter fish and she enjoyed it, but once she tasted my t-bone and my wife's ribeye she wished she had ordered a steak. my steak was great, (t-bone) but my wife's ribeye was excellent l. the bacon and bbq sauce app was amazing, the mash potatos  were fantastic. my mother-in-law is coming back tomorrow night. i highly recommend eating here. an enjoyable experince.", 
            "let me start by saying t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> spent 16 years in the restaurant business, and this is, by far, one of the best restaurants i've ever been to.\nmanager beth and her staff set themselves apart from almost every other service staff i've ever seen in efficiency, generosity, and unflinchingly warm customer service. when faced with a hungry 1 year old, they offered berries before the water even came to the table. beth always stops by to say hello, and despite a city of 2 million people- i'd swear she genuinely remembers me every time. they kill it with amazing service. \nnow the food- well, you've died and gone to heaven. if the meat seems a little heavy- have a salad-- they are just as amazing as any of the entrees.\nfrom the butcher to the bathrooms, this is a not-to-be-missed dining experience.",

            "i've lived in vegas for years and went here for the first time with some work associates for dinner.  decor is good, but their is nothing to dampen sound (carpets , partitions, etc.) so it is extremely loud when it gets busy which it was.  very difficult to carry on a conversation, felt like i was at a concert almost.  \n\nwaitstaff and manager beth were very attentive and very eager to please.  forgot our server's name but he had this attitude like he certainly didn't want to be there which became evident throughout the night.  he showed us some large plate of meat cuts and i never understood w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was for as his explanation was very lacking and the large cuts of steak he showed us weren't on the menu.  \n\nwe ordered and our food came out within a normal time frame.  <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> were amazing, steak tartare was ok, appearance was average but it was drenched in some kind of sauce.\n\nour main course arrived and everything looked good, however my friends \"medium well\" filet was definitely not even close to that.  once it was cut into it was plain to see it was on the rare side of rare.  we found out t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> member of the table had ordered the same thing and the serving staff had served the wrong food to both of them.  beth offered another steak to replace it and after we had all finished eating her replacement steak arrived.  it was supposed to be \"medium well\" but they barely managed to get it to \"medium rare\".  \n\nwe ordered some dessert and again the wait staff mixed up orders and served the wrong item to the wrong person. nothing like paying to serve your own food. \n\nwe asked for separate checks and after an extraordinary amount of time our server ensured to point out multiple times t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> gratuity was not included on the checks.  he seemed to be hovering over us as we signed our bills as he scooped them up almost immediately - can we get a little privacy or peace please?  sheesh.\n\noverall - meh.  waitstaff is attentive but unable to properly serve food.  for being a steakhouse, the kitchen can't seem to cook a steak properly.  cost is far too much for the level of service received and quality/portion size of the food.   definitely more than $$ place. \n\ncross this off the list places i will go again.  i don't mind paying for great service and great food, prefer it actually but there are plenty of other steakhouses in town worth paying this much for ok service and improperly cooked steaks (think outback).",

            "first time here and i think our waitress was drunk at 1pm. came for mimosas but they only do t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> sunday's. the waitress was most likely drunk and very aggressive. she was forcing the conversation asking about personal information like our last names and w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> school we went to and where we were born. went on and on about the menu for 5 minutes straight when we just needed a second to look. told us \"you can't order the salad and need to order a steak\"..... i personally like salads better when i went there for the mimosas in the first place. such a weird experience. have never walked out before ordering food and i did in this place because i was extremely uncomfortable. :/", 
            "this place is the ultimate spot for lunch or dinner, but their brunch is out of this world. \n\nthe brunch menu offers both savory and sweet options, from benedicts to <mark>Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes</mark>. i started my order with a classic bloody mary (a bloody mary isn't on the menu but they will make one for you t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> fresh and still has a great kick.) we also ordered the restaurants <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> served with a herb aioli ($9) as a starter. the fries are a signature item for the spot and they go through more portobello mushrooms than any other restaurant in las vegas. the breading was light and the mushrooms were sliced at a great size, plus i'm a sucker for any aioli.\n\nin addition to being a restaurant echo & rig is also a butcher shop which made savory an easy decision for my main brunch plate. i decided on the short rib hash ($15) and i was so glad i did. the short rib was perfectly cooked and the potatoes and peppers were diced to the perfect consistency. plus the hollandaise sauce had a dash of paprika on top which i was obsessed with. my friend got the same hash as me and my other friend got the <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> ($12) which was also stuffed with short rib and was equally unreal.  \n\ni capped off brunch with a final cocktail from their signature cocktail menu. i got the echo gimlet ($9) which was beyond refreshing, sweet and delicious! it was a vodka based cocktail with peach and mint, definitely one of the better cocktails i've had in my brunch explorations. they also offer bottomless bubbly ($16) if that's your thing, which it totally should be.\n\nif it's a beautiful day (hello, las vegas) take advantage of their outdoor balcony seating offering lovely views of tivoli village. \n\nlove this spot, a favorite for lunch and weekend brunch. i will absolutely be coming back for dinner soon.", 
            "last night my wife and i came here for a celebration dinner. we had an 8:30 pm reservation but we were able to get sat in till almost 9 o'clock at night. we didn't have any drinks before dinner and my expectations had dropped until the friendly hostess took us upstairs to meet our server nicholas. nicholas was full of wonderful personality and immediately turned around our initial negative experience. he works seamlessly with the rest of his team members and introduced us to derek the manager. i ordered a whiskey sour and my wife had some type of champagne. we started off with the bone marrow, beef tartare, watermelon salad and those three dishes were top notch. my wife and i commented t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> bone marrow dish specifically was probably a top three dish of our entire life. we go out to eat frequently and have no problem dropping a few hundred dollars on a good dinner. for our entr\\u00e9es my wife had the ribeye and and i had the lamb chops. we shared a cauliflower side dish as well. our biggest surprise came when the bill came. out the door including taxes and tip was under $130. we were so impressed with the service, the friendly attitudes, and the excellent food t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> recommended the restaurant to a group of friends who were staying on the strip and they took advantage of the recommendation and the six of them went to the restaurant tonight. i can't say enough good things about the management team or our server nicholas. i'm looking forward to going back and at t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> i don't have to wait for a special event such as a birthday. we will definitely make this a regular occurrence when possible. again, thank you nicholas, derek and the rest of your team for making our great night extremely memorable.", 
            "my girlfriends came to town to visit me for my birthday and wanted to go to a nice restaurant off the strip. i thought of a few restaurants but decided to go with echo & rigs because they never disappoint me. the food per usual was very good. my favorites of the night was the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>, the lamb chops and the jumping beef. the lamb chops had a nice crust on the top and was very tender. the jumping beef was full of flavor and as well very tender. you honestly can't go wrong with either choice. \n\nnormally at echo & rig i have great service but the waiter t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was so so. we described the kind of wine we wanted and we let him make the recommendation. he brought out the bottle and had us try the bottle but it was nothing like we described. we kindly told the waiter we didn't like it and then he told us, he didn't have us try the wine to see if we liked it or not, he had us try it to see if it was too corky. t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> the first time we ever heard of such a thing but we just looked at each other and said okay. t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> ruined our experience but then this nice gentleman name xavier turned everything around for us. he came to check on our table to see how we were doing and after we explained w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>, he was very apologetic and got us another bottle of wine t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> our description perfectly. xavier also sent us some dessert t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> also very delicious. i would of gave this place a 3 or 4 stars because of t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> since customer service is very important to me when dining especially at a nice establishment but xavier really made up for it so this place is getting 5 stars. \n\ni highly recommend this place if you want to go somewhere that's a nice local spot off the strip. the price is very reasonable and the ambience very nice.",

            "came here on a sunday night with reservations with friends.  the restaurant is located upstairs and the downstairs entry area is pretty cool.  they showcase their fresh and cured meats and the space is very modern and pretty.  they also have an awesome butcher book.\n\nwe got seated pretty quickly and there were various people who greeted us.  everyone is really friendly and nice.  they started us with two free dishes, a quinoie salad and the cauliflower on the vegetable list.  i loved the cauliflower because it was roasted and sweet with a slight spicy kick.  the quinoi salad was fresh but wasn't nearly as good as the cauliflower.  we ordered a bottle of wine, appetizers and entrees.  a lot of my friends got the ribeye cap, the ribeye cut and i was the only one to get the spencer steak.  we also ordered fries, corn, brussel sprouts, mac and cheese and broccolini.  the vegetables and side dishes were good.  fries were alright, nothing spectacular or special..but i liked the sweet corn, the brussel sprouts (though i've had much better elsewhere) broccolini and mac and cheese.  the dish i was disappointed in the calamari salad.  there were few pieces of squid and the whole plate consisted of fava beans.  it was tart, the squid was chewy, not crispy and wasn't flavorful.  i think its mediterranean inspired and it doesn't suit my palate.  really didn't care for it at all.  the mac and cheese was good though.  not too cheesy but very homey and hearty.\n\nas for the entrees, everyone enjoyed their steak except me.  i had a bite of my friend's ribeye cute and it was very juicy, tender and perfectly cooked.  i think the cut naturally has a lot more fat so its way more flavorful.  i had the spencer cut and it reminds me of a ny cut.  it was much thicker, dryer, and with less flavor.  it was cooked well but i think i prefer a fattier cut of steak.  each meal came with chips (mehhh) and stuffed mushroom.  liked the mushroom but would have much prefered mashed potatoes or a vegetable for a side dish than chips.\n\nservice was very attentive, the food took a little while to come but they gave us more chips to apologize...no one touched it.  they also have this amazing hand scrub in the bathroom.  t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> have been my favorite part, t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> the company.\n\noverall this place is a beautiful space, great service, and serves good food if your order right =).",

            "i've been here twice now for sunday brunch and had a great experience both times. when i first walked it, i was a little taken aback because it almost seemed like the interior was unfinished. as we waited to be seated, a server came and offered us a sample of their turkey deli-meat. at first, i was a bit confused, then i noticed t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> are also a butcher shop.  \n\nthe second floor, where the dining room and outdoor patio seating are located is gorgeous. it is a wide open space with a lot of white. it feels very sunny, a perfect ambiance for a sunday brunch.  \n\nthe service is always great and we never had to wait for refills or too long for food. both times i ordered the <mark>Eggs Benedict</mark>, which comes pretty traditional except they also add a layer of sauteed spinach, which is a perfect compliment to the dish.  there is a bottomless mimosa, and they are quick to refill you as soon as you reach halfway. i love t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> bring you a carafe of oj so t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> can determine yourself how much oj you want in your mimosa.\n\nthis and one other place in town are tied for my favorite sunday brunch location.  if you love brunch, echo and rig is a must.", 
            "i came in without a reservation, but it was a wednesday night and a bit slow, so the maitre d got us seated quickly and courteously. they messed up on the guest note and put \"mr.\" down on my girlfriend's name, which was funny because they addressed me by my girlfriend's name, but that's not a big deal, especially considering how great of a time we had.\n\nquick note on the restaurant layout: the restaurant itself is upstairs and the floor is lovely with plenty of spacing between tables and a nice view of the tivoli roundabout. not loud. very pleasant.\n\nour server was ricky and he was amazing. so friendly, funny, and he gave us such a great overview of the menu and explanation of specific items. we started with two cocktails: the le passion, which was great, very well balanced, and the white lightning, which was way too sweet for my taste, but maybe i shouldn't have chosen a cocktail with brown sugar in it. then ricky recommended the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> as a starter and they were a revelation. you must try them.\n\nfor our meal we had the kale salad, which was sweet, light, exactly w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'d expect, then followed with tie-dye salmon, which was incredibly moist and went perfectly with the asparagus one coconut rice its served with. the kitchen also sent us a cauliflower and chile dish gratis, but i can't remember the name of it. it was incredible, a perfect balance of sweetness and spice. i'll certainly order it when i'm back.\n\nwe finished with sundaes: one with all three sorbets and the other and apple sundae, which tasted like an apple a la mode. both were absolutely delicious, but also enormous. i expected them to be medium in size like the other dishes we had, but no, these things were enormous. definitely meant to be shared. \n\noverall it was a great night. i'd highly recommend this place. and if you call in a reservation, ask for ricky as your server.", 
            "i can't speak to the restaurant proper, but i am quite the regular at the butcher shop and have been known to hang out with friends at the bar.  the butcher shop is truly full service.  the slab bacon is excellent, the burger patties are amazing, and the <mark>Sausage</mark> and terrines are lovely.  they're the only butcher i have put special requests in to t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> produced, and since they bring in whole animals, i can always get pork skin on, which is very rare these days outside of a chinese market (which don't generally have roasts).  oh, and give their experiments a try, never been disappointed.\n\nservice at the bar is friendly and competent.  the beer selection is respectable for the small number of taps and the house wines are decent.  the happy hour menu is great, sadly they've reduced the happy hour hours.  from the full menu the bone marrow carne asada is excellent, and they do not treat their calamari as an afterthought.  the mac and cheese is not the best in town but it is not disappointing.  \n\nthe one real problem is the weekend.  since they do brunch the regular menu is not available before 4pm, which is kind of a bummer if you go to the farmer's market, which ends at 2pm, and want to grab a proper bite there afterwards.  i don't know about anyone else but i like to have breakfast before wandering a farmer's market, not after.", 
            "i made reservations for my boyfriend's birthday - dinner for us. they have contact information to make reservations ahead of time on their website, but i wanted to try my new app, and it worked successfully! the restaurant had our reservation with no hiccups. \nwe had gotten there about 15 minutes earlier than the reservation time 'cause i figured there'd still be a night crowd on a sunday, and i had read previous yelp reviews about patrons still having to wait even though reservations were made. anyway... we get there, and i was right. there were 2 large groups and a few couples already waiting at the hostess' podium. i think i overheard someone say t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> was helping another group settle in, but no biggie. she was nice and c<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> it up with us when showing us to our table, and it only took us about 10 minutes to get to our table after checking in. in t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> frame, the boyfriend got to look around the butcher shop which he found cool and unique for a vegas restaurant. \nshortly after being seated, the manager, lisa, introduced herself and wished my boyfriend a \"happy birthday.\" t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> quite thoughtful of her. also noticed t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> checked on other patrons throughout the night as well. now t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> impressive for a manager 'cause i rarely see that. our server ramon and his assistant was just as friendly and helpful/knowledgeable when it came to answering my boyfriend's questions about the menu. they checked on us repeatedly throughout the meal, making sure we were happy with the food and drinks, etc. i didn't think they'd do anything else beside wishing him a \"happy birthday,\" but they brought us ice cream with a birthday candle to share. lol. no wonder ramon's assistant conveniently forgot to bring us a dessert menu. thank goodness they don't sing to their patrons! t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'ve been mortifying! xd onto actual food and drinks... \nwe had ordered the lamb cigars & tzatziki sauce t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> extremely yummy, especially with the sauce, but really potent when you mix in the pickled onions(?). then comes the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> & herb aioli -  breading gives it enough crunch to match the texture of the portobello and the sauce pairs so well! he couldn't stop eating those, and he was hesitant at first. there was also roasted garlic mashed potatoes & white cheddar - wanted more of that, but the boyfriend limited w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> shared with me. we both ordered the rib-eye, cooked differently, and the chefs had made 'em right! love the char on it, but i love how tender the meat was overall. i didn't really have to struggle cutting through it (t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> or as leftovers). oh my gah... the salted caramel ice cream they brought out with a candle was amazing! it wasn't overly sweet, and i love the candied peanuts it was topped with. i'm not really a fan of caramel, but t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> an impressive find! \nafter dinner, they didn't rush us to leave or make us feel guilty for taking our time talking more, which i like and appreciate. the cool ending was t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> manager wished us a good night and hoped to see us for another celebration. not gonna lie, but i'm seriously contemplating it for sooner rather than later. food and service is worth going back here.",

(reading so far, they didn't take my name which i thought was odd but who knows how they operate.) they keep glancing at me, but make no attempt to talk or ask me anything. at all. another 30 minutes pass, and this small group comes in and actually gives their name. i finally ask about the status of my table. the hostess puts on a fake look of surprise and sympathy and tells me \"oh, we thought you were eating at the bar!\" uh, no. i stood behind you and practically stared you down for 30 minutes. she offers to take my name - but - then tells me there are two parties in front of me. are you serious??! you still make me wait after your mistake?\n\ni wasted an hour of my time, on my birthday, whom i had no one to share with. on top of that, it was fucking cold as shit in the lobby. do you even have heat?? i was livid, hungry, getting tired and freezing. i did wake up the next day feeling yucky because of practically standing outside for an hour. this was, by far, the worst, restaurant experience i have ever had. i can't imagine ever setting foot inside your establishment again.",

            "tldr; best experience i've ever had at a restaurant. food was amazing (definitely try the portobello mushroom fries). service was incredible. will definitely go back again!\n\ni've never written a review but this was place was so amazing t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> just had to! everything from food to service was great. here's how the whole experience went:\ni called in to make a reservation for me and my girlfriend's 4th year anniversary. they asked me if there was a special occasion and i told them it was for our anniversary. when we walked in and told them my name, the hostess congratulated us on our anniversary. when we were seated, our waiter, lucas (luke on the receipt), also congratulated us. as we wondered w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> were good since it was our first time there, he seemed completely honest with us. we ordered the filet mignon, butterfish, portobello mushroom fries, and brussels sprouts. i usually don't eat brussels sprouts but the waiter suggested it and i don't regret it at all! a few seconds after we finished the complimentary bread, we were given another without having to ask. same goes for when we were about half way done with our water. the service is incredibly quick. the waiter also suggested to order the white lightning cocktail and it was also great! all of the food was amazing. the filet and butterfish were tender and juicy. portobello mushroom fries were delicious and you can't really get it anywhere else! after we finished eating the main courses, we wanted dessert. the waiter then informed us t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> are going to receive dessert on the house for our anniversary! ice cream with assorted nuts. tasty! walking out, we were stopped by the restaurant manager, xavier, and given his business card and told to contact him anytime whenever i plan to go back. everything was great and i definitely plan to go back!\n\nthe restroom was also really cool. sea salt scrub as soap. paper towels were thick and soft. most interesting restroom i've been to..", 
            "wow....this place was impressive. we went for a couple's dinner...not celebrating anything special...just a nice dinner...and that's w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> got. we made reservations on open table, which is always awesome when t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> an option. when we arrived, we had time to look at the amazing butcher shop downstairs. we didn't get a chance to stop by the bar downstairs, but it looked like a hoppin' spot!! the host staff promptly took us upstairs to our seats. the place was busy and there were plenty of echo and rig staff to meet all the needs. almost as soon as we sat, the manager came over and introduced himself and gave us some of the story of the restaurant and the head chef. (who recently beat bobby flay!). the manager truly seemed excited to tell us about it...he was a young guy, so it was cool to see him so animated!  when our waiter arrived, he was just excited as the manager to work with us and explain the different cuts of meat and preparation, etc. he was able to knowledgeably recommend wines to us. he was amazingly attentive throughout the entire meal. the food was top notch. we all ordered steak...mostly filet mignon which melted in our mouths!!! we had a mashed potato side dish t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> delicious and someone else in our party could not stop eating the macaroni and cheese!! of course we were too stuffed to order any desserts but they looked amazing as well! i will definitely be back to echo and rig and highly recommend to anyone who wants a wonderful dining experience. (by the way...the prices are completely reasonable. i'm so used to l.a. prices, this meal seemed totally inexpensive to us!!)", 
            "oh w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> night! came here last year when in town and didn't think it could be any better. i was wrong. food was fabulous and service even better. ricky was the best and everyone treated us like we were somebody special.", 
            "great deal for drinks and mini apps during happy hour at the bar (starts at 3pm.)\n\naside from that, i've always had great service and food whenever i come here. the prices are not too shabby at all when you consider w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'re getting.\n\nthe tomahawks are, heck, pretty much anything from the steak specialties are bomb. great sides too, like their grilled octopus or <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>.\n\nvery nice restaurant/butchershop on the local side of vegas.", 
            "fantastic! took my boyfriend here for his birthday, w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> find...it's now our go-to steak place! this restaurant impeccable customer service, they really take care of you! very friendly. the steak is mouthwatering and always cooked to perfection! this is such a wonderful restaurant to get amazing service and a high end steak....off the strip!", 
            "i should be biased to be writing a review of a steakhouse since i'm not one to love steak. anyways, this place alone deserves the greatest praise for customer service. customer service is everything when it comes to dining in to a fancy restaurant. a group of us were here for dinner during our last weekend in vegas as suggested by our friends who live here to try this place out as it raves awesome reviews. \n\nfrom beginning to end, service was impressive. the waiter offered us water (with a complimentary choice of still or sparkling) all around and the way t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> all presented themselves in pouring our drinks were quite the service. our waters were constantly filled even when it was only half way. they even poured the rest of my cider when i drank just enough to fill up my cup again. the waiter who served us brought different cuts of meat and explained the different types of meats we could get. he offered recommendations as well to preferences we may have had. very informative to any questions we had. \n\neveryone else on my table got steak but me of course. i got the <mark>Roasted Chicken</mark> sandwich with a side of <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> & herb aioli. all our entrees came with potato chips as a side. as much as i love potato chips, these were too salty for me. the chicken was tasty, the sauces made the sandwich more flavorful. the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> is a must! it was really good with the aoli sauce t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> the perfectly battered crisp fries.  it was the highlight of my meal. it has a unique taste to it but its full of flavor. \n\nbut really, if you're a steak lover, this would be the place for you as it's well known for their steak cuts. they also came out with a complimentary dessert for our friend who was celebrating her birthday and so we all sang for her. i would recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a nice place and atmosphere to celebrate something special. \n\nbtw, use the sea salt scrub in the bathroom, it's makes your skin so soft! fancy bathroom for a fancy restaurant. the view outside overlooked the big beautiful christmas tree out in the courtyard. go outside and take a picture as it makes for a great background during the holidays!", 
            "amazing!!  i was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> like quite a simple set up walking in but low and behold, up the staircase leads to a great dining room with patio seating.  my fianc\\u00e9 and i arrived a little early (note, make a reservation!) so we were offered patio seating if we wanted to be seated right away.. keep in mind, the weather is in the 50's now .. we decided to be adventurous which turned out to be the better option and i'll tell you why.  the patio is heated so not only do you have a view and fresh air, but the noise level compared to inside, isn't a factor at all!  if you're dining with a group of friends, the c<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> inside may work for you but if you're looking for something more intimate; like we were, the patio is my recommendation!  we also had a great waitress and very attentive manager which complimented the entire evening.  i always like to see people who are passionate about their jobs, and the two of them were star examples of this.  the restaurant is a little bit of a drive for us but we couldn't have asked for a better evening and will definitely be back .. and will ask for toni", 
            "let me start off by saying this was my second time eating here. the first time was definitely a 5 star review, hence i booked a reservation here for the second time to celebrate my boyfriend's 30th birthday. a well deserved 1 star review. \n\nfirst, we were sat on the patio. it was freezing cold and the hostess and servers could see my immediate distaste, but did nothing about it. in fact, a comment was made about how the inside was so full with bigger parties (even though we had a reservation). i didn't want to make a big fuss of it because the night was not about me it was about my boyfriend. there were several other people struggling as well. the table next to us was shivering so bad because their heat lamp wasn't working we offered them to join us and share our heat lamp. \n\nsecond, our server and manager were kind of pushy with alcohol. we don't drink and it was extremely annoying to say over and over again t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> wouldn't like to order any cocktails. the disappointment was evident on our server's face. \n\nthird, we decided to try oysters (never tried them before). we ate three of them but were extremely dissatisfied. i don't know if it's oysters in general or just theirs. mine actually tasted gritty. when our server asked if we liked them, we politely said \"eh, definitely not our favorite,\" and he said, \"yeah, they're not for everyone.\" t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> it! no, \"oh, i'm sorry about that. w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark>'t you like about it? can we offer you an alternative?\" \n\nfourth, we ordered the salmon and new york steak. the new york steak was good. the salmon was extremely bland. definitely needed more seasoning. \n\nfifth, our server barely stopped by the table. his assistant servers did all the work. he barely even stopped by to say happy birthday when we were already half way through the dessert. \n\nlastly, the manager stopped by our table a couple of times ( i think to make up for our server's lack of presence). however, he seemed so preoccupied and insincere, we felt even if we did complain it would fall deaf ears. \n\noverall, we felt completely overlooked and not special on this special occasion.\n\ndefinitely, won't be visiting again. such a shame because our first experience was so great, but this experience was bad enough to never return.", 
            "was invited here for a birthday dinner. we had a large party and to my surprise we were seated outside. it was a tad chilly outside, but they had heat lamps so it wasn't too bad. not too fancy and big menu selection with decent prices. (small salads: $9.30 & $11.40, soups $5.90, sandwiches $12.40, seafood dishes $21.70, entrees $19.60, side dishes $5.90/8.20/9.80, and various steak prices from $25.70-34.80) \n\nstarted out with the first thing t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> our eye on the menu: portabello fries & herb aioli. so incredibly delicious! deep fried giant slices of mushrooms t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> to die! if they weren't about 10$ an order, i think we would have gladly ordered 5 of those alone! \n\nfor him: he ordered the colorado lamb porterhouse chops t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> with peewee potatoes, dried apricots and violet mustard. well cooked and flavored, okay size for a $20 steak. he asked if there was a way to get a side of rice and they said no... even though i swear i saw rice included with a few of the entrees. but he devoured the whole thing easily and was overall satisified.\n\nfor her: i ordered the jumping beef which were filet mignon tips, roasted tomatoes, red onions, crispy potatoes and peruvian demi-glace. very flavorful i must say, but was a little disappointed with only 4 little pieces of meat and the \"crispy potatoes\" it was topped with were french fries. i did enjoy the roasted tomatoes! luckily i wasn't too hungry from already eating the <mark>Portobello Fries</mark> and bread with butter, otherwise i don't think this meal would have filled me up ordinarily. \n\noverall, a good dining experience. wasn't too happy about being outdoors in the cold weather (and i would complain about t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> if i wasn't dressed warmly t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> with a long sleeve sweater & thigh high boots) and would have loved to dine inside, but the service was excellent and food was flavorful! wouldn't say it's a place i would want to eat at often, but definitely nothing negative to say either. definitely a place to try if you are a steak enthusiast!", 
            "service and the food outstanding. organic grass fed beef was delicious. and the portobella fries are unforgetable. for this quality, prices are reasonable. this would be a 5er but for the too loud music with the intense constant drumbeat. just causes the diners to talk louder and increases the din. very unpleasant and detracts from w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> be just about perfect in every other way. ask for brians section. he was great.\nthe complimentary prochiutto ham and champagne made the wait easier.\nwe'll return, maybe on a weekday night.", 
            "w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> wonderful change! past 2 times i went to this place (2 years ago) the food was not great and the service was bad.\nthis time everything was aaaamazing, we shared different side dishes and the meat was \"to die for\", the service was out of this world and overall very fun night. \nthe only downside was the deserts", 
            "i love this place! i've been there 3 times now and i've also purchased skirt steak to make it home all excellent reviews. they're small plates are wonderful each one very different than the next and then of course you get a slab of meat. i remember the first time i went in there that's w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> asked for a slab of meat and boy did my friend and i get a slab of meat! very nice atmosphere downstairs is a butcher  and  upstairs a nice restaurant t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> can look out onto tivoli village. i went there most recently with a friend in november and we were seated outside with a heat lamp. a little chilly but still beautiful. the view was nice the area is nice you almost forget t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> are in las vegas. definitely see this place, experience this place. the meat is perfectly cooked so when you have t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> craving this is definitely the place to go"

            "our first visit to e&r was about a year ago for my wife's birthday, and it was very disappointing overall. the food was decent enough, even for the price, but the service was horrible. it took over 3 hours to have dinner due to waiting, order issues and having one of the worst waiters you could possibly imagine. but i refrained from ever finishing my review and decided to give them another shot. it took a while, but we came back and chose a sunday to check out their pretty highly praised brunch.\n\nright off the bat, things were starting out way better than our first visit, and was quite possibly some of the best service i've ever gotten. we walked in at about 10:30am, the hostess took our name and got us seated in less then 10 minutes. they were able to get us a nice seat on the patio and just moments after being sat down we were greeted by the manager, who knew our names. shortly after that, our waiter (who also had our names by the way) came to take our drink order. he asked if we'd dined at e&r before, and when we told him only for dinner, he went through the brunch menu and explained some of their most popular items. during our whole brunch, every person who came to our table knew our name and were as friendly as could be. it was very impressive and a complete 180 from prior experience, but then the food came...\n\nas per the waiters suggestion, i ordered one of their signature dishes, the short rib hash. for $15 you get a healthy portion of short rib, finely diced potatoes and veggies, poached eggs and a smoked paprika hollandaise sauce. w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> the dish so disappointing was the fact t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> of it seemed to have sat under a heater or something for too long. basically half of the plate was excellent...the short ribs were moist and tender, the potatoes had a nice little crisp to them, and the egg was poached perfectly. then i got to the other half of the dish. all the meat was dry and crispy, and the egg was way overcooked. it was nearing hard boiled egg, complete with a cooked yoke. for me, those things combined just through the dish way off and was such a major let down compared to the other half i'd just eaten. \n\nwe also ordered a side of their thick cut bacon, which rings in at $8. they bring out a nice stack of <mark>1/2-inch Thick Grilled Bacon</mark> served with a side of bbq dipping sauce. this bacon is definitely thick, and has a nice charred flavor and texture from the grill. it was fatty, tender and even though i'm not a huge bbq sauce fan, it complimented the overall flavor nicely. it's something i'd definitely order again.\n\nfor w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> & rig is, their inconsistency issue are crazy. we had a great steak with terrible service once, and then came back to less then <mark>Stella</mark> food, but impeccable service. obviously this restaurant is a bit on the \"higher end\", but if you're going to charge $15 for a breakfast hash, you better be able to properly poach an egg. i can only speak for myself, but half a decent dish and a tasty side of bacon certainly isn't going to get me to come back alone. and because we had such a bad experience during dinner, i'm not so sure a 3rd visit for any meal would be a charm.", 
            "fantastic!! from the moment we walked in the customer service was <mark>Stella</mark>. the assistant manager derek first greeted us at our table followed by our server, jason. both great people t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> genuine and very knowledgeable about the menu and w<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> means to have a dinner experience. we got oysters and tuna poke to start, followed by shareable small plates of <mark>Portobello Fries</mark>, bone marrow carne asada, and steak tartare. everything was delicious and strategically coursed out by jason as far as timing was concerned. the main dish provided a giant tomahawk steak which my wife and i split and a family style dish of mashed potatoes. it was delicious, fun and everything we hoped for in going out for a special meal together. not only was the food great, the staff was prompt with clearing our dishes, we had new silverware for every course, and the people are generally pleasant to be around. i felt like i got to know them as people and t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> important to us. wonderful experience, highly recommended and will be returning soon. thanks echo & rig!!",

            "first visit to echo & rig and we were pleasantly surprise!\n\nwhen we arrived, this man was giving away free beer sample (ballast point <mark>Sierra Nevada <mark>Ballast Point Pale Ale</mark></mark>).  there is also a charcuterie  area, tables and <mark>Chai</mark>, a bar, it was quite nice.  the hostess took us upstairs where the dining area is.  it looked very classy and chic.\n\nwe were immediately greeted by our server and they have a pretty good memory on our complimentary selection of flat or sparkling water.  our table shared/tasted the following:\n-<mark>Portobello Fries</mark>: slices of thick portobello were lightly battered and served with a green aioli.  yum.\n-bone marrow:  a must try!  we all enjoyed this appetizer.\n-octopus with gigante beans and green olives: very refreshing.\n-lamb chops: seasoned to perfection and was very tender.\n-trenne: our server nicholas recommended this but for us to keep in mind t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> is not like the typical pasta.  i loved it!  i liked the crispiness and charred taste to some of the trenne.  the prime rib eye was super tender as well.  the black kale went so well with it.\n\nwe tasted nelson's hangar steak and oh boy, t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> seasoned very well and again, super tender.  e&r sure knows how to cook up a piece of meat.\n\nwe ended the meal with the berry shortcake and the caramel turtle sundae.  caramel turtle sundae was the winner of the two.\n\nour entire dinner service was <mark>Stella</mark>.  nicholas was super attentive.  even after we had paid our bill, he still made sure t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> are ok, and t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> water is topped off.\n\nwe have already made plans in the future to return for brunch!"

            "this place is the bee's knees. and if bees could eat this food they'd give this place 5 stars too. \n\nfirst off, love the decor and layout! bar area (open seating) downstairs + main dining area upstairs. it's clean and everything is spaced right (tables aren't too close, nor too far). so snaps for lovely interior design! \n\nnow the important stuff: the food. \n\ni got the sea bass -- soft and moist, with a beautifully crunchy exterior. this was served with a side of olive oil for dipping; oh and of course a lemon slice to squeeze over the fish! seriously, so flippin' delish. \n\nhusband got their most popular steak (forgive me, i can't quite remember the name, but it's basically smack dab in the middle of the menu, so your eyes focus on it almost immediately anyway! -- great placement guys!). he made sounds i've never heard him make at a restaurant before. yea. ah. may. zing. it came with a little stuffed mushroom, some housemade potato chips, and a mushroom gravy sauce (you can def taste the butter in it, yum!). \n\nso let me tell you, this was so good t<mark>Magic Hat #9</mark> our waitress took his plate (took it too soon on accident cause we were all talking and not paying attention), he shouted after her, \"no! come back! i have one more bite!\" and she didn't hear him, so he ran after her and got his plate back -- then proceeded to make the last bite into two bites (ain't he adorable?). now that's how you can tell it's a good steak. \n\noh, and for you beer enthusiasts, if you can get their <mark>Innis & Gunn Whiskey Cask</mark> beer (not always on tap), it's a must! \n\nwill definitely be returning :)"
