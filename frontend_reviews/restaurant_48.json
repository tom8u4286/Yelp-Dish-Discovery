            "the four stars are for the view - really wonderful balcony from which you can eat/seat.  the food is good, but not great.  the thai <mark>Maine Lobster Salad</mark> was incredible - the combination of flavors was perfectly executed.  the gnocchi was a bit starchy for me, the <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> was like any other good <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> (good, but it didn't wow), and the cod in cocounut foam was well-cooked (seared and crispy on the outside, tender on the inside), but the flavors didn't amaze me.  definitely go for the view, fun atmosphere, yummy cocktails - request a seat on the balcony!", 
            "i had the small tasting menu with wine. sat on the patio on the sixty something floor of the hotel! we definitely don't have this in milwaukee!\n\namuse- <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and fig jam. beautiful, layered like a parfait. just a classicly rich combination. paired with a champagne made especially for the restaurant!\n\nfirst course-<mark>Maine Lobster Salad</mark> with coral dressing. perfectly poached lobster...very good!\n\nsecond course- roasted cod over <mark>Cod Brandade</mark>. i am usually not a cod fan, but this was so soft and buttery, there was no way to improve on it! paired with a chardonnay that cut through the fattiness well.\n\nthird course- <mark>Roasted Duck Breast</mark> with braised diakon and baby vegetables. another very well done dish. one negative though; one piece of duck was so tough that i had to discard it.paired with a very big bold zin.\n\npre-dessert- a really fun passion fruit and guava puree with a coconut foam, served in a martini glass!\n\ndessert- i think it was called a tropical fruit fantasy. tons of different fresh fruit with a tropical sorbet. paired with more champagne.\n\ni ended my night looking out over the vegas skyline,sipping champagne, munching on tender little madeleines that came with the bill ($185), thinking, \"life is good!\"", 
            "the decor here is amazing! loved the floor to ceiling light installment (not sure what else to call it) in the middle of the restaurant, the pod-like booths for 2, and the gorgeous view out of the windows from the 64th floor of thehotel. \n\nthe food didn't really measure up to the decor i thought.\n\nwe had:\nbluefin tartare with taro chips\n<mark>Maine Lobster Salad</mark> with lobster vinaigrette\n<mark>Tender Potato Gnocchi</mark> with pumpkin two ways and crispy pancetta\npork loin and belly with grits and swiss chard\nbeef tenderloin with potato macaire and bearnaise\ndiver scallops with brandade ravioli and clam chowder sauce\nchocolate souffle\n\nthey were all kind of unremarkable. i do remember the beef tenderloin being pretty tender. the chocolate souffle was good and the freshly baked madeleines at the end of the meal were a nice touch.\n\nafter dinner, we went next door to the lounge for some drinks.", 
            "i went to mix restaurant this past weekend. my girlfriend and i had a great experience. the restaurant is located at the very top of the hotel at manadalay bay. the entire restaurant is white. when i first walked in i was initially disappointed in the view. i had expected a lot more, but as the day turned to night, the view was actually pretty nice. the food was very good. we ended up order the chef's tasting menu. our meal started of with a <mark>Maine Lobster Salad</mark>....yummy. we then had buttered cod, followed by a exceptionally soft tenderloin. the chef was kind enough to replace the duck dish with the beef tenderloin, because we did not feel like duck. my overall experience was great. you can never go wrong at a restaurant that has a michelin star.  also, the environment didn't seem at pretentious as other upscale restaurants i have eaten in.", 
            "mix was a huge, did i say huge, disappointment.  i would not recommend it to my enemies.  i would have hoped that for a $400 bill (for 2 people) i would get to experience some amazing food.  \n\nthe restaurant itself is beautifully decorated, with strung glass 'bubbles' acting as the sculptural centerpiece of the entire dining room.  my co-worker and i asked to be seated by the window to enjoy the beautiful las vegas night view from the 64th floor of  the hotel.  the hostess very coldly told us that the only-left window table was reserved for a \"marketing\" party.  wtf.  and for the record, that table was empty the entire night.\n\nwe decided to go for the \"a taste of mix\" tasting menu, the wine pairing, and the <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> appetizer.  pretty much fail.  we began our eating experience with an amuse bouche concoction of goat cheese, a yellowy mash, and an olive.  the girl sitting at the table next to us blurted out \"gross\" when our server described what it was.  and indeed, it was gross.  it felt like gunk in my mouth.    \n\nfor starters, we had the <mark>Maine Lobster Salad</mark>.  the lobster was juicy and delicious with the sweetness of the melon. if you are ever unsure about what appetizer to order, you can always count on the <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> being good at basically any sf restaurant.  the <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> here had no flavor and desperately needed to be hit with some lime juice to punch up the flavors.  it was just a bland blob for $24.  \n\nwe moved onto our main courses - the stripped bass and <mark>Roasted Duck Breast</mark>.  the bass was delicious with a sprinkling of little asparagus slices.  however, the blanquette sauce was a bit too cheesy for me after a few bites.  the duck was just weird.  it looked like a lame piece of boiled strip of meat that you would think would cut easily, but no, it was difficult to cut.  it did not have much flavor and simply did not look appetizing.  the baby turnips that the server said was \"slowly cooked for 5 hours\" looked like something my mom could whip out in 10 mins.    \n\ni must say that the pre-dessert was the bright light during this dinner.  the passion fruit juice/mix of sorts topped with a sweet coconuty frothy cream in a martini was delicious.  the sweetness of the cream and the tartness worked beautifully.  \n\nthe tropical fruit sensation, consisting of guava sorbet and finely diced mango and other fruits was another let down.  the sorbet was incredibly tart and the fruits simply added to the tartness.  it desperately needed something sweet (like chocolate) to balance it out.  our server noticed that we did no finish much of our plates and gave us freshly baked madeline cookies (right out of the molds) with some nutella.  it was ok.  lol...not enough to make it a good dinner.\n\nin addition to the pre-dessert, i thoroughly enjoyed my wine pairings.  i am not a wine person, but i did get to try two awesomely sweet wines - the 2007 riesling, dr thanisch and the 2007 moscato d'asti, d. rivetti. yum yum yum :)\n\nyou are better off going to the bellagio buffet.  or just having a drink at the adjacent mix lounge while enjoying the view.  i would suggest you gamble away $400 then going here.  at least then you might get something in return.", 
            "we had a bachelorette party for a friend of ours in vegas and this was perfect for what we were looking for.  we weren't the crazy, wildest b-party girls, so we were looking for something more elegant-ish with a fun atmosphere.  we thought about going to tao since we already knew it'd be loud and crowded  (food at tao is great also and probably perfect for loud bachelorette parties), but we've already been there and were looking for something nicer. \n\nmix could be a date place or a girls' night out place.  the decor is very white, but pretty and the view is amazing.  plus, they have a lounge area next to the restaurant on the top floor of the mandalay bay, so you can always hop over there for drinks after a great meal. the restaurant was actually kind of empty for a saturday night, so it may have been a bit too quiet for a bachelorette dinner.... \n\nour overall experience was very positive - our waiter was friendly and took the time to explain everything to us.  when one of the girls said her drink tasted like cough syrup, he gladly made her a new drink.  the food was so good and the bread was good too!  we shared:\n\n1) <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> \n2) spicy <mark>Maine Lobster Salad</mark>\n3) bison\n4) halibut\n\nfood: 4/5 stars\nservice: 5/5 stars\nambiance: 4/5 stars\nprice: on the pricier side, but a lot of things in vegas are.", 
            "this review is for the restaurant. \nmy husband and i came here for our 5 year anniversary dinner tonight. i did my research and thought this would be a good place to go. the food was wonderful. we had, for starters, the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> (half order), <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> (half order), and <mark>Maine Lobster Salad</mark>. for our entrees we had the <mark>Braised Wagyu</mark> and <mark>Cod Brandade</mark>. both were very tasty. for my dessert i had the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> w/ caramel ice cream. \nmy gripes with this restaurant was that we were seated on a round table between two square tables. it was awkwardly situated and did not make for a very comfortable meal. at least we were seated by a window with a pretty nice view. my next gripe is with the waiter (big caucasian blond guy) who talked and laughed with the tables next to us and made no effort with the two of us. i wonder if it's because we didn't order a bottle of wine. i forgot my zantac, so i didn't think drinking wine would be wise. my husband ordered a mojito and he totally forgot about it prompting us to have to remind him and when he wanted a second drink, we had to ask the busboy (sorry, i don't know what to call him). by the way, the busboy and the buslady were nice and friendly. my husband wanted to give the waiter a bad tip, but i convinced him against it because i wanted the other helpful staff to get what they deserved. we tipped the usual 18% even though the waiter clearly didn't deserve it. with the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and wagyu we weren't sure what we were supposed to eat it with. a good waiter would have made suggestions for sides to improve the enjoyment of our meal. \nso the verdict: the food was great, but the experience was lacking considering the amount of money we spent, $200+.\ni've been to many amazing restaurants, including french laundry, jar, lucques, osteria mozza, etc... this was by far the worst experience i've ever had at a fine dining establishment.", 
            "mix is one of the best spots in town.  the food is amazing. \n\n\nthe caviar plate is phenomenal and well worth the $160 charge. \n<mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> and <mark>Maine Lobster Salad</mark> are phenomenal.\n\nall the fish we had was amazing.  my pork belly was one of the best things i've ever tasted.\n\nservice is impeccable.", 
            "what an incredible experience!  if you are looking for an amazing view of the strip and a wonderful meal....you have to try this place.\n\nthe views from the restaurant and the adjacent lounge are awesome.  the lounge has an outdoor seating area with heat lamps when it is chilly.\n\nwe had a wonderful <mark>Maine Lobster Salad</mark> as a starter.  for the main course we both ordered steaks, cooked to perfection.  the sides of fork crushed potatoes and mushrooms were tasty.\n\ngreat wine list and great service.  we will absolutely dine here again!\n\ntoo bad the casino wasn't as friendly and our winnings were non-existent!  ;)", 
            "the view is the best part of the restaurant, and a good portion of it is blocked by poorly positioned bathrooms.  some bad design choices.  oh, and getting seated underneath the chandelier with the low ceilings is awful.  try not to be there.\n\nthe food was hit or miss; the lamb was excellently prepared, but the strip looked terrible.  the gnocchi was flavorful and well balanced, while the <mark>Maine Lobster Salad</mark> was bland and forgettable.  \n\nand whatever the name of the dessert with the armagnac-soaked bread is, it's terrible.  avoid at all costs.\n\nservice was average; my water wasn't refilled nearly quickly enough, and drinks were very slow in coming.  the servers also screwed up plating virtually everyone's appetizers, which was more entertaining than annoying, but still worth noting.\n\nbeing vegas, you can do better.", 
            "wonderful experience.  great decor and outstanding views. top notch service. staff was friendly and very professional.  we had the <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> appetizer and the <mark>Maine Lobster Salad</mark> - both delicious. the lobster curry entree was a true stunner. mac and cheese was great.  cod entree also delicious.  the complimentary cookies and chocolate sauce were wonderful.  would come back in a hurry!", 
            "thank you mix for taking my virginity! the first time i ever had <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> was at this restaurant and until now i still dream of it. if you never had <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, you are truly missing out. it tastes nothing like liver. it's buttery, smooth, with a hint of beef that melts in your mouth. almost like bone marrow. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mix-las-vegas#qwfprp-vh7u53bmj3pgvrg\nalmost everything about this dish was perfect. the sear, sauce, and texture was right on. the only element of the dish i disliked was the chutney.\n\nthe mixed bread, butter, and peanut butter spread were irresistible. i couldn't help but sample each style of bread and top it with the peanut butter. we ended up ordering 3 baskets of bread and extra peanut butter. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mix-las-vegas#mng-hx8y9jkqz2ih8u7l_a\n\nmy girlfriend ordered the main <mark>Maine Lobster Salad</mark> and my daughter order the <mark>Braised Wagyu</mark>. sorry no pics. i was busy adoring my <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>. the salad had a gratifying amount of lobster meat and the wagyu beef texture was tender and bursting with flavor. three thumbs up from the eaters. there was enough sauce leftover from the wagyu that i was able to soak it up with the mixed bread. i made a treat of out it. \n\nwe finished the dinner with a chocolate souffl\\u00e9 coupled with pistachio ice cream. the scent of chocolate drifted to the table next to me enough to turn heads and ask what i ordered. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mix-las-vegas#-ajweqfqj1tugr92hgbxdq\nit was warm chocolate heaven. the pistachio ice cream can be a hit or miss depending on your taste buds. \n\nmix has a spectacular view of las vegas. there is outside seating in the balcony but it was just too hot to even consider. the decor is light, hip, and trendy with the chandelier as the main attraction. the service was excellent. as for the wines, i didn't order any this time so i can't give a review. like the saying goes, what happens in vegas, stays in vegas. and that is where my wonderful <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> will stay. i'm looking forward to my next visit.", 
            "huhfor starters, if you are terrified of heights do not use the main elevator, its has glass walls and you will poop your pants on the way up. \n\nthis is a review about the restaurant not bar. \n\ni made reservations for the bf birthday. no wait, even though the place was almost empty, it started to fill up at the end. anyways, the waitress was a little snobby but i got over that because i am use to that in san diego. i ordered the <mark>Maine Lobster Salad</mark> for starters and it was amazing!!! \n\nmain course, i had the fois gras, in which, i only brought because its illegal everywhere else, and i had the mac and cheese which tasted awful. the bf had the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> with fois gras that he really enjoyed but the mashed potatoes was a miss. \n\nso 2 stars for the ambiance. \nanother star for the sommelier they have walking around to help you pair the wine to your meal.\nand the last star for writing happy birthday in chocolate on my bfs dessert and the delicious cocktails.",

            "my first visit to this restaurant--overall was very good.  the  views are excellent, i thought the service was wonderful--matt , the sommelier, was excellent.  started with the <mark>Maine Lobster Salad</mark>--wonderful presentation, had just the right amount of seasonings.  this was followed with the scallops--they were prepared well, how ever, the mushrooms that accompanied them seemed to me to be too earthy for this light seafood.  had the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> accompanied with a wonderful date and raisin compote--sweet and delicate.  tried the charcuterie plate, was surprised with the simple yet tasty samples of prosciutto and rosemary cotto ham . main course was the lamb--excellent preparation and presentation.  seasoned very well.  finished every thing off with the chocolate souffle--very light and flavorful.  overall had a wonderful time, atmosphere was very upscale and modern, as i said earlier, the views are great. definitely a good place to visit."

            "mix is my favorite spot in vegas. mix restaurant has a great atmosphere but the food is just ok for the price. (<mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> excellent; fliet decent). mix lounge is a great place to hangout. the view (top of the south end of the strip looking north) is the best on or off the strip. i had assumed that the luxor would block its view but that's totally not the case. there's an outdoor section divided up between general balcony and bottle service. i recommend the bottle service, not as pricey as a real club and more breathing room. and the waitresses are more attentive than other places. not that the rest of the lounge is super crowded.", 
            "i had the grand tasting menu, one of my dining companions had the lower leveled tasting menu and another one of us just ordered regular appetizer and main course dishes. we all ended up sharing everything which gave a great tasting of everything. both tasting menus had hits and misses. the most memorable dishes of the night were the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, cod, <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> and lobster (in that order). we had a side of mac and cheese that was delish! and the floating island dessert was light and a very appropriate ending to a decadent meal. with the decor and the view.. the totality of this restaurant experience was greater than sum of its parts.", 
            "atmosphere-\n\n* on the 64th floor, so no smoke from the casino.  the restaurant was non smoking.  that said, the bar was either smoking or non-smoking was not enforced.  at certain tables it may not truly be non smoking.  not sure about this.  \n\n* on the 64th floor, the best view of vegas\n\n* 15,000 glass ball chandelier, really cool.\n\n* we got sat next to the balcony.  one reviewer noted how hot it was outside; today it was ~50 f and ~6 tables near the balcony froze every time the door opened (which was a lot!).  this could easily be you, so be warned.  you might also sweat every time the door opens, depending on time of year.  \n\n\nservice\n\n* they showed a cheap tasting menu downstairs.  when we got upstairs, they said they didn't have it.  not cool\n\n* the waiters were very fast and attentive without being intrusive.  entire staff, from waiters to busboys were really fast.  our appetizers were out in record time.  terrific service.\n\nfood\n\n* kind of expensive\n\n* very good.  had the lobster, beef/<mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>, and gnocchi plus the mix candy for dessert.\n\n\noverall: go for the view.  service is great.  food is very good but $$.  would give this a 4.5 star on food and service alone.  but the other stuff lower the rating. don't trust them when they offer cheap tasting menus.    the quality of your experience may vary depending on where you get seated - and not because of the view but because of the temperature and the cigarette smoke.",

            "i had had enough of watching the creation of impressive high-end dishes on top chef with relentless envy.  never could i taste and enjoy.  my frustration led me to the need to be wined and dined at an amazing restaurant.  fellow yelpers led me here: to mix restaurant.\n\nmy bf and i headed over to mandalay bay and started with some confusion as to the location of the restaurant.  after some inquires and a long walk, we found it!  well we found mix lounge and walked through the dark area into the light.  i would describe this restaurant with its hanging clear globes and immaculately white decor as trendy.  on a busy friday night with a 9pm reservation, the dining room was a bit loud and full.  we weren't looking for romantic, just impressive.  along with the amazing vegas views, the room was breathtaking.\n\nfood\nwe were looking to be completely indulgent and opted for the grand tasting menu-more than six courses.  in addition, we went with the wine pairings as an extra!  we began with the amuse bouche: a ceviche with apple gelee.  nice way to start the meal.  the spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> was a refreshing follow-up, one of my favorite courses.  the <mark>Tender Potato Gnocchi</mark> sat atop a pumkin puree and was topped with applewood smoked bacon-delicious.  the scallop dish had only one scallop but boy was it amazing!  for me, the lobser curry and rice dish was the showstopper.  i was delighted with the generous lobster portions-perfect!  for the bf, he loved the next course: lamb accompanied by eggplant and tomato.  i enjoyed the lamb but dislike the consistency of the roasted eggplant.  the visual appeal was also lacking (the only one out of all the previous dishes).  the one-noted brown on the plate did little to impress.  the pre-dessert was a fruity martini 2-layer concoction:  frothy pina colada on taop and thick guava nectar on bottom.  last came the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> plated along side a coconut lime ice cream.  the contrast between the chocolate and citrus ice cream was interesting and tasty.  we thought we were through but a server brought freshly baked madelines with a chocolate sauce.  although we appreciated the dessert, the other dessert far surpassed the cookies.\n\nwine pairings\nbe careful!  we were tipsy mid-way through the dinner even though we did not finish each of the 3oz. pourings of each wine.  all the wines complimented each dish perfectly.  the last wine was a dessert sherry that we didn't want to leave behind so we took it over to the lounge and enjoyed it there.\n\nservice\nthe service was impeccable from the beginning, however, we didn't appreciate being rushed through the end, especially with the amount of money we were spending.  the waiter informed us that the staff was waiting for us to pay off our check as he brought it over so that they could leave their shifts.  we weren't being asked to leave, he said, just pay quickly.  it was just 11pm (closing time) and a few other patrons were still there.  they lost a star for making us feel uncomfortable towards the end of the meal. i didn't expect that from an establishment such as this one and don't want to be made to feel that way again.\n\ni absolutely would recommend mix and return again but i'll make sure to plan on an earlier reservation.", 
            "spectacular view, but if you still opt to sit indoors while you eat their decor is inviting to be around. \n\ni ordered the <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> for an appetizer and the halibut for dinner. the <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> was very tasty and had a some spice to it. i specifically ordered the halibut bc it said it was saffron infused, and anything and everything saffron makes me happy. unfortunately for me the halibut was too salty. i was grabbing water wherever i could for the rest of the night. ordering sides here is a must. amongst all the sides we ordered creamed spinach was the tastiest :) \n\nthey also brought out mini (i think it was bacon/asparagus) soups for us \"compliments of the chef\" so that we could \"open our pallets\", nice! \n\nservice: very v-e-r-y s--l--o--w. i like it when i'm out with a significant other, it lets you enjoy your meal to the fullest, but we were there for a bachelorette party heading out for some dancing after wards, maybe the waiter can tune into how the vibe of each table is rather than a \"one size fits all\" service? \nalso my halibut came out later than everyone else's bc apparently it fell apart in the kitchen right before they were coming out with it and the chef didn't like the presentation. sure i was hungry but i liked that the chef cared that much, plus they brought out an additional appetizer for me to enjoy while i waited. thoughtful/attentive +1! \n\nso my one and only complaint. we called during the afternoon to make reservations at mix. it being our first choice on where to go eat we were bummed that they told us they had no room to take an 8:00pm reservation. we began calling around literally everywhere around vegas for dinner reservations (we were there during fight weekend so it was really difficult to land any) we did finally find a place to eat but we still wanted to eat at mix bc a friend spoke highly of it. my sister came up with a little idea that we call back and tell them that we already had reservations and that we were calling to confirm (sneaky sneaky!) at first they told us we were not within their books, but that they would be happy to put us in. cool! so i'm thinking they're probably slammed and they somehow squeezed us in and just for that they got a plus one star from me. but when we got there, literally 10 tables were wide open and for the remainder of our dinner there were plenty of tables still open. i immediatly took back my +1 point and felt that they were shady with their reservation service. why would the girl over the phone tell us they had no space when there was tons? very weird and strange. i didn't like that at all. \n\nother than that, although i would like to try eating at different places while on vacation, if i had to go back i'd be more than happy to.", 
            "on one side of this restaurant is the restaurant, and the other side is the lounge, the views are amazing and beautiful on the 64th floor but the food in general is soso. i came here for a dinner and the decor blows me away. there is a spiral staircase in the middle, private 2 person booths line the restaurant so you can see the view, and the place is a decked out in white. they accent it with bits of red to add a contrast. that is probably where my favorites of this place end. \n\ni had the spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>, it had chunks of crab and avocado and veggies. it was just ok. other people in the party ordered the fish, the free range chicken which was very moist, and the filet. everything was just kind of bland and nothing special. my favorite thing was the walnut and raisin bread which i asked for seconds. the bread comes with regular butter and a peanut butter flavored butter. that was very interesting.  i liked how at the end they give you a complimentary madeline with a hazelnut (basically nutella) dip. i would of given it a 1 star if it wasn't for the amazing decor, probably one of my favorites in vegas, too bad the food isn't up to par and the menu has a very limited selection.", 
            "i had one of the best entrees of my life at mix! the halibut with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, truffle oil vinaigrette, atop a bed of brussels sprouts leaves with a hint of ginger... i die.\n\ni thoroughly enjoyed my dessert of chocolate souffle, which was ever light, warm, and the perfect amount of chocolatey-ness. the pistachio ice cream complements the souffle perfectly. \n\nmy cousin and i split the lobster ceasar salad, which was delish (we suspect there was lobster roe in the dressing...so delicious) but not worth the $26. \n\ni really liked the taste i had of the lobster curry. the cod was good too! oh and the <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> appetizer! \n\nthe only off thing was the grandpa's hat dessert. it looks too perfect and when you destroy it, it loses appeal. \n\nall in all, a wonderful dining experience! \n\ncheck out the bathroom before you leave, it's a treat. \n\nnot to mention, the view from 64 floors up is spectacular.",

            "this review is for the restaurant mix.... \nwe have been to the mix lounge so many times that it was finally time to give their restaurant a try. we each tried their tasting menu with wine pairing and it included the following: \n\namuse bouche \n\nspicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>: this was super fresh and made a great starter to the rest of the meal. the portion was great too. the riesling that it was paired with was excellent as well. \n\nbutternut squash ravioli: served with butter emulsion and super creamy...probably my favorite dish! another white was served along with it. \n\nseared diver scallops: the scallop was excellent, however, i did not enjoy the citrus endive marmalade it was served with...kinda reminded me of sour onions. \n\nrack of colorado lamb: it was served with piquillo peppers and delicious. at this point in time it was getting harder and harder to enjoy my wine, so the hubby had to start helping me with the wine pairings. we had already enjoyed a few at the lounge before dinner is my excuse! \n\npre-dessert: was more like a very sweet & tangy, frothy shake. \n\narmagnac ice cream: a creamy puff pastry...took one bite and i was done! this one is served with a port and i'm not a fan of port so i passed on it. \n\nservice: excellent! our server was awesome and he even allowed my hubby to swap out his scallops for the lobster with no extra charge. we used a restaurant.com coupon and had no problem at all...it was definitely worth it. \n\ni was pretty happy with our meal here, but also pretty buzzed by the end of meal too! overall, great place to enjoy a romantic dinner or for small groups.", 
            "mix has it all: impeccable service, delicious food, beautiful view, and lovely decor...what more can you ask for especially when you pre-purchase a giftcard on restaurant.com for $50 off your exquisite dining experience?!  the restaurant is perfect for a special occasion.  you should go to the open air lounge area to take pictures of the amazing view of the glittering lights of the strip.\n\nmy absolute favorite restaurant in vegas.  it is where luxury meets affordability. i recommend the <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> for appetizer, the caramel butter cod, and sauteed mushrooms.  i always get the same dishes since i love them so much, but i will attempt to try new ones too since they all look yummy.  try to save room for dessert, but i always have a hard time since the complimentary bread with homemade peanut butter always become too tempting!\n\nthe french manager nicolas is wonderful, and he made extra efforts to ensure my friend's request for vegetarian dishes can be accommodated.\n\nmerci beaucoup!", 
            "mix has a great view, but the food is average. the gnocchi were not very good, the spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> was so so, the scallops were ok. overall, it is one level down from aureole. the highlight for me was the green tea, which was good.", 
            "first dinner of the new year @mix. we came for the view and the food and the restaurant did not disappoint.  \n\na private glass elevator takes you directly to the top while you enjoy the view on the ascent to the 65th floor. it was a little confusing arriving in the dark and walking thru a long bar/club area and then past the kitchens before we were greeted (a hostest was not present at the booth either so we were confused on where to go). however, we did eventually find our table. the decor is a curtain of glass bubbles with white and red accents.  this place looked ready for a great valentine's day date. \n\nour cheerful and friendly server arrived soon after we were seated in our booth and was eager to please us. throughout our service, he provided detailed descriptions about the dishes and knowledgeable explanations about how each entree was prepared.  he was as excited talking about the food as we were to try it!\n\nwe started with the <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>.  it had all my favorite ingredients (fresh crab, avocado, cilantro, cucumber, etc) but there was a lingering bitter aftertaste that we could not place. it distracted from the flavors of the dish and we were ready to move on to the  next course.\n\nfor the main course, i tried the rack of lamb/tenderloin with a tian of eggplant.  the lamb was so flavorful and tender (prepared seared and then sous vide) on a bed of caramelized onions with tomato and the eggplant, tomato tian was bursting with fresh flavor that complemented the lamb well.  my husband ordered the atlantic seabass in a shellfish sauce.  also well prepared (seared and then baked) with melt in your mouth flavors. \n\nevery meal should end on a sweet note and mix reserves a whole page of their menu just for dessert!  i ordered the profiteroles for one.  it's 6 mini cream puffs served with some homemade chocolate sauce and a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream.  it reminded me of a \"deconstructed\" eclair. my husband opted for the signature <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark>. covered in chocolate with gold leaf and delicate wafer thin slices inside - it's a <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> to eat with a fork, if only to savor it a little bit longer. the lime coconut sorbet that comes with the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> is more lime than coconut and provides a tart contrast (maybe too much) to the delicately sweet <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark>.  compliments of our server, we received another delight with a freshly baked lemon madeleine (served right out of the pan) to dip in chocolate spread to top off our evening. \n\nas you stroll along on your way out, there are bathrooms tucked away just before the elevator. in the ladies room, two of the stalls have floor to ceiling windows for you to gaze outside as you go about your business (i'm told there's a similar set up in the men's room).  it takes a moment to remind yourself that it's one-way glass and what you really came to the ladies room to do. \n\nall in all, dinner at mix was a great start to the new year. \n\nsummary: delicious food, awesome views, great service. definitely would recommend to a friend and we will return again.", 
            "i really wanted to love mix. i had heard a lot of good things and decided we would finally give it a try. what a disappointment. when my husband and i first arrived, no one was there to greet us. we waited and finally decided to ask someone for assistance. an employee said we could go sit in the lounge and they would come get us. our reservation was at 6. it was 6:15, and no one came to the lounge so we yet again had to find someone to help us. we finally get seated and the server asks us if we had a show to catch. we told her no but i wish we had said yes because they were so slow. we were literally there almost 3 hours! i understand we had the pre fixe dinners, but 3 hours is excessive. \n\nwe each got a different pre fixe meal - the $90 and the $120 one and decided we would share everything. if i am paying over $100 pp person for dinner, i expect it to be good - damn good. what a disappointment. so, here is a run down of each item:\n\nspicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> - the crab part wasn't bad but there was something really off in this salad. we could not put our finger on it but if whatever it was, was left it, it would have probably tasted a lot better. \n\nbutternut squash ravioli - pretty good\n\nseared diver scallops - these were also very good\n\nlamb - was actually the best lamb i've ever had although the eggplant whatever else was in the side dish that came with it was disgusting and i love eggplant. \n\n<mark>Tender Potato Gnocchi</mark> - this wasn't bad\n\nlobster \"au curry\" - i think the way it was prepared ruined the dish. had the rice and the lobster been separate dishes it would have been much better. i ended up eating them separately so as to not ruin the taste of the lobster. lobster is good as it is, why try and dress it up just to ruin it? \n\nfilet minion - very good. cooked perfectly. \n\nboth desserts were very good. \n\n2 dinners, 2 light beers and 2 mixed drinks made our bill come out to $375, which included gratuity. luckily we had a $50 certificate from restaurant.com and we had comps from our players card so we ended up paying $130 out of pocket. had we paid more, i would have been really unhappy. our meal wasn't even worth the $130 we paid. i admit the view is amazing and they have some good options for dinner, but i say if you want to see the view, go to the lounge, see the view and then leave. there are a million other places in vegas where you could spend much less and get a much better meal!", 
            "i try to go to mix once a year, while i'm on business trips to vegas. phenomenal view of the strip, and a great bar to boot. interesting people watching also.\n\nas for the food: everything is pretty much spot-on perfect. great desserts, appetizers, meals. i wasn't wow'd by the charcuterie plate, so skip that. the spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> was out of this world, as was the lobster \"au curry.\"  when in doubt, stay away from the bread - you'll regret it as you'll be so glutinously full!\n\ni've always had great service there, with the exception of my latest february visit - our waitress was really good, but got snarky towards the end. nevertheless, worth the food, view, and price!", 
            "i had a great time at mix. i originally reserved for 2 people at 9pm. my horrible airport experience forced me to be 10-15 minutes late and not be able to change into a nicer outfit. they were very nice about the tardiness, assuming how the restaurant hours was until 10pm, and usually these dinners take long. my date and i were not rushed or anything during our dinner.\n\nthis place is beautiful! the bubbly decor coming from the ceiling made me think that i was dining under the sea. yet i'm at the very top of thehotel at mandalay bay. our booth was facing the backside of the strip, so the scenery was more mellow and calming than the glamorous strip, my dinner felt extremely relaxing although i was rushing there and freaking out at the airport.\n\nwe both ordered the tasting menu, which had a spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, halibut, <mark><mark>Colorado Lamb Loin</mark></mark>, and the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark>. i believe the entire table has to choose one of the tasting menus if any wanted to try it. my date didn't want to in the beginning since he wasn't into <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> or lamb. our server offered to switch out the lamb for the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> for $10 extra. \n\nwe started off the meal with a scallop ceviche. i enjoyed it a lot, it's very light, and the lime juice wasn't too overwhelming like most of the places that served ceviche. it was just right. it's interesting how they have some shredded raw mango on top, felt like some type of fusion going on here. \n\ni was enthralled by the looks of the spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>. very detailed with different layers of ingredients stacked up, but i had too high of expectations on the flavors. i don't recall it being spicy or crabby enough. for spiciness, i might be immune so my taste buds are less sensitive to spiciness. i was a bit disappointed there.\n\nsecond course came about with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> with lemon confit & dates. i liked how mine was seared just right, where it's more rare inside. i love the aftertaste and the aroma from each bite. unfortunately, i'm not too educated in <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, all i can tell you is if i liked it and met my expectations of it. i got to eat my date's piece too, since he's not too interested in something this rich in taste. his piece was a bit more cooked than mine, easier to slice, i just prefer a softer texture.\n\nthird course was the best one yet, halibut prepared in chicken jus and vegetable blanquette. every. bite. was. amazing. my general perception of halibut is that it's very bland and tasteless. this dish had such interesting flavors in many different layers. the flavors in every bite were going under transformation inside my mouth. i seriously don't want to finish this dish because i don't want the experience to end. \n\nfourth course was my <mark><mark>Colorado Lamb Loin</mark></mark>, with stuffed piquillo peppers and prommes anna. portions were generous, or maybe i was just very full. the spices on the <mark><mark>Colorado Lamb Loin</mark></mark> didn't take away the flavors of the lamb at all. i didn't like the meat inside the piquillo peppers though, it was a bit too tough. otherwise, the whole pepper was fun to eat; it's not the textures that were interesting but flavors of the pepper and the meat were well blended. the prommes anna was very crispy in the outside, you can feel the flakey texture with your tongue too. unfortunately i was hitting my maximum capacity.\n\nthat's when they brought out our pre-dessert. it was a sweet drink with mango puree tasted sweet and sour, topped with some coconut rum foam. it reminded me of thailand, maybe because of the tropical taste. the tart taste ease up the digestion, which was just what i needed!\n\nand finally, the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> of mix served with coconut/lime sorbet. the looks of it wasn't too spectacular, just a bar with a piece of gold flake and two half nuts on top. yes gold flake isn't too spectacular. i liked the simplicity of it though. it tasted like a ferrero rocher in a bar form served with the sorbet on the side. the combination is great. the sweetness of the chocolate is evened out with a light citrus.\n\nour dinner ended at 11:30-11:45. it would have been a nightmare if they didn't tolerate that 10 minutes of tardiness. in addition, our server offered us to their lounge with no covers. it was a great offer monetary-wise, but we were just in such a rush before that we were nowhere close in dressed properly for lounges. maybe next time :)", 
            "mix is one of the best spots in town.  the food is amazing. \n\n\nthe caviar plate is phenomenal and well worth the $160 charge. \n<mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> and <mark>Maine Lobster Salad</mark> are phenomenal.\n\nall the fish we had was amazing.  my pork belly was one of the best things i've ever tasted.\n\nservice is impeccable.", 
            "as stunningly beautiful as it is, eating at mix is kind of like eating in an airport terminal or a shopping mall. the high ceilings and glass and granite surfaces create an echo effect, so every sound reverberates off the walls and floors and just makes for an unsettling dining experience.\n\nacoustics aside, the food was pretty decent, although not quite as impressive as we had hoped. the best dish of the evening was the spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>. elegantly presented on a bed of guacamole and topped with shredded heart of palm, it was lively and fresh and made you feel like you were at a resort in cabo. the <mark>Cod Brandade</mark> was acceptable, but i was expecting exceptional. the lemon and capers just weren't enough to brighten up the bland brown butter sauce and the soggy fried parsley. and the <mark>Roasted Duck Breast</mark> was so forgettable that i simply forgot what went with it.\n\nwe were very impressed, however, with the wine service. we didn't want to order a bottle, so we just asked the somm to pair our dishes for us. he seemed to enjoy the challenge and was a delight to talk to.\n\none last note: i realize there isn't much the restaurant can do, but people really should not bring young children to these kinds of places. it's inappropriate and inconsiderate to your fellow diners -- especially so at mix because the sound of your rug rats squealing and shouting gets amplified throughout the entire restaurant.", 
            "came here for dinner, not the lounge portion, but if you want beautiful panoramas of the city i highly suggest you start here. but, be careful, they seem to be pretty snotty about outdoor seating even when the place is empty. call ahead.\n\nas for dinner, the restaurant is beautiful. you walk in and get instant visual stimulation. it's incredible. from the decor to the lights of the city all around, it really is just a place that draws you in. \n\nthere were a few thins that happened that could have been avoided and this would have been a four star experience. the first incident was being seated in a cozy little nook where conversation could be had without being so close to the next person you feel like you're sharing family secrets. that didn't last long. the hostess immediately, in a bare, empty, no one-there restaurant, seats people right next to me and my date. hello? that is beyond rude. i mean, the tables are so close together as to be really uncomfortable. to use the bathroom i literally had to wedge myself between my table and the one next to us. awkward. also, the waiter, when asked for my favorite belgian beer tried to tell me they only carried one type. i had to insist that he go ask someone because he was wrong (for the record, chimay comes in blue, white and red). \n\nother than those two missteps everything was okay. the service was quick and flawless. the time between waiter visits was perfect. i had to ask for water just one time and after that i couldn't take a sip without it being refilled. so, great job of picking up on that. we were also greeted by several people on our way in which i thought was a very nice touch.\n\nonto dinner. for appetizers i had the dinner salad which was essentially a larger than average bowl of mixed greens. it was mixed with a vinaigrette of some sort that just added to the bitter taste of the overall salad. i wouldn't recommend. my date had the spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> which was delicious, but absolutely could have come from mom's kitchen. what can i say, my mom's a great cook! \n\nfor an entree i had the 12 oz. <mark>Boneless Ribeye</mark>. it was cooked perfectly, but was much too large for me to eat so i brought the extra home. it was delicious. it did happen to be more of a fatty cut than i was used to, excessively so. it was fine, but i prefer less fat, more beef, obviously. for sides i chose the fork crushed potatoes. they were chunky and rich, but again, they could have come from my mom's kitchen. \n\nmy date had the <mark>Pepper Crusted Bison Tenderloin</mark> and seemed to enjoy it. i dislike that much pepper anywhere near me, but it looked delicious. his side was sauteed spinach which he found delicious. \n\nfor dessert i passed, but my friend had the ice cream/toppings. you get four choices of either and he chose pistachio ice cream, salted caramel ice cream and vanilla ice cream with coconut crunch as a topping. the pistachio was creamy and rich, i loved it. i could have done without the coconut, but really it wasn't a distraction. i disliked intensely the salted caramel. it tasted very bland and very unlike any salted caramel i've ever tasted. i almost think that's a taste that belongs solely in candy form. i just don't think it translates well to other things, which isn't the fault of the restaurant, i've just never found that it works on much else but candy. as for the vanilla, well, it was vanilla. \n\nall in all the decor, charm and service were perfection. the food was so enjoyable although i didn't get the michelin star experience, i don't think. the food really was good and the view was just beautiful. with all the restaurants in vegas, though, i doubt i'll revisit. but, do go try it once!", 
            "the food here was pretty good. i got the spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> which was great, my mom got the lobster that was pretty good to,but not as good as the spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>.  for our main course i got the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> on top. the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> had an eggy taste at least it did to me,my mom thought it was good.", 
            "my most recent visit was not like the first one. the hostess was very pleasant. i'd hate to call him a busboy but the man who brought water and cleared the dishes was also awesome. however, our waiter was less than enthusiastic being there. it seems he didn't spend any time studying the menu. \n\ni remember mix as having a staff that knows the menu inside out, how every dish was prepared and the best way to enjoy each course. our waiter seemed like he was filling in for someone, having difficulty explaining the menu. \n\nwe didn't do the tasting menu this time, and instead ordered a la carte.\n\nthe spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> was not the least bit spicy, but very good otherwise.\n<mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> & the seabass were both delicious\nthe ribeye was cooked perfectly, but contained a huge chunk of fat, signaling it was a bad cut of meat.\n\nperhaps the least impressive was the dessert. the <mark>Baba a L'armagnac</mark> was a plain cake served on a citrus reduction, w/ whipped cream and liquer to pour over it.  unfortunately, our waiter couldn't explain the best way to enjoy the dessert, nor anything else about it. however, the table next to ours ordered the same dessert and got a full explanation and i had to ease drop.  \n\nperhaps if we received better service, this experience could have been a 4 or 4.5, but 3 is the best this time, and that's a damn shame.",

            "as far as date spots go, this would be perfect in vegas.  you can't beat the views and the interior of the dining room.\n\nas far as dining experience, the food is quite incredible.  i would definitely go with at least one fish dish.  from the classics, i had the chef's <mark>Striped Bass</mark>.  even if it came without the squid/octopus and it's base, i would have still loved it.  same goes for the halibut.  i find it amazing how the chefs can cook such a big piece of fish so evenly and so moist.  \n\ntop the above dishes with the <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> and some gnocchi, you will be quite satisfied and full.  enjoy!\n\nwhy 4 stars?  the service is a bit casual.  the servers are pleasant, but the service doesn't equate to what the customer is paying.  items are missing, the staff is not completely attentive.  i have a feeling the chef is going for this feel to make it seem unpretentious, but i'm not sure if it's the best model.", 
            "touting itself as french cuisine with an american influence, this restaurant sits in an enviable location at the very tippy top of thehotel in las vegas.\n\nmy first trip to las vegas was due to an it expo going on, and we had been sent out armed with a list of places to try and restaurants to visit, with mix being a regularly recommended location.\n\nsome of our friends had decided to meet up with us for a few days during our vegas trip, and they were equally excited to eat at mix for the first time.\n\nfrom the discreet glass elevator that shoots up the outside of the hotel and offers a changing view of vegas, to the stunning d\\u00e9cor inside the varied bar and eating areas, to the panoramic view from the restaurant that comes alive as the sun goes down and the vegas lights come up, everything at mix is designed to be an experience that will leave you with a fantastic impression.\n\nthe staff are softly spoken and perform at the caliber you expect from an alain ducasse restaurant: quick on their feet, taking the time to discuss the menu without rushing any decisions, respectfully disappearing if more time is needed and knowledgeable about everything on offer and nicely versed on the wine list and suitable pairings.\n\nbetween everyone at our table we sampled the following:\n* complimentary bread basket sampler accompanied by perfectly spreadable butter studded with peanuts.\n* we ordered <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> with palm hearts, guacamole & cilantro, shrimp cocktail with horseradish and spring baby vegetable salad with an herby basil dressing as starters for the table to share.\n* 2x <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> rossini with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> & a black truffle sauce\n* 1x roasted maine lobster au curry with basmati rice\n* 1x <mark>Cod Brandade</mark> with lemon, capers, brown butter, croutons and fried parsley\n* we ordered fork crushed (the fancy way of saying expensively mashed) potatoes, <mark>Creamy Spinach</mark> and saut\\u00e9ed <mark>Sauteed Green Asparagus</mark> as sides to share.\n* complimentary madeleines (which were absolutely perfect) with a chocolate dipping sauce for everyone after dinner to bide us over while we decided on what to try for dessert.\n* 1x <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> with a textured coconut & lime sorbet\n* 1x chocolate cherry pudding with chocolate crisps & black cherries\n\nthe food was fantastic, but at mix prices i would expect it to do everything but dance on the table while singing a show tune.  \n\neverything was perfectly cooked, seasoned and flavoured: \n* the steaks were done exactly as requested, although the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> lacked the impact i was hoping for and tasted just like any other goose liver pate i've had (it was my first time trying it and i was a little underwhelmed)\n* the cod was glorious and the accompanying sauce was perfect\n* the lobster curry was phenomenal\n\nhowever, as someone with a raging, barely controlled sweet tooth the dessert options were a little limited but still of a superb quality nonetheless.\n\nthe wines suggested by our server were superb and all the cocktails we had at the bar afterwards were excellent.\n\non the way out i noticed what appeared to be the smallest dance floor in the world tucked away almost as an afterthought, however at a vegas altitude where every square metre of space comes at a premium i don't blame them for compromising their dance floor for extra dining space.\n\ni get the feeling that the staff were specifically chosen to bring a warm touch to what had the potential to be a very pretentious experience.  this is definitely a restaurant to try at least once, and i recommend that you try to time your visit around the sunset as this will give you a memorable view of vegas.", 
            "the meal at mix closed a great evening for us after the m.j. show. we've eaten here before and it never disappoints. we shared the <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> and ordered lamb and halibut dinners splitting them up. all i can say is best meal in recent memory. great service and had a window table with fantastic view."

            "mix was a huge, did i say huge, disappointment.  i would not recommend it to my enemies.  i would have hoped that for a $400 bill (for 2 people) i would get to experience some amazing food.  \n\nthe restaurant itself is beautifully decorated, with strung glass 'bubbles' acting as the sculptural centerpiece of the entire dining room.  my co-worker and i asked to be seated by the window to enjoy the beautiful las vegas night view from the 64th floor of  the hotel.  the hostess very coldly told us that the only-left window table was reserved for a \"marketing\" party.  wtf.  and for the record, that table was empty the entire night.\n\nwe decided to go for the \"a taste of mix\" tasting menu, the wine pairing, and the <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> appetizer.  pretty much fail.  we began our eating experience with an amuse bouche concoction of goat cheese, a yellowy mash, and an olive.  the girl sitting at the table next to us blurted out \"gross\" when our server described what it was.  and indeed, it was gross.  it felt like gunk in my mouth.    \n\nfor starters, we had the <mark>Maine Lobster Salad</mark>.  the lobster was juicy and delicious with the sweetness of the melon. if you are ever unsure about what appetizer to order, you can always count on the <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> being good at basically any sf restaurant.  the <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> here had no flavor and desperately needed to be hit with some lime juice to punch up the flavors.  it was just a bland blob for $24.  \n\nwe moved onto our main courses - the stripped bass and <mark>Roasted Duck Breast</mark>.  the bass was delicious with a sprinkling of little asparagus slices.  however, the blanquette sauce was a bit too cheesy for me after a few bites.  the duck was just weird.  it looked like a lame piece of boiled strip of meat that you would think would cut easily, but no, it was difficult to cut.  it did not have much flavor and simply did not look appetizing.  the baby turnips that the server said was \"slowly cooked for 5 hours\" looked like something my mom could whip out in 10 mins.    \n\ni must say that the pre-dessert was the bright light during this dinner.  the passion fruit juice/mix of sorts topped with a sweet coconuty frothy cream in a martini was delicious.  the sweetness of the cream and the tartness worked beautifully.  \n\nthe tropical fruit sensation, consisting of guava sorbet and finely diced mango and other fruits was another let down.  the sorbet was incredibly tart and the fruits simply added to the tartness.  it desperately needed something sweet (like chocolate) to balance it out.  our server noticed that we did no finish much of our plates and gave us freshly baked madeline cookies (right out of the molds) with some nutella.  it was ok.  lol...not enough to make it a good dinner.\n\nin addition to the pre-dessert, i thoroughly enjoyed my wine pairings.  i am not a wine person, but i did get to try two awesomely sweet wines - the 2007 riesling, dr thanisch and the 2007 moscato d'asti, d. rivetti. yum yum yum :)\n\nyou are better off going to the bellagio buffet.  or just having a drink at the adjacent mix lounge while enjoying the view.  i would suggest you gamble away $400 then going here.  at least then you might get something in return.",

            "lets start this review with the amazing views of the strip, there are several tables you can sit at and marvel at the twinkling lights of the strip, and bonus seats right at the outside of the bar to sippy sip your cocktails at. \nand, if you do happen to  visit this great find, def, def, def seek out the bathrooms located at the end of the bar area. they are pretty damn dark but how awesome is it when you sit on the toilet and find yourself  facing the outside of the of the hotel (ie full length glass wall) you could possibly sit on the toilet for days just looking out over las vegas if it werent for the perma lines youd get on your derieree!\nhmmm....\nwhat? oh yeah, the food. :-)\n-tell me,,, what restaurant starts you out with a bread basket full of 5 different types of bread and serves not only butter but crunchy peanut butter spread to go along with your bread???!!! soo good!\n-<mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> !!! yummmmmmm, even with the potato chips that come along for the added crunchy-nessss....\n-lobster ceasar salad (dressing on the side) was sooo good. im not usually a fan of ceasar salad, but anything with huge chunks of lobster, will make my palate do summersaults!!\n-mac 'n chesse <mark>Macaroni & Cheese with Ham</mark> (hello) southern delight! the perfect blend of cheese,cream, and crunchy toppings!\n-last but not certainly least..........ta da chocolate souffle with pistachio ice cream. more likely than not, i will usually go with a creme brulee, but who can resist a warm, crunchy chocolate on top, gooey rich, velvety yummness on the inside spectacular of a dessert!!!! ohh mmyyy ggaawwddd!!!",

            "simply stunning inside and out.  booked a table for 6 a few months out b/c i am proacitve and in charge of hosting my bff's bachelorette party.  they don't open for dinner until 6:00, so when we arrived at 6:30, the place was practically empty.  our table was outside on the balcony area which i had no idea existed.  the views were breathtaking and i was immediately happy i decided to book our dinner at mix.\n\nour waiter (can't remember his name) was sarcastically funny and catered to our every whim for dinner.  quite obviously, we were a bachelorette party complete with 80's glam dresses and the bachelorette in a neon pink and orange veil.  we weren't quite \"ferile\" yet as the evening was early, and this place is pretty swank.  they tolerated our outrageous clothing pretty well.  \n\nthey made every effort to accommodate to some picky eaters.  we had a few girls at the table who \"blew their wad\" the night before and couldn't eat much b/c they were feeling pretty sick.  i ordered the <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> app and the halibut.  my friend had the gnocchi which was also outstanding.  a few items on the menu were a miss.  bread was delish with 4 different types of bread, 2 types of butter.  for ambiance, this place is a solid 10, but the food and menu could be improved.  great for a romantic date night or place to meet up with your lover ;o)", 
            "really fabulous dinner in a fabulous location.  ask to sit on the balcony overlooking the strip - it was a great way to make the night memorable.\n\nall of the dishes were very well-prepared.  match the duck fois gras, which was brought in from france and then laid in date puree, with a glass of sauternes for the perfect wine pairing.   the gnocchi was delicate, fluffly, and almost chewy a great choice. the spicy crab and <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> were good alternatives for starters as well.\n\nfor dinner, i had the dry aged rib eye and it was soo tender.  it comes with sauces, bordelaise or many others - but i didnt use them - no need.  the beef cheeks (waygu) were slow braised in a rich wines sauce that was dark and complex - really delicious but very rich.   and the lobster in the curry sauce was a unique and fabulous version of a sauce american.", 
            "it was our first time ordering a prix fixe meal and although it was a bit pricey, it was worth every single penny!\n\nmy boyfriend and i came in for dinner around 7:30 and were seated immediately even though our reservations weren't till 8:00.\n\nwe each ordered a different \"chef tasting menu\" and every dish was amazing.\n\nthey brought out a variety basket of breads with two kinds of butter (regular and peanut) and <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> before the courses started coming. \n\nfor $120 i got:\n<mark>Tender Potato Gnocchi</mark>\nroasted maine lobster \"au curry\"\n<mark>Filet Mignon</mark> rossini\nbaba au rhum\n\nfor $90 my bf got:\nspicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>\nbutternut squash ravioli\nseared diver scallops\nrack of lamb\nlemon tart\n\ni wish i could remember what the pre-dessert was called but it was served in a martini glass with a light foam on the top layer..  the post dessert was a \"freshly baked\" madeline served with chocolate or maybe nutella but it didn't taste too fresh to me.\n\nfavorites:\nspicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> & black truffle that came with the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, scallops, lemon tart, and the <mark>Tender Potato Gnocchi</mark>.\n\nleast favorite:\nbread, madeline, baba au rhum, rack of lamb, and the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>.\n\nthe ambiance, decor, view, and service is awesome and it's just something everyone should experience at least once!  if you don't want to spend the money.. give the lounge area a visit.  we didn't have enough time or room for drinks but we'll definitely be back to give it a try.  i don't know if there's a cover or not but i do know it's free if you dine at mix.  your server will personally walk you over to the lounge and seat you... or at least he did for us :]", 
            "can i give this place 6 stars?\n\ni'm still glowing from my visit to mix.  i felt like a princess here: the atmosphere, the service, the foods, the yummy drinks- this place is heaven!\n\nfirst we sat down and ordered cocktails.  xpresso martini is very good and the bread is fantastic.  you get three different kinds and two different types of butter: traditional and peanut butter.  the peanut butter sort of tasted like reeses peanut butter filling to me, so yummy!\n\ni joked to my husband about being chilly and jokingly rubbed my hands over the candle on our table and the \"bread guy\" came over and gave me a fleece blanket for my legs.  so nice!  \n\nour entrees came.  i ordered the wagyu and my husband had the <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> and <mark>Pepper Crusted Bison Tenderloin</mark>.  he loved his dinner and mine was good but just not my taste.  so i was saving mine to take \"to go,\" to he could have it tomorrow.  the waitor asked how i liked my dinner and i told him that the martini was good, not wanting to be a problem, but he insisted \"very good, but how is your wagyu?\"  i told him it was okay but my husband will eat it.  he insisted i try another entree!  it's not like me to send something back, never did it before, especially when it was cooked just fine but it was something i never had before and didn't know i wouldn't like.  i ordered the ny strip steak instead- and it was sooo fabulous.  i was so pleased that he suggested i try another entree.\n\nour server's name was \"wayne,\" he's the best.  i plan to return here often and i'll ask if wayne is working, he made our experience just that much nicer.  pretty much all the staff that we ran into was very friendly.\n\nunfortunately the lounge was reserved for a convention party but wayne says we can get in tomorrow if we show our receipt.  we might do it.. the view was beautiful from the lounge.  it was beautiful from where we were sitting also, on the patio.  \n\ni have nothing negative to say about this place.  i hope they do really well.  our bill was $200 which is pretty steep but well worth it. \n\ni recommend the cheesecake martini!  the best martini i've ever had which should mean something because i am a conneseuir by now. :-)\n\nyay mix!  i'll see you next week when my cousin comes to visit us.  yelpers- go here.  if nothing else, for the view, drinks, and desserts.  the desserts are fantastic.", 
            "this review is for the restaurant. \nmy husband and i came here for our 5 year anniversary dinner tonight. i did my research and thought this would be a good place to go. the food was wonderful. we had, for starters, the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> (half order), <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> (half order), and <mark>Maine Lobster Salad</mark>. for our entrees we had the <mark>Braised Wagyu</mark> and <mark>Cod Brandade</mark>. both were very tasty. for my dessert i had the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> w/ caramel ice cream. \nmy gripes with this restaurant was that we were seated on a round table between two square tables. it was awkwardly situated and did not make for a very comfortable meal. at least we were seated by a window with a pretty nice view. my next gripe is with the waiter (big caucasian blond guy) who talked and laughed with the tables next to us and made no effort with the two of us. i wonder if it's because we didn't order a bottle of wine. i forgot my zantac, so i didn't think drinking wine would be wise. my husband ordered a mojito and he totally forgot about it prompting us to have to remind him and when he wanted a second drink, we had to ask the busboy (sorry, i don't know what to call him). by the way, the busboy and the buslady were nice and friendly. my husband wanted to give the waiter a bad tip, but i convinced him against it because i wanted the other helpful staff to get what they deserved. we tipped the usual 18% even though the waiter clearly didn't deserve it. with the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and wagyu we weren't sure what we were supposed to eat it with. a good waiter would have made suggestions for sides to improve the enjoyment of our meal. \nso the verdict: the food was great, but the experience was lacking considering the amount of money we spent, $200+.\ni've been to many amazing restaurants, including french laundry, jar, lucques, osteria mozza, etc... this was by far the worst experience i've ever had at a fine dining establishment.", 
            "sure, it's a very nice restaurant.  but this is a town full of nice restaurants.\n\nthe space is amazing - you take a glass elevator up to the top of thehotel, and step into a cross between a nightclub and an 1960's movie version of heaven's lobby with a huge chandelier taking up most of the room.  there are spectacular views of the strip ( ask for a table with a view ), as well as an outdoor balcony area ... 65 floors up.\n\nas others have mentioned, the tasting menu is a little bit ... difficult to obtain.  we were one of the later reservations of the evening, and were rather put out to discover that the chef was uninterested in providing us with his best at that hour.  they did not indicate that full service would be unavailable when we made our reservation.\n\nafter that rather rough start, service was very friendly and personal.\n\nthe food was fine, but nothing to write home about.  roasted curry lobster is definitely the stand out - a more adventurous combination of flavors.  otherwise, they have a foie dish, <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark>, steak and seafood that are not particularly different, or memorable.  even the chef's tasting is just a combination of regular menu items.\n\nso - go for the setting and the view, but don't expect to always be able to get the tasting, and look forward to a competent but rather uninspired dinner.", 
            "once you look past the annoying spelling of mix and thehotel (really, is the pretentious capitalization of those letters necessary?) you realize that the restaurant is more style than substance. the view, particularly from the outdoor balcony, is one of the best in town. the mod atmosphere created from the wall of bubbles in the center of the main dining area, the oversized pod dining booths, and spartan decor would lead you to believe that the meal you're about to enjoy will be both trendsetting and unforgettable. it's neither.\n\na french restaurant with a decidedly american spin along with latin and asian influenced dishes, the food sounded and looked better than it tasted. the gnocchi, sitting in a savory veal jus, was more mushy than pillowy. the <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> was memorable only because of the bold sweetness and acidity of the mango chutney.\n\nthe entrees we dined on were good, but underwhelming for the price. without the benefit of the bernaise and peppercorn sauces the under seasoned filet would have been disappointing. i did enjoy the curry sauce on the roasted main lobster \"au curry\" dish, but the bed of bazmati rice -- and i use the term \"rice\" loosely -- was like eating oatmeal. not a good combo with lobster in my opinion. the claw meat was wonderful, but the tail meat was so tough i had to use my wife's steak knife to cut it.\n\nfor dessert, we shared the chocolate souffle. not bad, but the highlight was the rocky road ice cream it came with. the other couple we dined with ordered the apple quince and caramel -- a tatin with a caramel parfait and green apple sorbet. i was able to sneak in a few bites and thought it was a fabulous mix of sweet and tart flavors. following dessert madeleines were brought out for the table. a nice gesture, but they were so dry that not even the nutella that came with it could save it.\n\nthe disappointment didn't end with the food. service was too casual and lackluster for a place that has garnered a michelin star. i don't remember our server's name, but he seemed to be more suited to renting out surfboards on some random beach than working at a \"high-end\" french place.\n\non a positive note, there are restaurant dot com gift certificates available to lessen the shock of receiving the bill.\n\n2.5 stars", 
            "we came to mix for the michelin-star food and 64th-floor views of the vegas strip. what we got was wedding banquet food and views of other tables.\n\nwe had a reservation for 9:45pm, and our waiter had to apologize that the prix fixe wasn't available after 9:30. what he didn't say was that (we presume) the chef had gone home 15 minutes earlier, and left it to the late-night catering team to ladle-out whatever had been mass-produced earlier that day.\n\nmy girlfriend and i ordered the <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> to start with, which came with taro chips and a small dollop of mango sauce on the side. pretty plain. she followed it up with chicken (bland), while my entree was a filet of bison. i had to scrape a thick blanket of peppercorns from the top of the meat to have any hope of tasting its real flavor, while the vegetables (for which the waiter could barely contain his excitement) could only fairly be described as 'vegetables'. quite what he saw in them, i have no idea. my girlfriend's comment that it all seemed like 'wedding banquet food' hit the nail right on the head. if these were $14 entrees i wouldn't have felt cheated. but these were not $14 entrees.\n\nwe cut our losses and skipped dessert.\n\nthe odd cocoon we were seated in prevented any views of the strip, and, oddly, had the effect of focusing sound such that it sometimes felt like diners at tables across from us were speaking right in our ears. i guess it made a distraction from the pounding of the nightclub next door.\n\nservice was perfectly fine. but to charge these kinds of prices for that kind of food is cynical and shameful. i can't imagine i'll be trying another alain ducasse restaurant.", 
            "my most recent visit was not like the first one. the hostess was very pleasant. i'd hate to call him a busboy but the man who brought water and cleared the dishes was also awesome. however, our waiter was less than enthusiastic being there. it seems he didn't spend any time studying the menu. \n\ni remember mix as having a staff that knows the menu inside out, how every dish was prepared and the best way to enjoy each course. our waiter seemed like he was filling in for someone, having difficulty explaining the menu. \n\nwe didn't do the tasting menu this time, and instead ordered a la carte.\n\nthe spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> was not the least bit spicy, but very good otherwise.\n<mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> & the seabass were both delicious\nthe ribeye was cooked perfectly, but contained a huge chunk of fat, signaling it was a bad cut of meat.\n\nperhaps the least impressive was the dessert. the <mark>Baba a L'armagnac</mark> was a plain cake served on a citrus reduction, w/ whipped cream and liquer to pour over it.  unfortunately, our waiter couldn't explain the best way to enjoy the dessert, nor anything else about it. however, the table next to ours ordered the same dessert and got a full explanation and i had to ease drop.  \n\nperhaps if we received better service, this experience could have been a 4 or 4.5, but 3 is the best this time, and that's a damn shame.", 
            "what a terrible experience!  my boyfriend, best friend and her husband went to mix for what we were expecting to a spectacular experience and it was quite the opposite.  although we were very pleased with the ambiance and the spectacular view, no other part of the evening was pleasant.\n\nthe four of us dressed appropriately for the restaurant per their \"dressy\" description but when a table of about a dozen younger, we'll call them \"boys\" showed up in jeans and undershirts we were a bit taken aback.  if you are going to advertise that you are a \"dressy\" establishment you should stand by that standard.  but the boys attire was the least of our concerns.  a couple of them were obviously inebriated and at one point one of them excused himself to, and i apologize for the choice of words, but vomit.  when he came back to the table he was no better than when he left.  he could barely sit in his chair or keep his head up straight.  by this time we noticed that management was \"standing by\" but they took no action to ask the boys to excuse their friend from the establishment.  their hesitation in doing so resulted in the same boy getting up from the table once again and not quite making it to the restroom this time... he vomited right there at the hostess area.  although it appeared one table found this amusing, we did not.  and we were not the only ones.  my boyfriend did the right thing and approached the manager to inquire on why they didn't take action sooner so as to avoid this scene and he was told \"they have protocol\".  apparently their protocol involves allowing their guests to vomit at will.  my boyfriend was also told that since the boys were guests of the hotel they did not wish to ask them to leave.  i'm sorry, were we not guests of the hotel?  and not only were we guests of the hotel but we were staying in their 2,000 sq ft media suite so we weren't just you average joe-schmos trying to act like we were \"somebodies\" or try to get something from them.  the manager made no apology to my boyfriend about the incident and instead gave him the attitude of \"what do you expect us to do\".  his attitude toward the situation was completely unprofessional and inexcusable.  \n\nnow, aside from the unexpected show that came with dinner, the food itself was absolutely terrible.  we were served a basket of mixed breads which weren't even warm, in fact their temperature was more of that they were just pulled out of the refrigerator.  we ordered the gnocchi and <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> for appetizers and they were just okay.  for our main entrees my best friend and i ordered the lobster \"au curry\".  it was over cooked and chewy not to mention it looked like the chef had just found remnants of a lobster and threw them on the plate.  i shouldn't have to chew my lobster like its beef jerky.  in fact i'm pretty sure i've had beef jerky that has been more tender.   my boyfriend had the sea bass and it was completely flavorless and overcooked.  we also ordered two sides of the macaroni and cheese which was also completely overcooked.  kraft macaroni and cheese is better than what they served us.  for a meal that was going to cost us close to $500 (they were gracious enough to comp us due to the fact that our appetites were lost since having to witness the vomiting - but don't worry, we tipped the server generously as this incident was no reflection on him) we were nothing short of disappointed and i think that's being kind.  in all honesty, i wouldn't even pay $25 for the meal we had.\n\nmy advice - go somewhere else. there are too many other wonderful restaurants in vegas to have to suffer through this one.", 
            "we were there with a party of 10 to celebrate a friend's birthday.\n\nthe good news-the view is great.\n\n\nthe service is awful.  aside from the guy topping off my water every few minutes, i was shocked at how bad the service was.  this alone would cause me to never go back.  we were seated, and waited nearly 15 minutes for a drink order to be taken.  we then waited about another 15 minutes before our apps order was taken.  and the restaurant wasn't full.\n\nthe food, imo, was mediocre at best. i started with a <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark>, which is normally one of my favorite appetizers, and i've had it in several different places.  while the plate certainly looked nice, it was tasteless.  i mean, you have a spice rack back there, don't you?  just very bland, and nothing at all special. there was a tiny bit of sauce on the side that provided some much needed flavor-but they put 4 dime sized drops across the plate.  hey, it would have been nice to have some of it that was meant for more than decoration.\n\ni got the slow roasted halibut for an entree.  it was cooked very well, but again-it was flavorless.  there was, once again, the tiniest bit of sauce over the halibut, that sat on a bed of peppers and some other vegetables.  that bed of vegetables was without question the best part of the meal.  it was very good.  the dish came with a small amount of \"lobster sauce\" on the side, which imo had no business being put on that nice piece of halibut.  on the side i also ordered the \"fork mashed\" potatoes.  once again (and almost comically so...), there was no salt, no herbs, no butter, no flavor. \n\nfor dessert, i got a piece of strawberry cheesecake that was very tasty.  it came with a sorbet on the side, and a small amount of fruit compote.  one of my friends asked how it was, and i said \"it's good,  but luckily sugar, fruit, and cheese mixed together is usually going to come out pretty good\".\n\ni will say that one of my friends got , iirc, a <mark>Pepper Crusted Bison Tenderloin</mark> of some sort that was very good.  if i ever found myself here again (which probably won't happen anytime soon), that would certainly be what i got.  there were also a few of us that got the lobster, which they said was very good.\n\nthere were also two different versions of a tasting menu that looked really good that some of us wanted to try.  but, it was not to be, because in order to order that, the entire table had to get it-something that i really don't understand.\n\none last note-i personally can't stand when a restaurant decides to automatically put a gratuity on the bill.  it's just a pet peeve of mine, and i know waiters and waitresses work hard, etc.  and i always pay it-but i sometimes will let the manager know that the staff would have been tipped a lot more if they just kept that off of there.  in this case, for the first time, we had people taking out calculators to figure out how much of a tip was put on the bill-something i've never done.  if i wasn't with a group of people celebrating a birthday, i would have absolutely complained to the manager to get that gratuity off the bill, and i would have decided myself how much to leave-the service was that bad.", 
            "wonderful experience.  great decor and outstanding views. top notch service. staff was friendly and very professional.  we had the <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> appetizer and the <mark>Maine Lobster Salad</mark> - both delicious. the lobster curry entree was a true stunner. mac and cheese was great.  cod entree also delicious.  the complimentary cookies and chocolate sauce were wonderful.  would come back in a hurry!", 
            "we dined here last night with a group of 5 and i must say, i am shocked it took me 3+ years to try this place! the interior is beyond beautiful and it will probably go on my list of must-see venues for tourists to visit while they are here. \n\nimagine voodoo lounge at the rio with  better views and incomparable 5 star menus. all of 5 of us tried the \"classic\" tasting menu. \n\nclassic tasting menu:  \n--pre-menu: a mouse, sooo good. it tastes like bacon but better. \n1. <mark>Tender Potato Gnocchi</mark> with asparagus cream & pesto. amazing!! everyone at the table agreed it was the best gnocchi they had ever tasted. \n*** i added <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> as well, it was tasty.***\n2. lobster curry. omg, imagine the best tasting indian dish you ever put in your mouth with a melt in your mouth buttery lobster! \n3.filet w/ foire gras. cooked perfectly. so good!!\n--passion fruit foamy cocktail. i have no idea what the real name is, but it was a unique end to the meal. i will look forward to it again :)\n4. baba cake. not my fav... i would probably sub this out because i need chocolate. i am not subtracting any stars for this because the view made up for the meh dessert, plus everyone else at the table loved it, \n--after dessert: vanilla cookies, fresh with nutella. \n\nview: if i could give a view 10 stars, i would!! it was amazing!! make sure you use the club restroom so you can have a view even while you go ;) \n\nservice: 10 stars as well! our server was very engaging an answered a ton of questions about the chandelier and history of the restaurant. \n\ni will be back!! plan about $200 per person for wine/food for a nice meal :)", 
            "an update is in order for my review of mix.\n\nfirst-the manager of the restaurant cared so much about the negative review that he actually tracked me down at work, spoke to me, and insisted that we give the restaurant another try.\n\ni'm glad we did.  i went in with my parents, and we were blown away by the meal and the service we got.   sebastian, the manager, was terrific.  bianca, our server, was as good as it gets.\n\nbefore people say that we were treated well simply because of a negative review, i will say that i was actually watching the tables around us, and i have to say that everybody seemed to be getting great service!\n\nnow the food-honestly, it was like i was in a different restaurant.  we started with shrimp cocktail.  this was served in a pretty unique way, more of a small salad with shrimp mixed into it.  at the bottom of the bowl was a horseradish custard.  the dish was outstanding.  my father got a plate of sliced meats of different type (i forgot what it's called) and he loved it.\n\nbecause i was unhappy with the tuna i had for an app last time, we were brought out a portion to try.  once again, it was like a different dish.  the tuna had a great spice to it, and the veggies underneath were very crisp.  that\"s what <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> should be like!  it was great.\n\nwe also had the gnocchi appetizer.  once again-it was outstanding.  terrific mushrooms, gnocchi, and vegetables, cooked and seasoned perfectly.  it was delicious.\n\nfor mains, we got the surf and turf (chicken breast, with lobster), the bison fillet, and a beef filet.  simply put, each dish was amazing.  the bison was so tender you could almost cut it just with a fork.  my dad got the beef filet, and the fork mashed potatoes.  as soon as the waitress put the potatoes in front of him, i said \"dad, that looks like a different dish than the potatoes i got last time\". and i was right, because these had seasoning, butter, and were delicious! everything was cooked and seasoned perfectly.\n\nfor desert, we had vanilla bean ice cream, the cheesecake, and a \"deconstructed apple pie\".  we loved every bite.\n\ni've come to realize that any restaurant can have a bad night.  the food and service on the second trip more than made up for it.  i will say, i was shocked to hear from the manager after the first visit.  the effort he put in to track me down and be sure we had a great experience was incredible-there should be more restaurant managers like sebastian here in vegas.\n\nnot only will i be back again (as will my parents), but we've already relayed this story to several of our friends who are going to be trying mix.\n\nthank you!", 
            "i've eaten at mix three times now and while it's definitely only a three star as far as cuisine is concerned, i would still probably return...\n\nfirst of all, the restaurant is absolutely gorgeous. fantastic ambiance. the lounge area is a vegas absolute must and the main reason i'll probably return again and again. if i were to rate <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> on the lounge (view) and the decor, i'd have to give it 5 stars. \n\nnow to the food and service. the food is just okay. not good... i promise you won't be blown away... not bad either. just food on a plate that tastes okay. \n\ni ordered the lobster curry for my latest meal. it was lobster in a non-spicy, light curry sauce. nothing fancy or brilliant about it. i probably could have done something better at home. \n\ni had the <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> for an appetizer. it was very good... but again... something i could have easily created in my home kitchen. when i go out i'd rather be wow'd by wondering how the chef could have prepared something so wonderful. you won't find any of that at mix. \n\nthe service was good. we had two large tables and they serviced our needs quite well... though the meal probably took a little longer you'd expect, but they try to time everything just right.\n\nthis is pretty much how i'd summarize every meal i've eaten at mix. something you can easily prepare at home that tastes good but you'll pay a pretty penny for at a nicely decorated restaurant with good service. \n\nif you've never been there... i'd highly recommend at least checking out the lounge area. it's probably one of the top two or three places that i love having an evening cocktail at and watch the sunset. get tipsy enough and you certainly won't mind paying for a meal there.", 
            "mix is beautiful inside and the view is amazing.  go next door to their bar and partake in the sunset champagne toast, lots of fun.  the food was good, the cod was less than desirable.  chicken was moist and amazing.  <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> was fair.  mushroom fricasse was delicious.  great beer selection, tried matilda from chicago, would definitely order that again.  server was very knowledgeable, a bit on the uppity side, but relaxed as the meal went on.  overall very delicious and fun!", 
            "excellent food! we enjoyed some delicious <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> appetiser - the seasoning was just perfect and fantastic flavours. we all had <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, one just the meat the other rossini. the quality of meat and perfect cooking made them nothing short of great. great fries as well, think cooked belgian style. time for the deserts. this was highlight of meal outstanding.  \nthe restaurant is on top of hotel and the views are nothing short of great. it also is a very comfortable lounge type atmosphere, relaxed yet sophisticated.  service lacked a bit in 'quality' which at this level should have been better.  \nprices are actually quite good value for this level of food.", 
            "a stunning lounge/restaurant located inside mandalay bay on the 64th floor with a great view. went here with a large group of friends, probably 14 of us and had an excellent time.\n\nthe ambiance: on the lighter side and that huge dining area is so welcoming that it gives you room to breath. loved the decor and the bubbly chandeliers. i mean whats not nice in vegas.\n\nfood: we got a few orders of <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark>, cheese salami and prosciutto platter and some other appetizer cant remember. k so my main 5 stars are based on the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> steak with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> this was by far the most memorable filet i've had. cooked to perfection and the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> being on top of the meat gave all the oils and juices to the filet which made it more outstanding. \n\nservice: all right normal\n\noverall if you're seeking a place that serves great steak and want to try or simply have <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> try this place out it should impress you.",

            "although my tab was 200$ for two people... the food was really good. we ordered the lobster curry, <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark>, and some pasta dish. the prices were really high for the portion sizes, but that's fine dining for ya. we also ordered the bora bora and the lavender drink which were amazing, but 20 bucks a drink! ouchhhh. all in all, this place is the best once a month date night spot forsure.", 
            "i came here on a quiet, 80 degree night with a group of 10 after watching the michael jackson cirque de soleil show.....and it was a night to remember.  \n\nthe 65th story restaurant is spacious with the perfect combination of black & red mood lighting. as i walked in, someone in the group commented: \"i feel like i'm in heaven......\"\n\nwe sat on the balcony overlooking the entire strip. champagne was delivered on the house, along with an egg caviar, and incredible dessert martini. \n\ni didn't eat the bread, but the butter placed on the table was too good to resist.....one of them featured nougats and mango. \n\ni started with the <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark>, placed on a fancy block of chopped root vegetables, served with taro root chips. the peanut satay sauce was the perfect addition to the fish. \n\ni also ordered the lobster gazpacho. i expected it to be some acidic, tomato-filled, lime- juice soup....but then, they brought the wonderful dish to my table. 5 nice slices of lobster with chopped cucumber, cilantro, tomato, and coconut milk!!!!!! i can't even explain how simply decadent the gazpacho was. one-of-a-kind. \n\ni've heard the lobster curry is as good or better than the lobster gazpacho.......\n\nwho knew the mandalay bay could get this fancy? (...........although every hotel in vegas is fancy aside from excalibur) \n\ni never drink, but the meal was so intriguing, i drank white wine and a glass of champagne."

            "love this place. perched high up on the 64th floor of the swanky 'the hotel' at mandalay bay this open,modern and fun restaurant has everything working in its favor. we got a nice corner table with a gorgeous view of the strip. we dined at michael mina @ bellagio the night before for our wedding anniversary and were not quite impressed but this place more than made up for it. \n\nthe bubbly rose moscato wine was by far one of the best glasses of wine i've had. the complimentary bread was a bit disappointing .. it was way too hard to be chewed and digested properly.. \n\nwe ordered 2 entrees after consulting our server for recommendations\n- <mark>Cod Brandade</mark>: this was by far one of the best seafood dishes ever to have gone down my throat. the cod was perfectly cooked and had great flavor and spices to go with it. \n\n- maine lobster curry with coconut basmati rice: believe it or not this was my first lobster dish... the lobster itself was a bit chewy but the rice and the curry made the whole dish very delectable\n\nthe chocolate souffle was served in a ceramic case and was extremely delicious although i would have preferred more of the pistachio ice cream on the top\n\nthe best part was the complimentary madeleines served fresh from the oven .. perfect way to end the meal .. on our way out we had a sneak peek at the lounge but since we had to go somewhere else we did not have enough time to check it out .. definitely a must do for next visit ...", 
            "this review is for the restaurant. \nmy husband and i came here for our 5 year anniversary dinner tonight. i did my research and thought this would be a good place to go. the food was wonderful. we had, for starters, the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> (half order), <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> (half order), and <mark>Maine Lobster Salad</mark>. for our entrees we had the <mark>Braised Wagyu</mark> and <mark>Cod Brandade</mark>. both were very tasty. for my dessert i had the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> w/ caramel ice cream. \nmy gripes with this restaurant was that we were seated on a round table between two square tables. it was awkwardly situated and did not make for a very comfortable meal. at least we were seated by a window with a pretty nice view. my next gripe is with the waiter (big caucasian blond guy) who talked and laughed with the tables next to us and made no effort with the two of us. i wonder if it's because we didn't order a bottle of wine. i forgot my zantac, so i didn't think drinking wine would be wise. my husband ordered a mojito and he totally forgot about it prompting us to have to remind him and when he wanted a second drink, we had to ask the busboy (sorry, i don't know what to call him). by the way, the busboy and the buslady were nice and friendly. my husband wanted to give the waiter a bad tip, but i convinced him against it because i wanted the other helpful staff to get what they deserved. we tipped the usual 18% even though the waiter clearly didn't deserve it. with the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and wagyu we weren't sure what we were supposed to eat it with. a good waiter would have made suggestions for sides to improve the enjoyment of our meal. \nso the verdict: the food was great, but the experience was lacking considering the amount of money we spent, $200+.\ni've been to many amazing restaurants, including french laundry, jar, lucques, osteria mozza, etc... this was by far the worst experience i've ever had at a fine dining establishment.", 
            "i had two amazing dinners here on a recent trip to vegas. i had to go twice because the first time was so wonderful, i had to see if it wasn't just a fluke. \n\nfirst off - if you get a waiter named randy, you are set! he is so attentive and friendly (without being invasive). \n\nthe ambiance of the entire room is like you're floating on a cloud - the glass bubbles that surround the central seating creates a fun vibe. we wondered why many of the tables near the window in the restaurant don't have the best view of the strip. we figured it was for two reasons: (1) so the mix nightclub and balcony dining could have the amazing view; (2) so the diners would focus inward on the clean and bright decor. \n\nafter reviewing the menu, randy gave us his suggestions for dinner. definitely get the shrimp cocktail with the spicy sauce to start. the horseradish isn't overwhelming since it's tempered by the tomato sauce. \n\nwe also tried the steak rossini - one of chef ducasse's specialties. for my taste, it was a little heavy for me, but still very flavorful and tender. \n\nthe pepper-crusted buffalo is another great choice if you're looking for a leaner cut of beef. \n\nthe star of the menu (in my opinion) is the <mark>Cod Brandade</mark> with lemon, capers, brown butter, and fried parsley. amazing doesn't begin to describe how velvety smooth this fish is prepared. it simply melts into your mouth and you wish that the dish will never end! \n\nif it's summer, try the asparagus as a side - they shave down the sides of the stalk, relieving some of that woody texture to it. steamed, then finished in olive oil and butter, it'll make you want to finish all your vegetables. \n\nno dinner is complete without dessert....but what does mix do? they bring you a complementary lemon cookie (warm) from the pastry kitchen to be eaten with nutella. wow!! but, don't you dare stop there! be sure you have the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> (and ask for another scoop of caramel ice cream to be served with it). simply the perfect finish. \n\ni'd happily go back here again and hope you have the same experience as i did. cheers!", 
            "this place is delicious, and really just outstandingly beautiful. i took my girlfriend here for her birthday last year because i found it online at restaurant.com and looked at the reviews and the restaurant website, and was sold when i saw that #1 it's alain ducasse (whose restaurant itinerary is an impressive 24 restaurants at the moment and who has his own culinary school in paris- a true pioneer of french cooking) and #2 i saw pictures of the restaurant. if you look at my picture you'll know what i'm talking about. the impact of the ceiling to floor hand-made blown glass sphere's that surround an intimate and prestigious table for one in the center of the restaurant really takes your breath away. and actually, we learned from our waiter, that the table placed in the middle of this glass ceiling jewelry is no longer allowed to be used, because it is not handicap accessible (they're stairs).\n\nfor dinner we had zero complaints, which pretty much has not happened for me at any restaurant. one of the best dining experience of my life. here's what my girlfriend and i enjoyed for dinner:\n\nshared appetizer:\n<mark>Tender Potato Gnocchi</mark> with sunchoke, parmigiano reggiano and  veal jus. the best gnocchi i've ever tasted. tender is an understatement.\n\nentrees:\nroasted maine lobster \"au curry\" with coconut basmati rice. speechless, just speechless.\n\n<mark>Cod Brandade</mark> with lemon, capers, brown butter, croutons & fried parsley. those croutons were basically a vehicle to supply your taste buds with a burst of butter, and that coupled with the largest capers i've ever seen (they were the size of peas!) and the fried parsley- just incredible.\n\nnow that i've popped my alain ducasse cherry, i will definitely be visiting adour new york and benoit new york when i have a large chuck of change burning a hole in my pocket. oh, and if you go, check out the bathroom in mix lounge next door. you'll see what i mean when you get there.", 
            "stayed at thehotel. we used the same elevator as our hotel room to head up to this place on the top floor. the decor is great and plus the big panoramic views just rounds off the great atmosphere they have going here. they have an open kitchen which you can see all of the stress that goes on trying to keep everything going well in a nice restaurant like this. \n\nwe started with the <mark>Charcuterie Sampler</mark> that had these nice italian hams and sausages cut thin. this dish paired well with my new castle beer!\n\nthen i had the <mark>Cod Brandade</mark> that was cooked perfectly; the fried parsley added great texture. one of the best cod dishes i have ever tasted. my girlfriend had the seared tuna that was perfectly seared, that dish was very good too. and through out our party i had the chance to taste a few other items that were all very good. like the <mark>Braised Wagyu</mark> that just melted in your mouth, mac and cheese w/ham was creamy and salty (in a good way) from the ham, wild mushrooms had a nice gravy, and  the john dory (fish) had huge flavors in a light dish. \n\nand in the end we had a great chocolate souffle; one if the top 5 i've ever tasted!!\n\nmy bill was around $240.00 that included one starter, three main courses, two sides and one chocolate souffle in the end. i had three beers and the two girls had only water. it was all worth it. \n\ni gave it four star because our waiter had this dry humor that just doesn't come across well when you are pay top dollar for a great dinning experience. \n\nbut i'll be back...", 
            "as stunningly beautiful as it is, eating at mix is kind of like eating in an airport terminal or a shopping mall. the high ceilings and glass and granite surfaces create an echo effect, so every sound reverberates off the walls and floors and just makes for an unsettling dining experience.\n\nacoustics aside, the food was pretty decent, although not quite as impressive as we had hoped. the best dish of the evening was the spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>. elegantly presented on a bed of guacamole and topped with shredded heart of palm, it was lively and fresh and made you feel like you were at a resort in cabo. the <mark>Cod Brandade</mark> was acceptable, but i was expecting exceptional. the lemon and capers just weren't enough to brighten up the bland brown butter sauce and the soggy fried parsley. and the <mark>Roasted Duck Breast</mark> was so forgettable that i simply forgot what went with it.\n\nwe were very impressed, however, with the wine service. we didn't want to order a bottle, so we just asked the somm to pair our dishes for us. he seemed to enjoy the challenge and was a delight to talk to.\n\none last note: i realize there isn't much the restaurant can do, but people really should not bring young children to these kinds of places. it's inappropriate and inconsiderate to your fellow diners -- especially so at mix because the sound of your rug rats squealing and shouting gets amplified throughout the entire restaurant.", 
            "i loved this restaurant! i had never heard of it before my last trip to vegas, but this time i went with a friend and her parents treated us to dinner here. the restaurant itself is very nice inside and the view is amazing. we would have sat outside if it wasn't 100 degrees at night! \ni ordered the <mark>Cod Brandade</mark> and a side of asparagus and it was delicious. probably the best piece of fish i've ever had. i also tried my friend's lobster curry and it was amazing. for an appetizer the table shared the <mark>Tender Potato Gnocchi</mark> which was... you guessed it- delicious. everything was rich and flavorful. \nthe cocktails were good, but i wouldn't say they were amazing. and my friend was surprised with a dessert since it was her birthday.\nthe only reason i don't think it deserved 5 stars was because the waitress seemed to forget about us quite often, even though the restaurant was relatively empty. i would still refer this restaurant to a friend, and go back myself.", 
            "i'll preface this review by disclosing that my wife and i had both our wedding ceremony and reception at mix.  on one hand, that may make me biased a bit in my love for this restaurant, but on the other hand, that also made me far more critical of the food, staff and service since we paid them the price of a small car to do an exclusive buy out on a saturday evening in vegas for a seven hour event.  \n\nso, that being said, here goes; saving food for last!  edit: looks like i have to trim my review, i hit the 5000 character limit. :-(\n\n1) ambience - if you like old fashioned or traditional decor in your dining venues, you will probably hate mix.  there is not a wood panel anywhere to be found, nor any green or blue carpeting.  the interior is many modern features with the centerpiece being the thousands of blown glass bulbs hanging from the ceiling around the two level dining area; the idea being to make it look like champagne bubbles rising.\n\nthe main seating area enjoys two story tall open windows with both views of the mountains and views of the strip.  if you're sitting inside, sunset is a perfect time to go because it looks simply incredible.  if you're sitting outside on their balcony, you'll only have a strip view because of where the balcony is located, but the view is still excellent at all times of day since you're 64 stories up looking north up the strip.  i recommend after dark for balcony seating.\n\n2) service - i've never had a bad experience at mix.  my wife and i visited vegas several times in advance of our wedding and dined at mix each time just to reassure ourselves that we had made the right decision.  we did not let them know in advance that we were coming to ensure we got to experience service as it normally is.  drinks are always full, they'll pick your napkin up and re-fold it if you get up to go to the bathroom, they check on your needs frequently, everyone is very congenial and outgoing.\n\nwe've been back numerous times since our wedding and yes, now we probably get extra service as many of the staff are still there and recognize us (it was a pretty memorable wedding), but they're really great folks.  i'm sure over the years as staff come and go we'll be a distant memory and service will go back to 'normal' but for the three years we've been back so far they've really made it special.\n\n3) special requests.  they've been very accommodating to us both for our wedding/reception and since then.  for example, on our first anniversary when we went back, i arranged with a cake bakery to make a small version of our wedding cake and deliver it to mix to surprise my wife after dinner.  the restaurant ensured someone was available to receive the cake that day and then they cut and served it for us.  if you're having a special occasion, talk to the staff and see if there's anything special you would want.\n\n4) food!  okay, the view sold me on this place to begin with, and fortunately, the food lived up to, and exceeded, expectations.  here's what we've had and when:\n\na) the <mark>Pepper Crusted Bison Tenderloin</mark>, <mark>Cod Brandade</mark> and roasted free range chicken (not always a menu option) were our wedding choices for guests.  the bison was awesome; many steak lovers who had never had bison remarked at how great the flavor was.  on the fish, we also had quite a few comments where significant others had shared their fish entree with someone who was not a fan of fish and they loved it, so that speaks for itself.\n\nb) surf & turf.  although it's not always on the menu, they'll do a filet and lobster if you ask.  my wife gets this religiously and loves it.  i will note that it is not as good as the surf & turf from n9ne at the palms.  there's regular surf & turf, then there's mix's surf & turf, then there's the n9ne surf & turf which is the best one in the universe.\n\nc) <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> rossini with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> & black truffle sauce.  if you're into truffles, i'm sure you'll love this.  the steak comes out perfectly.  i'm not a huge fan of the sauce so this is one of those love/hate meals for me.  perhaps ask to try the sauce before you order; not sure if that's possible.\n\nd) roasted maine lobster \"au curry\".  i love spicy, i love indian food, i love this meal.  it's my go-to mix meal; i get it every time once i tried it.  it's perfect combo of everything i love; lobster, spicy, curry, veggies, etc.\n\ndon't forget to go visit the mix lounge next door after dinner!  great place to relax and have a drink and cigar (on the balcony only of course).", 
            "touting itself as french cuisine with an american influence, this restaurant sits in an enviable location at the very tippy top of thehotel in las vegas.\n\nmy first trip to las vegas was due to an it expo going on, and we had been sent out armed with a list of places to try and restaurants to visit, with mix being a regularly recommended location.\n\nsome of our friends had decided to meet up with us for a few days during our vegas trip, and they were equally excited to eat at mix for the first time.\n\nfrom the discreet glass elevator that shoots up the outside of the hotel and offers a changing view of vegas, to the stunning d\\u00e9cor inside the varied bar and eating areas, to the panoramic view from the restaurant that comes alive as the sun goes down and the vegas lights come up, everything at mix is designed to be an experience that will leave you with a fantastic impression.\n\nthe staff are softly spoken and perform at the caliber you expect from an alain ducasse restaurant: quick on their feet, taking the time to discuss the menu without rushing any decisions, respectfully disappearing if more time is needed and knowledgeable about everything on offer and nicely versed on the wine list and suitable pairings.\n\nbetween everyone at our table we sampled the following:\n* complimentary bread basket sampler accompanied by perfectly spreadable butter studded with peanuts.\n* we ordered <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> with palm hearts, guacamole & cilantro, shrimp cocktail with horseradish and spring baby vegetable salad with an herby basil dressing as starters for the table to share.\n* 2x <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> rossini with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> & a black truffle sauce\n* 1x roasted maine lobster au curry with basmati rice\n* 1x <mark>Cod Brandade</mark> with lemon, capers, brown butter, croutons and fried parsley\n* we ordered fork crushed (the fancy way of saying expensively mashed) potatoes, <mark>Creamy Spinach</mark> and saut\\u00e9ed <mark>Sauteed Green Asparagus</mark> as sides to share.\n* complimentary madeleines (which were absolutely perfect) with a chocolate dipping sauce for everyone after dinner to bide us over while we decided on what to try for dessert.\n* 1x <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> with a textured coconut & lime sorbet\n* 1x chocolate cherry pudding with chocolate crisps & black cherries\n\nthe food was fantastic, but at mix prices i would expect it to do everything but dance on the table while singing a show tune.  \n\neverything was perfectly cooked, seasoned and flavoured: \n* the steaks were done exactly as requested, although the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> lacked the impact i was hoping for and tasted just like any other goose liver pate i've had (it was my first time trying it and i was a little underwhelmed)\n* the cod was glorious and the accompanying sauce was perfect\n* the lobster curry was phenomenal\n\nhowever, as someone with a raging, barely controlled sweet tooth the dessert options were a little limited but still of a superb quality nonetheless.\n\nthe wines suggested by our server were superb and all the cocktails we had at the bar afterwards were excellent.\n\non the way out i noticed what appeared to be the smallest dance floor in the world tucked away almost as an afterthought, however at a vegas altitude where every square metre of space comes at a premium i don't blame them for compromising their dance floor for extra dining space.\n\ni get the feeling that the staff were specifically chosen to bring a warm touch to what had the potential to be a very pretentious experience.  this is definitely a restaurant to try at least once, and i recommend that you try to time your visit around the sunset as this will give you a memorable view of vegas."

            "i came here with my girlfriend for her birthday. back in may the elevator ride up gave us a great view to start the evening\n\nwe got there a little early around 630 pm and were the first ones there. there were plenty of tables so reservations werent even needed. \n\nthe waiter was very nice. he answered all of our questions about every dish we were considering ordering. \n\nwe started with the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> w/ daikon . it was very good. the daikon really helped balance out the richness of the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>.\n\ni had the <mark>Pepper Crusted Bison Tenderloin</mark>. it was prepared just right medium as asked and very tasty..but nothing special. my girlfriend had the <mark>Roasted Duck Breast</mark>. i wish i would have ordered that cause it was delicious. her dish consisted of  a <mark>Roasted Duck Breast</mark> along with a separate piece of duck that had an very very tasty and crispy outer skin. i couldnt eaten that crispy skin all night. \ni would also recommend the fancy mac and cheese they have. \n\nall in all a very good dining experience. but its really just one of those places you need to experience once...", 
            "located in the mandalay bay, mix offers fabulous a modern all white decor and an awesome view of the entire strip. i will definitely go back and strongly recommend it if you like french fusion gourmet modern cuisine. \n\nit also listed as one of the most romantic restaurant in las vegas! a bit pricey (which is expected from a high-end establishment on the las vegas strip) but worth it, especially for a romantic dinner or a special celebration or even just for a gourmet meal and a good time!\nmy favorite restaurant so far! my boyfriend works there, so we got a deal on all the food. the staff was nice and very professional, even though my boyfriend worked for the lounge side.\n\nall the food was excellent. small portions (since it is considered french cuisine), but we were full at the end. since the staff knew it was a special occasion (our one year anniversary), they offered many items complimentary. off the top of my head, we had the <mark>Pepper Crusted Bison Tenderloin</mark>, kampachi sushi, lobster, tuna tartar. etc. the mac cheese (which is called elbow pasta) is really good as well. forewarning, there is a lot of butter used.  they also had a special martinis (from coconut and pineapple liqueurs). wine selection was also great! (this could be due to the number of master sommeliers on staff) \n\n to top it off, they surprised us with an anniversary dessert platter that had almost everything on the dessert menu. the entire experience was fabulous and succulent!", 
            "a chilly dining experience that detracts from excellent food.\n\nwalking into mix after a vip elevator ride to the 64th floor lets you know right off the bat what you're in for--a restaurant that prides itself on impressing with the appearance of eliteness. you walk through the dark black and red lounge into the uber-modern, all white, all open dining space littered with tables. beautiful, yes, but a place you can settle in for a relaxing, private meal? definitely not.\n\nlas vegas is all about spectacle, and mix definitely has that. but everything from the doorstop of a wine menu to the 18 different servers who hover over you as you eat discourages complete enjoyment. you're so busy trying not to look un-chic that you forget to have fun.\n\nand the food--excellent, no question. i had the curried lobster and my fella had the <mark>Pepper Crusted Bison Tenderloin</mark>. the portions were small but impeccably cooked and flavored. the bison was so tender, it made me angry at every other steak i'd ever had. the prices are quite high, even for vegas. the cocktail list is all sweet, flavored vodka drinks--they want you to drink wine anyway.\n\nbottom line--great food overwhelmed by a snooty vibe and personality-less service.", 
            "can i give this place 6 stars?\n\ni'm still glowing from my visit to mix.  i felt like a princess here: the atmosphere, the service, the foods, the yummy drinks- this place is heaven!\n\nfirst we sat down and ordered cocktails.  xpresso martini is very good and the bread is fantastic.  you get three different kinds and two different types of butter: traditional and peanut butter.  the peanut butter sort of tasted like reeses peanut butter filling to me, so yummy!\n\ni joked to my husband about being chilly and jokingly rubbed my hands over the candle on our table and the \"bread guy\" came over and gave me a fleece blanket for my legs.  so nice!  \n\nour entrees came.  i ordered the wagyu and my husband had the <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> and <mark>Pepper Crusted Bison Tenderloin</mark>.  he loved his dinner and mine was good but just not my taste.  so i was saving mine to take \"to go,\" to he could have it tomorrow.  the waitor asked how i liked my dinner and i told him that the martini was good, not wanting to be a problem, but he insisted \"very good, but how is your wagyu?\"  i told him it was okay but my husband will eat it.  he insisted i try another entree!  it's not like me to send something back, never did it before, especially when it was cooked just fine but it was something i never had before and didn't know i wouldn't like.  i ordered the ny strip steak instead- and it was sooo fabulous.  i was so pleased that he suggested i try another entree.\n\nour server's name was \"wayne,\" he's the best.  i plan to return here often and i'll ask if wayne is working, he made our experience just that much nicer.  pretty much all the staff that we ran into was very friendly.\n\nunfortunately the lounge was reserved for a convention party but wayne says we can get in tomorrow if we show our receipt.  we might do it.. the view was beautiful from the lounge.  it was beautiful from where we were sitting also, on the patio.  \n\ni have nothing negative to say about this place.  i hope they do really well.  our bill was $200 which is pretty steep but well worth it. \n\ni recommend the cheesecake martini!  the best martini i've ever had which should mean something because i am a conneseuir by now. :-)\n\nyay mix!  i'll see you next week when my cousin comes to visit us.  yelpers- go here.  if nothing else, for the view, drinks, and desserts.  the desserts are fantastic.", 
            "impressive... everything from the views to the interior design and food. stellar views of the strip from the lounge but the dining room's decor does not disappoint either as it was the opposite view of the strip. highly recommend the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> which was heavenly melting in our mouths. we also had the <mark>Pepper Crusted Bison Tenderloin</mark> and the red snapper thai ginger dishes. presentation and tastes were perfect. a truly memorable experience!", 
            "2.5 stars. i would give it 3 for food, but the experience was just horrendous, i couldn't bring myself to give it 3. \n\ni heard nothing but good things about mix. so when we were going to magic, i knew i had to make our team dinner at mix. their view is incredible, the restaurant is cute/modern, and it's definitely trendy. \n\nthe one thing that i have to complain about is the service. it's god awful. they are so slow i can't stand it. we waited over an hour for our food to come out. my boss complained to the manager, and they just comped a bottle of wine, without very much regard or apology. for a michelin rated restaurant, this is a big no no. the waiter didn't even acknowledge that our food was going to be late, or offer any explanation as to why it took so long. \n\nok, now that i got my rant aside, i'll move onto the food/drinks\n\ni stuck to the skinny girl margaritas, and they were just ok. it wasn't mixed very well (alcohol was at the way bottom), and it wasn't something i wanted to devour immediately. \n\nfor appetizers, we got the  macaroni and <mark>Macaroni & Cheese with Ham</mark> and lobster casesar salad. the salad was fresh, and tasty. the mac and cheese? not so much. it was runny, and just not good. no cheesy goodness there. you can skip that.\n\nfor entrees, i got he <mark>Pepper Crusted Bison Tenderloin</mark> with glazed vegetables and black pepper sauce. the meat was cooked very well, medium rare, super soft, but that pepper crusted part was so peppery that it was overpowering. all i could taste was the pepper, and it definitely took away from the entree. as for sides, we got the <mark>Creamy Spinach</mark> and the fork crushed potatoes. sides were good, but nothing to die over. \n\nat this point, our meal was getting to be so long i wanted it to be over (we were approaching hour 3). but they gave us homemade madelines and chocolate, and this passion fruit \"drink\" served in a martini glass with foam. just too much dessert that i didn't even want. we quickly tried that, and asked for the bill. my boss paid for it, so i can't tell you exactly how much it was, but 6 people was about $500.", 
            "had dinner here last night with a few co-workers.  i started with the (duck) <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and then had the <mark>Pepper Crusted Bison Tenderloin</mark> and a quince tart for dessert with some lovely sorbet.  \n\nall in all, it was a good meal, the view was great, the wine was good and the atmosphere is a welcome retreat from the noise and flash of the strip.  yet, somehow, it didn't all add up to a spectacular meal - it was a very good meal, but for whatever reason, this isn't the type of experience that makes me want to bring my wife here the next time we're in vegas.\n\nlet me be clear, you will have a good meal here.  you probably won't make memories here, however.  what's the english translation for je ne sais quoi?  whatever it is, this place is missing that.", 
            "i guess a restaurant with a 4 diamond rating doesn't need another review. i've been to a lot of fabulous restaurants, mostly in the phoenix/scottsdale area and i always rave about a great restaurant. i can honestly say that our waiter made the difference for me here. this guy looks like he was a 20 year old scene kid with some of the craziest hair i have seen. and he blew me away with his knowledge of wine, regions, vineyards and history when totally caught off guard. he was prepared for every question we had, topic of discussion. he proceeds to modestly share that he worked for the french laundry. he was sooo attentive, so friendly and his presence and skill at his job just left me in awe. seriously. anyway, to the food. we were brought a bread basket with some very unique spreads and butters. try them all. hands down the best filet i have ever tasted. pepper crusted with a bernaise sauce. my friend wanted to order the wagyu like we've had before out here for about $10 an oz. $34 an oz here! no thanks! the <mark>Pepper Crusted Bison Tenderloin</mark> he chose was a perfect substitute! food, wine, desert, service is going to be amazing. but the views are incredible! make time to sit at the bar to check out the city!", 
            "came here for dinner, not the lounge portion, but if you want beautiful panoramas of the city i highly suggest you start here. but, be careful, they seem to be pretty snotty about outdoor seating even when the place is empty. call ahead.\n\nas for dinner, the restaurant is beautiful. you walk in and get instant visual stimulation. it's incredible. from the decor to the lights of the city all around, it really is just a place that draws you in. \n\nthere were a few thins that happened that could have been avoided and this would have been a four star experience. the first incident was being seated in a cozy little nook where conversation could be had without being so close to the next person you feel like you're sharing family secrets. that didn't last long. the hostess immediately, in a bare, empty, no one-there restaurant, seats people right next to me and my date. hello? that is beyond rude. i mean, the tables are so close together as to be really uncomfortable. to use the bathroom i literally had to wedge myself between my table and the one next to us. awkward. also, the waiter, when asked for my favorite belgian beer tried to tell me they only carried one type. i had to insist that he go ask someone because he was wrong (for the record, chimay comes in blue, white and red). \n\nother than those two missteps everything was okay. the service was quick and flawless. the time between waiter visits was perfect. i had to ask for water just one time and after that i couldn't take a sip without it being refilled. so, great job of picking up on that. we were also greeted by several people on our way in which i thought was a very nice touch.\n\nonto dinner. for appetizers i had the dinner salad which was essentially a larger than average bowl of mixed greens. it was mixed with a vinaigrette of some sort that just added to the bitter taste of the overall salad. i wouldn't recommend. my date had the spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> which was delicious, but absolutely could have come from mom's kitchen. what can i say, my mom's a great cook! \n\nfor an entree i had the 12 oz. <mark>Boneless Ribeye</mark>. it was cooked perfectly, but was much too large for me to eat so i brought the extra home. it was delicious. it did happen to be more of a fatty cut than i was used to, excessively so. it was fine, but i prefer less fat, more beef, obviously. for sides i chose the fork crushed potatoes. they were chunky and rich, but again, they could have come from my mom's kitchen. \n\nmy date had the <mark>Pepper Crusted Bison Tenderloin</mark> and seemed to enjoy it. i dislike that much pepper anywhere near me, but it looked delicious. his side was sauteed spinach which he found delicious. \n\nfor dessert i passed, but my friend had the ice cream/toppings. you get four choices of either and he chose pistachio ice cream, salted caramel ice cream and vanilla ice cream with coconut crunch as a topping. the pistachio was creamy and rich, i loved it. i could have done without the coconut, but really it wasn't a distraction. i disliked intensely the salted caramel. it tasted very bland and very unlike any salted caramel i've ever tasted. i almost think that's a taste that belongs solely in candy form. i just don't think it translates well to other things, which isn't the fault of the restaurant, i've just never found that it works on much else but candy. as for the vanilla, well, it was vanilla. \n\nall in all the decor, charm and service were perfection. the food was so enjoyable although i didn't get the michelin star experience, i don't think. the food really was good and the view was just beautiful. with all the restaurants in vegas, though, i doubt i'll revisit. but, do go try it once!", 
            "we were there with a party of 10 to celebrate a friend's birthday.\n\nthe good news-the view is great.\n\n\nthe service is awful.  aside from the guy topping off my water every few minutes, i was shocked at how bad the service was.  this alone would cause me to never go back.  we were seated, and waited nearly 15 minutes for a drink order to be taken.  we then waited about another 15 minutes before our apps order was taken.  and the restaurant wasn't full.\n\nthe food, imo, was mediocre at best. i started with a <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark>, which is normally one of my favorite appetizers, and i've had it in several different places.  while the plate certainly looked nice, it was tasteless.  i mean, you have a spice rack back there, don't you?  just very bland, and nothing at all special. there was a tiny bit of sauce on the side that provided some much needed flavor-but they put 4 dime sized drops across the plate.  hey, it would have been nice to have some of it that was meant for more than decoration.\n\ni got the slow roasted halibut for an entree.  it was cooked very well, but again-it was flavorless.  there was, once again, the tiniest bit of sauce over the halibut, that sat on a bed of peppers and some other vegetables.  that bed of vegetables was without question the best part of the meal.  it was very good.  the dish came with a small amount of \"lobster sauce\" on the side, which imo had no business being put on that nice piece of halibut.  on the side i also ordered the \"fork mashed\" potatoes.  once again (and almost comically so...), there was no salt, no herbs, no butter, no flavor. \n\nfor dessert, i got a piece of strawberry cheesecake that was very tasty.  it came with a sorbet on the side, and a small amount of fruit compote.  one of my friends asked how it was, and i said \"it's good,  but luckily sugar, fruit, and cheese mixed together is usually going to come out pretty good\".\n\ni will say that one of my friends got , iirc, a <mark>Pepper Crusted Bison Tenderloin</mark> of some sort that was very good.  if i ever found myself here again (which probably won't happen anytime soon), that would certainly be what i got.  there were also a few of us that got the lobster, which they said was very good.\n\nthere were also two different versions of a tasting menu that looked really good that some of us wanted to try.  but, it was not to be, because in order to order that, the entire table had to get it-something that i really don't understand.\n\none last note-i personally can't stand when a restaurant decides to automatically put a gratuity on the bill.  it's just a pet peeve of mine, and i know waiters and waitresses work hard, etc.  and i always pay it-but i sometimes will let the manager know that the staff would have been tipped a lot more if they just kept that off of there.  in this case, for the first time, we had people taking out calculators to figure out how much of a tip was put on the bill-something i've never done.  if i wasn't with a group of people celebrating a birthday, i would have absolutely complained to the manager to get that gratuity off the bill, and i would have decided myself how much to leave-the service was that bad.", 
            "i'll preface this review by disclosing that my wife and i had both our wedding ceremony and reception at mix.  on one hand, that may make me biased a bit in my love for this restaurant, but on the other hand, that also made me far more critical of the food, staff and service since we paid them the price of a small car to do an exclusive buy out on a saturday evening in vegas for a seven hour event.  \n\nso, that being said, here goes; saving food for last!  edit: looks like i have to trim my review, i hit the 5000 character limit. :-(\n\n1) ambience - if you like old fashioned or traditional decor in your dining venues, you will probably hate mix.  there is not a wood panel anywhere to be found, nor any green or blue carpeting.  the interior is many modern features with the centerpiece being the thousands of blown glass bulbs hanging from the ceiling around the two level dining area; the idea being to make it look like champagne bubbles rising.\n\nthe main seating area enjoys two story tall open windows with both views of the mountains and views of the strip.  if you're sitting inside, sunset is a perfect time to go because it looks simply incredible.  if you're sitting outside on their balcony, you'll only have a strip view because of where the balcony is located, but the view is still excellent at all times of day since you're 64 stories up looking north up the strip.  i recommend after dark for balcony seating.\n\n2) service - i've never had a bad experience at mix.  my wife and i visited vegas several times in advance of our wedding and dined at mix each time just to reassure ourselves that we had made the right decision.  we did not let them know in advance that we were coming to ensure we got to experience service as it normally is.  drinks are always full, they'll pick your napkin up and re-fold it if you get up to go to the bathroom, they check on your needs frequently, everyone is very congenial and outgoing.\n\nwe've been back numerous times since our wedding and yes, now we probably get extra service as many of the staff are still there and recognize us (it was a pretty memorable wedding), but they're really great folks.  i'm sure over the years as staff come and go we'll be a distant memory and service will go back to 'normal' but for the three years we've been back so far they've really made it special.\n\n3) special requests.  they've been very accommodating to us both for our wedding/reception and since then.  for example, on our first anniversary when we went back, i arranged with a cake bakery to make a small version of our wedding cake and deliver it to mix to surprise my wife after dinner.  the restaurant ensured someone was available to receive the cake that day and then they cut and served it for us.  if you're having a special occasion, talk to the staff and see if there's anything special you would want.\n\n4) food!  okay, the view sold me on this place to begin with, and fortunately, the food lived up to, and exceeded, expectations.  here's what we've had and when:\n\na) the <mark>Pepper Crusted Bison Tenderloin</mark>, <mark>Cod Brandade</mark> and roasted free range chicken (not always a menu option) were our wedding choices for guests.  the bison was awesome; many steak lovers who had never had bison remarked at how great the flavor was.  on the fish, we also had quite a few comments where significant others had shared their fish entree with someone who was not a fan of fish and they loved it, so that speaks for itself.\n\nb) surf & turf.  although it's not always on the menu, they'll do a filet and lobster if you ask.  my wife gets this religiously and loves it.  i will note that it is not as good as the surf & turf from n9ne at the palms.  there's regular surf & turf, then there's mix's surf & turf, then there's the n9ne surf & turf which is the best one in the universe.\n\nc) <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> rossini with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> & black truffle sauce.  if you're into truffles, i'm sure you'll love this.  the steak comes out perfectly.  i'm not a huge fan of the sauce so this is one of those love/hate meals for me.  perhaps ask to try the sauce before you order; not sure if that's possible.\n\nd) roasted maine lobster \"au curry\".  i love spicy, i love indian food, i love this meal.  it's my go-to mix meal; i get it every time once i tried it.  it's perfect combo of everything i love; lobster, spicy, curry, veggies, etc.\n\ndon't forget to go visit the mix lounge next door after dinner!  great place to relax and have a drink and cigar (on the balcony only of course).",

            "very nice food and ambiance, but very very expensive. \n\naccording to our friendly waiter, mix is supposed to comprise both heaven and hell. the bar uses dark colors reminiscent of flames, because as we all know, drinking is evil and alcohol is the work of the devil. the main dining area uses light colors without seeming bright or harsh. it's surrounded by a curtain of glass handblown balls that are supposed to represent rain from the heavens. a few of the tables are sheltered by a white pod that looks like something from star trek. we sat outside, with a perfect view of the gigantic glittering sign for thehotel at eye level. i guess that means we were in purgatory? \n\nin the bar, i ordered a $16 cocktail called violet, which was fruity but not cutesy or too sweet. it was delicious and potent. when we sat down at our table, we were given a basket of different kinds of bread and proceeded to tear little nibbles off of each one, slathered them in peanut-butter (i'd say it was one part peanut butter to 10 parts butter) and very satisfingly ruined our collective appetites. \n\nwe easily chose our meals - i had the pistachio crusted sea bass with parmesan foam and a side of \"the best macaroni & cheese you'll ever have.\" the sea bass was fantastic. the mac & cheese was okay, but not the best i've ever had - everyone knows i like it cheap & gooey. i tasted some of my companions' meals too - bison in a peppery crust, <mark>Roasted Duck Breast</mark>, and gnocchi. all really tasty and beautifully prepared. \n\nmost of us didn't order appetizers because we were a little floored by the prices. my friends and i are bay area foodies, but this place was pretty expensive by our standards. the average main course was around $50, and appetizers were $20ish. \n\nbut what really stumped us was the wine list. we saw one bottle in there for $36,000. another one for $12,000. those were prices for cars, not wine. we asked the sommelier to help us choose a bottle of wine in the two-digit range, and he found a nice australian shiraz for us. it was excellent wine, but i don't typically spend more than $20 on a bottle, maybe $50 if it's especially nice. \n\nall in all, we divided up the check among 7 of us, and each paid about $100. i'm afraid some people felt cheated who didn't drink wine or order an appetizer. i would have to say it was nice, but not nice enough to warrant those prices. it wasn't the french laundry, yunno?", 
            "i really wanted to love this place.  maybe i just went on an off night.  \n\nthe view was fantastic--we sat on the outdoor patio.  however, it was really hot outside and there was no a/c or fans outside to alleviate the 90-degree heat.  there was a newlywed couple sitting next to us, still in their wedding clothes, totally sweating.  i wouldn't want to eat in 90 degree heat for my wedding dinner.  i'd think a restaurant of this caliber might at least have some sort of solution to the heat.  \n\nthe food was just ok for the price.  i liked the appetizers we ordered (blue fin <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> and vitello tonnato) more than the main dishes (<mark>Roasted Duck Breast</mark> and pan seared john dory.  the <mark>Roasted Duck Breast</mark> was chewy and sliced a little too thick, thus enhancig the chewiness.  the fish was very overcooked and even--gasp!--dry in parts...which is not the texture i expect in a $46 fish filet.\n\nwe shared the tropical souffle for dessert and it was delicious!  the coffee was really good too.  but, not enough to redeem the dry fish and chewy duck.\n\ni also feel that the menu options were rather limited...and if you're not going to offer that many dishes, then at least make sure the ones you do offer are well-executed.\n\nfor a similar price range ($100-150 per person), i think picasso was better.", 
            "i had the small tasting menu with wine. sat on the patio on the sixty something floor of the hotel! we definitely don't have this in milwaukee!\n\namuse- <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and fig jam. beautiful, layered like a parfait. just a classicly rich combination. paired with a champagne made especially for the restaurant!\n\nfirst course-<mark>Maine Lobster Salad</mark> with coral dressing. perfectly poached lobster...very good!\n\nsecond course- roasted cod over <mark>Cod Brandade</mark>. i am usually not a cod fan, but this was so soft and buttery, there was no way to improve on it! paired with a chardonnay that cut through the fattiness well.\n\nthird course- <mark>Roasted Duck Breast</mark> with braised diakon and baby vegetables. another very well done dish. one negative though; one piece of duck was so tough that i had to discard it.paired with a very big bold zin.\n\npre-dessert- a really fun passion fruit and guava puree with a coconut foam, served in a martini glass!\n\ndessert- i think it was called a tropical fruit fantasy. tons of different fresh fruit with a tropical sorbet. paired with more champagne.\n\ni ended my night looking out over the vegas skyline,sipping champagne, munching on tender little madeleines that came with the bill ($185), thinking, \"life is good!\"", 
            "see profile site for full review with formatted pics.\n\nfor myself, the focus was the food and the evening unfolded as follows:\n\n\"amuse bouche\" - eggplant caviar w/tuna picatta, crispy chip - a small blend of tender eggplant and spicy tuna plus a crispy round for dipping, this was a wonderful taste to begin the evening.  barely spicy with hints of tomato and basil, the texture was like a creamy tuna salad without the mayo.\n\ndish 1:  kampachi sashimi, green curry emulsion, seaweed salad - perfect kampachi with a fairly mild flavor, yet delectably enhanced by the green curry this dish was quite attractive and a good followup to the tuna.  as good as the fish was, however, the seaweed salad was incredible and my only complaint could possibly be that there wasn't ten times as much.  then again, had i known how much food was to come i'd have known better.\n\ndish 2:  <mark>Tender Potato Gnocchi</mark>, fresh morels & asparagus with veal juice and flaked parmesagna - knowing my feelings about gnocchi, this dish was a part of the reason i'd selected mix in the first place.  unlike thomas keller's buttery parisian version, ducasse opts here to utilize the italian formula of simple and tender potato dumplings with just a little salt and complements from the dense and woody flavor of perfectly tender morels and flawlessly crisp asparagus.  the veal juice and parmesagna added a salty and savory component to the dish.  while not the best gnocchi ever, the texture and flavor were sublime and i'd certainly re-order on return visits.\n\ndish 3:  macadamia/pistachio crusted halibut, asparagus cream, parmesan foam - the show stealer for my friend and a solid frontrunner for best-fish-dish-ever for myself, it is hard to describe the delicate nuisances of this dish without experiencing it.  perfectly poached fish with a crunchy yet sweet and nutty coating bisected a plate with asparagus and creamy asparagus cream on one side and a cheesy foam on the other side.  while each flavor was superb separately, the combination was even more stunning with the cream and foam drizzled over the fish.  a second dish featuring asparagus and parmesan, it is easy to see why ducasse serves these two dishes back to back frequently and i cannot recommend the combination enough.  in a weekend that featured tasting menu fish preparations by le cirque and alex as well, this may have been the best fish dish of all, and that is saying something.\n\ndish 4:  roasted maine lobster \"au curry\", coconut basmati rice, pineapple, raisin, and pearl onions - quite frankly i've no idea what ducasse was thinking when he prepared this dish the first time, but the thought it was certainly inspired by a muse or a god.  to be fair, the curry was understated so anyone ordering this for heat will be disappointed.....i didn't order for heat.  what i ordered it for was a fantastically prepared lobster served over sweet sticky rice and complimented by roasted onions and sweet fruits.  while not quite as mind-blowing as the lobster at alex (which may be my favorite dish of all time,) this is the second best lobster preparation i've ever experienced and it will haunt my dreams until i find a means to prepare it myself.\n\ndish 5:  <mark>Roasted Duck Breast</mark>, black mission fig, radish & baby turnips, fig sauce - my first substitution and absolutely worth the choice.  a well cooked yet juicy <mark>Roasted Duck Breast</mark>, skin on and perforated for complete cooking, the meat was not gamey at all and the earthy/meaty texture was wonderfully offset by the figs and fig sauce, yet given a crispy textural component by the radish and turnips.  while the \"worst\" of the dishes in my opinion, the competition was pretty stiff and that is no disrespect at all.   \n\npalate cleanser:  passionfruit and mango sorbet with coconut lime foam - served in a martini glass, i believe the phrase palate cleanser was invented for this dish.  i don't even like mango and this item impressed me.  \n\ndessert:  baba au rhum, monte carlo style with spiced rum and cr\\u00c8me anglais - while i'm not a drinker, i am a fan of rum cake and rank mastro's buttercake amongst my all time favorite desserts.  a small cake was served along with a pot of rum and a second pot of cr\\u00e8me which was then reconstructed by the waiter tableside, first pouring a little rum and then a dollop of cream with further customization allowed.  while not quite as good as mastros, the dish was a beautiful compliment to the meal and left a warm feeling in my belly for the rest of the night.\n\nmadelines :  to cap off the meal we were served four of ducasse's signature madelines straight from the piping hot pan along with warm nutella.  while i realize the tradition of the madeline has been carried on by both stratta and boulud, it is my understanding that ducasse was first and though i've not tried daniel's, ducasse's option blew alex's out of the water.  moist, creamy, delicate, and perfect with the nutella.", 
            "i came here with my girlfriend for her birthday. back in may the elevator ride up gave us a great view to start the evening\n\nwe got there a little early around 630 pm and were the first ones there. there were plenty of tables so reservations werent even needed. \n\nthe waiter was very nice. he answered all of our questions about every dish we were considering ordering. \n\nwe started with the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> w/ daikon . it was very good. the daikon really helped balance out the richness of the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>.\n\ni had the <mark>Pepper Crusted Bison Tenderloin</mark>. it was prepared just right medium as asked and very tasty..but nothing special. my girlfriend had the <mark>Roasted Duck Breast</mark>. i wish i would have ordered that cause it was delicious. her dish consisted of  a <mark>Roasted Duck Breast</mark> along with a separate piece of duck that had an very very tasty and crispy outer skin. i couldnt eaten that crispy skin all night. \ni would also recommend the fancy mac and cheese they have. \n\nall in all a very good dining experience. but its really just one of those places you need to experience once...", 
            "the high ceilings, white decor with imitation crystal cascade and plus absolutely amazing view of vegas makes this place a super romantic spot. although we were not big fans of the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> with rhubarb sauce we were nevertheless impressed by the size of it. my <mark>Roasted Duck Breast</mark> was tender and juicy. the drink that i ordered a mix of champagne and vodka gave me a fast buzz. absolutely recommend the drink if you are willing to cope <mark>Macaroni & Cheese with Ham</mark> it gives next morning. \nthe ladies room again wowed me with decor as it had hint to futurism. if you dined at mix they will waive cover charge for the lounge area with another fantastic view.", 
            "mix was a huge, did i say huge, disappointment.  i would not recommend it to my enemies.  i would have hoped that for a $400 bill (for 2 people) i would get to experience some amazing food.  \n\nthe restaurant itself is beautifully decorated, with strung glass 'bubbles' acting as the sculptural centerpiece of the entire dining room.  my co-worker and i asked to be seated by the window to enjoy the beautiful las vegas night view from the 64th floor of  the hotel.  the hostess very coldly told us that the only-left window table was reserved for a \"marketing\" party.  wtf.  and for the record, that table was empty the entire night.\n\nwe decided to go for the \"a taste of mix\" tasting menu, the wine pairing, and the <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> appetizer.  pretty much fail.  we began our eating experience with an amuse bouche concoction of goat cheese, a yellowy mash, and an olive.  the girl sitting at the table next to us blurted out \"gross\" when our server described what it was.  and indeed, it was gross.  it felt like gunk in my mouth.    \n\nfor starters, we had the <mark>Maine Lobster Salad</mark>.  the lobster was juicy and delicious with the sweetness of the melon. if you are ever unsure about what appetizer to order, you can always count on the <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> being good at basically any sf restaurant.  the <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> here had no flavor and desperately needed to be hit with some lime juice to punch up the flavors.  it was just a bland blob for $24.  \n\nwe moved onto our main courses - the stripped bass and <mark>Roasted Duck Breast</mark>.  the bass was delicious with a sprinkling of little asparagus slices.  however, the blanquette sauce was a bit too cheesy for me after a few bites.  the duck was just weird.  it looked like a lame piece of boiled strip of meat that you would think would cut easily, but no, it was difficult to cut.  it did not have much flavor and simply did not look appetizing.  the baby turnips that the server said was \"slowly cooked for 5 hours\" looked like something my mom could whip out in 10 mins.    \n\ni must say that the pre-dessert was the bright light during this dinner.  the passion fruit juice/mix of sorts topped with a sweet coconuty frothy cream in a martini was delicious.  the sweetness of the cream and the tartness worked beautifully.  \n\nthe tropical fruit sensation, consisting of guava sorbet and finely diced mango and other fruits was another let down.  the sorbet was incredibly tart and the fruits simply added to the tartness.  it desperately needed something sweet (like chocolate) to balance it out.  our server noticed that we did no finish much of our plates and gave us freshly baked madeline cookies (right out of the molds) with some nutella.  it was ok.  lol...not enough to make it a good dinner.\n\nin addition to the pre-dessert, i thoroughly enjoyed my wine pairings.  i am not a wine person, but i did get to try two awesomely sweet wines - the 2007 riesling, dr thanisch and the 2007 moscato d'asti, d. rivetti. yum yum yum :)\n\nyou are better off going to the bellagio buffet.  or just having a drink at the adjacent mix lounge while enjoying the view.  i would suggest you gamble away $400 then going here.  at least then you might get something in return.", 
            "picked <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> on their michelin rating and reputation of the chef. overall, the experience wad awkward from beginning to end. when you get out of the elevator and walk to the host desk, you find that it is on the other side and have to walk through the bar to get to the main dining room. strange and not welcoming...\n\nservice was pretty uncomfortable, not very polished, and there was no connection/personality. we saw the server about two times throughout the night and that's about it. no quality check either... my friends and i have not seen each other in over a year, so we did not pay much attention to the shortcomings. busser was really good though, he was the only one who payed attention to us all night.\n\nwhat is up with the pad and pencil on the table? and i hate to be picky, but why is there salt and pepper on the table during dinner? lastly, why are the hostesses sitting down on the bar stool that is behind their desk?\n\nsorry, i need to shut off my brain sometimes and just enjoy dinner.\n\nfood was food though. our party of three had: tuna tar tare, shrimp cocktail, <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, roasted lamp chops, seared <mark>Roasted Duck Breast</mark>, and chicken. for wine we had a bottle of dr. loosen's eroica. tasty. oh props on the bread selection: parker rolls, fusettes, focaccia... the peanut butter spread did nothing for me, regular butter with maldon on top is fine.  \n\nthe dining room is gorgeous and the views are stunning (esp. from the lounge). we decided to have a post dinner cocktail + dessert here, but was underwhelmed by their selection.", 
            "this place was impeccable! the service was amazing and the views did not disappoint. we initially booked this reservation based on the beauty of the restaurant but the food turned out to be the star. we started with the gnocchi and, as others have said, it was incredible....probably one of the best things i have ever tasted. the pea puree was so delicate! our main course included a wonderfully done <mark>Roasted Duck Breast</mark> and delicious pistachio encrusted halibut. portion size was very small for the duck but perfect for the fish. everything was presented beautifully and had amazing flavor. we ordered profiteroles for dessert and the ice cream came on a bed of smashed merengue cookies which added incredible texture to the dish. \nif you are looking for an amazing meal in a very romantic restaurant then this is the place for you!", 
            "perched high upon the 64th floor of the hotel, the only way to access mix is via a high-speed glass elevator that has only two possible stops - level 1, and level 64.  the quick, drastic elevation change plugs my ears a little bit every time.\n\nthe night view (it's only open for dinner) of the city and south end of the strip is pretty fantastic from both the dining and lounge areas, and the lounge includes an outdoor patio.\n\nthis 1 star michelin-rated (in addition to other awards) dining experience offers a medium sized american/french based menu.\n\ni enjoyed the <mark>Roasted Duck Breast</mark> with fig as my entree.  it was tender, rich, tasty, and surprisingly filling for such a small portion.  this could also be a result of filling up on the (free) bread with butter and peanut butter that is included, and from boozing beforehand.\n\nreservations are strongly suggested.  unless it's a slow night (which is not the norm), you're not getting in without them.  also, plan on making the reservations many hours (if not days) before your dinner.  i've been denied on more than one occasion by procrastinating until the 11th hour.\n\nbecause it's vegas, you can get away with moderately casual dress.  however, this is a very high end restaurant where dressing up would be more than appropriate.\n\nplan on spending somewhere between $40 to over $100 per person for food alone depending on your hunger level and tastes.\n\nsurprisingly, mixx offers a generous discount at restaurant.com -  http://www.restaurant.com/rdc/mandalay-bay-resort-mix-in-las-vegas-las-vegas-french-restaurant-rid=357835.  search fatwallet.com for a promo code to get the restaurant.com $50 certificate down to around $5 or less.\n\nfinally, by dining at mixx, you're free to enter the lounge/club afterwards and avoid the cover charge.  although it looked interesting, there was money to be made at the poker tables below, so i opted out of dancing and drinks with the ballers.", 
            "as stunningly beautiful as it is, eating at mix is kind of like eating in an airport terminal or a shopping mall. the high ceilings and glass and granite surfaces create an echo effect, so every sound reverberates off the walls and floors and just makes for an unsettling dining experience.\n\nacoustics aside, the food was pretty decent, although not quite as impressive as we had hoped. the best dish of the evening was the spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>. elegantly presented on a bed of guacamole and topped with shredded heart of palm, it was lively and fresh and made you feel like you were at a resort in cabo. the <mark>Cod Brandade</mark> was acceptable, but i was expecting exceptional. the lemon and capers just weren't enough to brighten up the bland brown butter sauce and the soggy fried parsley. and the <mark>Roasted Duck Breast</mark> was so forgettable that i simply forgot what went with it.\n\nwe were very impressed, however, with the wine service. we didn't want to order a bottle, so we just asked the somm to pair our dishes for us. he seemed to enjoy the challenge and was a delight to talk to.\n\none last note: i realize there isn't much the restaurant can do, but people really should not bring young children to these kinds of places. it's inappropriate and inconsiderate to your fellow diners -- especially so at mix because the sound of your rug rats squealing and shouting gets amplified throughout the entire restaurant."

            "i had a great time at mix. i originally reserved for 2 people at 9pm. my horrible airport experience forced me to be 10-15 minutes late and not be able to change into a nicer outfit. they were very nice about the tardiness, assuming how the restaurant hours was until 10pm, and usually these dinners take long. my date and i were not rushed or anything during our dinner.\n\nthis place is beautiful! the bubbly decor coming from the ceiling made me think that i was dining under the sea. yet i'm at the very top of thehotel at mandalay bay. our booth was facing the backside of the strip, so the scenery was more mellow and calming than the glamorous strip, my dinner felt extremely relaxing although i was rushing there and freaking out at the airport.\n\nwe both ordered the tasting menu, which had a spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, halibut, <mark><mark>Colorado Lamb Loin</mark></mark>, and the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark>. i believe the entire table has to choose one of the tasting menus if any wanted to try it. my date didn't want to in the beginning since he wasn't into <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> or lamb. our server offered to switch out the lamb for the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> for $10 extra. \n\nwe started off the meal with a scallop ceviche. i enjoyed it a lot, it's very light, and the lime juice wasn't too overwhelming like most of the places that served ceviche. it was just right. it's interesting how they have some shredded raw mango on top, felt like some type of fusion going on here. \n\ni was enthralled by the looks of the spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>. very detailed with different layers of ingredients stacked up, but i had too high of expectations on the flavors. i don't recall it being spicy or crabby enough. for spiciness, i might be immune so my taste buds are less sensitive to spiciness. i was a bit disappointed there.\n\nsecond course came about with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> with lemon confit & dates. i liked how mine was seared just right, where it's more rare inside. i love the aftertaste and the aroma from each bite. unfortunately, i'm not too educated in <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, all i can tell you is if i liked it and met my expectations of it. i got to eat my date's piece too, since he's not too interested in something this rich in taste. his piece was a bit more cooked than mine, easier to slice, i just prefer a softer texture.\n\nthird course was the best one yet, halibut prepared in chicken jus and vegetable blanquette. every. bite. was. amazing. my general perception of halibut is that it's very bland and tasteless. this dish had such interesting flavors in many different layers. the flavors in every bite were going under transformation inside my mouth. i seriously don't want to finish this dish because i don't want the experience to end. \n\nfourth course was my <mark><mark>Colorado Lamb Loin</mark></mark>, with stuffed piquillo peppers and prommes anna. portions were generous, or maybe i was just very full. the spices on the <mark><mark>Colorado Lamb Loin</mark></mark> didn't take away the flavors of the lamb at all. i didn't like the meat inside the piquillo peppers though, it was a bit too tough. otherwise, the whole pepper was fun to eat; it's not the textures that were interesting but flavors of the pepper and the meat were well blended. the prommes anna was very crispy in the outside, you can feel the flakey texture with your tongue too. unfortunately i was hitting my maximum capacity.\n\nthat's when they brought out our pre-dessert. it was a sweet drink with mango puree tasted sweet and sour, topped with some coconut rum foam. it reminded me of thailand, maybe because of the tropical taste. the tart taste ease up the digestion, which was just what i needed!\n\nand finally, the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> of mix served with coconut/lime sorbet. the looks of it wasn't too spectacular, just a bar with a piece of gold flake and two half nuts on top. yes gold flake isn't too spectacular. i liked the simplicity of it though. it tasted like a ferrero rocher in a bar form served with the sorbet on the side. the combination is great. the sweetness of the chocolate is evened out with a light citrus.\n\nour dinner ended at 11:30-11:45. it would have been a nightmare if they didn't tolerate that 10 minutes of tardiness. in addition, our server offered us to their lounge with no covers. it was a great offer monetary-wise, but we were just in such a rush before that we were nowhere close in dressed properly for lounges. maybe next time :)",

            "time to update, i finally ate in the restaurant.  since i've basically declared the mandalay bay my second home (not by choice btw), i've come to know and love the fact that restaurant.com offers discounts to almost all of their restaurants.  it allows business people without an expense account, like myself, the opportunity to eat good food without feeling the urge to jump off the beautiful balcony when the check arrives.  so thanks restaurant.com!\n\nthe interior of the restaurant is stunning.  definitely worth the trip just to see it.  i would have been happy dining inside but we were escorted to a table outside so that we could enjoy the beautiful view.  nice!\n\nafter deciding against a cocktail...\n\n***sorry, i have to add a side note here.  mix, update your cocktail menu!  the cocktails on the list are reminiscent of sex and the city circa 1994!***\n\nwe decided to check out the wine list.  if you're not dining at mix for a special occasion, you can get away with a $50 bottle.  it won't be great, but hey, when you've been working for 12 hours, who cares.  we settled on an unmemorable bottle of white.  \n\nwe started with the 1/2 portion of <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>.  it was gigantic.  i kept wondering if they brought the full order because it was so big.  definitely large enough for 2.  it was amazing.  \n\nfor the main course, i chose the <mark>Braised Wagyu</mark> en cocotte.  it was phenomenal.  the most tender and delicious meat that i've had since i can remember.  i don't think i even needed a knife.  i would comment on what my friend ordered but who the heck knows.  i don't think i even looked up from my meal to see.  it was that good.\n\nat the end of the meal we were stuffed.  i don't think i was able to finish my main course but there's always room for ice cream.  we went with the homemade ice creams and sorbets - coco lime, buttermilk and butter pecan.  worth every calorie.\n\nto top things off, our server was cool and very professional.  he took great care of us.  it was a great way to end the work day.  i loved it!", 
            "despite the mix-ed reviews- sorry for the bad pun- i decided to dine hear because:\n\n1. i was staying at mandalay bay and wanted to do something close.\n2. i had a $50 off gift certificate\n3. i thought to myself, \"well even if the food is so-so like i read, its got a great view and cool decor.\"\n\nwell i guess since i had lower expectations, i ended up being pretty happy with the experience. first thing i should mention, you really should view mix as a french-influenced american steakhouse, as opposed to a french restaurant along the lines of le cirque. if you look at the menu, you'll notice how similar it is to a classic steakhouse. that said, the food isn't going to be mindblowing, but it is really good, albeit pricey. i love <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, but at $32 for an app, this was the most i ever paid for it...but it was a nice sized portion and it was cooked perfectly. my <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> was perfect also, and i needed that after the chewy hangar steak i had at sage the previous night. dessert was a passion fruit souffle...again, very good...moist and eggy. \n\nthe service was good, the setting was really cool..it really looks great in there at night with the lights dimmed...and the view was great also, althoguh tough to see because of the reflection on the windows. the elevator ride up is quite an experience also... a glass-enclosed elevator on the outside of thehotel giving you a view for the ride all the way up and back down. \n\nit was worth going to once, especially with the $50 off, but i don't think i'll be returning with all the other places in vegas to try.", 
            "we were there on saturday and were shocked to learn that no tasting menu available because thet were too busy. yeah right, if there's no tasting menu, then post it on the website so we would not have gone! the food is just so so; the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> was a bit tough, the mac and cheese was a huge disappointment and the filet was tasteless. the best thing is the view. for really good food, try aureole instead. been there three times and never been disappointed.", 
            "we had dinner at mix and had a nice view of the sunset and the strip from where we sat.  i like the indoor/outdoor aspect, in particular the view from the lounge as other reviewers have mentioned.  it is is worth a visit for that alone!\n\nour table had a 4 course tasting menu with wine pairings.  we chose the alain ducasse classics menu, which featured his signature tenderloin as the entree.  \n\ni was disappointed that the sommelier didn't describe each of the wines for us as they were delivered (only the one with the main entree).  at other restaurants, it has been the sommelier and not the waiter who explains the wine.  \n\nthe waiter was a bit over-enthusiastic about the food (almost like he wanted to convince us how good it was) and alain ducasse, explaining to us who he is (we already know, that's why we were there!).  \n\nthe second course was a lobster curry that wasn't a favorite of our table.  all of the other dishes (seabass with asparagus, tenderloin with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, and traditional bhaba rum cake) were all very tasty.", 
            "i can't really think of a better \"special occasion\" restaurant in america. right off the bat, the view of the las vegas strip from the lounge is breathtaking. it's a fantastic place to have a few drinks before dinner, or just in general if you aren't there to dine. even the view from the restroom is fantastic. the main dining room is very contemporary and minimalistic. hundreds of hand-blown glass bubbles fill the area, so it almost feels like you're sitting in a glass of champagne. but what really sets this restaurant apart is the food. from start to finish, everything we tried was exceptional. the one dish that really stands out in my mind was the fillet <mark>Filet Mignon Rossini</mark>. being a big fan of <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, chef alain ducasse really hit a grand slam with this dish. it was easily the best steak i've ever had. on the downside, the prices are a bit on the upper end but you certainly won't be disappointed. so if you're ever in the las vegas area for a special occasion, mix should be on the top of your list for fine dining dinner spots.",

            "dining in the restaurant mix by alain ducasse was on my food list of top places to dine around the us. so my husband and i were very excited to finally get the chance to go. \n\nwhen you come up to the elevators the reservationists asks your name, points you to an elevator, you get out of the elevator with no clue as to where to go. you walk accross the lounge looking for anyone to help you. when you get to the restaurant they look at you and ask you for your name again, now why would you not communicate that from downstairs? we were able to find the restaurant quickly, but had it been busy inside i would have no idea where to go. \n\nthe interior design of the restaurant and bathrooms is simply stunning and i was so excited for the meal to begin. we were brought the bread which had peanut butter and butter as a spread, cool idea, but not well executed. the peanut butter had just come out of the refridgerater as well as the butter and was not spreadable. i tried, but it just ripped the bread in half. \n\nthe sommelier came over asked if we needed wine suggestions and i had told him that i was looking at a riesling, by the glass and wanted to know if it was sweet or dry. he said sweet and recommended something a little drier... so i picked the wine he suggested and out came a sickly sweet riesling. weird to have a riesling this sweet by the glass, it reminded me of ethos late harvest as a dessert wine. i suffered through it and never ended up finishing it. \n\nthe food was underseasoned and the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> for my first course was way to sweet.. foie is so delicate, why would you over power it with so much sugary jam? my fish was overcooked and nothing wowed me. i was so disappointed in the food as this is ducasse's place and how could i forget when our waiter was mentioning that it was \"sir ducasse's\" restaurant every five minutes. i get that you are proud, but you're just hurting his culinary reputation by touting it repeatidly. \n\nservice was good, although i had an entire mushroom side vessel spilled on the table and dripping into my lap. i'm sure the manager saw this as he was staring at our table all night, but never came over to appologize. \n\nnot a true representation of michelin stars... i'm not sure why they even came to vegas because compared to europe the restaurants here are not deserving of michelin. \n\nthe one positive note is the view-- so come up for a drink instead of eating and the dessert babarum was amazing!",

            "this review is for the restaurant. \nmy husband and i came here for our 5 year anniversary dinner tonight. i did my research and thought this would be a good place to go. the food was wonderful. we had, for starters, the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> (half order), <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> (half order), and <mark>Maine Lobster Salad</mark>. for our entrees we had the <mark>Braised Wagyu</mark> and <mark>Cod Brandade</mark>. both were very tasty. for my dessert i had the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> w/ caramel ice cream. \nmy gripes with this restaurant was that we were seated on a round table between two square tables. it was awkwardly situated and did not make for a very comfortable meal. at least we were seated by a window with a pretty nice view. my next gripe is with the waiter (big caucasian blond guy) who talked and laughed with the tables next to us and made no effort with the two of us. i wonder if it's because we didn't order a bottle of wine. i forgot my zantac, so i didn't think drinking wine would be wise. my husband ordered a mojito and he totally forgot about it prompting us to have to remind him and when he wanted a second drink, we had to ask the busboy (sorry, i don't know what to call him). by the way, the busboy and the buslady were nice and friendly. my husband wanted to give the waiter a bad tip, but i convinced him against it because i wanted the other helpful staff to get what they deserved. we tipped the usual 18% even though the waiter clearly didn't deserve it. with the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and wagyu we weren't sure what we were supposed to eat it with. a good waiter would have made suggestions for sides to improve the enjoyment of our meal. \nso the verdict: the food was great, but the experience was lacking considering the amount of money we spent, $200+.\ni've been to many amazing restaurants, including french laundry, jar, lucques, osteria mozza, etc... this was by far the worst experience i've ever had at a fine dining establishment.",

            "i was invited here by some colleagues during a work retreat and treated to an extravagant place with over-the-top prices on food. there were many areas to mix that ran the gamut of styles. first of all, the entrance to mix was just a hallway to an outdoor elevator that shot up to the top of the hotel; by the way, it was hot! \n\nonce we got in, there was the lounge and bar area which were club-like and very loud. vegas, yes yes. we apparently were in the back past the kitchen so we moved from that very dark, very loud setting to a white bubbly restaurant area. talk about modernized fancy schmancy - even our bread came with square pats of creamy butter and sweet peanut butter. by the way, the pimento bread was very excellent and good on its own without any spread. \n\nso after trying to get a little comfortable in this unfamiliar setting of a swanky restaurant (and staring at the price tags on the food), i decided that since i was already in the situation, i ought to take full advantage of it. i mean, when else am i going to place myself there with a high-priced menu? therefore, what else to order but one of the chef's signature dishes, the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> rossini? it came with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and sliced black truffles. oh and i believe there was also a side of mashed potatoes for me too. when they came out, they honestly weren't presented in a way that made my mouth water (actually, the waiter set the plate down in front of me incorrectly with the insignia not turned properly). however, the tenderness of the steak certainly played its part in charming me. was the best i've had though? no but the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> really helped pull the flavors together. let's not forget the truffle! the mashed potatoes were also both fluffy and still chunky enough to please my palate. now, was the whole entree worth $69? i'd say not. was it delicious and juicy? yes it sure was.\n\ni couldn't resist getting dessert with such wonderful descriptions listed on the menu (turn a blind eye to the price tag, minerva!). i ended up with a hazelnut souffle paired with grapefruit sorbet. uh, who pairs the two together? i was hoping that i'd get them in some kind of complex mix but alas, they were presented separately on one plate. the hazelnut souffle had too much sugar in some parts so that it was unnecessarily cavity-inducing crunchy. i really enjoyed the sorbet but felt that it was odd to include the bits of sugar in the bowl. the candied grapefruit peel was delicious but again, too sweet. i'm glad i had the experience here but once again was proven correct in my thought that the cost and high profile appearance of a place does not say anything about the food. it's all about the diner, and this diner was only somewhat satisfied that night.", 
            "this is a review for the restaurant, which i just walked out of 15 minutes ago. :)  my party and i chose to go for their better tasting menu which included four courses plus an amuse bouche and pre-dessert dish.  here's the breakdown:\n\n1. amuse bouche: thai coconut chicken soup aka tom ka gai.  a nice touch, but i've had better tom ka gai at my local thai restaurant.  too much lemongrass, and not enough sweetness.  not bad, but not great.\n\n2. first course: gnocchi with asparagus and morels in a cream sauce.  i personally liked this dish, i felt that the delicate flavors were well balanced and a perfect introduction for what was to come.  my sister felt that this dish was a little on the bland side, but then again, she has a cold, so i'm not sure if her taste buds are fully functioning, lol.\n\n3. second course: roasted maine lobster \"au curry\" with coconut basmati rice.  i was a little apprehensive when i saw \"curry\" and \"lobster\" in the same sentence, but this was actually a very unique and pleasant twist on how i normally experience lobster.  when dining at gary danko in san francisco, my go-to dish is the butter-poached maine lobster with risotto, and here we have a similar dish with an indian touch...delicious!\n\n4. third course: <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> rossini with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and black truffle.  i do love my tournedos rossini and mix does it beautifully here.  my velvety filet practically melted in my mouth and the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> was richer than butter.  the chef was also very generous with the black truffle slices.  definitely the star of tonight's meal!\n\n5. pre-dessert: mango puree with coconut foam.  this light and airy precursor to dessert looked like a fancy cocktail served in a martini glass.  exotic, fruity, and a refreshing palate cleanser after such a rich main dish!\n\n6. fourth course/dessert: <mark>Baba a L'armagnac</mark> (monte carlo style).  this was an irish sponge cake drizzled with armagnac and served alongside an airy vanilla bean whipped cream.  decadent without being over-the-top, but i was still so stuffed that i could only finish half...what a waste!  still, being a chocolate lover, i would have chosen a mousse or lava cake a la mode over this any day.  sorry mix!\n\ni also had two glasses of the sparkling rose and an irish coffee to accompany my meal.  the rose was nice, but the irish coffee had such a kick that i could only finish half for fear of being unable to walk out of the restaurant!\n\nthe location, view, and decor was amazing!  i'm sure you've all seen photos of the \"floating\" glass bubbles that adorn the center of the restaurant.  the floor is also made to emulate a lace pattern.  service was friendly, but unfortunately on the slow side.  it took them over 2.5 hours to serve us four courses.  also, i felt like the price was a little on the high side for only four courses...i've eaten at comparable restaurants here in vegas and in sf which cost about the same for 6-9 courses.  nonetheless, i would still consider this a very good experience and is worth trying once.  but if you're going to do it, do it all the way and go with the higher tasting menu for the best the chef has to offer!", 
            "i had a great time at mix. i originally reserved for 2 people at 9pm. my horrible airport experience forced me to be 10-15 minutes late and not be able to change into a nicer outfit. they were very nice about the tardiness, assuming how the restaurant hours was until 10pm, and usually these dinners take long. my date and i were not rushed or anything during our dinner.\n\nthis place is beautiful! the bubbly decor coming from the ceiling made me think that i was dining under the sea. yet i'm at the very top of thehotel at mandalay bay. our booth was facing the backside of the strip, so the scenery was more mellow and calming than the glamorous strip, my dinner felt extremely relaxing although i was rushing there and freaking out at the airport.\n\nwe both ordered the tasting menu, which had a spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, halibut, <mark><mark>Colorado Lamb Loin</mark></mark>, and the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark>. i believe the entire table has to choose one of the tasting menus if any wanted to try it. my date didn't want to in the beginning since he wasn't into <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> or lamb. our server offered to switch out the lamb for the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> for $10 extra. \n\nwe started off the meal with a scallop ceviche. i enjoyed it a lot, it's very light, and the lime juice wasn't too overwhelming like most of the places that served ceviche. it was just right. it's interesting how they have some shredded raw mango on top, felt like some type of fusion going on here. \n\ni was enthralled by the looks of the spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>. very detailed with different layers of ingredients stacked up, but i had too high of expectations on the flavors. i don't recall it being spicy or crabby enough. for spiciness, i might be immune so my taste buds are less sensitive to spiciness. i was a bit disappointed there.\n\nsecond course came about with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> with lemon confit & dates. i liked how mine was seared just right, where it's more rare inside. i love the aftertaste and the aroma from each bite. unfortunately, i'm not too educated in <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, all i can tell you is if i liked it and met my expectations of it. i got to eat my date's piece too, since he's not too interested in something this rich in taste. his piece was a bit more cooked than mine, easier to slice, i just prefer a softer texture.\n\nthird course was the best one yet, halibut prepared in chicken jus and vegetable blanquette. every. bite. was. amazing. my general perception of halibut is that it's very bland and tasteless. this dish had such interesting flavors in many different layers. the flavors in every bite were going under transformation inside my mouth. i seriously don't want to finish this dish because i don't want the experience to end. \n\nfourth course was my <mark><mark>Colorado Lamb Loin</mark></mark>, with stuffed piquillo peppers and prommes anna. portions were generous, or maybe i was just very full. the spices on the <mark><mark>Colorado Lamb Loin</mark></mark> didn't take away the flavors of the lamb at all. i didn't like the meat inside the piquillo peppers though, it was a bit too tough. otherwise, the whole pepper was fun to eat; it's not the textures that were interesting but flavors of the pepper and the meat were well blended. the prommes anna was very crispy in the outside, you can feel the flakey texture with your tongue too. unfortunately i was hitting my maximum capacity.\n\nthat's when they brought out our pre-dessert. it was a sweet drink with mango puree tasted sweet and sour, topped with some coconut rum foam. it reminded me of thailand, maybe because of the tropical taste. the tart taste ease up the digestion, which was just what i needed!\n\nand finally, the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> of mix served with coconut/lime sorbet. the looks of it wasn't too spectacular, just a bar with a piece of gold flake and two half nuts on top. yes gold flake isn't too spectacular. i liked the simplicity of it though. it tasted like a ferrero rocher in a bar form served with the sorbet on the side. the combination is great. the sweetness of the chocolate is evened out with a light citrus.\n\nour dinner ended at 11:30-11:45. it would have been a nightmare if they didn't tolerate that 10 minutes of tardiness. in addition, our server offered us to their lounge with no covers. it was a great offer monetary-wise, but we were just in such a rush before that we were nowhere close in dressed properly for lounges. maybe next time :)", 
            "i have been to this restaurant 5-6 times and i always enjoy it. my friends from japan loved it so much too. their <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> is wonderful!! their signature dish, lobster curry, is crazy good. i never really care for lobster but this is different. i wish i could make it at home!! i always have issue with their portion...(in a good way). their portion is pretty decent that i always feel too full after a full course menu!! sometimes i can't even eat dessert because i'm too full!! i like the ambiance. i would not \"expect\" a window seating as window seatings are limited (does not matter how early you make your reservation.) the view is available from the bar anyway.\n\nalso, their deserts, especially the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark>.... is amazing!\n\nas far as service goes, i have never had issue personally.i believe it's worth a visit and great place for a great meal!", 
            "i've had a lot of spectacular meals, but the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> topped with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> topped with black truffles was honestly one of the best things i've ever tasted in my life. then put that on top of an amazing location at the top of the hotel looking over the whole vegas strip makes it amazing!", 
            "-saturday night, (8/25/12), right before the dinner rush.\n\ni had never heard of mix restaurant until a week before i was invited to go there for dinner.  mix is more known in vegas as a bar/lounge with great views of the strip and is located at the top of the thehotel, a part of the mandalay bay resort.  you can get up to the lounge by two elevators.  one is a great all glass elevator on the outside of the hotel that provides fantastic views of the strip and the valley beyond as the elevator whisks you to the top of the hotel.  the other is an inside elevator for those afraid of heights.   this outside elevator opens up into the very large bar area.  the bar also offers a balcony where you can sit outside and enjoy sweeping views while you drink and socialize.  you can walk through the bar into the adjoining restaurant.  the restaurant is a circular room done in white and chrome colors with contrasting bright red glassware and windows almost all the way around.  there are strings of clear glass balls hanging down from the ceiling that help to separate the space from the bar.  i suppose it is meant to look sophisticated but it instead it just looks dated, like a set from an old austin powers movie.\n\nwe started off with an appetizer of the chicken and coconut thai soup ($16) and a half order of <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> ($17/full order is $32).  the soup had similar ingredients to the traditional thai tom ka however it was watered down and bland.  it tasted as if an amateur chef was trying to replicate a thai dish and failed.  the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, on the other hand, was luscious and fatty with just a smattering of lemon confit on the top to balance the tastes.  \n\nfor dinner, we had the john dory \"meuniere\" ($38) and the slightly glazed \"ne3\" pork belly with spicy \"mangavocao\" salad ($34).  the fish was slightly overcooked and somewhat dry but served with enough fennel and tomatoes to cover the mistake.  the pork, on the other hand, was cooked well but very, very salty.  the mango and avocado salad tasted fine and was artfully presented in a small lettuce leaf, but did not go well with the salty pork meat.  i like fusion cuisine but this tasted more like throwing flavors together simply for the sake of it, rather than for the taste.  perhaps they should stop trying to think up cute phrases to put in quotation marks on their menu, and concentrate more on cooking well.  we would not order either of these dishes again.\n\nfor dessert, we both had the home made ice-cream and sorbet.  you can create your own plate by picking any combination of four ice creams flavors, sorbets or toppings from an extended list of choices ($9).  i had the pistachio and almond ice creams with maraschino cherries and brownie bites toppings.  your \"creation\" is served simply as two small (and i mean small) ice-cream scoops on a plate with two little cups on the side filled with your choice of toppings.  while the ice cream tasted fine, the maraschino cherries were straight out of a jar from the supermarket and the brownie crumbles were a tad stale.  you could get something tastier and cheaper at your local frozen yogurt store.  this is from a michelin star chef?\n\nthe service was good and the waiter was attentive but there were several times when we had to ask for water.  to quote the waiter's own words, \"it is a bad idea for a restaurant to use red glassware; you can never tell when the glasses are empty\".  if only the restaurant management would note the same point.  overall, the food was just ok.  but you expect more from a michelin star chef.  perhaps the executive chef is not replicating chef ducasse's dishes correctly, perhaps the restaurant is just a second thought to the bar or perhaps they are just hoping that you are so tipsy from the bar that you don't notice the imperfections in the food.  in any event, i would definitely recommend bringing your guests to the lounge to enjoy the view and drinks, but then bring them elsewhere to eat.", 
            "i selected the chef's tasting menu along with the wine pairing. i was not impressed with the restaurant at all. i can not believe alain ducasse put his name on this restaurant. \n\nthe bread basket that came out(yawn) and the cold butter (peanut butter-butter and unsalted) that crumbled on my bread when i tried smearing it, really? i do not know where to start from the boring curry lobster on coconut bastmati rice to the highly alcoholic baba armagnac for dessert. the one thing that was tasty was the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> on top of the beef fillet, along with the rioja(really good) was the only thing i enjoyed. i really wished i had gone with the some thing from a-la carte menu. \n\nfor the price of the tasting menu with wine pairing you should go to sage in the aria hotel, talk about a spectacular meal. \n\nwell, i hope you find my review helpful.", 
            "***mix provides a great view of the strip and the service is very nice, but the food is below average when compared to fine dining spots outside of las vegas***\n\nmix is the second alain ducasse restaurant i've tried.  the other one was in tokyo and it was decent but not special.  occasionally, the food at mix felt pretty good, but often the food felt a little below average.  the food tastes slightly better than nearby aureole (and the service is better too), but mix just does not feel like a great fine dining spot.\n\nthe alain ducasse name is definitely a draw for mix, but the atmosphere is too.  mix sits on the 64th floor of the mandalay bay and you get a good view of the strip (best at night) from most tables; there are some obstructed views.  the dining room is nice--mostly an all white room with white tablecloth; there are splashes of red here and there.  the lounge area is different; it utilizes darker and more typical lounge colors.\n\nmix offers several menu options.  there is an a la carte menu, which features starters and entrees including several prime steaks.  there is also a seasonal mix tasting menu as well as a tasting menu comprised of alain ducasse signature dishes.  i decided to opt for the alain ducasse tasting menu.\n\n(sweet corn soup amuse) the sweet corn flavor was good and it was creamy, but it was way too hot--almost like they zapped it in the microwave.\n\n(assorted bread with butter and peanut butter) the breadbasket was a decent variety of options, but it was just okay.  the addition of peanut butter was interesting, but the actual peanut butter itself was not that great.\n\n(<mark>Tender Potato Gnocchi</mark>, asparagus, mushrooms, aged cheese) the gnocchi was okay; it was a little doughy and i prefer gnocchi with a seared outside.  the asparagus was good.  the mushrooms were just okay, but i really liked the aged cheese, which was sharp and hard but still surprisingly creamy and not dry (there should have been more of it on the plate).\n\n(<mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, date puree, lemon confit) i added this as an a la carte item to the tasting menu and the date puree was a good sweet compliment to the more salty <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>.  the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> was not that good though.  it was a little stringy and it was not that smooth or creamy.\n\n(roasted maine lobster au curry, coconut basmati rice) the lobster was tender, but it just lacked the softness and moistness you get at really great fine dining restaurants. the coconut basmati rice was nice and creamy and the curry sauce was fragrant, but the flavors did not really develop.  it just became a decent curry dish and nothing else.  and because it was such a big portion, it became kind of a task to eat (instead of a really great dish where you can't put your fork down).\n\n(<mark>Filet Mignon</mark> rossini, <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, black truffle) this was the main course and it was quite rich and heavy.  the filet was decent.  it was cooked okay and was juicy and tender enough, but i did not think the quality of the meat was great.  the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> was similar to the a la carte <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> where it just did not have that velvety smoothness you get with great <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> (the texture kind of reminded me of when you don't do creme brulee right and it becomes like scrambled egg).\n\nthe black truffle was not that great either.  it was probably australian truffle and not the peak season for it.  this truffle part might be better in the winter.\n\n(mango puree) the first dessert was a palate cleanser and it was not that great.  it was mango puree and a soda foam.  it was just tart and fizzy and not that refreshing.\n\n(baba a 'larmagnac, brioche, blueberry compote, cream) this was a kind of make-your-own dessert because they serve it in parts.  the sponge cake-like brioche sits atop a good blueberry compote and there is very strong brandy on the side for pouring and a very good cream for applying, dipping and such.  as individual parts, this dessert was decent, but i did not really love it as a whole.\n\n(madeleines with chocolate dipping sauce).  i liked that the madeleines were freshly baked, but they were too big.  i wish they had more of a defined edge/crust.  the chocolate dipping sauce did not have a great flavor and was too thick.\n\ndespite a lot of the food being mediocre, the service was very good.  the staff was pleasant and attentive and the food came out at a good pace.\n\nprices were high, but you do get a very generous amount of food with the tasting menu.  and because a lot of the food is rich and heavy, you definitely will not leave hungry.\n\ni thought the service at mix was very good, but the food was about the same quality as mandalay bay's other lackluster fine dining spot aureole.  there is a lot mediocre fine dining in las vegas and, unfortunately, alain ducasse's mix falls in that bunch.  if you are looking for better and more contemporary french dining, you should check out l'atelier de joel robuchon in the mgm grand instead.\n\nthe mandalay bay offers both complimentary valet and self parking.",

            "mix is a gorgeous restaurant, and if you're lucky enough to sit outside the view is amazing. the food is pretty good, but you're paying more for the overall experience and ambiance. \n\ni thought the ahi tartare was just okay. i would have preferred ahi and avocado instead of the cucumber with curry flavoring. \n\nthe lobster curry was good but not amazing. the pieces of lobster were large, but the curry sauce and the rice were not too impressive.  personally, i don't think the two go together.\n\nthe filet with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and black truffle was yummy! too bad my first steak was way overcooked.  they were nice enough to take it back and prepare another one for me, and they even gave me a new side of potatoes which i thought was a nice gesture.  the 2nd one was cooked perfectly, but i felt like half the piece was really good and tender and the other half had a lot of gristle and was a little tough to eat. guess i had bad luck with the piece i got. =\\\n\nthe sorbet was a nice way to end the meal.  overall, mix is still one of my favorite restaurants in vegas. the service was good and the decor and view are very impressive.", 
            "amazing view! that is all i have to say! \n\nthis restaurant is located at the very top of 'the hotel'. they have such a spectacular view of the strip!...\n\nhonestly speaking though, that's about it!....i came here for valentines day with my husband and sat right by the windows facing the strip. everything besides the view was ok. the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and steak were delicious but what killed our experience was the glass door! it kept opening on it's own from the wind or the waiters opening them up. we probably exchanged eye rolls and looks with everyone on that side of the restaurant that night! what a mood killer! when the wind blew the tablecloths would fly up and our food would get colder and colder. they clearly know this is a problem because everyone acted so casual when they saw all the patrons getting annoyed. i couldn't enjoy my dinner because it got cold so quickly and every few minutes the door flew open so you had to 'hold it down'. there were no apologies nor did anyone stand near the door to hold it shut...major flaw. i highly recommend sitting on the other side of the restaurant or simply just visiting the bar for the view.", 
            "excellent food and service. i went here with my bf on a saturday evening a  couple summers ago. i immediately loved the decor as soon as we walked into the restaurant. we were seated on the patio, which has a gorgeous view of the vegas strip from the 64th floor. it was very romantic. the dish that stood out the most to me was their <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>. i would have to say that was some of the best <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> i've ever had. \n\nas we were finishing our appetizers, i noticed the chef come out and shake hands with a man from the table next to us. so i turned around to see who this special guest was. little did i know, gordan ramsey was dining right next to us with his wife! that was kind of cool. :) they seemed like they were having a pleasant evening. and gordan seemed to enjoy the food, which says enough right there!",

            "perhaps having eaten at a lot of highly acclaimed restaurants my expectation were too high, but a michelin star should be better.\n\nthe <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> with chicken was good, but too much chicken.  the <mark>Filet Mingnon Rossini</mark> lacked sauce and was overcooked and a bit dry,  the lamb was so over flavored on the crust that only the center was tasty.  excellent buttery potatoes and creamed spinach, the asparagus was good, but tasted mostly like butter..\n\nthe desserts were the most disappointing - the profiteroles were fair and the chocolate souffl\\u00e9 dry, lacking in chocolate flavor and inedible (left almost completely uneaten, complained about and still charged).  the madeleines were cute, but too dry and cakey, lacking the buttery-lemon flavor of true madeleine fame (my wife's are much better).\n\nservice was about the same as the food.  the sommelier was competent and the turley zinfandel excellent, although our waitress managed to spill some while pouring due to her seeming indifference.  we had an early dinner and the room was empty most of the time with too many servers per patron. at times they were overly anxious, at times good and at times intrusive - certainly not first rate.  you shouldn't clear one diner and not the table, but that wasn't the way things worked here.\n\nit seemed like a new venture that hand't yet worked out the kinks, but hearing they'd been open for several years they have no excuses.\n\nlovely space, good view, have a drink, but forget the food, until they get serious about being a real first rate restaurant.  when a big name chef adds his name to a restaurant, i'd expect his continued involvement or at least a higher level of quality control.  his name now just means high prices.  he should learn from thomas keller and the french laundry.\n\nreturned for hosted cocktails during the following week and the waitress smashed into my wife's arm leaving a very nasty black and blue mark.  maybe she'd read my earlier review?", 
            "mix is an absolute beautiful restaurant and bar! located on the 64th floor of the hotel (mandalay bay), mix offers amazing views of the strip and beyond. the theme of the restaurant is quite simple yet classy. the restaurant is divided into two different areas. one side is black. like everything from the walls to the furniture is black. the bar area is red and the kitchen and a private dining table is located in the middle. on the other side it's completely different. everything from the walls to the furniture is white. it's so classy and elegant and also offers spectacular views of the las vegas strip. \n\nthe menu at mix is a very upscale dining menu. they offer quality foods such as caviar, <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, lobster and <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>. i came here for a couple different events so i didn't get the chance to try things off of the menu. \n\n==service==\nthe service here at mix was great. the host was pretty cute and all of the cocktail waitresses were very friendly. they had plenty of servers coming around and delivering hors d'oeuvres. \n\n==food==\nthey had different hors d'oeuvres such as chicken satay, sliders, shrimps, beef skewers, caprese skewers and more. the entrees were <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> with scalloped potatoes, pasta bolognese, mushroom risotto and chicken with saut\\u00e9ed vegetables. out of everything i really enjoyed the sliders, mushroom risotto and the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>. \n\neven though the two events that i attended were free and the food was pre-set, i still looked over the menu and its on the pricier side. although the price is a little high, it's definitely worth it in my opinion since the quality of food and the view are both spectacular. i'm definitely planning on stopping by mix on my next visit to vegas.\n\n**you must stop by the restrooms here! both have amazing views as you are taking care of business. it's not the nicest bathrooms, but the view is definitely worth checking out!", 
            "mix was amazing. the food is mouthwatering and the service was impeccable. the view at the top of mandalay bay was gorgeous. we have never have tastes such tender lamb and both types of beef were nice and tender with the perfect amount. it was nice that they had a bar area with a large outside balcony where you can probably rent out and have a private party there. the main dining was was beautiful. it is the perfect place for a special date or even a small dinner party. it is probably not the place to host a large loud group of friends for a fancy dinner.\n\nwe ordered:\n-<mark>Filet Mignon</mark> rossini\n-<mark>Braised Wagyu</mark>\n-colorado rack of lamb (bone out)\n-<mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> (as appetiser)\n\nthe only con about mix is that it's kind of hard to find, at least it was for us.", 
            "mix was recommend to us by the concierge at the aria (who was great btw) as having the most beautiful view with the loveliest french cuisine in all of vegas, and it did not disappoint. everything was marvelous. for someone used to dining in fine restaurants, in the u.s. as well as in europe, i don't say this often or lightly. i very rarely write reviews.\n\nthe dishes were genuine and well executed. the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> au torchon was exactly as it is served in france. the best way to judge is by going somewhere else the next day, which we did, and honestly, you'll want to go back to mix. i especially liked the way the menu offered classic dishes as well as newer creations. mom was happy as well as my indie-film-loving brother. \n\nhowever, the real reason to go is for the service. i have read some of the previous reviews and see what's going on. but here's the deal. i hope it is useful:\n\ni respect that customers come in with all kinds of expectations on the level of service. we were 10, with a baby and a 4 year girl, celebrating a pre-wedding dinner with the bride and groom. i asked for the chef's table for privacy, but we were disappointed to find out that it was not available. nonetheless, the hostess assured me that we would be in a special area of the restaurant that would not bother anyone else and offered us a glass of champagne, as well, for the inconvenience. she was wonderful! and she was right.\n\ni was very skeptical about sitting in the main dining room because we did not want to spoil any one else evening. but the entire staff was so attentive to our every need that i must say, the entire evening went without a hitch. of note was a moment, early in the evening, when our 4-year-old spilled her grenadine water with its fancy straw and then had that tense frozen look that precedes the oncoming torrential scream. within seconds, our servers swooped down with a a napkin, cleaned up and replaced her place setting with a big smile letting her know that everything was okay. wow! it was nothing short of amazing. they treated her like a princess and she really felt like one. \n\nit's easy to provide good service when everything goes well. but the true note of distinctively great service is how swiftly and professionally the staff handles problems when something goes wrong. at mix, mr. ducasse has a top-notch, experienced staff of professionals -- something often lacking in today's restaurant scene. so, about the $10 sparkling water that you didn't order... it's important to brush up on 5-star restaurant etiquette, because you'll get a lot of that at this restaurant.\n\nthe whole evening was filled with extremely good service, timeliness and friendliness that matched the deliciousness of the cuisine and exceeded the expectations of each and every one of us. a memorable evening in every way.",

            "so my gf and i were in vegas for the new years and we were dying to try <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> (which is illegal in ca) and a lot of people recommended to us mix. luckily, we were staying in mandalay bay so we just walked up to mix and went up to the elevator which took us to the 64th floor.\n\nfirst off, the lounge at mix is amazing! since mandalay is at the end of the strip, you get a full view of the strip and you can really appreciate the lights of vegas. additionally, the chairs are comfy and the heat lamps will keep you cozy.\n\nas for the restaurant, the decor is all white and very chic. you start out by walking through the open kitchen which is really cool. we were able to get a table next to the window, which made no difference since our backs were to the windows.\n\nas for the food:\n\nassorted bread with sea salt butter and peanut butter- 5/5- hey it's free bread, anything at this restaurant that is free is a 5/5 for me. xd\n\nfoies gras <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>- 5/5- for $60, i was pretty disappointed when the plate came out and there was a tiny piece of meat. however, this baby must be made from dehydrated food because it expands quickly in your stomach! the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> pretty much melts in your mouth and the flavor is really strong and decadent. i definitely, recommend this dish at mix.\n\nmash potatoes- 3/5- pretty plain. kind of tastes like instant mash potatoes to me...\n\n<mark>Creamy Spinach</mark>- 3/5- nothing out of the ordinary here.\n\nwagyu beef- 4/5- this baby just melts in your mouth. however, it's a little bit salty for my taste. luckily, the potatoes and carrots offset some of the saltiness.\n\noverall, the food is overpriced; however, the dishes are very flavorful here and the decor and view is top notch. if you're tired of the buffet scene, this is definitely, a worthy try.",

            "recommended by a friend to come here, i paid them a visit on my most recent vegas trip. have your cab driver drop you off at thehotel since the elevators to go up to the 64th floor where the restaurant is located is right when you walk in!\n\nthe minute that i stepped out of the elevator and approached the restaurant, i was taken back by the all white decorations. i love it! absolutely sleek and chic. we were seated by the window. it's kinda weird how they have it so that your backs are to the windows but no big complaints there. it was nice to enjoy our meal and when we occasionally turn around, we were able to take in the view.\n\nthey started us off with a bread basket that includes 2 kinds of butter: sea salt & peanut. now, i'm normally not a peanut butter fan but this was so good! it was creamy with a hint of sweetness. i would've been happy just eating bread with the peanut butter but wait! it doesn't stop here, it gets better!\n\ni ordered the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> rossini w/ <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and my date ordered the rib-eye with asparagus as a side. although i enjoyed the rib-eye, i believe the dish worth raving about is the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>! it came with mashed potatoes. the filet was tender and juicy at the same time. the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> just melts in your mouth and was so tasty! i couldn't get enough. prior to ordering we had ask the waitress for recommendations on red wine. she recommended the syrah which went extremely well with our steaks.\n\nour waitress was extremely soft spoken it was sometimes hard to hear her. i also felt the service was not as attentive as it could've been. the bus boy seems to be around our table more and was extremely friendly. i noticed he was conversing with other guests at other tables too. when he learned that we were on the trip for my birthday celebration, he got me a complimentary dessert which consisted of  sweet breads and nutella spread. so sweet of him! aside from that, we also ordered the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> which has coconut and lime sorbet. totally worth it!!! the chocolate was sweet while the coconut filled made it a little crunchy. perfect combination.\n\nafter our dinner experience we went to the lounge and wanted to step outside to snap some photos. since mandalay bay is all the way at the end of the strip, you are able to see the view of the whole strip from the lounge area. we were stopped and told that only those with bottle service could be outside. what? lame... \n\noverall, mix has given me such a good experience that i will be back next time and will tell my friends to give it a try!", 
            "my latest visit to mix was quite the disappointment.  i had dined there once before over a year ago and recalled a much better dining experience.  if you are here for the food, you have made a mistake.  there are so many places in lv to go for an amazing gastronomic experience, that mix doesn't even begin to contemplate playing in that ballpark (though they may be fronting like they do by serving hoity-toity dishes like <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> with chicken terrine.) however, it's more than just what you're serving, it really comes down to how it tastes.  our party of four tried several different options and none commanded anything but average reviews, and some were even worse than that.  my ribeye, which our waiter assured was \"excellent,\" was not.  it would have been excellent if i ordered it at denny's or sizzler with some eggs, but it wasn't excellent at some ritzy lv restaurant.  i didn't even care to finish it.  and i always care to finish a good cut of meat.  it tasted like a supermarket bought steak, prepared clumsily at home.  that's how good it was.  the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> was horrible, neither it's taste, appearance or texture were appetizing.  my husband ordered scallops.  again, okay if they were from a buffet.  they were out of the cod entr\\u00e9e, which is what i remembered enjoying on my previous visit.  our meal was so un-spectacular that i can barely recall the other appetizers we ordered or the dessert.  our server was a tad curt and unavailable and not forthcoming with recommendations or suggestions.  in all, we regret having wasted our one night out in lv at mix. the view is nice, but not nearly enough to redeem the poor quality and taste of dinner.  we were so hungry after the michael jackson cirque show downstairs that we ignored our better judgment that was telling us to eat at sw instead.  sorry mix, we won't be coming back.", 
            "the view here was amazingggg. located on top of the hotel by mandalay bay, you can see all the lights from below. make sure you take a trip to the bathroom. on the way walking there, they have a patio where you can walk out and see the huge sign that sparkles and says \"thehotel\" it's quite an amazing view with so many lights. the bathroom has a gold tinted window. great place to take bathroom pictures for girls. \n\nfood wise, the food was delicious and the staff were friendly. must try the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> steak item on their menu.", 
            "i'll preface this review by disclosing that my wife and i had both our wedding ceremony and reception at mix.  on one hand, that may make me biased a bit in my love for this restaurant, but on the other hand, that also made me far more critical of the food, staff and service since we paid them the price of a small car to do an exclusive buy out on a saturday evening in vegas for a seven hour event.  \n\nso, that being said, here goes; saving food for last!  edit: looks like i have to trim my review, i hit the 5000 character limit. :-(\n\n1) ambience - if you like old fashioned or traditional decor in your dining venues, you will probably hate mix.  there is not a wood panel anywhere to be found, nor any green or blue carpeting.  the interior is many modern features with the centerpiece being the thousands of blown glass bulbs hanging from the ceiling around the two level dining area; the idea being to make it look like champagne bubbles rising.\n\nthe main seating area enjoys two story tall open windows with both views of the mountains and views of the strip.  if you're sitting inside, sunset is a perfect time to go because it looks simply incredible.  if you're sitting outside on their balcony, you'll only have a strip view because of where the balcony is located, but the view is still excellent at all times of day since you're 64 stories up looking north up the strip.  i recommend after dark for balcony seating.\n\n2) service - i've never had a bad experience at mix.  my wife and i visited vegas several times in advance of our wedding and dined at mix each time just to reassure ourselves that we had made the right decision.  we did not let them know in advance that we were coming to ensure we got to experience service as it normally is.  drinks are always full, they'll pick your napkin up and re-fold it if you get up to go to the bathroom, they check on your needs frequently, everyone is very congenial and outgoing.\n\nwe've been back numerous times since our wedding and yes, now we probably get extra service as many of the staff are still there and recognize us (it was a pretty memorable wedding), but they're really great folks.  i'm sure over the years as staff come and go we'll be a distant memory and service will go back to 'normal' but for the three years we've been back so far they've really made it special.\n\n3) special requests.  they've been very accommodating to us both for our wedding/reception and since then.  for example, on our first anniversary when we went back, i arranged with a cake bakery to make a small version of our wedding cake and deliver it to mix to surprise my wife after dinner.  the restaurant ensured someone was available to receive the cake that day and then they cut and served it for us.  if you're having a special occasion, talk to the staff and see if there's anything special you would want.\n\n4) food!  okay, the view sold me on this place to begin with, and fortunately, the food lived up to, and exceeded, expectations.  here's what we've had and when:\n\na) the <mark>Pepper Crusted Bison Tenderloin</mark>, <mark>Cod Brandade</mark> and roasted free range chicken (not always a menu option) were our wedding choices for guests.  the bison was awesome; many steak lovers who had never had bison remarked at how great the flavor was.  on the fish, we also had quite a few comments where significant others had shared their fish entree with someone who was not a fan of fish and they loved it, so that speaks for itself.\n\nb) surf & turf.  although it's not always on the menu, they'll do a filet and lobster if you ask.  my wife gets this religiously and loves it.  i will note that it is not as good as the surf & turf from n9ne at the palms.  there's regular surf & turf, then there's mix's surf & turf, then there's the n9ne surf & turf which is the best one in the universe.\n\nc) <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> rossini with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> & black truffle sauce.  if you're into truffles, i'm sure you'll love this.  the steak comes out perfectly.  i'm not a huge fan of the sauce so this is one of those love/hate meals for me.  perhaps ask to try the sauce before you order; not sure if that's possible.\n\nd) roasted maine lobster \"au curry\".  i love spicy, i love indian food, i love this meal.  it's my go-to mix meal; i get it every time once i tried it.  it's perfect combo of everything i love; lobster, spicy, curry, veggies, etc.\n\ndon't forget to go visit the mix lounge next door after dinner!  great place to relax and have a drink and cigar (on the balcony only of course).", 
            "perched atop the 64th floor of the majestic hotel at mandalay, mix boasts some of the best views of the south strip in vegas. once you set foot inside the lavish ivory themed dining room, you know you're in an alain ducasse restaurant. the space simply oozes the charm and elegance of his signature opulent style reminiscent of the dining room at the hotel plaza ath\\u00e9n\\u00e9e in paris.  the glitz and glamour of vegas is also quite apparent and you can't help but be dazzled by the contemporary and elegant atmosphere that envelops you.\n\nwith the beautiful weather i had been  experiencing over the weekend, i opted for patio seating with a direct view of the vegas strip below. \n\nafter glancing through the menu, i decided  to try chef ducasse's signature tasting menu with wine pairings.\n\nbreads came out soon after with a selection of focaccia, french baguette, dinner rolls and sourdough with unsalted and an interesting \"peanut\" butter. the breads were room temperature and butters were cold so spreading was not pleasant but the breads served their purpose of filling my gullet til the main courses arrived. \n\namuse\n\n<mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> royale with port reduction and mushroom foam \n\n- this enticing little number exhibited a pleasant airiness and irresistible aroma from the mushroom foam and the interesting mix of flavors and textures married well together lending a savory yet earthy element to this whimsically fascinating dish\n\ngnocci\nwith parmigiano reggiano, veal jus and sun chokes.\n\nnot the best gnocci i've ever had but satisfying nonetheless. this dish had an incredibly comforting feel to it. i especially enjoyed the contrasting textures from the light & crispy chips and tender enoki mushrooms served with the dish. warm, rustic yet subtle and familiar flavors were easy on my palate. \n\nmain lobster curry with coconut basmati rice \n\n- it's hard to go wrong with lobster, especially when you infuse thai flavors into a dish. the perfectly cooked lobster was bathed in a pool of curry and served stop luscious coconut rice. a delectable marriage of flavors.\n\n<mark>Filet Mignon</mark> rossini with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and black truffle sauce \n\n- this was easily my favorite dish of the night. the combination of <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and black truffle is like the holy trinity of fine dining.  the result will almost always result in endless drooling and licking the porcelain off your plate. \n\npredessert\n\ncoconut foam and mango rum cocktail. an exhilarating drink with bright notes and a sweet finish. excellent palate cleanser and a perfect way to prepare my taste buds for the sweet finale.\n\nbaba a la marnagnac\n\nunfortunately i wasn't as impressed with my dessert.\nthe liqueur for the cake was too strong and pungent while the flavors were just were too heavy handed. i may have myself to blame for that, as i may have given the cakes too heavy of a pour of the accompanying liqueur.\n\noverall, food was good but i must admit that i expected more from a multi michelin star chef like alain ducasse.  imo, the dishes lacked that wow factor that i was eagerly anticipating.  service was also on the clumsy and awkward side the night i dined, as well. for instance, my wine pairing for one of my dishes was completely forgotten until i reminded the sommelier. additionally, the wait staff seemed a bit hurried and rushed.  the furniture itself, which has probably seen better days, was in desperate need of an update, too. during my dinner one of my guests had to change their seat out because the chair was collapsing. for a restaurant of this caliber, i expected a bit more, at least chairs that weren't falling apart at the seams. \nwith that said, they changed the chair out without a hitch and there were some redeeming factors which included the stunning views, beautiful setting and expansive bar next door.  \n3.5 stars for now and hoping the restaurant makes some improvements on the menu, furniture, and service in the future.\n\nuntil then...\n\nhappy eats!", 
            "wow! this restaurant/lounge is amazing. it's located in \"the hotel\" tower at the mandalay bay and it's an amazing french restaurant/lounge. i had dinner there - steak and <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>. it was excellent...\n\ni'm gluten free but had a bite or two of their french banquette with salted butter - yumm! steak came with mashed potatoes drizzled with truffle oil. the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> was amazing. we can't order it here in california so it was my treat :)\n\ni had them make me raspberry martini and it was delicious too. the decor is spectacular and the views are breathtaking. \n\nthey have a lounge next to the restaurant which is cool to see if you just want drinks. \n\nmy <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> appetizer, steak with mushrooms, mashed potatoes and 1 martini was around $150. which is a bit expensive for one person. \n\nthey greeted me with a glass of champagne which was very nice. this is 5-star dinning all the way... you won't be disappointed.", 
            "touting itself as french cuisine with an american influence, this restaurant sits in an enviable location at the very tippy top of thehotel in las vegas.\n\nmy first trip to las vegas was due to an it expo going on, and we had been sent out armed with a list of places to try and restaurants to visit, with mix being a regularly recommended location.\n\nsome of our friends had decided to meet up with us for a few days during our vegas trip, and they were equally excited to eat at mix for the first time.\n\nfrom the discreet glass elevator that shoots up the outside of the hotel and offers a changing view of vegas, to the stunning d\\u00e9cor inside the varied bar and eating areas, to the panoramic view from the restaurant that comes alive as the sun goes down and the vegas lights come up, everything at mix is designed to be an experience that will leave you with a fantastic impression.\n\nthe staff are softly spoken and perform at the caliber you expect from an alain ducasse restaurant: quick on their feet, taking the time to discuss the menu without rushing any decisions, respectfully disappearing if more time is needed and knowledgeable about everything on offer and nicely versed on the wine list and suitable pairings.\n\nbetween everyone at our table we sampled the following:\n* complimentary bread basket sampler accompanied by perfectly spreadable butter studded with peanuts.\n* we ordered <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> with palm hearts, guacamole & cilantro, shrimp cocktail with horseradish and spring baby vegetable salad with an herby basil dressing as starters for the table to share.\n* 2x <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> rossini with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> & a black truffle sauce\n* 1x roasted maine lobster au curry with basmati rice\n* 1x <mark>Cod Brandade</mark> with lemon, capers, brown butter, croutons and fried parsley\n* we ordered fork crushed (the fancy way of saying expensively mashed) potatoes, <mark>Creamy Spinach</mark> and saut\\u00e9ed <mark>Sauteed Green Asparagus</mark> as sides to share.\n* complimentary madeleines (which were absolutely perfect) with a chocolate dipping sauce for everyone after dinner to bide us over while we decided on what to try for dessert.\n* 1x <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> with a textured coconut & lime sorbet\n* 1x chocolate cherry pudding with chocolate crisps & black cherries\n\nthe food was fantastic, but at mix prices i would expect it to do everything but dance on the table while singing a show tune.  \n\neverything was perfectly cooked, seasoned and flavoured: \n* the steaks were done exactly as requested, although the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> lacked the impact i was hoping for and tasted just like any other goose liver pate i've had (it was my first time trying it and i was a little underwhelmed)\n* the cod was glorious and the accompanying sauce was perfect\n* the lobster curry was phenomenal\n\nhowever, as someone with a raging, barely controlled sweet tooth the dessert options were a little limited but still of a superb quality nonetheless.\n\nthe wines suggested by our server were superb and all the cocktails we had at the bar afterwards were excellent.\n\non the way out i noticed what appeared to be the smallest dance floor in the world tucked away almost as an afterthought, however at a vegas altitude where every square metre of space comes at a premium i don't blame them for compromising their dance floor for extra dining space.\n\ni get the feeling that the staff were specifically chosen to bring a warm touch to what had the potential to be a very pretentious experience.  this is definitely a restaurant to try at least once, and i recommend that you try to time your visit around the sunset as this will give you a memorable view of vegas.", 
            "we had dinner here last night and went for the executive tasting menu by alan ducasse with paired wine. now this was a fine dining experience at this michelin starred restaurant and not cheap at $175 per person. \n\nthe restaurant boasts beautiful views being on the 50 something floor, even the ladies restroom had a floor to ceiling picture window in it, stunning. \n\nwe had an amuse bouche of broccoli pur\\u00e9e and sweet pickled vegetables followed by 4 courses. my husband had gnocchi with wild mushrooms and asparagus, maine lobster, fillet mignon with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> then rum armagnac then madeleines and dipping chocolate.\n\ni had a vegetarian alternative menu also starting with the gnocchi, followed by a warm vegetable salad then swede pickled veg and mushroom tapenade rum armagnac and madeleines. \n\nthat was all very delicious and we were totally spoilt with the food which us he'd our taste buds to the extreme with new flavours and combinations. not everything was to our tastes like my husband couldn't take the fois gras. \n\nthe one star was reduced more with the service. we were left waiting for a while at the front for a server to seat us and we got the menus but they were whisked away before we got to look at them when they realised that we had the executive tasting menu pre-booked, i asked for one back to read the full listings of each course to savour it more. they did talk through each course but so quickly that a couple of times i asked how that would be cooked etc. \n\nthe door to the balcony tables kept blowing open with the wind which sent our pristine starched white table cloth flapping and the servers running to close it many times! \n\nthe decor was white minimal with glass spheres suspended by wires that reminded me of jelly fish. \n\ni really enjoyed the experience and the food was first class.", 
            "this probably wouldn't have been a 5 star when we first sat down. as one obnoxious patron sat immediately behind us, loud, rude and nonstop yapping about how much money he spent. omg!! there were two other outdoor tables, we all agreed, to throw him off the 60th floor!  thanks to our wonderful server \"jonathan\" who saved us. got rid of mr. stupid...so everyone can enjoy the ridiculous gorgeous view of vegas. not a cloud in the sky, staring at the pyramid, etc...it was picture perfect with \"the hotel\" glistening in the back. the ride up and down the elevator was just as fun but if you are afraid of height, hold your breath! and i def do not recommend sitting outdoor.\n\nsome food porn:\n<mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> (yes, first thing on my mind the moment i landed in nv!)\n<mark>Charcuterie Sampler</mark> (everything you expect and love from cured flavors and pickle)\nslow baked halibut (huge portion and it's sooooo tender and sweet, buttery veggies)\nendless pour of pinot gri and s. blanc!!!\nhad two glasses of the yummiest, sweet mix flavor of coconut and strawberry mousse cocktails\nbiscuits dipped in hot melty chocolate!\n\ncan't wait to return....", 
            "funny thing is, we went to a burger place at mandalay first. but they didn't come to our table for 5 minutes to even say hello. and 5 minutes is longer than you think when you just spent 90 minutes at the mj one show and you're ready to eat off your hand with hunger. so we left. and came here. a bit different, to put it mildly. service was impeccable, but not snooty. the missus and i both got different tasting menus. mine was the alain ducasse 4 course one sans wine. from the cold broccoli soup amuse to the amazing lobster curry to the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> topped filet to the armagnac dessert, almost everything was very well presented and tasted amazing. first time with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>. would definitely have been beyond the pale if served solo, but topping the perfectly cooked medium rare filet balanced it's richness. all i know is the junk was tasty. the only misstep was the mashed potatoes that accompanied  the filet. they were served in a bowl separate from the plate, and surprisingly...basic.  \n\natmosphere was romantic, view was stunning, of course, and definitely an experience to remember. not cheap. but actually worth it.", 
            "my first visit to this restaurant--overall was very good.  the  views are excellent, i thought the service was wonderful--matt , the sommelier, was excellent.  started with the <mark>Maine Lobster Salad</mark>--wonderful presentation, had just the right amount of seasonings.  this was followed with the scallops--they were prepared well, how ever, the mushrooms that accompanied them seemed to me to be too earthy for this light seafood.  had the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> accompanied with a wonderful date and raisin compote--sweet and delicate.  tried the charcuterie plate, was surprised with the simple yet tasty samples of prosciutto and rosemary cotto ham . main course was the lamb--excellent preparation and presentation.  seasoned very well.  finished every thing off with the chocolate souffle--very light and flavorful.  overall had a wonderful time, atmosphere was very upscale and modern, as i said earlier, the views are great. definitely a good place to visit.",

            "see profile site for full review with formatted pics.\n\nfor myself, the focus was the food and the evening unfolded as follows:\n\n\"amuse bouche\" - eggplant caviar w/tuna picatta, crispy chip - a small blend of tender eggplant and spicy tuna plus a crispy round for dipping, this was a wonderful taste to begin the evening.  barely spicy with hints of tomato and basil, the texture was like a creamy tuna salad without the mayo.\n\ndish 1:  kampachi sashimi, green curry emulsion, seaweed salad - perfect kampachi with a fairly mild flavor, yet delectably enhanced by the green curry this dish was quite attractive and a good followup to the tuna.  as good as the fish was, however, the seaweed salad was incredible and my only complaint could possibly be that there wasn't ten times as much.  then again, had i known how much food was to come i'd have known better.\n\ndish 2:  <mark>Tender Potato Gnocchi</mark>, fresh morels & asparagus with veal juice and flaked parmesagna - knowing my feelings about gnocchi, this dish was a part of the reason i'd selected mix in the first place.  unlike thomas keller's buttery parisian version, ducasse opts here to utilize the italian formula of simple and tender potato dumplings with just a little salt and complements from the dense and woody flavor of perfectly tender morels and flawlessly crisp asparagus.  the veal juice and parmesagna added a salty and savory component to the dish.  while not the best gnocchi ever, the texture and flavor were sublime and i'd certainly re-order on return visits.\n\ndish 3:  macadamia/pistachio crusted halibut, asparagus cream, parmesan foam - the show stealer for my friend and a solid frontrunner for best-fish-dish-ever for myself, it is hard to describe the delicate nuisances of this dish without experiencing it.  perfectly poached fish with a crunchy yet sweet and nutty coating bisected a plate with asparagus and creamy asparagus cream on one side and a cheesy foam on the other side.  while each flavor was superb separately, the combination was even more stunning with the cream and foam drizzled over the fish.  a second dish featuring asparagus and parmesan, it is easy to see why ducasse serves these two dishes back to back frequently and i cannot recommend the combination enough.  in a weekend that featured tasting menu fish preparations by le cirque and alex as well, this may have been the best fish dish of all, and that is saying something.\n\ndish 4:  roasted maine lobster \"au curry\", coconut basmati rice, pineapple, raisin, and pearl onions - quite frankly i've no idea what ducasse was thinking when he prepared this dish the first time, but the thought it was certainly inspired by a muse or a god.  to be fair, the curry was understated so anyone ordering this for heat will be disappointed.....i didn't order for heat.  what i ordered it for was a fantastically prepared lobster served over sweet sticky rice and complimented by roasted onions and sweet fruits.  while not quite as mind-blowing as the lobster at alex (which may be my favorite dish of all time,) this is the second best lobster preparation i've ever experienced and it will haunt my dreams until i find a means to prepare it myself.\n\ndish 5:  <mark>Roasted Duck Breast</mark>, black mission fig, radish & baby turnips, fig sauce - my first substitution and absolutely worth the choice.  a well cooked yet juicy <mark>Roasted Duck Breast</mark>, skin on and perforated for complete cooking, the meat was not gamey at all and the earthy/meaty texture was wonderfully offset by the figs and fig sauce, yet given a crispy textural component by the radish and turnips.  while the \"worst\" of the dishes in my opinion, the competition was pretty stiff and that is no disrespect at all.   \n\npalate cleanser:  passionfruit and mango sorbet with coconut lime foam - served in a martini glass, i believe the phrase palate cleanser was invented for this dish.  i don't even like mango and this item impressed me.  \n\ndessert:  baba au rhum, monte carlo style with spiced rum and cr\\u00c8me anglais - while i'm not a drinker, i am a fan of rum cake and rank mastro's buttercake amongst my all time favorite desserts.  a small cake was served along with a pot of rum and a second pot of cr\\u00e8me which was then reconstructed by the waiter tableside, first pouring a little rum and then a dollop of cream with further customization allowed.  while not quite as good as mastros, the dish was a beautiful compliment to the meal and left a warm feeling in my belly for the rest of the night.\n\nmadelines :  to cap off the meal we were served four of ducasse's signature madelines straight from the piping hot pan along with warm nutella.  while i realize the tradition of the madeline has been carried on by both stratta and boulud, it is my understanding that ducasse was first and though i've not tried daniel's, ducasse's option blew alex's out of the water.  moist, creamy, delicate, and perfect with the nutella.", 
            "the decor here is amazing! loved the floor to ceiling light installment (not sure what else to call it) in the middle of the restaurant, the pod-like booths for 2, and the gorgeous view out of the windows from the 64th floor of thehotel. \n\nthe food didn't really measure up to the decor i thought.\n\nwe had:\nbluefin tartare with taro chips\n<mark>Maine Lobster Salad</mark> with lobster vinaigrette\n<mark>Tender Potato Gnocchi</mark> with pumpkin two ways and crispy pancetta\npork loin and belly with grits and swiss chard\nbeef tenderloin with potato macaire and bearnaise\ndiver scallops with brandade ravioli and clam chowder sauce\nchocolate souffle\n\nthey were all kind of unremarkable. i do remember the beef tenderloin being pretty tender. the chocolate souffle was good and the freshly baked madeleines at the end of the meal were a nice touch.\n\nafter dinner, we went next door to the lounge for some drinks.", 
            "as everyone has already mentioned... the view from the lounge area is breathtaking.  however, on the restuarant side, there are only a handful of tables that give you the strip view.\n\nnevertheless, the food was very good, albeit very pricey.\n\nwe shared the following:\n\n<mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> on guacamole with taro chips - this dish reminds me of the <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> at tasca in los angeles, though not quite as tasty.  the tuna was incredibly fresh (considering we're in the desert) but the guacamole slightly overpowered its flavor.  the taro chips were super thin and a great base for the tartare.\n\n<mark>Tender Potato Gnocchi</mark> with asparagus and morel mushrooms - i have never had such flavorful morel mushrooms in my life.  however, the gnocchi had a slightly grainy texture and the asparagus was cooked unevenly.  flavors were great, but i don't think i'd recommend this dish.\n\nbeef rossini - oh my freakin heart.... steroid-free, naturally raised prime <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> topped with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and black truffle reduction.  the dish, as you could imagine, was super rich and loaded with heavy flavors.  i enjoyed it to the last bite... however, it wasn't until we got the check that i found out it was a $77 item on the menu.  ouch.  but soooo good.\n\nfresh baked madeleine with chocolate-nutella sauce - best madeleines i've had in my life, served to us fresh off the baking tray.  i could eat 3 trays of this to myself.  the chocolate nutella blend was delicious, and i'm usually not a big nutella fan.\n\nwine - we had 5 glasses of wine.  they were divine!  their by-the-glass selection is very well thought out and i don't believe there is a single bad choice you could make.\n\noverall, i really enjoyed my meal.  the service was amazing.  every single person on their staff was attentive and friendly.  we never went a moment without somebody making sure we were enjoying our meal.  and i must also mention that the portions are huge (for this type of restaurant).  we split all three items we ordered, and the split portions were as large as most restaurants serve in full.\n\nif it weren't for the price ($250 for the above... remember, we split the dishes), i'd easily give this place 5 stars.  however, if you want a great view and a great meal on the strip and $$ is not an important factor, mix will not disappoint.", 
            "i had had enough of watching the creation of impressive high-end dishes on top chef with relentless envy.  never could i taste and enjoy.  my frustration led me to the need to be wined and dined at an amazing restaurant.  fellow yelpers led me here: to mix restaurant.\n\nmy bf and i headed over to mandalay bay and started with some confusion as to the location of the restaurant.  after some inquires and a long walk, we found it!  well we found mix lounge and walked through the dark area into the light.  i would describe this restaurant with its hanging clear globes and immaculately white decor as trendy.  on a busy friday night with a 9pm reservation, the dining room was a bit loud and full.  we weren't looking for romantic, just impressive.  along with the amazing vegas views, the room was breathtaking.\n\nfood\nwe were looking to be completely indulgent and opted for the grand tasting menu-more than six courses.  in addition, we went with the wine pairings as an extra!  we began with the amuse bouche: a ceviche with apple gelee.  nice way to start the meal.  the spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> was a refreshing follow-up, one of my favorite courses.  the <mark>Tender Potato Gnocchi</mark> sat atop a pumkin puree and was topped with applewood smoked bacon-delicious.  the scallop dish had only one scallop but boy was it amazing!  for me, the lobser curry and rice dish was the showstopper.  i was delighted with the generous lobster portions-perfect!  for the bf, he loved the next course: lamb accompanied by eggplant and tomato.  i enjoyed the lamb but dislike the consistency of the roasted eggplant.  the visual appeal was also lacking (the only one out of all the previous dishes).  the one-noted brown on the plate did little to impress.  the pre-dessert was a fruity martini 2-layer concoction:  frothy pina colada on taop and thick guava nectar on bottom.  last came the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> plated along side a coconut lime ice cream.  the contrast between the chocolate and citrus ice cream was interesting and tasty.  we thought we were through but a server brought freshly baked madelines with a chocolate sauce.  although we appreciated the dessert, the other dessert far surpassed the cookies.\n\nwine pairings\nbe careful!  we were tipsy mid-way through the dinner even though we did not finish each of the 3oz. pourings of each wine.  all the wines complimented each dish perfectly.  the last wine was a dessert sherry that we didn't want to leave behind so we took it over to the lounge and enjoyed it there.\n\nservice\nthe service was impeccable from the beginning, however, we didn't appreciate being rushed through the end, especially with the amount of money we were spending.  the waiter informed us that the staff was waiting for us to pay off our check as he brought it over so that they could leave their shifts.  we weren't being asked to leave, he said, just pay quickly.  it was just 11pm (closing time) and a few other patrons were still there.  they lost a star for making us feel uncomfortable towards the end of the meal. i didn't expect that from an establishment such as this one and don't want to be made to feel that way again.\n\ni absolutely would recommend mix and return again but i'll make sure to plan on an earlier reservation.", 
            "there was a lot of build up coming into dinner here, and i can say that it lived up to it - barely. i expect a lot out of a restaurant that has a michelin star, and rightly so. those things aren't thrown around willy-nilly. \ni'll give my quick rundown then get into the details:\natmosphere: 4\nservice: 5\nfood: 4\n\nthe atmosphere is hard to beat when you're on the 64th floor facing out over the gorgeous las vegas strip. you enter the restaurant through the lounge which is dark and moody, but really lovely. it goes from nearly pitch black to an overwhelming sensation of light when you round the corner to the dining room. there is a massive 35 foot champagne bubble chandelier that takes over the center of the room. it's truly gorgeous and sets the mood for a classy but nouveau style experience. we were seated at a half booth, and one of my complaints was that the seating arrangements felt crowded. not only could we hear the conversations on both sides of us, but i had to put my jacket behind me because my neighbors' jacket was nearly touching me. when the waiters have to slide the tables to let you get in, i think it's a little close. that bothered me just a bit as this was our romantic valentines day dinner and i was hoping for a little more intimacy. \n\nthe service was impeccable. it seemed like all we had to do was think of something that we wanted and someone appeared to make it happen. they have multiple attendants along with your individual server for each section and it pays off. we were never let wanting or waiting. we asked for a slow service and to not have our entrees fired until our appetizer had been cleared to give us time to enjoy the meal and it was done perfectly. some places prefer not to do that because you take up time at the table, but they were very gracious and accommodated our request. the other thing i appreciated was the fact that they were there just enough-never over bearing. \n\nthe food is what i was really looking forward to. their bread basket contained 5 types of bread and 2 butters. the ciabatta and sourdough were my favorites. their house made peanut butter was to die for but didn't go with any of the breads. the house sommelier stopped by and we picked out first glass of wine to go with out appetizer, <mark>Tender Potato Gnocchi</mark> with pumpkin, crispy bacon, and veal jus. it was to die for. my boyfriend who is just beginning his foray into the gastronomic world was blown away. in a different setting, i dare say he would have licked the plate. my entr\\u00e9e was the surf & turf; lobster and stuffed chicken breast with salsify and wild mushrooms. the only dark spot on the plate was the chicken. i usually don't order chicken at restaurants because is it always overcooked, but i really wanted everything else on the plate. the chicken wasn't overcooked, but the 'stuffing' was lacking flavor and was so minimal. however, it was quickly picked up by the amazing flavor of the lobster and wild mushrooms. the salsify was cooked to perfection as well. it was incredibly delicious and there was so much lobster that i ate only a small portion of the chicken. my honey got the pork loin and belly over grits which he loved. there was also pulled pork in the pot that it came cooked in that tasted a little too much like its sauce came out of a heinz can, but that's just my opinion. he enjoyed it all. the creamy grits really complemented the heavy smoky flavor of the pork belly. for dessert we split the '<mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark>' which is their homemade cookie center <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark>. it was really good. the chocolate was smooth and creamy and the filling was crunchy and sweet. we were so full at that point, but they brought around freshly baked vanilla-bean madelines and nutella as a 'parting gift.' of course i put mine away quickly seeing as how madelines and nutella are two of my favorite things. their madelines were perfection. \n\nthe bill came out to $220 with tax and tip, and i find that to be very reasonable for what it was. it was a great dinner and we finished with a drink in the lounge looking out over the strip. good times!", 
            "mix so far is the best dining experience i've had in vegas.  the restaurant truly stands for its 5 stars quality.  the fact that it's on the 64th floor of the the hotel is already amazing but let me tell you, the food is to die for.  i have complete satisfaction for the foods and they're worth every dime.  let me just say first that it's not cheap.  but who cares, after you finish dining there, you will be so satisfied that every dollar spent was worth the experience.  the restaurant is so elegant and gorgeous.  we ordered the ham mac & cheese, <mark>Tender Potato Gnocchi</mark>, seard <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, roasted main lobster with basmati rice & beef tenderloin top with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>.  all were excellent.  i left feeling so full and happy.  we then went to the other side of the restaurant which is the mix lounge.  gorgeous lounge.  definitely coming back when i'm back in vega again", 
            "what a beautiful restaurant!\nit's situated on the top floor of the hotel and has the most breathtaking views of the city. the restaurant boasts all white decor and is oh so chic. \nwe had a table next to a window so we had a phenomenal view. \nthere were 8 of us. \ni ordered a glass of pinot grigio, we started off with shoestring fries, a caesar salad and i had the <mark>Tender Potato Gnocchi</mark> for my entree. \nmy wine was tasty, the shoestring fries were addicting and i was in love with my caesar salad. the <mark>Tender Potato Gnocchi</mark> was just okay for me...there was something missing there. the service was good,  not great. this was a really gorgeous restaurant...but not too many veggie options so i probably wouldn't go back again. \nthe bill came out to $70/person with tax and tip\ndefinitely a great place to go on a date!", 
            "it was our first time ordering a prix fixe meal and although it was a bit pricey, it was worth every single penny!\n\nmy boyfriend and i came in for dinner around 7:30 and were seated immediately even though our reservations weren't till 8:00.\n\nwe each ordered a different \"chef tasting menu\" and every dish was amazing.\n\nthey brought out a variety basket of breads with two kinds of butter (regular and peanut) and <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> before the courses started coming. \n\nfor $120 i got:\n<mark>Tender Potato Gnocchi</mark>\nroasted maine lobster \"au curry\"\n<mark>Filet Mignon</mark> rossini\nbaba au rhum\n\nfor $90 my bf got:\nspicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>\nbutternut squash ravioli\nseared diver scallops\nrack of lamb\nlemon tart\n\ni wish i could remember what the pre-dessert was called but it was served in a martini glass with a light foam on the top layer..  the post dessert was a \"freshly baked\" madeline served with chocolate or maybe nutella but it didn't taste too fresh to me.\n\nfavorites:\nspicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> & black truffle that came with the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, scallops, lemon tart, and the <mark>Tender Potato Gnocchi</mark>.\n\nleast favorite:\nbread, madeline, baba au rhum, rack of lamb, and the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>.\n\nthe ambiance, decor, view, and service is awesome and it's just something everyone should experience at least once!  if you don't want to spend the money.. give the lounge area a visit.  we didn't have enough time or room for drinks but we'll definitely be back to give it a try.  i don't know if there's a cover or not but i do know it's free if you dine at mix.  your server will personally walk you over to the lounge and seat you... or at least he did for us :]", 
            "wow!.  amazing food, decor, and view.  my friends and i dined at mix to celebrate one of my friend's birthday...what a wonderful experience.  we ordered the tasting menu.  started with amuse bouche of lobster on top of citrus gelatin.  very good flavor.  next was the gnocchi...best i ever had.  the <mark>Tender Potato Gnocchi</mark> was so smooth and flavorful...not chewy like most places.  then they served lobster curry on bed of coconut rice.  they gave large pieces of lobster.  you can literally smell the sweet aroma of lobster as they were serving it.  next course was <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> topped with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and truffle.  steak was tender, but most impressive was the size of the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> on top of the steak.  cooked perfectly.  don't taste too much of the truffle though.  the dessert was ba ba rhum (sponge cake topped with rum and cream)...the only low point of the meal.  sponge cake was good, but the whole dessert was plain.\n\nthe decor is modern contemporary...the view is amazing.  on the top floor of the hotel (next to mandalay bay).  don't forget to visit the restroom.  there are windows on top of the urinals so you can enjoy the view.  the toilet faces outwards toward a large floor to ceiling glass window...very unique indeed.", 
            "this place earned the 5 stars.  service was exceptional.  all the staff were smiling, no one walked by without checking my table to see if i needed anything or to remove a dirty dish or pick up and empty sweet 'n low packet.  my server was haydee, and she was marvelous!\n\ni got the ducasse classics, the grand tasting menu.  before ordering, i asked the area manager for my section of the restaurant--who took my order--if i could switch dessert because i didn't want to have the baba au rhum with the small bottles of rum and cream alternately poured on the cake.  he had me look at their \\u00e0 la carte menu and pick any dessert from that--even the souffl\\u00e9 and he would substitute.  that's customer service and it's very accommodating. \n\nbread basket:  standard types of bread.  one in particular had red bell pepper baked in it.  that was great!  there was regular butter in a small holder with two sides.  on the other side was a peanut butter spread.  it was excellent when you let it come to room temperature.  heavenly flavors.\n\nthe courses:\n\namuse bouche:  mango and shrimp coulis with sliced daikon and sliced red radish.  very light and tasty.\n\nappetizer:  <mark>Tender Potato Gnocchi</mark> with two varieties of mushrooms, sunchoke, parmigiano reggiano with veal jus.  there were a couple of baby escarole pieces that just set off the presentation of the items.  the gnocchi were absolutely the softest gnocchi i have had!  superb!\n\nfish:  roasted maine lobster \"au curry\" on bed of coconut basmati rice.  there was not much curry flavor at all which would please some because there was certainly no flavor to overwhelm the delicate and sweet lobster. i tasted no coconut flavor in the basmati rice.     one small glitch here--there was a piece of lobster shell i bit into.  now, if i were scott conant on \"chopped\" i would have made that deep frown and made some remark about good chefs being careful about what they serve.  it happens and was no big deal.\n\nmeat:  <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> rossini.  a perfectly cooked filet--rare just as i asked with a large piece of delicate <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and several slices of black truffle.  it's the first truffle i ever had.  before, someone merely waved some truffle above the food and said, \"ok, here's your xxxxxxx with black truffle oil.\"  this was very tasty!\n\npre-dessert:  a martini glass with a passion fruit base and a rum foam for a topping.  very refreshing and an excellent palate cleanser.\n\ndessert:  <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark>.  a <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> made with alternate layers of graham cracker and chocolate all dipped in chocolate.  there was some edible gold leaf on the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark>.  with it was a lime coconut sorbet.  the lime was very dominating such that again i tasted no coconut.  they must use only a small amount of coconut flavoring.\n\npost dessert, dessert:  a different server brings to your table some warm madeleines in their mold fresh from the oven.  you remove your own madeleines with your fingers.  you also get a small bowl of nutella with a very small spoon to spread the heavenly hazelnut-chocolate goodness on your madeleine.\n\ni think i'll make a return visit here when it's winter and it's darker early.  the city's lights were just coming on but it wasn't yet dark enough to fully enjoy the lights of this great city!", 
            "this place is delicious, and really just outstandingly beautiful. i took my girlfriend here for her birthday last year because i found it online at restaurant.com and looked at the reviews and the restaurant website, and was sold when i saw that #1 it's alain ducasse (whose restaurant itinerary is an impressive 24 restaurants at the moment and who has his own culinary school in paris- a true pioneer of french cooking) and #2 i saw pictures of the restaurant. if you look at my picture you'll know what i'm talking about. the impact of the ceiling to floor hand-made blown glass sphere's that surround an intimate and prestigious table for one in the center of the restaurant really takes your breath away. and actually, we learned from our waiter, that the table placed in the middle of this glass ceiling jewelry is no longer allowed to be used, because it is not handicap accessible (they're stairs).\n\nfor dinner we had zero complaints, which pretty much has not happened for me at any restaurant. one of the best dining experience of my life. here's what my girlfriend and i enjoyed for dinner:\n\nshared appetizer:\n<mark>Tender Potato Gnocchi</mark> with sunchoke, parmigiano reggiano and  veal jus. the best gnocchi i've ever tasted. tender is an understatement.\n\nentrees:\nroasted maine lobster \"au curry\" with coconut basmati rice. speechless, just speechless.\n\n<mark>Cod Brandade</mark> with lemon, capers, brown butter, croutons & fried parsley. those croutons were basically a vehicle to supply your taste buds with a burst of butter, and that coupled with the largest capers i've ever seen (they were the size of peas!) and the fried parsley- just incredible.\n\nnow that i've popped my alain ducasse cherry, i will definitely be visiting adour new york and benoit new york when i have a large chuck of change burning a hole in my pocket. oh, and if you go, check out the bathroom in mix lounge next door. you'll see what i mean when you get there.", 
            "i really wanted to love mix. i had heard a lot of good things and decided we would finally give it a try. what a disappointment. when my husband and i first arrived, no one was there to greet us. we waited and finally decided to ask someone for assistance. an employee said we could go sit in the lounge and they would come get us. our reservation was at 6. it was 6:15, and no one came to the lounge so we yet again had to find someone to help us. we finally get seated and the server asks us if we had a show to catch. we told her no but i wish we had said yes because they were so slow. we were literally there almost 3 hours! i understand we had the pre fixe dinners, but 3 hours is excessive. \n\nwe each got a different pre fixe meal - the $90 and the $120 one and decided we would share everything. if i am paying over $100 pp person for dinner, i expect it to be good - damn good. what a disappointment. so, here is a run down of each item:\n\nspicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> - the crab part wasn't bad but there was something really off in this salad. we could not put our finger on it but if whatever it was, was left it, it would have probably tasted a lot better. \n\nbutternut squash ravioli - pretty good\n\nseared diver scallops - these were also very good\n\nlamb - was actually the best lamb i've ever had although the eggplant whatever else was in the side dish that came with it was disgusting and i love eggplant. \n\n<mark>Tender Potato Gnocchi</mark> - this wasn't bad\n\nlobster \"au curry\" - i think the way it was prepared ruined the dish. had the rice and the lobster been separate dishes it would have been much better. i ended up eating them separately so as to not ruin the taste of the lobster. lobster is good as it is, why try and dress it up just to ruin it? \n\nfilet minion - very good. cooked perfectly. \n\nboth desserts were very good. \n\n2 dinners, 2 light beers and 2 mixed drinks made our bill come out to $375, which included gratuity. luckily we had a $50 certificate from restaurant.com and we had comps from our players card so we ended up paying $130 out of pocket. had we paid more, i would have been really unhappy. our meal wasn't even worth the $130 we paid. i admit the view is amazing and they have some good options for dinner, but i say if you want to see the view, go to the lounge, see the view and then leave. there are a million other places in vegas where you could spend much less and get a much better meal!", 
            "ate dinner at the restaurant -- overall a very nice experience.  food was generally very good, service is nice, and atmosphere and view are great.\n\ngreat\n- hazelnut souffle -- the best souffle i have ever had i can recall.   top was crispy while the inside was still light and not overly sweet.\n- the curry lobster over coconut rice --  wonderfully rich sauce\n- <mark>Tender Potato Gnocchi</mark> app - great, light texture.  loved how they peeled the asparagus to make it extra tender\n\njust ok\n- foie appetizer was average (needed more seasoning)\n- the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> - would be better if it was dark chocolate\n\nbut overall nice experience.   the bathrooms have a unique view too!", 
            "***mix provides a great view of the strip and the service is very nice, but the food is below average when compared to fine dining spots outside of las vegas***\n\nmix is the second alain ducasse restaurant i've tried.  the other one was in tokyo and it was decent but not special.  occasionally, the food at mix felt pretty good, but often the food felt a little below average.  the food tastes slightly better than nearby aureole (and the service is better too), but mix just does not feel like a great fine dining spot.\n\nthe alain ducasse name is definitely a draw for mix, but the atmosphere is too.  mix sits on the 64th floor of the mandalay bay and you get a good view of the strip (best at night) from most tables; there are some obstructed views.  the dining room is nice--mostly an all white room with white tablecloth; there are splashes of red here and there.  the lounge area is different; it utilizes darker and more typical lounge colors.\n\nmix offers several menu options.  there is an a la carte menu, which features starters and entrees including several prime steaks.  there is also a seasonal mix tasting menu as well as a tasting menu comprised of alain ducasse signature dishes.  i decided to opt for the alain ducasse tasting menu.\n\n(sweet corn soup amuse) the sweet corn flavor was good and it was creamy, but it was way too hot--almost like they zapped it in the microwave.\n\n(assorted bread with butter and peanut butter) the breadbasket was a decent variety of options, but it was just okay.  the addition of peanut butter was interesting, but the actual peanut butter itself was not that great.\n\n(<mark>Tender Potato Gnocchi</mark>, asparagus, mushrooms, aged cheese) the gnocchi was okay; it was a little doughy and i prefer gnocchi with a seared outside.  the asparagus was good.  the mushrooms were just okay, but i really liked the aged cheese, which was sharp and hard but still surprisingly creamy and not dry (there should have been more of it on the plate).\n\n(<mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, date puree, lemon confit) i added this as an a la carte item to the tasting menu and the date puree was a good sweet compliment to the more salty <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>.  the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> was not that good though.  it was a little stringy and it was not that smooth or creamy.\n\n(roasted maine lobster au curry, coconut basmati rice) the lobster was tender, but it just lacked the softness and moistness you get at really great fine dining restaurants. the coconut basmati rice was nice and creamy and the curry sauce was fragrant, but the flavors did not really develop.  it just became a decent curry dish and nothing else.  and because it was such a big portion, it became kind of a task to eat (instead of a really great dish where you can't put your fork down).\n\n(<mark>Filet Mignon</mark> rossini, <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, black truffle) this was the main course and it was quite rich and heavy.  the filet was decent.  it was cooked okay and was juicy and tender enough, but i did not think the quality of the meat was great.  the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> was similar to the a la carte <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> where it just did not have that velvety smoothness you get with great <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> (the texture kind of reminded me of when you don't do creme brulee right and it becomes like scrambled egg).\n\nthe black truffle was not that great either.  it was probably australian truffle and not the peak season for it.  this truffle part might be better in the winter.\n\n(mango puree) the first dessert was a palate cleanser and it was not that great.  it was mango puree and a soda foam.  it was just tart and fizzy and not that refreshing.\n\n(baba a 'larmagnac, brioche, blueberry compote, cream) this was a kind of make-your-own dessert because they serve it in parts.  the sponge cake-like brioche sits atop a good blueberry compote and there is very strong brandy on the side for pouring and a very good cream for applying, dipping and such.  as individual parts, this dessert was decent, but i did not really love it as a whole.\n\n(madeleines with chocolate dipping sauce).  i liked that the madeleines were freshly baked, but they were too big.  i wish they had more of a defined edge/crust.  the chocolate dipping sauce did not have a great flavor and was too thick.\n\ndespite a lot of the food being mediocre, the service was very good.  the staff was pleasant and attentive and the food came out at a good pace.\n\nprices were high, but you do get a very generous amount of food with the tasting menu.  and because a lot of the food is rich and heavy, you definitely will not leave hungry.\n\ni thought the service at mix was very good, but the food was about the same quality as mandalay bay's other lackluster fine dining spot aureole.  there is a lot mediocre fine dining in las vegas and, unfortunately, alain ducasse's mix falls in that bunch.  if you are looking for better and more contemporary french dining, you should check out l'atelier de joel robuchon in the mgm grand instead.\n\nthe mandalay bay offers both complimentary valet and self parking.", 
            "we dined here last night with a group of 5 and i must say, i am shocked it took me 3+ years to try this place! the interior is beyond beautiful and it will probably go on my list of must-see venues for tourists to visit while they are here. \n\nimagine voodoo lounge at the rio with  better views and incomparable 5 star menus. all of 5 of us tried the \"classic\" tasting menu. \n\nclassic tasting menu:  \n--pre-menu: a mouse, sooo good. it tastes like bacon but better. \n1. <mark>Tender Potato Gnocchi</mark> with asparagus cream & pesto. amazing!! everyone at the table agreed it was the best gnocchi they had ever tasted. \n*** i added <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> as well, it was tasty.***\n2. lobster curry. omg, imagine the best tasting indian dish you ever put in your mouth with a melt in your mouth buttery lobster! \n3.filet w/ foire gras. cooked perfectly. so good!!\n--passion fruit foamy cocktail. i have no idea what the real name is, but it was a unique end to the meal. i will look forward to it again :)\n4. baba cake. not my fav... i would probably sub this out because i need chocolate. i am not subtracting any stars for this because the view made up for the meh dessert, plus everyone else at the table loved it, \n--after dessert: vanilla cookies, fresh with nutella. \n\nview: if i could give a view 10 stars, i would!! it was amazing!! make sure you use the club restroom so you can have a view even while you go ;) \n\nservice: 10 stars as well! our server was very engaging an answered a ton of questions about the chandelier and history of the restaurant. \n\ni will be back!! plan about $200 per person for wine/food for a nice meal :)", 
            "i loved this restaurant! i had never heard of it before my last trip to vegas, but this time i went with a friend and her parents treated us to dinner here. the restaurant itself is very nice inside and the view is amazing. we would have sat outside if it wasn't 100 degrees at night! \ni ordered the <mark>Cod Brandade</mark> and a side of asparagus and it was delicious. probably the best piece of fish i've ever had. i also tried my friend's lobster curry and it was amazing. for an appetizer the table shared the <mark>Tender Potato Gnocchi</mark> which was... you guessed it- delicious. everything was rich and flavorful. \nthe cocktails were good, but i wouldn't say they were amazing. and my friend was surprised with a dessert since it was her birthday.\nthe only reason i don't think it deserved 5 stars was because the waitress seemed to forget about us quite often, even though the restaurant was relatively empty. i would still refer this restaurant to a friend, and go back myself."

            "mix atop of the hotel has to be one of the most expensive resturants i've been to.  was it worth the price?  yes indeed!  the food was really good, not great.  i had the <mark>Striped Bass</mark> with asparagus served two ways, and it was tasty.  my friend had the beef tenderloin and short rib with these great block potatoes.  those were really good.  we also shared the tuna tartar and shrimp cocktail appies.  the shrimp cocktail was on top of a horseradish compote.  it's was very tasty.  of course we had lovely cocktails, i had a lovely glass (well 3, should have bought the bottle) of pinot grigio.\n\nthe best part of our meal...hmmm, we sat in one of the pods and it was quite fun and funny.  we had no idea when our waiter was going to show up so it was a nice little surprise.  we had a lot of fun at this restaurant, views are amazing, decor is very modern, and i love the glass bubbles hanging in the middle of the restaurant. \n\nthe only reason why i'm giving mix 4 stars is because i thought the food would be unbelievable for the prices....but it's vegas.", 
            "what a way to start our weekend in vegas! \n\nthe topline:\n*sommalier on site to help choose between the exorbitantly-priced, but excellent wines on the endless list.\n*holy view! i couldn't decide what was more enthralling to look at (besides the ever-enthralling will t., of course)--the sparking landscape out the 62nd-floor window or the bone white interior with it's 15,000 glass balls hanging from the ceiling.\n*the service was not up to the pricetag of the menu or its michelin rating. we were fortunate enough to have a very sweet guy who didn't ever leave us hanging (and didn't laugh when we needed to start dinner with sugarfree redbull and vodka!), but i would expect michael mina-level flawless service here.\n*the food was 5 stars--when you get to decide between bison and venison on a menu (i chose the perfectly-prepared bison fillet), you are in for a unique dining experience. the creamed spinach on the side was notably good. and we also shared the surf and turf: <mark>Striped Bass</mark>, <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, brussel sprouts, with crushed black truffle. and you should order the baba au rhum dessert just for fun--the moist cake is already steeped in rum, and you get extra, warm rum to pour on top--deee-lightful.\n\nmix is definitely worth saving your duckets or gambling grandma's social security check for.",

            "as far as date spots go, this would be perfect in vegas.  you can't beat the views and the interior of the dining room.\n\nas far as dining experience, the food is quite incredible.  i would definitely go with at least one fish dish.  from the classics, i had the chef's <mark>Striped Bass</mark>.  even if it came without the squid/octopus and it's base, i would have still loved it.  same goes for the halibut.  i find it amazing how the chefs can cook such a big piece of fish so evenly and so moist.  \n\ntop the above dishes with the <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> and some gnocchi, you will be quite satisfied and full.  enjoy!\n\nwhy 4 stars?  the service is a bit casual.  the servers are pleasant, but the service doesn't equate to what the customer is paying.  items are missing, the staff is not completely attentive.  i have a feeling the chef is going for this feel to make it seem unpretentious, but i'm not sure if it's the best model."

            "perhaps having eaten at a lot of highly acclaimed restaurants my expectation were too high, but a michelin star should be better.\n\nthe <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> with chicken was good, but too much chicken.  the <mark>Filet Mingnon Rossini</mark> lacked sauce and was overcooked and a bit dry,  the lamb was so over flavored on the crust that only the center was tasty.  excellent buttery potatoes and creamed spinach, the asparagus was good, but tasted mostly like butter..\n\nthe desserts were the most disappointing - the profiteroles were fair and the chocolate souffl\\u00e9 dry, lacking in chocolate flavor and inedible (left almost completely uneaten, complained about and still charged).  the madeleines were cute, but too dry and cakey, lacking the buttery-lemon flavor of true madeleine fame (my wife's are much better).\n\nservice was about the same as the food.  the sommelier was competent and the turley zinfandel excellent, although our waitress managed to spill some while pouring due to her seeming indifference.  we had an early dinner and the room was empty most of the time with too many servers per patron. at times they were overly anxious, at times good and at times intrusive - certainly not first rate.  you shouldn't clear one diner and not the table, but that wasn't the way things worked here.\n\nit seemed like a new venture that hand't yet worked out the kinks, but hearing they'd been open for several years they have no excuses.\n\nlovely space, good view, have a drink, but forget the food, until they get serious about being a real first rate restaurant.  when a big name chef adds his name to a restaurant, i'd expect his continued involvement or at least a higher level of quality control.  his name now just means high prices.  he should learn from thomas keller and the french laundry.\n\nreturned for hosted cocktails during the following week and the waitress smashed into my wife's arm leaving a very nasty black and blue mark.  maybe she'd read my earlier review?"

            "came here for dinner, not the lounge portion, but if you want beautiful panoramas of the city i highly suggest you start here. but, be careful, they seem to be pretty snotty about outdoor seating even when the place is empty. call ahead.\n\nas for dinner, the restaurant is beautiful. you walk in and get instant visual stimulation. it's incredible. from the decor to the lights of the city all around, it really is just a place that draws you in. \n\nthere were a few thins that happened that could have been avoided and this would have been a four star experience. the first incident was being seated in a cozy little nook where conversation could be had without being so close to the next person you feel like you're sharing family secrets. that didn't last long. the hostess immediately, in a bare, empty, no one-there restaurant, seats people right next to me and my date. hello? that is beyond rude. i mean, the tables are so close together as to be really uncomfortable. to use the bathroom i literally had to wedge myself between my table and the one next to us. awkward. also, the waiter, when asked for my favorite belgian beer tried to tell me they only carried one type. i had to insist that he go ask someone because he was wrong (for the record, chimay comes in blue, white and red). \n\nother than those two missteps everything was okay. the service was quick and flawless. the time between waiter visits was perfect. i had to ask for water just one time and after that i couldn't take a sip without it being refilled. so, great job of picking up on that. we were also greeted by several people on our way in which i thought was a very nice touch.\n\nonto dinner. for appetizers i had the dinner salad which was essentially a larger than average bowl of mixed greens. it was mixed with a vinaigrette of some sort that just added to the bitter taste of the overall salad. i wouldn't recommend. my date had the spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> which was delicious, but absolutely could have come from mom's kitchen. what can i say, my mom's a great cook! \n\nfor an entree i had the 12 oz. <mark>Boneless Ribeye</mark>. it was cooked perfectly, but was much too large for me to eat so i brought the extra home. it was delicious. it did happen to be more of a fatty cut than i was used to, excessively so. it was fine, but i prefer less fat, more beef, obviously. for sides i chose the fork crushed potatoes. they were chunky and rich, but again, they could have come from my mom's kitchen. \n\nmy date had the <mark>Pepper Crusted Bison Tenderloin</mark> and seemed to enjoy it. i dislike that much pepper anywhere near me, but it looked delicious. his side was sauteed spinach which he found delicious. \n\nfor dessert i passed, but my friend had the ice cream/toppings. you get four choices of either and he chose pistachio ice cream, salted caramel ice cream and vanilla ice cream with coconut crunch as a topping. the pistachio was creamy and rich, i loved it. i could have done without the coconut, but really it wasn't a distraction. i disliked intensely the salted caramel. it tasted very bland and very unlike any salted caramel i've ever tasted. i almost think that's a taste that belongs solely in candy form. i just don't think it translates well to other things, which isn't the fault of the restaurant, i've just never found that it works on much else but candy. as for the vanilla, well, it was vanilla. \n\nall in all the decor, charm and service were perfection. the food was so enjoyable although i didn't get the michelin star experience, i don't think. the food really was good and the view was just beautiful. with all the restaurants in vegas, though, i doubt i'll revisit. but, do go try it once!",

            "wow!.  amazing food, decor, and view.  my friends and i dined at mix to celebrate one of my friend's birthday...what a wonderful experience.  we ordered the tasting menu.  started with amuse bouche of lobster on top of citrus gelatin.  very good flavor.  next was the gnocchi...best i ever had.  the <mark>Tender Potato Gnocchi</mark> was so smooth and flavorful...not chewy like most places.  then they served lobster curry on bed of coconut rice.  they gave large pieces of lobster.  you can literally smell the sweet aroma of lobster as they were serving it.  next course was <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> topped with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and truffle.  steak was tender, but most impressive was the size of the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> on top of the steak.  cooked perfectly.  don't taste too much of the truffle though.  the dessert was ba ba rhum (sponge cake topped with rum and cream)...the only low point of the meal.  sponge cake was good, but the whole dessert was plain.\n\nthe decor is modern contemporary...the view is amazing.  on the top floor of the hotel (next to mandalay bay).  don't forget to visit the restroom.  there are windows on top of the urinals so you can enjoy the view.  the toilet faces outwards toward a large floor to ceiling glass window...very unique indeed.", 
            "this place earned the 5 stars.  service was exceptional.  all the staff were smiling, no one walked by without checking my table to see if i needed anything or to remove a dirty dish or pick up and empty sweet 'n low packet.  my server was haydee, and she was marvelous!\n\ni got the ducasse classics, the grand tasting menu.  before ordering, i asked the area manager for my section of the restaurant--who took my order--if i could switch dessert because i didn't want to have the baba au rhum with the small bottles of rum and cream alternately poured on the cake.  he had me look at their \\u00e0 la carte menu and pick any dessert from that--even the souffl\\u00e9 and he would substitute.  that's customer service and it's very accommodating. \n\nbread basket:  standard types of bread.  one in particular had red bell pepper baked in it.  that was great!  there was regular butter in a small holder with two sides.  on the other side was a peanut butter spread.  it was excellent when you let it come to room temperature.  heavenly flavors.\n\nthe courses:\n\namuse bouche:  mango and shrimp coulis with sliced daikon and sliced red radish.  very light and tasty.\n\nappetizer:  <mark>Tender Potato Gnocchi</mark> with two varieties of mushrooms, sunchoke, parmigiano reggiano with veal jus.  there were a couple of baby escarole pieces that just set off the presentation of the items.  the gnocchi were absolutely the softest gnocchi i have had!  superb!\n\nfish:  roasted maine lobster \"au curry\" on bed of coconut basmati rice.  there was not much curry flavor at all which would please some because there was certainly no flavor to overwhelm the delicate and sweet lobster. i tasted no coconut flavor in the basmati rice.     one small glitch here--there was a piece of lobster shell i bit into.  now, if i were scott conant on \"chopped\" i would have made that deep frown and made some remark about good chefs being careful about what they serve.  it happens and was no big deal.\n\nmeat:  <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> rossini.  a perfectly cooked filet--rare just as i asked with a large piece of delicate <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and several slices of black truffle.  it's the first truffle i ever had.  before, someone merely waved some truffle above the food and said, \"ok, here's your xxxxxxx with black truffle oil.\"  this was very tasty!\n\npre-dessert:  a martini glass with a passion fruit base and a rum foam for a topping.  very refreshing and an excellent palate cleanser.\n\ndessert:  <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark>.  a <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> made with alternate layers of graham cracker and chocolate all dipped in chocolate.  there was some edible gold leaf on the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark>.  with it was a lime coconut sorbet.  the lime was very dominating such that again i tasted no coconut.  they must use only a small amount of coconut flavoring.\n\npost dessert, dessert:  a different server brings to your table some warm madeleines in their mold fresh from the oven.  you remove your own madeleines with your fingers.  you also get a small bowl of nutella with a very small spoon to spread the heavenly hazelnut-chocolate goodness on your madeleine.\n\ni think i'll make a return visit here when it's winter and it's darker early.  the city's lights were just coming on but it wasn't yet dark enough to fully enjoy the lights of this great city!", 
            "despite the mix-ed reviews- sorry for the bad pun- i decided to dine hear because:\n\n1. i was staying at mandalay bay and wanted to do something close.\n2. i had a $50 off gift certificate\n3. i thought to myself, \"well even if the food is so-so like i read, its got a great view and cool decor.\"\n\nwell i guess since i had lower expectations, i ended up being pretty happy with the experience. first thing i should mention, you really should view mix as a french-influenced american steakhouse, as opposed to a french restaurant along the lines of le cirque. if you look at the menu, you'll notice how similar it is to a classic steakhouse. that said, the food isn't going to be mindblowing, but it is really good, albeit pricey. i love <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, but at $32 for an app, this was the most i ever paid for it...but it was a nice sized portion and it was cooked perfectly. my <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> was perfect also, and i needed that after the chewy hangar steak i had at sage the previous night. dessert was a passion fruit souffle...again, very good...moist and eggy. \n\nthe service was good, the setting was really cool..it really looks great in there at night with the lights dimmed...and the view was great also, althoguh tough to see because of the reflection on the windows. the elevator ride up is quite an experience also... a glass-enclosed elevator on the outside of thehotel giving you a view for the ride all the way up and back down. \n\nit was worth going to once, especially with the $50 off, but i don't think i'll be returning with all the other places in vegas to try.", 
            "i can't really think of a better \"special occasion\" restaurant in america. right off the bat, the view of the las vegas strip from the lounge is breathtaking. it's a fantastic place to have a few drinks before dinner, or just in general if you aren't there to dine. even the view from the restroom is fantastic. the main dining room is very contemporary and minimalistic. hundreds of hand-blown glass bubbles fill the area, so it almost feels like you're sitting in a glass of champagne. but what really sets this restaurant apart is the food. from start to finish, everything we tried was exceptional. the one dish that really stands out in my mind was the fillet <mark>Filet Mignon Rossini</mark>. being a big fan of <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, chef alain ducasse really hit a grand slam with this dish. it was easily the best steak i've ever had. on the downside, the prices are a bit on the upper end but you certainly won't be disappointed. so if you're ever in the las vegas area for a special occasion, mix should be on the top of your list for fine dining dinner spots.", 
            "for the view and ambience? 5 stars.\nfor the food for the verrry high price? i say 3.\n\nthis place is on the 64th floor and you just really can't beat the view.  the service was alright, a little slow but i think that's just because of the type of place it is - they never want to rush you.  \n\ndrinks were very high and for four of us our bill came out to be around $250. the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> was delicious but nothing better then i've had at many other steak houses at the casino's along the strip... you definitely pay for the ambiance and view here!", 
            "wow, amazing view, exceptional service (randy is an outstanding waiter!) food was amazing. i had the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, which i have to say is probably in the top 3 i've ever eaten. the mac & <mark>Macaroni & Cheese with Ham</mark> is delicious as a side. my wife had the halibut, which was very good and quite light (she didn't want to stuff herself). definitely coming back and recommending to everyone.",

            "i was invited here by some colleagues during a work retreat and treated to an extravagant place with over-the-top prices on food. there were many areas to mix that ran the gamut of styles. first of all, the entrance to mix was just a hallway to an outdoor elevator that shot up to the top of the hotel; by the way, it was hot! \n\nonce we got in, there was the lounge and bar area which were club-like and very loud. vegas, yes yes. we apparently were in the back past the kitchen so we moved from that very dark, very loud setting to a white bubbly restaurant area. talk about modernized fancy schmancy - even our bread came with square pats of creamy butter and sweet peanut butter. by the way, the pimento bread was very excellent and good on its own without any spread. \n\nso after trying to get a little comfortable in this unfamiliar setting of a swanky restaurant (and staring at the price tags on the food), i decided that since i was already in the situation, i ought to take full advantage of it. i mean, when else am i going to place myself there with a high-priced menu? therefore, what else to order but one of the chef's signature dishes, the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> rossini? it came with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and sliced black truffles. oh and i believe there was also a side of mashed potatoes for me too. when they came out, they honestly weren't presented in a way that made my mouth water (actually, the waiter set the plate down in front of me incorrectly with the insignia not turned properly). however, the tenderness of the steak certainly played its part in charming me. was the best i've had though? no but the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> really helped pull the flavors together. let's not forget the truffle! the mashed potatoes were also both fluffy and still chunky enough to please my palate. now, was the whole entree worth $69? i'd say not. was it delicious and juicy? yes it sure was.\n\ni couldn't resist getting dessert with such wonderful descriptions listed on the menu (turn a blind eye to the price tag, minerva!). i ended up with a hazelnut souffle paired with grapefruit sorbet. uh, who pairs the two together? i was hoping that i'd get them in some kind of complex mix but alas, they were presented separately on one plate. the hazelnut souffle had too much sugar in some parts so that it was unnecessarily cavity-inducing crunchy. i really enjoyed the sorbet but felt that it was odd to include the bits of sugar in the bowl. the candied grapefruit peel was delicious but again, too sweet. i'm glad i had the experience here but once again was proven correct in my thought that the cost and high profile appearance of a place does not say anything about the food. it's all about the diner, and this diner was only somewhat satisfied that night.", 
            "this is a review for the restaurant, which i just walked out of 15 minutes ago. :)  my party and i chose to go for their better tasting menu which included four courses plus an amuse bouche and pre-dessert dish.  here's the breakdown:\n\n1. amuse bouche: thai coconut chicken soup aka tom ka gai.  a nice touch, but i've had better tom ka gai at my local thai restaurant.  too much lemongrass, and not enough sweetness.  not bad, but not great.\n\n2. first course: gnocchi with asparagus and morels in a cream sauce.  i personally liked this dish, i felt that the delicate flavors were well balanced and a perfect introduction for what was to come.  my sister felt that this dish was a little on the bland side, but then again, she has a cold, so i'm not sure if her taste buds are fully functioning, lol.\n\n3. second course: roasted maine lobster \"au curry\" with coconut basmati rice.  i was a little apprehensive when i saw \"curry\" and \"lobster\" in the same sentence, but this was actually a very unique and pleasant twist on how i normally experience lobster.  when dining at gary danko in san francisco, my go-to dish is the butter-poached maine lobster with risotto, and here we have a similar dish with an indian touch...delicious!\n\n4. third course: <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> rossini with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and black truffle.  i do love my tournedos rossini and mix does it beautifully here.  my velvety filet practically melted in my mouth and the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> was richer than butter.  the chef was also very generous with the black truffle slices.  definitely the star of tonight's meal!\n\n5. pre-dessert: mango puree with coconut foam.  this light and airy precursor to dessert looked like a fancy cocktail served in a martini glass.  exotic, fruity, and a refreshing palate cleanser after such a rich main dish!\n\n6. fourth course/dessert: <mark>Baba a L'armagnac</mark> (monte carlo style).  this was an irish sponge cake drizzled with armagnac and served alongside an airy vanilla bean whipped cream.  decadent without being over-the-top, but i was still so stuffed that i could only finish half...what a waste!  still, being a chocolate lover, i would have chosen a mousse or lava cake a la mode over this any day.  sorry mix!\n\ni also had two glasses of the sparkling rose and an irish coffee to accompany my meal.  the rose was nice, but the irish coffee had such a kick that i could only finish half for fear of being unable to walk out of the restaurant!\n\nthe location, view, and decor was amazing!  i'm sure you've all seen photos of the \"floating\" glass bubbles that adorn the center of the restaurant.  the floor is also made to emulate a lace pattern.  service was friendly, but unfortunately on the slow side.  it took them over 2.5 hours to serve us four courses.  also, i felt like the price was a little on the high side for only four courses...i've eaten at comparable restaurants here in vegas and in sf which cost about the same for 6-9 courses.  nonetheless, i would still consider this a very good experience and is worth trying once.  but if you're going to do it, do it all the way and go with the higher tasting menu for the best the chef has to offer!", 
            "i had a great time at mix. i originally reserved for 2 people at 9pm. my horrible airport experience forced me to be 10-15 minutes late and not be able to change into a nicer outfit. they were very nice about the tardiness, assuming how the restaurant hours was until 10pm, and usually these dinners take long. my date and i were not rushed or anything during our dinner.\n\nthis place is beautiful! the bubbly decor coming from the ceiling made me think that i was dining under the sea. yet i'm at the very top of thehotel at mandalay bay. our booth was facing the backside of the strip, so the scenery was more mellow and calming than the glamorous strip, my dinner felt extremely relaxing although i was rushing there and freaking out at the airport.\n\nwe both ordered the tasting menu, which had a spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, halibut, <mark><mark>Colorado Lamb Loin</mark></mark>, and the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark>. i believe the entire table has to choose one of the tasting menus if any wanted to try it. my date didn't want to in the beginning since he wasn't into <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> or lamb. our server offered to switch out the lamb for the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> for $10 extra. \n\nwe started off the meal with a scallop ceviche. i enjoyed it a lot, it's very light, and the lime juice wasn't too overwhelming like most of the places that served ceviche. it was just right. it's interesting how they have some shredded raw mango on top, felt like some type of fusion going on here. \n\ni was enthralled by the looks of the spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>. very detailed with different layers of ingredients stacked up, but i had too high of expectations on the flavors. i don't recall it being spicy or crabby enough. for spiciness, i might be immune so my taste buds are less sensitive to spiciness. i was a bit disappointed there.\n\nsecond course came about with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> with lemon confit & dates. i liked how mine was seared just right, where it's more rare inside. i love the aftertaste and the aroma from each bite. unfortunately, i'm not too educated in <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, all i can tell you is if i liked it and met my expectations of it. i got to eat my date's piece too, since he's not too interested in something this rich in taste. his piece was a bit more cooked than mine, easier to slice, i just prefer a softer texture.\n\nthird course was the best one yet, halibut prepared in chicken jus and vegetable blanquette. every. bite. was. amazing. my general perception of halibut is that it's very bland and tasteless. this dish had such interesting flavors in many different layers. the flavors in every bite were going under transformation inside my mouth. i seriously don't want to finish this dish because i don't want the experience to end. \n\nfourth course was my <mark><mark>Colorado Lamb Loin</mark></mark>, with stuffed piquillo peppers and prommes anna. portions were generous, or maybe i was just very full. the spices on the <mark><mark>Colorado Lamb Loin</mark></mark> didn't take away the flavors of the lamb at all. i didn't like the meat inside the piquillo peppers though, it was a bit too tough. otherwise, the whole pepper was fun to eat; it's not the textures that were interesting but flavors of the pepper and the meat were well blended. the prommes anna was very crispy in the outside, you can feel the flakey texture with your tongue too. unfortunately i was hitting my maximum capacity.\n\nthat's when they brought out our pre-dessert. it was a sweet drink with mango puree tasted sweet and sour, topped with some coconut rum foam. it reminded me of thailand, maybe because of the tropical taste. the tart taste ease up the digestion, which was just what i needed!\n\nand finally, the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> of mix served with coconut/lime sorbet. the looks of it wasn't too spectacular, just a bar with a piece of gold flake and two half nuts on top. yes gold flake isn't too spectacular. i liked the simplicity of it though. it tasted like a ferrero rocher in a bar form served with the sorbet on the side. the combination is great. the sweetness of the chocolate is evened out with a light citrus.\n\nour dinner ended at 11:30-11:45. it would have been a nightmare if they didn't tolerate that 10 minutes of tardiness. in addition, our server offered us to their lounge with no covers. it was a great offer monetary-wise, but we were just in such a rush before that we were nowhere close in dressed properly for lounges. maybe next time :)", 
            "i've had a lot of spectacular meals, but the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> topped with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> topped with black truffles was honestly one of the best things i've ever tasted in my life. then put that on top of an amazing location at the top of the hotel looking over the whole vegas strip makes it amazing!", 
            "***mix provides a great view of the strip and the service is very nice, but the food is below average when compared to fine dining spots outside of las vegas***\n\nmix is the second alain ducasse restaurant i've tried.  the other one was in tokyo and it was decent but not special.  occasionally, the food at mix felt pretty good, but often the food felt a little below average.  the food tastes slightly better than nearby aureole (and the service is better too), but mix just does not feel like a great fine dining spot.\n\nthe alain ducasse name is definitely a draw for mix, but the atmosphere is too.  mix sits on the 64th floor of the mandalay bay and you get a good view of the strip (best at night) from most tables; there are some obstructed views.  the dining room is nice--mostly an all white room with white tablecloth; there are splashes of red here and there.  the lounge area is different; it utilizes darker and more typical lounge colors.\n\nmix offers several menu options.  there is an a la carte menu, which features starters and entrees including several prime steaks.  there is also a seasonal mix tasting menu as well as a tasting menu comprised of alain ducasse signature dishes.  i decided to opt for the alain ducasse tasting menu.\n\n(sweet corn soup amuse) the sweet corn flavor was good and it was creamy, but it was way too hot--almost like they zapped it in the microwave.\n\n(assorted bread with butter and peanut butter) the breadbasket was a decent variety of options, but it was just okay.  the addition of peanut butter was interesting, but the actual peanut butter itself was not that great.\n\n(<mark>Tender Potato Gnocchi</mark>, asparagus, mushrooms, aged cheese) the gnocchi was okay; it was a little doughy and i prefer gnocchi with a seared outside.  the asparagus was good.  the mushrooms were just okay, but i really liked the aged cheese, which was sharp and hard but still surprisingly creamy and not dry (there should have been more of it on the plate).\n\n(<mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, date puree, lemon confit) i added this as an a la carte item to the tasting menu and the date puree was a good sweet compliment to the more salty <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>.  the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> was not that good though.  it was a little stringy and it was not that smooth or creamy.\n\n(roasted maine lobster au curry, coconut basmati rice) the lobster was tender, but it just lacked the softness and moistness you get at really great fine dining restaurants. the coconut basmati rice was nice and creamy and the curry sauce was fragrant, but the flavors did not really develop.  it just became a decent curry dish and nothing else.  and because it was such a big portion, it became kind of a task to eat (instead of a really great dish where you can't put your fork down).\n\n(<mark>Filet Mignon</mark> rossini, <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, black truffle) this was the main course and it was quite rich and heavy.  the filet was decent.  it was cooked okay and was juicy and tender enough, but i did not think the quality of the meat was great.  the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> was similar to the a la carte <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> where it just did not have that velvety smoothness you get with great <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> (the texture kind of reminded me of when you don't do creme brulee right and it becomes like scrambled egg).\n\nthe black truffle was not that great either.  it was probably australian truffle and not the peak season for it.  this truffle part might be better in the winter.\n\n(mango puree) the first dessert was a palate cleanser and it was not that great.  it was mango puree and a soda foam.  it was just tart and fizzy and not that refreshing.\n\n(baba a 'larmagnac, brioche, blueberry compote, cream) this was a kind of make-your-own dessert because they serve it in parts.  the sponge cake-like brioche sits atop a good blueberry compote and there is very strong brandy on the side for pouring and a very good cream for applying, dipping and such.  as individual parts, this dessert was decent, but i did not really love it as a whole.\n\n(madeleines with chocolate dipping sauce).  i liked that the madeleines were freshly baked, but they were too big.  i wish they had more of a defined edge/crust.  the chocolate dipping sauce did not have a great flavor and was too thick.\n\ndespite a lot of the food being mediocre, the service was very good.  the staff was pleasant and attentive and the food came out at a good pace.\n\nprices were high, but you do get a very generous amount of food with the tasting menu.  and because a lot of the food is rich and heavy, you definitely will not leave hungry.\n\ni thought the service at mix was very good, but the food was about the same quality as mandalay bay's other lackluster fine dining spot aureole.  there is a lot mediocre fine dining in las vegas and, unfortunately, alain ducasse's mix falls in that bunch.  if you are looking for better and more contemporary french dining, you should check out l'atelier de joel robuchon in the mgm grand instead.\n\nthe mandalay bay offers both complimentary valet and self parking.",

            "came here for christmas eve dinner with reservations and ordered the seared scallops, which the boyfriend liked a lot. i was not so much of a fan. the sauce was light and nothing spectacular, albeit the scallops were seared perfectly. the seating was a bit awkward, as we were seated and a round table at the edge of the restaurant near one of the large points of view where you can look out into the city. i sat in a position where i was directly facing a couple who were seated directly facing me. no sir, i am not checking you out...you just happen to be where the view is. \n\nthe reason why i'm giving it 4 stars instead of 3? the boyfriend ordered from the  christmas menu, in which he chose a raw & cooked vegetable tart as an appetizer, beef <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> as an entree, and christmas log as the dessert for $95. the appetizer was very rich in truffle sauce. the entree, which was the star of the meal, consisted of shiitake gratin, pommes anna, and bordelaise sauce. the shiitake gratin was spectacular! i could eat them nonstop. the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> was also cooked to perfection, not too chewy. the christmas log was a standard small roll cake. i had the roasted pineapple dessert, which was a pineapple cake on the bottom, with roasted sliced pineapples on top, pineapple chips and sauce. it was delicious. at the end of the meal, one of the chefs walked by and offered freshly baked madeleines. best madeleine i've ever had in my life.  also, service was very attentive and courteous. :)\n\ni would consider coming back for a prix fixe menu, but only if i got a table with the view of the city. the view from the side of the restaurant outside is lovely as well (although too cold for winter, brr).\n\none last thing, as beautiful as the view in the bathroom is, the stalls were not up to par for an upscale restaurant. the white paint looked like it was coming off and there were no designs anywhere to be seen. it didn't seem elegant at all (after you see the view and walk to a stall, you'll see what i mean). there were also only three stalls.

            "so my gf and i were in vegas for the new years and we were dying to try <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> (which is illegal in ca) and a lot of people recommended to us mix. luckily, we were staying in mandalay bay so we just walked up to mix and went up to the elevator which took us to the 64th floor.\n\nfirst off, the lounge at mix is amazing! since mandalay is at the end of the strip, you get a full view of the strip and you can really appreciate the lights of vegas. additionally, the chairs are comfy and the heat lamps will keep you cozy.\n\nas for the restaurant, the decor is all white and very chic. you start out by walking through the open kitchen which is really cool. we were able to get a table next to the window, which made no difference since our backs were to the windows.\n\nas for the food:\n\nassorted bread with sea salt butter and peanut butter- 5/5- hey it's free bread, anything at this restaurant that is free is a 5/5 for me. xd\n\nfoies gras <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>- 5/5- for $60, i was pretty disappointed when the plate came out and there was a tiny piece of meat. however, this baby must be made from dehydrated food because it expands quickly in your stomach! the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> pretty much melts in your mouth and the flavor is really strong and decadent. i definitely, recommend this dish at mix.\n\nmash potatoes- 3/5- pretty plain. kind of tastes like instant mash potatoes to me...\n\n<mark>Creamy Spinach</mark>- 3/5- nothing out of the ordinary here.\n\nwagyu beef- 4/5- this baby just melts in your mouth. however, it's a little bit salty for my taste. luckily, the potatoes and carrots offset some of the saltiness.\n\noverall, the food is overpriced; however, the dishes are very flavorful here and the decor and view is top notch. if you're tired of the buffet scene, this is definitely, a worthy try.",

            "recommended by a friend to come here, i paid them a visit on my most recent vegas trip. have your cab driver drop you off at thehotel since the elevators to go up to the 64th floor where the restaurant is located is right when you walk in!\n\nthe minute that i stepped out of the elevator and approached the restaurant, i was taken back by the all white decorations. i love it! absolutely sleek and chic. we were seated by the window. it's kinda weird how they have it so that your backs are to the windows but no big complaints there. it was nice to enjoy our meal and when we occasionally turn around, we were able to take in the view.\n\nthey started us off with a bread basket that includes 2 kinds of butter: sea salt & peanut. now, i'm normally not a peanut butter fan but this was so good! it was creamy with a hint of sweetness. i would've been happy just eating bread with the peanut butter but wait! it doesn't stop here, it gets better!\n\ni ordered the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> rossini w/ <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and my date ordered the rib-eye with asparagus as a side. although i enjoyed the rib-eye, i believe the dish worth raving about is the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>! it came with mashed potatoes. the filet was tender and juicy at the same time. the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> just melts in your mouth and was so tasty! i couldn't get enough. prior to ordering we had ask the waitress for recommendations on red wine. she recommended the syrah which went extremely well with our steaks.\n\nour waitress was extremely soft spoken it was sometimes hard to hear her. i also felt the service was not as attentive as it could've been. the bus boy seems to be around our table more and was extremely friendly. i noticed he was conversing with other guests at other tables too. when he learned that we were on the trip for my birthday celebration, he got me a complimentary dessert which consisted of  sweet breads and nutella spread. so sweet of him! aside from that, we also ordered the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> which has coconut and lime sorbet. totally worth it!!! the chocolate was sweet while the coconut filled made it a little crunchy. perfect combination.\n\nafter our dinner experience we went to the lounge and wanted to step outside to snap some photos. since mandalay bay is all the way at the end of the strip, you are able to see the view of the whole strip from the lounge area. we were stopped and told that only those with bottle service could be outside. what? lame... \n\noverall, mix has given me such a good experience that i will be back next time and will tell my friends to give it a try!", 
            "i'll preface this review by disclosing that my wife and i had both our wedding ceremony and reception at mix.  on one hand, that may make me biased a bit in my love for this restaurant, but on the other hand, that also made me far more critical of the food, staff and service since we paid them the price of a small car to do an exclusive buy out on a saturday evening in vegas for a seven hour event.  \n\nso, that being said, here goes; saving food for last!  edit: looks like i have to trim my review, i hit the 5000 character limit. :-(\n\n1) ambience - if you like old fashioned or traditional decor in your dining venues, you will probably hate mix.  there is not a wood panel anywhere to be found, nor any green or blue carpeting.  the interior is many modern features with the centerpiece being the thousands of blown glass bulbs hanging from the ceiling around the two level dining area; the idea being to make it look like champagne bubbles rising.\n\nthe main seating area enjoys two story tall open windows with both views of the mountains and views of the strip.  if you're sitting inside, sunset is a perfect time to go because it looks simply incredible.  if you're sitting outside on their balcony, you'll only have a strip view because of where the balcony is located, but the view is still excellent at all times of day since you're 64 stories up looking north up the strip.  i recommend after dark for balcony seating.\n\n2) service - i've never had a bad experience at mix.  my wife and i visited vegas several times in advance of our wedding and dined at mix each time just to reassure ourselves that we had made the right decision.  we did not let them know in advance that we were coming to ensure we got to experience service as it normally is.  drinks are always full, they'll pick your napkin up and re-fold it if you get up to go to the bathroom, they check on your needs frequently, everyone is very congenial and outgoing.\n\nwe've been back numerous times since our wedding and yes, now we probably get extra service as many of the staff are still there and recognize us (it was a pretty memorable wedding), but they're really great folks.  i'm sure over the years as staff come and go we'll be a distant memory and service will go back to 'normal' but for the three years we've been back so far they've really made it special.\n\n3) special requests.  they've been very accommodating to us both for our wedding/reception and since then.  for example, on our first anniversary when we went back, i arranged with a cake bakery to make a small version of our wedding cake and deliver it to mix to surprise my wife after dinner.  the restaurant ensured someone was available to receive the cake that day and then they cut and served it for us.  if you're having a special occasion, talk to the staff and see if there's anything special you would want.\n\n4) food!  okay, the view sold me on this place to begin with, and fortunately, the food lived up to, and exceeded, expectations.  here's what we've had and when:\n\na) the <mark>Pepper Crusted Bison Tenderloin</mark>, <mark>Cod Brandade</mark> and roasted free range chicken (not always a menu option) were our wedding choices for guests.  the bison was awesome; many steak lovers who had never had bison remarked at how great the flavor was.  on the fish, we also had quite a few comments where significant others had shared their fish entree with someone who was not a fan of fish and they loved it, so that speaks for itself.\n\nb) surf & turf.  although it's not always on the menu, they'll do a filet and lobster if you ask.  my wife gets this religiously and loves it.  i will note that it is not as good as the surf & turf from n9ne at the palms.  there's regular surf & turf, then there's mix's surf & turf, then there's the n9ne surf & turf which is the best one in the universe.\n\nc) <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> rossini with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> & black truffle sauce.  if you're into truffles, i'm sure you'll love this.  the steak comes out perfectly.  i'm not a huge fan of the sauce so this is one of those love/hate meals for me.  perhaps ask to try the sauce before you order; not sure if that's possible.\n\nd) roasted maine lobster \"au curry\".  i love spicy, i love indian food, i love this meal.  it's my go-to mix meal; i get it every time once i tried it.  it's perfect combo of everything i love; lobster, spicy, curry, veggies, etc.\n\ndon't forget to go visit the mix lounge next door after dinner!  great place to relax and have a drink and cigar (on the balcony only of course).", 
            "huhfor starters, if you are terrified of heights do not use the main elevator, its has glass walls and you will poop your pants on the way up. \n\nthis is a review about the restaurant not bar. \n\ni made reservations for the bf birthday. no wait, even though the place was almost empty, it started to fill up at the end. anyways, the waitress was a little snobby but i got over that because i am use to that in san diego. i ordered the <mark>Maine Lobster Salad</mark> for starters and it was amazing!!! \n\nmain course, i had the fois gras, in which, i only brought because its illegal everywhere else, and i had the mac and cheese which tasted awful. the bf had the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> with fois gras that he really enjoyed but the mashed potatoes was a miss. \n\nso 2 stars for the ambiance. \nanother star for the sommelier they have walking around to help you pair the wine to your meal.\nand the last star for writing happy birthday in chocolate on my bfs dessert and the delicious cocktails.", 
            "perched atop the 64th floor of the majestic hotel at mandalay, mix boasts some of the best views of the south strip in vegas. once you set foot inside the lavish ivory themed dining room, you know you're in an alain ducasse restaurant. the space simply oozes the charm and elegance of his signature opulent style reminiscent of the dining room at the hotel plaza ath\\u00e9n\\u00e9e in paris.  the glitz and glamour of vegas is also quite apparent and you can't help but be dazzled by the contemporary and elegant atmosphere that envelops you.\n\nwith the beautiful weather i had been  experiencing over the weekend, i opted for patio seating with a direct view of the vegas strip below. \n\nafter glancing through the menu, i decided  to try chef ducasse's signature tasting menu with wine pairings.\n\nbreads came out soon after with a selection of focaccia, french baguette, dinner rolls and sourdough with unsalted and an interesting \"peanut\" butter. the breads were room temperature and butters were cold so spreading was not pleasant but the breads served their purpose of filling my gullet til the main courses arrived. \n\namuse\n\n<mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> royale with port reduction and mushroom foam \n\n- this enticing little number exhibited a pleasant airiness and irresistible aroma from the mushroom foam and the interesting mix of flavors and textures married well together lending a savory yet earthy element to this whimsically fascinating dish\n\ngnocci\nwith parmigiano reggiano, veal jus and sun chokes.\n\nnot the best gnocci i've ever had but satisfying nonetheless. this dish had an incredibly comforting feel to it. i especially enjoyed the contrasting textures from the light & crispy chips and tender enoki mushrooms served with the dish. warm, rustic yet subtle and familiar flavors were easy on my palate. \n\nmain lobster curry with coconut basmati rice \n\n- it's hard to go wrong with lobster, especially when you infuse thai flavors into a dish. the perfectly cooked lobster was bathed in a pool of curry and served stop luscious coconut rice. a delectable marriage of flavors.\n\n<mark>Filet Mignon</mark> rossini with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and black truffle sauce \n\n- this was easily my favorite dish of the night. the combination of <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and black truffle is like the holy trinity of fine dining.  the result will almost always result in endless drooling and licking the porcelain off your plate. \n\npredessert\n\ncoconut foam and mango rum cocktail. an exhilarating drink with bright notes and a sweet finish. excellent palate cleanser and a perfect way to prepare my taste buds for the sweet finale.\n\nbaba a la marnagnac\n\nunfortunately i wasn't as impressed with my dessert.\nthe liqueur for the cake was too strong and pungent while the flavors were just were too heavy handed. i may have myself to blame for that, as i may have given the cakes too heavy of a pour of the accompanying liqueur.\n\noverall, food was good but i must admit that i expected more from a multi michelin star chef like alain ducasse.  imo, the dishes lacked that wow factor that i was eagerly anticipating.  service was also on the clumsy and awkward side the night i dined, as well. for instance, my wine pairing for one of my dishes was completely forgotten until i reminded the sommelier. additionally, the wait staff seemed a bit hurried and rushed.  the furniture itself, which has probably seen better days, was in desperate need of an update, too. during my dinner one of my guests had to change their seat out because the chair was collapsing. for a restaurant of this caliber, i expected a bit more, at least chairs that weren't falling apart at the seams. \nwith that said, they changed the chair out without a hitch and there were some redeeming factors which included the stunning views, beautiful setting and expansive bar next door.  \n3.5 stars for now and hoping the restaurant makes some improvements on the menu, furniture, and service in the future.\n\nuntil then...\n\nhappy eats!",

            "a wonderful dinner experience at this beautiful restaurant! everything was perfect! we have been to the lounge before, it was fun, and the dining experience this time was even better! \n\nthe elevator to mix restaurant and lounge was scary, it was meant for dining people to see some amazing views on the way up, too bad i am scared of height. passed through mix lounge, lovely host girl let us choose a window booth or a bird nest booth, was it a bird nest? or half egg shell? either one i guess, i liked the bird nest, it was more private, comfy and fun.\n\nwe brought our own perrier jou\\u00cbt champagne, our server put it in the ice to cool it down. i ordered a raspberry lemon drop martini to sip on while we were looking through the menu, very clean and simple menu, i could tell every single item on the menu must be so good. and i was right, the dishes we tried were amazing! \n\nstarters: \ncomplimentary bread basket: assorted breads with butter and peanut butter, very delicious, loved the peanut butter! \n\nshrimp cocktail: non traditional shrimp cocktail, it was like a salad, jumbo shrimps were so fresh and tender, they tasted so good with the tomato sauce on the bottom, the sauce was so flavorful and delicious! \n\nbroccoli soup: clean flavor, with a hint of cheese in it, it was yummy. \n\nentrees:\nlobster curry: one of their signature dishes, our server's favorite, he said he didn't even like curry, neither am i, but the curry flavor was fantastic! it was not heavy, just rich and flavorful, small amount of coconut to add a hint of spice, tender lobster meat with exotic flavors, it was magical, i loved it so much! \n\n<mark>Filet Mignon</mark> with jalape\\u00f1o pepper: the first cut came out overcooked to medium, they changed another one for hubby, the second one was a perfect medium rare, bloody and juicy, exactly what hubby liked. the red wine sauce was so good, the jalape\\u00f1o was extremely spicy, server said it was from santa monica, most of them aren't spicy, guess hubby just got lucky to have a super spicy one on his plate, but both of us love spicy flavor, we didn't mind. hubby loved his steak so much. \n\nsaut\\u00e9ed mushrooms: with housemade creamy sauce, delicious mushrooms, the flavors were so strong. \n\nfrom appetizers to entrees, the food was amazing! the flavors were heavenly delicious! chef worked magical exotic flavors on each dish, how did he do that?! just wow!\n\ndrinks:\nour perrier champagne was so tasty, loved it, the raspberry lemon drop was strong and yummy, chef's complimentary coconut and passion fruit souffl\\u00e9 was very very tasty, i usually don't like coconut flavor, what happened that night, how did i come to like curry and coconut flavors? \n\nafter so much rich and flavorful food, i had no room for desert, the portions were big, both hubby and i got so full. chef made us mini cakes with hot fudge as a little treat, just to apologize for overcooking hubby's steak, they were yummy. hubby had double shot of espresso to finish this lovely dinner, i had the rest of the champagne by myself as usual. \n\ndefinitely one of the best dining experience i have ever had for a very long time! the restaurant was beautiful, the views were amazing, the food was spectacular, the service was flawless, it was just perfect! worth every penny of the $300 tab! the cork fee was $35. \n\nmix has just become one my favorite restaurants in vegas, along with comme ca and circo. i think i've just had my next vegas trip dinner dates lined up, that's awesome! \n\nps. the lounge next door offers champagne bottle service on the patio, it's a great place to enjoy the night views of las vegas while sipping on champagne, very romantic and relaxing.",

            "has dinner at mix tonight for our last meal in vegas. we decided to come a little early and check out the lounge, which opens at 5pm. there were families there partaking in hh and the gorgeous views from the 64th floor. we ordered a bottle of white wine, and enjoyed a glass overlooking the strip. the views are fabulous. the rest of our bottle was brought to our table. our waiter was from the big island of hawaii and he was very nice. he recommended several things. i typically ask the wait staff what their favorite items are the menu are. bread basket was yummy and diverse. we ordered: shrimp cocktail: 5 medium shrimp on a \"horseradish crust\" with some greens and cocktail sauce. was not impressed. couldnt taste the horseradish. when i asked for more horseradish, they didnt have any? is that weird if it was made with it? asked for lemons and tabasco; salad: greens came in a huge bowl w balsamic vinaigrette. bf liked it; chicken: loved the chicken. best chicken i have ever had. great crust. <mark>Braised Wagyu</mark>: amazingly tender. kind of like beef stew, but the sauce was reduced a bit more. it was awesome!; <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> dessert: good. tasted almost like a kit kat. homemade vanilla ice cream was good. they also gave us some fresh profiteroles that we dipped in melted chocolate. so yummy. decor and location was gorgeous, food was very good. service was top notch. will return!", 
            "time to update, i finally ate in the restaurant.  since i've basically declared the mandalay bay my second home (not by choice btw), i've come to know and love the fact that restaurant.com offers discounts to almost all of their restaurants.  it allows business people without an expense account, like myself, the opportunity to eat good food without feeling the urge to jump off the beautiful balcony when the check arrives.  so thanks restaurant.com!\n\nthe interior of the restaurant is stunning.  definitely worth the trip just to see it.  i would have been happy dining inside but we were escorted to a table outside so that we could enjoy the beautiful view.  nice!\n\nafter deciding against a cocktail...\n\n***sorry, i have to add a side note here.  mix, update your cocktail menu!  the cocktails on the list are reminiscent of sex and the city circa 1994!***\n\nwe decided to check out the wine list.  if you're not dining at mix for a special occasion, you can get away with a $50 bottle.  it won't be great, but hey, when you've been working for 12 hours, who cares.  we settled on an unmemorable bottle of white.  \n\nwe started with the 1/2 portion of <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>.  it was gigantic.  i kept wondering if they brought the full order because it was so big.  definitely large enough for 2.  it was amazing.  \n\nfor the main course, i chose the <mark>Braised Wagyu</mark> en cocotte.  it was phenomenal.  the most tender and delicious meat that i've had since i can remember.  i don't think i even needed a knife.  i would comment on what my friend ordered but who the heck knows.  i don't think i even looked up from my meal to see.  it was that good.\n\nat the end of the meal we were stuffed.  i don't think i was able to finish my main course but there's always room for ice cream.  we went with the homemade ice creams and sorbets - coco lime, buttermilk and butter pecan.  worth every calorie.\n\nto top things off, our server was cool and very professional.  he took great care of us.  it was a great way to end the work day.  i loved it!", 
            "came here with my boyfriend to experience the best view in las vegas. located at the top of mandalay bay, it definitely has one of the most amazing views i've seen in vegas. i was most impressed with the decor of the lounge and the ambiance was pretty laid back even though it seemed classy. the food was fantastic, must try the <mark>Braised Wagyu</mark>, it literally falls apart with your fork, amazing! the only thing that was disappointing was the seating we thought we made reservations for. we hoped to get patio seating with our reservation but they denied our request. but still a good view and i'd still recommend checking it out.", 
            "this review is for the restaurant. \nmy husband and i came here for our 5 year anniversary dinner tonight. i did my research and thought this would be a good place to go. the food was wonderful. we had, for starters, the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> (half order), <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> (half order), and <mark>Maine Lobster Salad</mark>. for our entrees we had the <mark>Braised Wagyu</mark> and <mark>Cod Brandade</mark>. both were very tasty. for my dessert i had the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> w/ caramel ice cream. \nmy gripes with this restaurant was that we were seated on a round table between two square tables. it was awkwardly situated and did not make for a very comfortable meal. at least we were seated by a window with a pretty nice view. my next gripe is with the waiter (big caucasian blond guy) who talked and laughed with the tables next to us and made no effort with the two of us. i wonder if it's because we didn't order a bottle of wine. i forgot my zantac, so i didn't think drinking wine would be wise. my husband ordered a mojito and he totally forgot about it prompting us to have to remind him and when he wanted a second drink, we had to ask the busboy (sorry, i don't know what to call him). by the way, the busboy and the buslady were nice and friendly. my husband wanted to give the waiter a bad tip, but i convinced him against it because i wanted the other helpful staff to get what they deserved. we tipped the usual 18% even though the waiter clearly didn't deserve it. with the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and wagyu we weren't sure what we were supposed to eat it with. a good waiter would have made suggestions for sides to improve the enjoyment of our meal. \nso the verdict: the food was great, but the experience was lacking considering the amount of money we spent, $200+.\ni've been to many amazing restaurants, including french laundry, jar, lucques, osteria mozza, etc... this was by far the worst experience i've ever had at a fine dining establishment.", 
            "great service! spectacular view! good food!\nhad the ribeye, lobster au curry, mac n cheese,  too bad no room for dessert. \nribeye(med-rare)- perfectly pan seared\nlobster au curry- party in my mouth, delicious.\nmac n' cheese- way too cheesy! consisitancy made it seem like they melted some cheese in heavy whipping cream, but went cheap on the quality ofcheese, the bits of ham were just weird.\ndrinks- green tea, surpisingly served at the right temperature and loose leaf, no tea bags here, wait staff even told me to wait a few minutes for it to properly steep (brownie points), & seirra nevada, nice pairing with  steak for non vinophiles.\n2nd visit still 5 stars. this time it was a toss up between lamb and <mark>Braised Wagyu</mark>. i got the wagyu on waiters suggestion, it tasted like pot roast, oh well. steak was again perfect. i finally got to try the lemon verbana tea, excellent. the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> itself tasted like a freshly made kit kat, mixed with the lime sorbet, it becomes that perfect nye kiss. service was on point.", 
            "this place was the start to an amazing birthday weekend extravaganza!  on saturday night, we came here to enjoy the dining experience, as my friends had a gift certificate from restaurant.com.  \n\nthe experience started when you walked into the elevator.  this restaurant is at the top floor of mandalay bay and only accessible by elevator with glass walls looking over the strip and airport as you ascend.  we walked through the bar area and found the podium hidden around the corner.  we were originally sat at a round table next to a big pillar opposite of everyone else in the restaurant, so we asked to move to a table with a view.  they did have a sense of urgency in moving us, however, ended up putting us further to the back of the restaurant by window with a view of nothing!  not to be particular, but it was my birthday, so my friend asked the server to move us again with a view of the strip.  we were then taken outside on the last table in the back. our view was of the airport (meh...) and the hostess walked away and grabbed a server and whispered something to him. this hostess was a lady with greasy mullet with a very \"stand off-ish\" vibe.  no bueno.   aside from this, here's what we got:\n\ni got the rack of colorado lamb for $39.  it was cooked medium and perfect!  served with eggplant and lamb au jus.  the flavors meshed well together.  light, yet savory.  my friends had the <mark>Braised Wagyu</mark> (for $34) served in a small pot, with a flavorful gravy and veggies.  the wagyu was fork tender and ah-maze-ing!  my other friends had the venison and the ribeye.  although i didn't try it, they seemed to enjoy the meal as well.  we also ordered three side dishes: 2 mac and cheese and <mark>French Fries</mark>.  the fries were crispy and nicely seasoned, however the mac and cheese, serve <mark>Macaroni & Cheese with Ham</mark>, was \"on point!\"  so cheesy, so flavorful, so good!!  all in all, i'd say the food was 5 star all the way!\n\nmix is a wonderful place to dine on a super special occasion, like my birthday (lol).  at the end of the day, i was thoroughly impressed with the potential this place has on the typical dining experience.  for our party, it seemed that the service fell short in a couple of places.  our actual server, however, was very nice and engaging so i left i happy camper!", 
            "i have dined at mix many times with a friend of mine and loved it, so we suggested it for our mutual friend's birthday extravaganza. the evening did not start out as intended. first, you have to go on a scavenger hunt to find the hostess podium, why they hide it is beyond me as it makes perfect sense to have it out front and visible. after we checked in, we were seated in the middle of the dining room. every other diner in the restaurant was seated with a view of the strip so we thought that was a little odd. sure, we are young, but we were going to spend plenty of money considering the price of the entrees! so we asked to be reseated, since it was my friend's birthday we were hoping for a seat with a view, i mean that is the allure of mix. we were immediately seated in a corner in front of the hostess podium, with a view of the southwest, ummm ok? so we asked if we could sit outside instead. the hostess begrudgingly lead us outside and sat us in the far corner of the balcony, with a beautiful view of the airport. this seemed very passive aggressive to me and that belief was validated as she whispered into our waiters ear for a good few minutes, not even trying to hide the fact that she was clearly talking about us. we seriously almost got up and left, as there are plenty of other fabulous dining options in mandalay bay. now, i agree that we may have been a pain, but the restaurant was nearly empty and there were plenty of tables open on the balcony the entire time we dined, so it was not like the place was packed and we were demanding a specific seat. also, the strip celebrated earth hour, so it was really cool to see all the lights go out on the strip, of course we had to stand and peer over the railing since we were still in a corner, but we definitely enjoyed the view. overall, this was really a sour start to what was supposed to be a fun evening.\n\nthe food at mix never disappoints and it shouldn't for the price. you always start out with a selection of fresh baked breads, so many delicious choices it's hard not to fill up. i always get the <mark>Braised Wagyu</mark> beef and i am always happy with it. it is served in a cute little pot with a delicious braising sauce, carrots, mushrooms, and pearl onions. it is fork tender and a nice size for the price. i shared a bite with everyone and they were all very jealous! i also tried a bite of my husband's ribeye and my friend's venison, which were both delicious. we always get a side of mac and <mark>Macaroni & Cheese with Ham</mark>, which is always a creamy and delicious winner. we tried the fries as well, they had a weird seasoning on them, but worked when i dipped them in the wagyu gravy. they also serve a complimentary madeleine pastry at the end of the meal, which is lemony and delicious. i definitely appreciated that they brought them out with a happy birthday plate and a side of nutella for our friend, it was the least they could do after how we were initially treated. \n\noverall, i love mix, but will think twice after this debacle. they have a fabulous view and fantastic food, but nobody likes a pretentious and unfriendly start to their meal. our evening would have been 100% better if it had started with a smile and a warm greeting, nobody likes to feel like a pain, change the attitude mix and you will have a packed house every night. it seriously pains me to give you 3 stars since i truly believe that the food is 4 star, but i can't ignore how we were treated.", 
            "stayed at thehotel. we used the same elevator as our hotel room to head up to this place on the top floor. the decor is great and plus the big panoramic views just rounds off the great atmosphere they have going here. they have an open kitchen which you can see all of the stress that goes on trying to keep everything going well in a nice restaurant like this. \n\nwe started with the <mark>Charcuterie Sampler</mark> that had these nice italian hams and sausages cut thin. this dish paired well with my new castle beer!\n\nthen i had the <mark>Cod Brandade</mark> that was cooked perfectly; the fried parsley added great texture. one of the best cod dishes i have ever tasted. my girlfriend had the seared tuna that was perfectly seared, that dish was very good too. and through out our party i had the chance to taste a few other items that were all very good. like the <mark>Braised Wagyu</mark> that just melted in your mouth, mac and cheese w/ham was creamy and salty (in a good way) from the ham, wild mushrooms had a nice gravy, and  the john dory (fish) had huge flavors in a light dish. \n\nand in the end we had a great chocolate souffle; one if the top 5 i've ever tasted!!\n\nmy bill was around $240.00 that included one starter, three main courses, two sides and one chocolate souffle in the end. i had three beers and the two girls had only water. it was all worth it. \n\ni gave it four star because our waiter had this dry humor that just doesn't come across well when you are pay top dollar for a great dinning experience. \n\nbut i'll be back...",

            "the <mark>Braised Wagyu</mark> was amazing!!! also tried some baked halibut that made it's way around the table and thought it was pretty good as well, but the wagyu took the cake hands down! will definitely come back here at night to have a drink and check out the lounge next time.", 
            "mix was amazing. the food is mouthwatering and the service was impeccable. the view at the top of mandalay bay was gorgeous. we have never have tastes such tender lamb and both types of beef were nice and tender with the perfect amount. it was nice that they had a bar area with a large outside balcony where you can probably rent out and have a private party there. the main dining was was beautiful. it is the perfect place for a special date or even a small dinner party. it is probably not the place to host a large loud group of friends for a fancy dinner.\n\nwe ordered:\n-<mark>Filet Mignon</mark> rossini\n-<mark>Braised Wagyu</mark>\n-colorado rack of lamb (bone out)\n-<mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> (as appetiser)\n\nthe only con about mix is that it's kind of hard to find, at least it was for us.", 
            "in a word: phenomenal!\n\nin the pretense of celebrating a birthday/anniversary, we went to the top of thehotel at mandalay bay to have dinner at mix; it was a fantastic decision!  the ambiance was perfect for the evening with balcony seating with the cool evening air venturing in.\n\nthe food, although on the pricey side, was exquisite.  i had the <mark>Braised Wagyu</mark> which was tender and flavorful as can be!\n\nour server, randy, was superb!  he was very knowledgeable of the menu and his charisma definitely added to the evening.  the service even brought out fresh madeleines decorated for our special occasion.\n\nbottom line: we will definitely be visiting this establishment again and will make sure to venture also into the lounge area next time."

            "food 5 stars: \n\ncomplimentary bread basket- the bread basket included foccacia, fruit and nut bread, wheat bread, and baguette. the fruit and nut bread is the best piece of bread i have ever tasted. it was very moist, warm, and absolutely delicious. it wasn't too sweet or to oily, it was so good that we got seconds. the focaccia bread wasn't that special and tasted a little strange to me. \n\ncomplimentary <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>- we all got a small tasting of <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and it was pretty good. i only ate a bite though, because the feeling of goose liver haunts me. \n\n1. surf and turf (lobster and chicken) $38 - this is what i called surf and turf. i love how they use chicken instead of beef, much healthier. i usually eat chicken and lobster every other day, so my palate was designed to taste this dish. the chicken was awesome, and it was stuffed with spinach. it was soft moist and not oily. the stuffing was beautifully placed inside the chicken. the lobster was pretty decent, but not the best i have tasted. the portion size for this dish was very generous and filling. \n\n2. seared scallops $38- there were only three scallops on the plate, but what can you expect. i have learned to ask the server how many scallops before ordering them, because the usual is 2-4. the scallops were cooked very properly and were very tender. the only complaint is the portion size, because the other two parties had to fill up on the bread. \n\n3. creamed spinach $9- ordered with less cream. i didn't ask how it tasted like, but it looked like he enjoyed it.\n\n4. <mark>Sauteed Green Asparagus</mark> $9- a moment of heaven with vegetables. my mom usually cooks some of the best vegetables in the world, so i love to eat vegetables, but at the same time i hate flavorless vegetables. it was the best couple of asparagus spears i have ever tasted. it was so soft, moist, and full of flavor. absolutely amazing. it is a must order sied to go with the meal.\n\ncomplimentary dessert- the chef never lets you leave without something sweet. we were offered each one madeline with a chocolate dipping sauce and it was wonderful. the perfect way to end a meal without stuffing yourself. \n\nservice 5 stars: \n\nour waiter was kind and polite even when we wanted to change tables. he always refilled on beverages whenever needed, and didn't stand over us like a school teacher. we were surprised that out entrees arrived so quickly ( i wasn't even finished with my first loaf of bread), because it was a busy night. \n\natmosphere 5 stars: \n\ni took so many pictures that night! the atmosphere was fantastic. there were like glass bubbles that hung down from the rood, the restaurant was pearl white, and there was a beautiful staircase in the center of the restaurant. there are tables for business groups as well as a cozy date. just beautiful!",

            "went here to celebrate a bachelor party before going out for the evening.  the elevator trip up is a perfect introduction to the experience. the decor and the views are amazing. you come here for that, rather than the food. not the the food is bad, it's just pretty expensive. apps are around $30 and entrees are in the $50 range.\n\nthe lounge doesn't charge cover before 10, so you get some of a trailer park crowd before then. \n\nas usual the dishes are rated 1 - 10, 10 being amazing.\n\n$12 chivas\ngood pour and quick service\n\n$0 bread basket (6)\nnice variety, warm and fresh. comes <mark>Macaroni & Cheese with Ham</mark> butter and peanut butter. the peanut butter just doesn't work.\n\n$33 <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, apple (6)\nif you like <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, this was a decent choice. my friend had never tried <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and liked it. nice thick cut.\n\n$28 gnocchi, morels (8)\ni was pleaantly surprised by this dish. i heard it was bland. i thought it was great.\n\n$52 <mark>Pepper Crusted Bison Tenderloin</mark> (4)\nnothing special, such a straight-forward steak with a peppercorn sauce.\n\n$75 beef tenderloin, <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, truffle (5)\none of the special of the night. basic preparation with expensive ingredients. it was decent.\n\n$44 seared tuna, carrot (4)\nnothing special. i wouldn't order this dish. it's just seared tuna.\n\n$51 rack of lamb (5)\nthe lamb was prepared well, but again nothing special and very straight-forward for $50.\n\n$59 beef tenderloin (4)\nnot sure how they priced this one. same story, good straight-forward dish, but you're really paying for the decor.\n\n$55 halibut, <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, truffle (5)\nthis was my pick. the halibut was ok, a little bland, but was made up by the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and truffle sauce. \n\n$12 elbow pasta, guyere, ham (6)\nit's hard to go wrong with this dish. it was good, but i don't go to a nice restaurant to get mac 'n' cheese.\n\n$12 forked potatoes (3)\njust plain expensive for potatoes and butter. not that good.\n\n$77 the cake (3)\nthe didn't make the cake, but to cut it and throw some ice cream on each slice, they charged $7 a person.\n\nthe service was great and very attentive and friendly. as it should be for the large group  20%. \n\noverall, good place to celebrate a special occasion and hang out at the lounge afterwards. but, there are better places in a vegas for the food, especially at these costs.", 
            "the high ceilings, white decor with imitation crystal cascade and plus absolutely amazing view of vegas makes this place a super romantic spot. although we were not big fans of the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> with rhubarb sauce we were nevertheless impressed by the size of it. my <mark>Roasted Duck Breast</mark> was tender and juicy. the drink that i ordered a mix of champagne and vodka gave me a fast buzz. absolutely recommend the drink if you are willing to cope <mark>Macaroni & Cheese with Ham</mark> it gives next morning. \nthe ladies room again wowed me with decor as it had hint to futurism. if you dined at mix they will waive cover charge for the lounge area with another fantastic view.", 
            "lets start this review with the amazing views of the strip, there are several tables you can sit at and marvel at the twinkling lights of the strip, and bonus seats right at the outside of the bar to sippy sip your cocktails at. \nand, if you do happen to  visit this great find, def, def, def seek out the bathrooms located at the end of the bar area. they are pretty damn dark but how awesome is it when you sit on the toilet and find yourself  facing the outside of the of the hotel (ie full length glass wall) you could possibly sit on the toilet for days just looking out over las vegas if it werent for the perma lines youd get on your derieree!\nhmmm....\nwhat? oh yeah, the food. :-)\n-tell me,,, what restaurant starts you out with a bread basket full of 5 different types of bread and serves not only butter but crunchy peanut butter spread to go along with your bread???!!! soo good!\n-<mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> !!! yummmmmmm, even with the potato chips that come along for the added crunchy-nessss....\n-lobster ceasar salad (dressing on the side) was sooo good. im not usually a fan of ceasar salad, but anything with huge chunks of lobster, will make my palate do summersaults!!\n-mac 'n chesse <mark>Macaroni & Cheese with Ham</mark> (hello) southern delight! the perfect blend of cheese,cream, and crunchy toppings!\n-last but not certainly least..........ta da chocolate souffle with pistachio ice cream. more likely than not, i will usually go with a creme brulee, but who can resist a warm, crunchy chocolate on top, gooey rich, velvety yummness on the inside spectacular of a dessert!!!! ohh mmyyy ggaawwddd!!!", 
            "satc vibe with a killer view of the strip.  \n\nskip the <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark>.  \ni sampled the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> appetizer with relish.  \nthen came my entree - the rossini <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> topped with truffles and another generous heap of <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>.  needless to say, it was super savory, truffley, <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> overkill.  and i mean that in the best possible way~  \n\nthe side mac and <mark>Macaroni & Cheese with Ham</mark> was good, not great. it tasted like something i could easily whip up at home.  \n\nsince we were dressed up to the nines, the host was gracious enough to comp us 2 rounds of cocktails at the lounge, but the lounge was pretty dead.", 
            "this is for the restaurant, and not the club:\n\nfive stars for the atmosphere, 5 for the view, 5 for service, but only 2 for the food itself.\n\nriding up the secret elevator to the top floor of the mandalay bay was by far the highlight of this experience.  the glass elevator propels you high up to the 44th floor, where you have a panoramic view of the strip. \n\nhttp://images.travelpod.com/tw_slides/ta00/a62/d2e/view-from-mix-top-of-mandalay-bay-west-bristol.jpg\n(i did not take this picture)\n\nthe <mark>Boneless Ribeye</mark> with black peppercorn was not visually appealing, but its flavor wasn't too bad.  mix's downfall were their side dishes. the wild mushroom fricasee was limp and unflavorful.  the fork crushed potatoes tasted starchy and bland. and for something that they're supposed to be \"famous\" for, the mix macaroni  and <mark>Macaroni & Cheese with Ham</mark> is to be avoided at all costs, unless you feel like shelling out $9 for easy-mac with chunks of oscar meyer ham slices.\n\nservice was impeccable though.  we were in a rush after dinner, but our server insisted on complimentary dessert for our entire party.  i'd definitely return here, but merely for the view/bar/drinks.", 
            "wow, amazing view, exceptional service (randy is an outstanding waiter!) food was amazing. i had the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, which i have to say is probably in the top 3 i've ever eaten. the mac & <mark>Macaroni & Cheese with Ham</mark> is delicious as a side. my wife had the halibut, which was very good and quite light (she didn't want to stuff herself). definitely coming back and recommending to everyone.", 
            "2.5 stars. i would give it 3 for food, but the experience was just horrendous, i couldn't bring myself to give it 3. \n\ni heard nothing but good things about mix. so when we were going to magic, i knew i had to make our team dinner at mix. their view is incredible, the restaurant is cute/modern, and it's definitely trendy. \n\nthe one thing that i have to complain about is the service. it's god awful. they are so slow i can't stand it. we waited over an hour for our food to come out. my boss complained to the manager, and they just comped a bottle of wine, without very much regard or apology. for a michelin rated restaurant, this is a big no no. the waiter didn't even acknowledge that our food was going to be late, or offer any explanation as to why it took so long. \n\nok, now that i got my rant aside, i'll move onto the food/drinks\n\ni stuck to the skinny girl margaritas, and they were just ok. it wasn't mixed very well (alcohol was at the way bottom), and it wasn't something i wanted to devour immediately. \n\nfor appetizers, we got the  macaroni and <mark>Macaroni & Cheese with Ham</mark> and lobster casesar salad. the salad was fresh, and tasty. the mac and cheese? not so much. it was runny, and just not good. no cheesy goodness there. you can skip that.\n\nfor entrees, i got he <mark>Pepper Crusted Bison Tenderloin</mark> with glazed vegetables and black pepper sauce. the meat was cooked very well, medium rare, super soft, but that pepper crusted part was so peppery that it was overpowering. all i could taste was the pepper, and it definitely took away from the entree. as for sides, we got the <mark>Creamy Spinach</mark> and the fork crushed potatoes. sides were good, but nothing to die over. \n\nat this point, our meal was getting to be so long i wanted it to be over (we were approaching hour 3). but they gave us homemade madelines and chocolate, and this passion fruit \"drink\" served in a martini glass with foam. just too much dessert that i didn't even want. we quickly tried that, and asked for the bill. my boss paid for it, so i can't tell you exactly how much it was, but 6 people was about $500.", 
            "this place was the start to an amazing birthday weekend extravaganza!  on saturday night, we came here to enjoy the dining experience, as my friends had a gift certificate from restaurant.com.  \n\nthe experience started when you walked into the elevator.  this restaurant is at the top floor of mandalay bay and only accessible by elevator with glass walls looking over the strip and airport as you ascend.  we walked through the bar area and found the podium hidden around the corner.  we were originally sat at a round table next to a big pillar opposite of everyone else in the restaurant, so we asked to move to a table with a view.  they did have a sense of urgency in moving us, however, ended up putting us further to the back of the restaurant by window with a view of nothing!  not to be particular, but it was my birthday, so my friend asked the server to move us again with a view of the strip.  we were then taken outside on the last table in the back. our view was of the airport (meh...) and the hostess walked away and grabbed a server and whispered something to him. this hostess was a lady with greasy mullet with a very \"stand off-ish\" vibe.  no bueno.   aside from this, here's what we got:\n\ni got the rack of colorado lamb for $39.  it was cooked medium and perfect!  served with eggplant and lamb au jus.  the flavors meshed well together.  light, yet savory.  my friends had the <mark>Braised Wagyu</mark> (for $34) served in a small pot, with a flavorful gravy and veggies.  the wagyu was fork tender and ah-maze-ing!  my other friends had the venison and the ribeye.  although i didn't try it, they seemed to enjoy the meal as well.  we also ordered three side dishes: 2 mac and cheese and <mark>French Fries</mark>.  the fries were crispy and nicely seasoned, however the mac and cheese, serve <mark>Macaroni & Cheese with Ham</mark>, was \"on point!\"  so cheesy, so flavorful, so good!!  all in all, i'd say the food was 5 star all the way!\n\nmix is a wonderful place to dine on a super special occasion, like my birthday (lol).  at the end of the day, i was thoroughly impressed with the potential this place has on the typical dining experience.  for our party, it seemed that the service fell short in a couple of places.  our actual server, however, was very nice and engaging so i left i happy camper!", 
            "i have dined at mix many times with a friend of mine and loved it, so we suggested it for our mutual friend's birthday extravaganza. the evening did not start out as intended. first, you have to go on a scavenger hunt to find the hostess podium, why they hide it is beyond me as it makes perfect sense to have it out front and visible. after we checked in, we were seated in the middle of the dining room. every other diner in the restaurant was seated with a view of the strip so we thought that was a little odd. sure, we are young, but we were going to spend plenty of money considering the price of the entrees! so we asked to be reseated, since it was my friend's birthday we were hoping for a seat with a view, i mean that is the allure of mix. we were immediately seated in a corner in front of the hostess podium, with a view of the southwest, ummm ok? so we asked if we could sit outside instead. the hostess begrudgingly lead us outside and sat us in the far corner of the balcony, with a beautiful view of the airport. this seemed very passive aggressive to me and that belief was validated as she whispered into our waiters ear for a good few minutes, not even trying to hide the fact that she was clearly talking about us. we seriously almost got up and left, as there are plenty of other fabulous dining options in mandalay bay. now, i agree that we may have been a pain, but the restaurant was nearly empty and there were plenty of tables open on the balcony the entire time we dined, so it was not like the place was packed and we were demanding a specific seat. also, the strip celebrated earth hour, so it was really cool to see all the lights go out on the strip, of course we had to stand and peer over the railing since we were still in a corner, but we definitely enjoyed the view. overall, this was really a sour start to what was supposed to be a fun evening.\n\nthe food at mix never disappoints and it shouldn't for the price. you always start out with a selection of fresh baked breads, so many delicious choices it's hard not to fill up. i always get the <mark>Braised Wagyu</mark> beef and i am always happy with it. it is served in a cute little pot with a delicious braising sauce, carrots, mushrooms, and pearl onions. it is fork tender and a nice size for the price. i shared a bite with everyone and they were all very jealous! i also tried a bite of my husband's ribeye and my friend's venison, which were both delicious. we always get a side of mac and <mark>Macaroni & Cheese with Ham</mark>, which is always a creamy and delicious winner. we tried the fries as well, they had a weird seasoning on them, but worked when i dipped them in the wagyu gravy. they also serve a complimentary madeleine pastry at the end of the meal, which is lemony and delicious. i definitely appreciated that they brought them out with a happy birthday plate and a side of nutella for our friend, it was the least they could do after how we were initially treated. \n\noverall, i love mix, but will think twice after this debacle. they have a fabulous view and fantastic food, but nobody likes a pretentious and unfriendly start to their meal. our evening would have been 100% better if it had started with a smile and a warm greeting, nobody likes to feel like a pain, change the attitude mix and you will have a packed house every night. it seriously pains me to give you 3 stars since i truly believe that the food is 4 star, but i can't ignore how we were treated.", 
            "just ate at mix last friday night and enjoyed it immensely. as soon as you walk in you're transported into an ethereal dining experience. the decor makes you feel like you're walking on air and the views of the strip are amazing. we are the family that doesn't let the fact that we have a child hold us back from dining where we want to on vacation. she's well-behaved and she's 9 but nevertheless, some places frown upon children and we never got that impression at all. the staff treated her exactly how we want her to be treated in a restaurant, in such a way that helps give her a chance to use her manners - they asked her for her order, not me or my husband, and treated her like any other diner. we were a bit nervous when an elderly couple sat next to us as we didn't know how they'd feel about being seated next to a family, but later on in the meal the woman told us she was completely full and asked if we minded if she offered for our daughter to try her souffle. \n\nto start, our family was served the thai coconut chicken soup which was very good. i started with the shrimp cocktail which was absolutely delicious. i could have been done right there. finished it off with the maine lobster curry which i loved. my husband had the tasting menu and was in heaven. my daughter had the macaroni & <mark>Macaroni & Cheese with Ham</mark> side and that was perfect for her. our waitress was lovely and we felt the perfect amount of attention and timing. we had everything exactly when we needed it. a truly lovely dining experience."

            "this place was the start to an amazing birthday weekend extravaganza!  on saturday night, we came here to enjoy the dining experience, as my friends had a gift certificate from restaurant.com.  \n\nthe experience started when you walked into the elevator.  this restaurant is at the top floor of mandalay bay and only accessible by elevator with glass walls looking over the strip and airport as you ascend.  we walked through the bar area and found the podium hidden around the corner.  we were originally sat at a round table next to a big pillar opposite of everyone else in the restaurant, so we asked to move to a table with a view.  they did have a sense of urgency in moving us, however, ended up putting us further to the back of the restaurant by window with a view of nothing!  not to be particular, but it was my birthday, so my friend asked the server to move us again with a view of the strip.  we were then taken outside on the last table in the back. our view was of the airport (meh...) and the hostess walked away and grabbed a server and whispered something to him. this hostess was a lady with greasy mullet with a very \"stand off-ish\" vibe.  no bueno.   aside from this, here's what we got:\n\ni got the rack of colorado lamb for $39.  it was cooked medium and perfect!  served with eggplant and lamb au jus.  the flavors meshed well together.  light, yet savory.  my friends had the <mark>Braised Wagyu</mark> (for $34) served in a small pot, with a flavorful gravy and veggies.  the wagyu was fork tender and ah-maze-ing!  my other friends had the venison and the ribeye.  although i didn't try it, they seemed to enjoy the meal as well.  we also ordered three side dishes: 2 mac and cheese and <mark>French Fries</mark>.  the fries were crispy and nicely seasoned, however the mac and cheese, serve <mark>Macaroni & Cheese with Ham</mark>, was \"on point!\"  so cheesy, so flavorful, so good!!  all in all, i'd say the food was 5 star all the way!\n\nmix is a wonderful place to dine on a super special occasion, like my birthday (lol).  at the end of the day, i was thoroughly impressed with the potential this place has on the typical dining experience.  for our party, it seemed that the service fell short in a couple of places.  our actual server, however, was very nice and engaging so i left i happy camper!", 
            "dinner with client:\nwent here with a friend of mine who happens to be a client as well as his colleagues.  the service was great in seating all 10 of us in the middle of the restaurant so we could get a feel of the atmosphere, rather than be on the side lines. \n\ni enjoyed the <mark>New York Strip</mark> and went big with eh sides with mac and cheese and <mark>French Fries</mark>.  not to take away from the perfectly cooked steak, but their mac and cheese was amazing, i use theirs as my benchmark now.  fries can be messed up, but they did them well.\n\nnightcap atmosphere:\nwe ended the night with some drinks overlooking the strip in a non-stuffy and mellow atmosphere.  i would recommend this place over the foundation room.  \n\nonly con i can think of (splitting hairs here)\nonly downside can be if you are sat by a group of cigar smokers in the outdoor lounge.  the smoke gets trapped there due to the winds that wrap around high rises, so the open air lounge does not help air out the place.  don't get me wrong, i enjoy smoking cigars once in awhile, but it is not pleasant if you are not indulging and are left with the second hand smoke (sorry i am from california and probably sound like a hypocrite to most readers).", 
            "alex gregoire is an amazing chef. and i can now say a true frenchman has made me <mark>French Fries</mark>! he brought us almost everything on the menu and i can't remember the french names but it was a taste adventure."

            "mix is my favorite spot in vegas. mix restaurant has a great atmosphere but the food is just ok for the price. (<mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> excellent; fliet decent). mix lounge is a great place to hangout. the view (top of the south end of the strip looking north) is the best on or off the strip. i had assumed that the luxor would block its view but that's totally not the case. there's an outdoor section divided up between general balcony and bottle service. i recommend the bottle service, not as pricey as a real club and more breathing room. and the waitresses are more attentive than other places. not that the rest of the lounge is super crowded.", 
            "i had the grand tasting menu, one of my dining companions had the lower leveled tasting menu and another one of us just ordered regular appetizer and main course dishes. we all ended up sharing everything which gave a great tasting of everything. both tasting menus had hits and misses. the most memorable dishes of the night were the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, cod, <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> and lobster (in that order). we had a side of mac and cheese that was delish! and the floating island dessert was light and a very appropriate ending to a decadent meal. with the decor and the view.. the totality of this restaurant experience was greater than sum of its parts.", 
            "atmosphere-\n\n* on the 64th floor, so no smoke from the casino.  the restaurant was non smoking.  that said, the bar was either smoking or non-smoking was not enforced.  at certain tables it may not truly be non smoking.  not sure about this.  \n\n* on the 64th floor, the best view of vegas\n\n* 15,000 glass ball chandelier, really cool.\n\n* we got sat next to the balcony.  one reviewer noted how hot it was outside; today it was ~50 f and ~6 tables near the balcony froze every time the door opened (which was a lot!).  this could easily be you, so be warned.  you might also sweat every time the door opens, depending on time of year.  \n\n\nservice\n\n* they showed a cheap tasting menu downstairs.  when we got upstairs, they said they didn't have it.  not cool\n\n* the waiters were very fast and attentive without being intrusive.  entire staff, from waiters to busboys were really fast.  our appetizers were out in record time.  terrific service.\n\nfood\n\n* kind of expensive\n\n* very good.  had the lobster, beef/<mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>, and gnocchi plus the mix candy for dessert.\n\n\noverall: go for the view.  service is great.  food is very good but $$.  would give this a 4.5 star on food and service alone.  but the other stuff lower the rating. don't trust them when they offer cheap tasting menus.    the quality of your experience may vary depending on where you get seated - and not because of the view but because of the temperature and the cigarette smoke.", 
            "mix restaurant in the \"the hotel\", i know, i know, it's a confusing name has great foods and food to boot.\n\nfrench cuisine that was spot on.  the decor of mix immediately makes your eye wander.  with lots of white, glass bubbles floating in the air, high vaulted ceiling, and a great view you can't go wrong coming here.  \ni had the filet with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and black truffles which was cooked to a perfect medium rare.  the <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> my friend and another bud had the chicken both didn't have mix reviews about their dishes.  service was good except they cleared a few plates before we were done.  besides that everything was great.\n\nafter you stuff yourself head over to mix lounge to enjoy the view, grab a few drinks, and save on the $25 cover after 10 as your are already up there.", 
            "this restaurant is located on top of thehotel at mandalay bay and has one of best views in the city, imo. the decor is modern and has a really awesome glass chandelier that looks like a waterfall of bubbles. servers were very attentive and helpful. the food is pricey, but super fancy and well-thought-out.  i ordered the veggie terrine, which name alone, doesn't really sound great, but in actuality was totally fan-f*cking-tastic! the <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> was also delish. for dessert we split the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark>. omg. it's the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> of your wildest dreams.", 
            "i had had enough of watching the creation of impressive high-end dishes on top chef with relentless envy.  never could i taste and enjoy.  my frustration led me to the need to be wined and dined at an amazing restaurant.  fellow yelpers led me here: to mix restaurant.\n\nmy bf and i headed over to mandalay bay and started with some confusion as to the location of the restaurant.  after some inquires and a long walk, we found it!  well we found mix lounge and walked through the dark area into the light.  i would describe this restaurant with its hanging clear globes and immaculately white decor as trendy.  on a busy friday night with a 9pm reservation, the dining room was a bit loud and full.  we weren't looking for romantic, just impressive.  along with the amazing vegas views, the room was breathtaking.\n\nfood\nwe were looking to be completely indulgent and opted for the grand tasting menu-more than six courses.  in addition, we went with the wine pairings as an extra!  we began with the amuse bouche: a ceviche with apple gelee.  nice way to start the meal.  the spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> was a refreshing follow-up, one of my favorite courses.  the <mark>Tender Potato Gnocchi</mark> sat atop a pumkin puree and was topped with applewood smoked bacon-delicious.  the scallop dish had only one scallop but boy was it amazing!  for me, the lobser curry and rice dish was the showstopper.  i was delighted with the generous lobster portions-perfect!  for the bf, he loved the next course: lamb accompanied by eggplant and tomato.  i enjoyed the lamb but dislike the consistency of the roasted eggplant.  the visual appeal was also lacking (the only one out of all the previous dishes).  the one-noted brown on the plate did little to impress.  the pre-dessert was a fruity martini 2-layer concoction:  frothy pina colada on taop and thick guava nectar on bottom.  last came the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> plated along side a coconut lime ice cream.  the contrast between the chocolate and citrus ice cream was interesting and tasty.  we thought we were through but a server brought freshly baked madelines with a chocolate sauce.  although we appreciated the dessert, the other dessert far surpassed the cookies.\n\nwine pairings\nbe careful!  we were tipsy mid-way through the dinner even though we did not finish each of the 3oz. pourings of each wine.  all the wines complimented each dish perfectly.  the last wine was a dessert sherry that we didn't want to leave behind so we took it over to the lounge and enjoyed it there.\n\nservice\nthe service was impeccable from the beginning, however, we didn't appreciate being rushed through the end, especially with the amount of money we were spending.  the waiter informed us that the staff was waiting for us to pay off our check as he brought it over so that they could leave their shifts.  we weren't being asked to leave, he said, just pay quickly.  it was just 11pm (closing time) and a few other patrons were still there.  they lost a star for making us feel uncomfortable towards the end of the meal. i didn't expect that from an establishment such as this one and don't want to be made to feel that way again.\n\ni absolutely would recommend mix and return again but i'll make sure to plan on an earlier reservation.", 
            "spectacular view, but if you still opt to sit indoors while you eat their decor is inviting to be around. \n\ni ordered the <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> for an appetizer and the halibut for dinner. the <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> was very tasty and had a some spice to it. i specifically ordered the halibut bc it said it was saffron infused, and anything and everything saffron makes me happy. unfortunately for me the halibut was too salty. i was grabbing water wherever i could for the rest of the night. ordering sides here is a must. amongst all the sides we ordered creamed spinach was the tastiest :) \n\nthey also brought out mini (i think it was bacon/asparagus) soups for us \"compliments of the chef\" so that we could \"open our pallets\", nice! \n\nservice: very v-e-r-y s--l--o--w. i like it when i'm out with a significant other, it lets you enjoy your meal to the fullest, but we were there for a bachelorette party heading out for some dancing after wards, maybe the waiter can tune into how the vibe of each table is rather than a \"one size fits all\" service? \nalso my halibut came out later than everyone else's bc apparently it fell apart in the kitchen right before they were coming out with it and the chef didn't like the presentation. sure i was hungry but i liked that the chef cared that much, plus they brought out an additional appetizer for me to enjoy while i waited. thoughtful/attentive +1! \n\nso my one and only complaint. we called during the afternoon to make reservations at mix. it being our first choice on where to go eat we were bummed that they told us they had no room to take an 8:00pm reservation. we began calling around literally everywhere around vegas for dinner reservations (we were there during fight weekend so it was really difficult to land any) we did finally find a place to eat but we still wanted to eat at mix bc a friend spoke highly of it. my sister came up with a little idea that we call back and tell them that we already had reservations and that we were calling to confirm (sneaky sneaky!) at first they told us we were not within their books, but that they would be happy to put us in. cool! so i'm thinking they're probably slammed and they somehow squeezed us in and just for that they got a plus one star from me. but when we got there, literally 10 tables were wide open and for the remainder of our dinner there were plenty of tables still open. i immediatly took back my +1 point and felt that they were shady with their reservation service. why would the girl over the phone tell us they had no space when there was tons? very weird and strange. i didn't like that at all. \n\nother than that, although i would like to try eating at different places while on vacation, if i had to go back i'd be more than happy to.", 
            "on one side of this restaurant is the restaurant, and the other side is the lounge, the views are amazing and beautiful on the 64th floor but the food in general is soso. i came here for a dinner and the decor blows me away. there is a spiral staircase in the middle, private 2 person booths line the restaurant so you can see the view, and the place is a decked out in white. they accent it with bits of red to add a contrast. that is probably where my favorites of this place end. \n\ni had the spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>, it had chunks of crab and avocado and veggies. it was just ok. other people in the party ordered the fish, the free range chicken which was very moist, and the filet. everything was just kind of bland and nothing special. my favorite thing was the walnut and raisin bread which i asked for seconds. the bread comes with regular butter and a peanut butter flavored butter. that was very interesting.  i liked how at the end they give you a complimentary madeline with a hazelnut (basically nutella) dip. i would of given it a 1 star if it wasn't for the amazing decor, probably one of my favorites in vegas, too bad the food isn't up to par and the menu has a very limited selection.", 
            "i had one of the best entrees of my life at mix! the halibut with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, truffle oil vinaigrette, atop a bed of brussels sprouts leaves with a hint of ginger... i die.\n\ni thoroughly enjoyed my dessert of chocolate souffle, which was ever light, warm, and the perfect amount of chocolatey-ness. the pistachio ice cream complements the souffle perfectly. \n\nmy cousin and i split the lobster ceasar salad, which was delish (we suspect there was lobster roe in the dressing...so delicious) but not worth the $26. \n\ni really liked the taste i had of the lobster curry. the cod was good too! oh and the <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> appetizer! \n\nthe only off thing was the grandpa's hat dessert. it looks too perfect and when you destroy it, it loses appeal. \n\nall in all, a wonderful dining experience! \n\ncheck out the bathroom before you leave, it's a treat. \n\nnot to mention, the view from 64 floors up is spectacular.", 
            "it was our first time ordering a prix fixe meal and although it was a bit pricey, it was worth every single penny!\n\nmy boyfriend and i came in for dinner around 7:30 and were seated immediately even though our reservations weren't till 8:00.\n\nwe each ordered a different \"chef tasting menu\" and every dish was amazing.\n\nthey brought out a variety basket of breads with two kinds of butter (regular and peanut) and <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> before the courses started coming. \n\nfor $120 i got:\n<mark>Tender Potato Gnocchi</mark>\nroasted maine lobster \"au curry\"\n<mark>Filet Mignon</mark> rossini\nbaba au rhum\n\nfor $90 my bf got:\nspicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>\nbutternut squash ravioli\nseared diver scallops\nrack of lamb\nlemon tart\n\ni wish i could remember what the pre-dessert was called but it was served in a martini glass with a light foam on the top layer..  the post dessert was a \"freshly baked\" madeline served with chocolate or maybe nutella but it didn't taste too fresh to me.\n\nfavorites:\nspicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> & black truffle that came with the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, scallops, lemon tart, and the <mark>Tender Potato Gnocchi</mark>.\n\nleast favorite:\nbread, madeline, baba au rhum, rack of lamb, and the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>.\n\nthe ambiance, decor, view, and service is awesome and it's just something everyone should experience at least once!  if you don't want to spend the money.. give the lounge area a visit.  we didn't have enough time or room for drinks but we'll definitely be back to give it a try.  i don't know if there's a cover or not but i do know it's free if you dine at mix.  your server will personally walk you over to the lounge and seat you... or at least he did for us :]", 
            "excellent cuisine, polite staff and awesome view! we were seated right by the window for a perfect sunset view. ordered the spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> for appetizer and it's highly recommended. would definitely come back again! :]", 
            "this review is for the restaurant mix.... \nwe have been to the mix lounge so many times that it was finally time to give their restaurant a try. we each tried their tasting menu with wine pairing and it included the following: \n\namuse bouche \n\nspicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>: this was super fresh and made a great starter to the rest of the meal. the portion was great too. the riesling that it was paired with was excellent as well. \n\nbutternut squash ravioli: served with butter emulsion and super creamy...probably my favorite dish! another white was served along with it. \n\nseared diver scallops: the scallop was excellent, however, i did not enjoy the citrus endive marmalade it was served with...kinda reminded me of sour onions. \n\nrack of colorado lamb: it was served with piquillo peppers and delicious. at this point in time it was getting harder and harder to enjoy my wine, so the hubby had to start helping me with the wine pairings. we had already enjoyed a few at the lounge before dinner is my excuse! \n\npre-dessert: was more like a very sweet & tangy, frothy shake. \n\narmagnac ice cream: a creamy puff pastry...took one bite and i was done! this one is served with a port and i'm not a fan of port so i passed on it. \n\nservice: excellent! our server was awesome and he even allowed my hubby to swap out his scallops for the lobster with no extra charge. we used a restaurant.com coupon and had no problem at all...it was definitely worth it. \n\ni was pretty happy with our meal here, but also pretty buzzed by the end of meal too! overall, great place to enjoy a romantic dinner or for small groups.", 
            "mix has it all: impeccable service, delicious food, beautiful view, and lovely decor...what more can you ask for especially when you pre-purchase a giftcard on restaurant.com for $50 off your exquisite dining experience?!  the restaurant is perfect for a special occasion.  you should go to the open air lounge area to take pictures of the amazing view of the glittering lights of the strip.\n\nmy absolute favorite restaurant in vegas.  it is where luxury meets affordability. i recommend the <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> for appetizer, the caramel butter cod, and sauteed mushrooms.  i always get the same dishes since i love them so much, but i will attempt to try new ones too since they all look yummy.  try to save room for dessert, but i always have a hard time since the complimentary bread with homemade peanut butter always become too tempting!\n\nthe french manager nicolas is wonderful, and he made extra efforts to ensure my friend's request for vegetarian dishes can be accommodated.\n\nmerci beaucoup!", 
            "mix has a great view, but the food is average. the gnocchi were not very good, the spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> was so so, the scallops were ok. overall, it is one level down from aureole. the highlight for me was the green tea, which was good.", 
            "first dinner of the new year @mix. we came for the view and the food and the restaurant did not disappoint.  \n\na private glass elevator takes you directly to the top while you enjoy the view on the ascent to the 65th floor. it was a little confusing arriving in the dark and walking thru a long bar/club area and then past the kitchens before we were greeted (a hostest was not present at the booth either so we were confused on where to go). however, we did eventually find our table. the decor is a curtain of glass bubbles with white and red accents.  this place looked ready for a great valentine's day date. \n\nour cheerful and friendly server arrived soon after we were seated in our booth and was eager to please us. throughout our service, he provided detailed descriptions about the dishes and knowledgeable explanations about how each entree was prepared.  he was as excited talking about the food as we were to try it!\n\nwe started with the <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>.  it had all my favorite ingredients (fresh crab, avocado, cilantro, cucumber, etc) but there was a lingering bitter aftertaste that we could not place. it distracted from the flavors of the dish and we were ready to move on to the  next course.\n\nfor the main course, i tried the rack of lamb/tenderloin with a tian of eggplant.  the lamb was so flavorful and tender (prepared seared and then sous vide) on a bed of caramelized onions with tomato and the eggplant, tomato tian was bursting with fresh flavor that complemented the lamb well.  my husband ordered the atlantic seabass in a shellfish sauce.  also well prepared (seared and then baked) with melt in your mouth flavors. \n\nevery meal should end on a sweet note and mix reserves a whole page of their menu just for dessert!  i ordered the profiteroles for one.  it's 6 mini cream puffs served with some homemade chocolate sauce and a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream.  it reminded me of a \"deconstructed\" eclair. my husband opted for the signature <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark>. covered in chocolate with gold leaf and delicate wafer thin slices inside - it's a <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> to eat with a fork, if only to savor it a little bit longer. the lime coconut sorbet that comes with the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> is more lime than coconut and provides a tart contrast (maybe too much) to the delicately sweet <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark>.  compliments of our server, we received another delight with a freshly baked lemon madeleine (served right out of the pan) to dip in chocolate spread to top off our evening. \n\nas you stroll along on your way out, there are bathrooms tucked away just before the elevator. in the ladies room, two of the stalls have floor to ceiling windows for you to gaze outside as you go about your business (i'm told there's a similar set up in the men's room).  it takes a moment to remind yourself that it's one-way glass and what you really came to the ladies room to do. \n\nall in all, dinner at mix was a great start to the new year. \n\nsummary: delicious food, awesome views, great service. definitely would recommend to a friend and we will return again.", 
            "i really wanted to love mix. i had heard a lot of good things and decided we would finally give it a try. what a disappointment. when my husband and i first arrived, no one was there to greet us. we waited and finally decided to ask someone for assistance. an employee said we could go sit in the lounge and they would come get us. our reservation was at 6. it was 6:15, and no one came to the lounge so we yet again had to find someone to help us. we finally get seated and the server asks us if we had a show to catch. we told her no but i wish we had said yes because they were so slow. we were literally there almost 3 hours! i understand we had the pre fixe dinners, but 3 hours is excessive. \n\nwe each got a different pre fixe meal - the $90 and the $120 one and decided we would share everything. if i am paying over $100 pp person for dinner, i expect it to be good - damn good. what a disappointment. so, here is a run down of each item:\n\nspicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> - the crab part wasn't bad but there was something really off in this salad. we could not put our finger on it but if whatever it was, was left it, it would have probably tasted a lot better. \n\nbutternut squash ravioli - pretty good\n\nseared diver scallops - these were also very good\n\nlamb - was actually the best lamb i've ever had although the eggplant whatever else was in the side dish that came with it was disgusting and i love eggplant. \n\n<mark>Tender Potato Gnocchi</mark> - this wasn't bad\n\nlobster \"au curry\" - i think the way it was prepared ruined the dish. had the rice and the lobster been separate dishes it would have been much better. i ended up eating them separately so as to not ruin the taste of the lobster. lobster is good as it is, why try and dress it up just to ruin it? \n\nfilet minion - very good. cooked perfectly. \n\nboth desserts were very good. \n\n2 dinners, 2 light beers and 2 mixed drinks made our bill come out to $375, which included gratuity. luckily we had a $50 certificate from restaurant.com and we had comps from our players card so we ended up paying $130 out of pocket. had we paid more, i would have been really unhappy. our meal wasn't even worth the $130 we paid. i admit the view is amazing and they have some good options for dinner, but i say if you want to see the view, go to the lounge, see the view and then leave. there are a million other places in vegas where you could spend much less and get a much better meal!", 
            "i try to go to mix once a year, while i'm on business trips to vegas. phenomenal view of the strip, and a great bar to boot. interesting people watching also.\n\nas for the food: everything is pretty much spot-on perfect. great desserts, appetizers, meals. i wasn't wow'd by the charcuterie plate, so skip that. the spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> was out of this world, as was the lobster \"au curry.\"  when in doubt, stay away from the bread - you'll regret it as you'll be so glutinously full!\n\ni've always had great service there, with the exception of my latest february visit - our waitress was really good, but got snarky towards the end. nevertheless, worth the food, view, and price!", 
            "i had a great time at mix. i originally reserved for 2 people at 9pm. my horrible airport experience forced me to be 10-15 minutes late and not be able to change into a nicer outfit. they were very nice about the tardiness, assuming how the restaurant hours was until 10pm, and usually these dinners take long. my date and i were not rushed or anything during our dinner.\n\nthis place is beautiful! the bubbly decor coming from the ceiling made me think that i was dining under the sea. yet i'm at the very top of thehotel at mandalay bay. our booth was facing the backside of the strip, so the scenery was more mellow and calming than the glamorous strip, my dinner felt extremely relaxing although i was rushing there and freaking out at the airport.\n\nwe both ordered the tasting menu, which had a spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, halibut, <mark><mark>Colorado Lamb Loin</mark></mark>, and the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark>. i believe the entire table has to choose one of the tasting menus if any wanted to try it. my date didn't want to in the beginning since he wasn't into <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> or lamb. our server offered to switch out the lamb for the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> for $10 extra. \n\nwe started off the meal with a scallop ceviche. i enjoyed it a lot, it's very light, and the lime juice wasn't too overwhelming like most of the places that served ceviche. it was just right. it's interesting how they have some shredded raw mango on top, felt like some type of fusion going on here. \n\ni was enthralled by the looks of the spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>. very detailed with different layers of ingredients stacked up, but i had too high of expectations on the flavors. i don't recall it being spicy or crabby enough. for spiciness, i might be immune so my taste buds are less sensitive to spiciness. i was a bit disappointed there.\n\nsecond course came about with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> with lemon confit & dates. i liked how mine was seared just right, where it's more rare inside. i love the aftertaste and the aroma from each bite. unfortunately, i'm not too educated in <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, all i can tell you is if i liked it and met my expectations of it. i got to eat my date's piece too, since he's not too interested in something this rich in taste. his piece was a bit more cooked than mine, easier to slice, i just prefer a softer texture.\n\nthird course was the best one yet, halibut prepared in chicken jus and vegetable blanquette. every. bite. was. amazing. my general perception of halibut is that it's very bland and tasteless. this dish had such interesting flavors in many different layers. the flavors in every bite were going under transformation inside my mouth. i seriously don't want to finish this dish because i don't want the experience to end. \n\nfourth course was my <mark><mark>Colorado Lamb Loin</mark></mark>, with stuffed piquillo peppers and prommes anna. portions were generous, or maybe i was just very full. the spices on the <mark><mark>Colorado Lamb Loin</mark></mark> didn't take away the flavors of the lamb at all. i didn't like the meat inside the piquillo peppers though, it was a bit too tough. otherwise, the whole pepper was fun to eat; it's not the textures that were interesting but flavors of the pepper and the meat were well blended. the prommes anna was very crispy in the outside, you can feel the flakey texture with your tongue too. unfortunately i was hitting my maximum capacity.\n\nthat's when they brought out our pre-dessert. it was a sweet drink with mango puree tasted sweet and sour, topped with some coconut rum foam. it reminded me of thailand, maybe because of the tropical taste. the tart taste ease up the digestion, which was just what i needed!\n\nand finally, the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> of mix served with coconut/lime sorbet. the looks of it wasn't too spectacular, just a bar with a piece of gold flake and two half nuts on top. yes gold flake isn't too spectacular. i liked the simplicity of it though. it tasted like a ferrero rocher in a bar form served with the sorbet on the side. the combination is great. the sweetness of the chocolate is evened out with a light citrus.\n\nour dinner ended at 11:30-11:45. it would have been a nightmare if they didn't tolerate that 10 minutes of tardiness. in addition, our server offered us to their lounge with no covers. it was a great offer monetary-wise, but we were just in such a rush before that we were nowhere close in dressed properly for lounges. maybe next time :)", 
            "mix is one of the best spots in town.  the food is amazing. \n\n\nthe caviar plate is phenomenal and well worth the $160 charge. \n<mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> and <mark>Maine Lobster Salad</mark> are phenomenal.\n\nall the fish we had was amazing.  my pork belly was one of the best things i've ever tasted.\n\nservice is impeccable.", 
            "as stunningly beautiful as it is, eating at mix is kind of like eating in an airport terminal or a shopping mall. the high ceilings and glass and granite surfaces create an echo effect, so every sound reverberates off the walls and floors and just makes for an unsettling dining experience.\n\nacoustics aside, the food was pretty decent, although not quite as impressive as we had hoped. the best dish of the evening was the spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>. elegantly presented on a bed of guacamole and topped with shredded heart of palm, it was lively and fresh and made you feel like you were at a resort in cabo. the <mark>Cod Brandade</mark> was acceptable, but i was expecting exceptional. the lemon and capers just weren't enough to brighten up the bland brown butter sauce and the soggy fried parsley. and the <mark>Roasted Duck Breast</mark> was so forgettable that i simply forgot what went with it.\n\nwe were very impressed, however, with the wine service. we didn't want to order a bottle, so we just asked the somm to pair our dishes for us. he seemed to enjoy the challenge and was a delight to talk to.\n\none last note: i realize there isn't much the restaurant can do, but people really should not bring young children to these kinds of places. it's inappropriate and inconsiderate to your fellow diners -- especially so at mix because the sound of your rug rats squealing and shouting gets amplified throughout the entire restaurant.", 
            "came here for dinner, not the lounge portion, but if you want beautiful panoramas of the city i highly suggest you start here. but, be careful, they seem to be pretty snotty about outdoor seating even when the place is empty. call ahead.\n\nas for dinner, the restaurant is beautiful. you walk in and get instant visual stimulation. it's incredible. from the decor to the lights of the city all around, it really is just a place that draws you in. \n\nthere were a few thins that happened that could have been avoided and this would have been a four star experience. the first incident was being seated in a cozy little nook where conversation could be had without being so close to the next person you feel like you're sharing family secrets. that didn't last long. the hostess immediately, in a bare, empty, no one-there restaurant, seats people right next to me and my date. hello? that is beyond rude. i mean, the tables are so close together as to be really uncomfortable. to use the bathroom i literally had to wedge myself between my table and the one next to us. awkward. also, the waiter, when asked for my favorite belgian beer tried to tell me they only carried one type. i had to insist that he go ask someone because he was wrong (for the record, chimay comes in blue, white and red). \n\nother than those two missteps everything was okay. the service was quick and flawless. the time between waiter visits was perfect. i had to ask for water just one time and after that i couldn't take a sip without it being refilled. so, great job of picking up on that. we were also greeted by several people on our way in which i thought was a very nice touch.\n\nonto dinner. for appetizers i had the dinner salad which was essentially a larger than average bowl of mixed greens. it was mixed with a vinaigrette of some sort that just added to the bitter taste of the overall salad. i wouldn't recommend. my date had the spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> which was delicious, but absolutely could have come from mom's kitchen. what can i say, my mom's a great cook! \n\nfor an entree i had the 12 oz. <mark>Boneless Ribeye</mark>. it was cooked perfectly, but was much too large for me to eat so i brought the extra home. it was delicious. it did happen to be more of a fatty cut than i was used to, excessively so. it was fine, but i prefer less fat, more beef, obviously. for sides i chose the fork crushed potatoes. they were chunky and rich, but again, they could have come from my mom's kitchen. \n\nmy date had the <mark>Pepper Crusted Bison Tenderloin</mark> and seemed to enjoy it. i dislike that much pepper anywhere near me, but it looked delicious. his side was sauteed spinach which he found delicious. \n\nfor dessert i passed, but my friend had the ice cream/toppings. you get four choices of either and he chose pistachio ice cream, salted caramel ice cream and vanilla ice cream with coconut crunch as a topping. the pistachio was creamy and rich, i loved it. i could have done without the coconut, but really it wasn't a distraction. i disliked intensely the salted caramel. it tasted very bland and very unlike any salted caramel i've ever tasted. i almost think that's a taste that belongs solely in candy form. i just don't think it translates well to other things, which isn't the fault of the restaurant, i've just never found that it works on much else but candy. as for the vanilla, well, it was vanilla. \n\nall in all the decor, charm and service were perfection. the food was so enjoyable although i didn't get the michelin star experience, i don't think. the food really was good and the view was just beautiful. with all the restaurants in vegas, though, i doubt i'll revisit. but, do go try it once!", 
            "the food here was pretty good. i got the spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> which was great, my mom got the lobster that was pretty good to,but not as good as the spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>.  for our main course i got the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> on top. the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> had an eggy taste at least it did to me,my mom thought it was good.", 
            "my most recent visit was not like the first one. the hostess was very pleasant. i'd hate to call him a busboy but the man who brought water and cleared the dishes was also awesome. however, our waiter was less than enthusiastic being there. it seems he didn't spend any time studying the menu. \n\ni remember mix as having a staff that knows the menu inside out, how every dish was prepared and the best way to enjoy each course. our waiter seemed like he was filling in for someone, having difficulty explaining the menu. \n\nwe didn't do the tasting menu this time, and instead ordered a la carte.\n\nthe spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> was not the least bit spicy, but very good otherwise.\n<mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> & the seabass were both delicious\nthe ribeye was cooked perfectly, but contained a huge chunk of fat, signaling it was a bad cut of meat.\n\nperhaps the least impressive was the dessert. the <mark>Baba a L'armagnac</mark> was a plain cake served on a citrus reduction, w/ whipped cream and liquer to pour over it.  unfortunately, our waiter couldn't explain the best way to enjoy the dessert, nor anything else about it. however, the table next to ours ordered the same dessert and got a full explanation and i had to ease drop.  \n\nperhaps if we received better service, this experience could have been a 4 or 4.5, but 3 is the best this time, and that's a damn shame.", 
            "i ate dinner here twice. the first time was 3 yrs ago and the second time was this past weekend. we were seated outside and fortunately the weather was warm...when it did get chilly there were plenty of heat lamps to keep us warm. located at the top of the hotel, the restaurant is simply decorated with a gorgeous bubble chandelier lighting as the masterpiece. the view of the strip and vegas all around is amazing. the lounge area is nice and mellow but both times i didn't have the chance to try it out.\n\nwe ordered the prefix menu which included the spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, seared diver scallops, <mark><mark>Colorado Lamb Loin</mark></mark> and <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark>. we skipped the beverage pairing and ordered two bottles separately - a delicious and fruity sauvignon blanc by honig and a merlot (forgot name). the food was outstanding, the first and second time. i particularly liked the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, scallops and <mark><mark>Colorado Lamb Loin</mark></mark>. all prepared just perfectly. they even provided us complimentary dish at the beginning and a drink in the middle to clean our palette. the frothy, peachy drink was delicious...so yummy we asked our waiter to hook us up with another round which he was nice enough to oblige. the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> was okay...we all agreed they taste similar to a kit kat bar.\n\nthe whole experience was fantastic...food, service, experience!", 
            "this was the gem of our trip to las vegas. first we arrived about fifteen minutes early so we were able to enjoy a drink out on the patio. it was very hot, but worth it for the view.\nour favorites: bass ceviche, cod, creamed spinach and the deserts: <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> and coffee and chocolate opera\nnot so great: spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> (too fishy)  and mac and cheese (too many noodles, not enough cheese)\nwe also had the braised waygu, a filet, a <mark>New York Strip</mark> and fork smashed potatoes, all great.\nour server was great until we had our main course and then it was difficult to find him again to order coffee and dessert. his helper was phenomenal all night.\nwe will definitely be back for both the view and the fabulous food. our bill included a bottle of wine and about 7 cocktails and was just under 500 dollars.", 
            "absolute breathtaking view atop the hotel at mandalay. do yourself a favor, get a dinner reservation for around 8pm. enjoy a cocktail outside the lounge overlooking the strip before dinner. its a good a view as you can get anywhere on the strip.\n\nattentive and friendly service. water nor cocktail glass was ever empty. \n\ncocktails were delicious, ordered 3 different ones and loved each.\n\nfood is 4 stars. nothing mind blowing but perfectly prepared and seasoned apps and entrees. both the lobster and <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> apps are musts. entr\\u00e9e was the filet topped with a <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> steak. it was excellent\n\ni do think the food is slightly overpriced. you're basically paying for the view and i suppose in many ways, that part is priceless. definitely a must visit if you haven't already", 
            "my last dinner in vegas and it was disappointing okay.   nothing really blew me away and i was expecting it for the price you pay.  granted the ambiance is very nice and service amazing, but the food was lack luster.  \n\ni got the tasting 5 course pre-fixe dinner.  it included a spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>, fois gras, cod, lamb, and dessert.  the best part of the meal was the dessert.  the others were good and some were bland.  we did get some complimentary items which were a nice touch, but it didn't make up for the food.\n\nwith all the many restaurants in vegas i would not be back here.  sorry.",

            "food 5 stars: \n\ncomplimentary bread basket- the bread basket included foccacia, fruit and nut bread, wheat bread, and baguette. the fruit and nut bread is the best piece of bread i have ever tasted. it was very moist, warm, and absolutely delicious. it wasn't too sweet or to oily, it was so good that we got seconds. the focaccia bread wasn't that special and tasted a little strange to me. \n\ncomplimentary <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>- we all got a small tasting of <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and it was pretty good. i only ate a bite though, because the feeling of goose liver haunts me. \n\n1. surf and turf (lobster and chicken) $38 - this is what i called surf and turf. i love how they use chicken instead of beef, much healthier. i usually eat chicken and lobster every other day, so my palate was designed to taste this dish. the chicken was awesome, and it was stuffed with spinach. it was soft moist and not oily. the stuffing was beautifully placed inside the chicken. the lobster was pretty decent, but not the best i have tasted. the portion size for this dish was very generous and filling. \n\n2. seared scallops $38- there were only three scallops on the plate, but what can you expect. i have learned to ask the server how many scallops before ordering them, because the usual is 2-4. the scallops were cooked very properly and were very tender. the only complaint is the portion size, because the other two parties had to fill up on the bread. \n\n3. creamed spinach $9- ordered with less cream. i didn't ask how it tasted like, but it looked like he enjoyed it.\n\n4. <mark>Sauteed Green Asparagus</mark> $9- a moment of heaven with vegetables. my mom usually cooks some of the best vegetables in the world, so i love to eat vegetables, but at the same time i hate flavorless vegetables. it was the best couple of asparagus spears i have ever tasted. it was so soft, moist, and full of flavor. absolutely amazing. it is a must order sied to go with the meal.\n\ncomplimentary dessert- the chef never lets you leave without something sweet. we were offered each one madeline with a chocolate dipping sauce and it was wonderful. the perfect way to end a meal without stuffing yourself. \n\nservice 5 stars: \n\nour waiter was kind and polite even when we wanted to change tables. he always refilled on beverages whenever needed, and didn't stand over us like a school teacher. we were surprised that out entrees arrived so quickly ( i wasn't even finished with my first loaf of bread), because it was a busy night. \n\natmosphere 5 stars: \n\ni took so many pictures that night! the atmosphere was fantastic. there were like glass bubbles that hung down from the rood, the restaurant was pearl white, and there was a beautiful staircase in the center of the restaurant. there are tables for business groups as well as a cozy date. just beautiful!",

            "i really wanted to like this place.  i had high expectations after reading some of the yelp reviews.  however, i left a bit disappointed and unsatisfied.  it is a beautiful restaurant with ultra chic decor.  the winding staircase and hanging glass balls are a nice touch.  i originally wanted to give it a 3, but the more i think about it, the more i want to give it a lower review.  \n\nfirst of all, my bf and i were seated at the opposite end of where we wanted to sit (the side facing the strip).  we got bread with two kinds of butter.  regular and peanut butter butter.  i didn't really like the peanut butter butter very much.  and the bread was difficult to cut.  i like it when they give you bread that's already cut up so all you have to do is tear it off from the bread bowl.  especially when you're sharing with a group of people.  who wants to eat it after someone grabs it with their hands and cuts it up. \n\ni wasn't very hungry so decided to not do the prixe fixe meal and instead decided to get 2 appetizers and a salad for my entree.  we got the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> to start.  it was good, but i've definitely had better.   my $20 appetizer salad was light and refreshing but still left me unsatisfied.  my bf got the lobster with rice and i must say that it was delicious.  for $50, it better be!  \n\nthe wine: we opted to share a bottle of pinot grigio.  the wine guy, likely not a master sommelier barely said a word.  my bf tried the wine and he approved and said would you like to try it? the guy starts pouring me a full glass.  i guess we are getting this bottle whether i like it or not.  \n\nthe service:   umm service was not great.  just mediocre.  our waiter was nice and took some pics for us but the host was not so friendly.  we had a restaurant.com gift certificate but didn't print it out and asked if we could still use it.  it was in email format and my bf pulled it up on his phone.  at first they said that it was fine and later french host dude with an attitude came back and said sorry our mistake, that was for someone else.  but said that we would get something complimentary from the chef.  i was excited, yay! free stuff.  they brought out this drink in a martini glass.  french dude said, it's non-alcoholic because \"i'm not sure if you're 21.\"  i don't know whether he was trying to be funny or not, because clearly i was drinking wine all night already and was still sipping on my last glass when he came.  so i decided to try it.  it was not good.  then i looked over the other tables and saw that people got the same thing.  it could be that they may very well have ordered that.  or the chef was just giving those away to everybody that night.  \n\noverall, food was pretty good, but for the price, i also expect stellar service.  this restaurant did not meet my expectations.",

            "time to update, i finally ate in the restaurant.  since i've basically declared the mandalay bay my second home (not by choice btw), i've come to know and love the fact that restaurant.com offers discounts to almost all of their restaurants.  it allows business people without an expense account, like myself, the opportunity to eat good food without feeling the urge to jump off the beautiful balcony when the check arrives.  so thanks restaurant.com!\n\nthe interior of the restaurant is stunning.  definitely worth the trip just to see it.  i would have been happy dining inside but we were escorted to a table outside so that we could enjoy the beautiful view.  nice!\n\nafter deciding against a cocktail...\n\n***sorry, i have to add a side note here.  mix, update your cocktail menu!  the cocktails on the list are reminiscent of sex and the city circa 1994!***\n\nwe decided to check out the wine list.  if you're not dining at mix for a special occasion, you can get away with a $50 bottle.  it won't be great, but hey, when you've been working for 12 hours, who cares.  we settled on an unmemorable bottle of white.  \n\nwe started with the 1/2 portion of <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>.  it was gigantic.  i kept wondering if they brought the full order because it was so big.  definitely large enough for 2.  it was amazing.  \n\nfor the main course, i chose the <mark>Braised Wagyu</mark> en cocotte.  it was phenomenal.  the most tender and delicious meat that i've had since i can remember.  i don't think i even needed a knife.  i would comment on what my friend ordered but who the heck knows.  i don't think i even looked up from my meal to see.  it was that good.\n\nat the end of the meal we were stuffed.  i don't think i was able to finish my main course but there's always room for ice cream.  we went with the homemade ice creams and sorbets - coco lime, buttermilk and butter pecan.  worth every calorie.\n\nto top things off, our server was cool and very professional.  he took great care of us.  it was a great way to end the work day.  i loved it!", 
            "despite the mix-ed reviews- sorry for the bad pun- i decided to dine hear because:\n\n1. i was staying at mandalay bay and wanted to do something close.\n2. i had a $50 off gift certificate\n3. i thought to myself, \"well even if the food is so-so like i read, its got a great view and cool decor.\"\n\nwell i guess since i had lower expectations, i ended up being pretty happy with the experience. first thing i should mention, you really should view mix as a french-influenced american steakhouse, as opposed to a french restaurant along the lines of le cirque. if you look at the menu, you'll notice how similar it is to a classic steakhouse. that said, the food isn't going to be mindblowing, but it is really good, albeit pricey. i love <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, but at $32 for an app, this was the most i ever paid for it...but it was a nice sized portion and it was cooked perfectly. my <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> was perfect also, and i needed that after the chewy hangar steak i had at sage the previous night. dessert was a passion fruit souffle...again, very good...moist and eggy. \n\nthe service was good, the setting was really cool..it really looks great in there at night with the lights dimmed...and the view was great also, althoguh tough to see because of the reflection on the windows. the elevator ride up is quite an experience also... a glass-enclosed elevator on the outside of thehotel giving you a view for the ride all the way up and back down. \n\nit was worth going to once, especially with the $50 off, but i don't think i'll be returning with all the other places in vegas to try.", 
            "we were there on saturday and were shocked to learn that no tasting menu available because thet were too busy. yeah right, if there's no tasting menu, then post it on the website so we would not have gone! the food is just so so; the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> was a bit tough, the mac and cheese was a huge disappointment and the filet was tasteless. the best thing is the view. for really good food, try aureole instead. been there three times and never been disappointed.", 
            "we had dinner at mix and had a nice view of the sunset and the strip from where we sat.  i like the indoor/outdoor aspect, in particular the view from the lounge as other reviewers have mentioned.  it is is worth a visit for that alone!\n\nour table had a 4 course tasting menu with wine pairings.  we chose the alain ducasse classics menu, which featured his signature tenderloin as the entree.  \n\ni was disappointed that the sommelier didn't describe each of the wines for us as they were delivered (only the one with the main entree).  at other restaurants, it has been the sommelier and not the waiter who explains the wine.  \n\nthe waiter was a bit over-enthusiastic about the food (almost like he wanted to convince us how good it was) and alain ducasse, explaining to us who he is (we already know, that's why we were there!).  \n\nthe second course was a lobster curry that wasn't a favorite of our table.  all of the other dishes (seabass with asparagus, tenderloin with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, and traditional bhaba rum cake) were all very tasty.", 
            "i can't really think of a better \"special occasion\" restaurant in america. right off the bat, the view of the las vegas strip from the lounge is breathtaking. it's a fantastic place to have a few drinks before dinner, or just in general if you aren't there to dine. even the view from the restroom is fantastic. the main dining room is very contemporary and minimalistic. hundreds of hand-blown glass bubbles fill the area, so it almost feels like you're sitting in a glass of champagne. but what really sets this restaurant apart is the food. from start to finish, everything we tried was exceptional. the one dish that really stands out in my mind was the fillet <mark>Filet Mignon Rossini</mark>. being a big fan of <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, chef alain ducasse really hit a grand slam with this dish. it was easily the best steak i've ever had. on the downside, the prices are a bit on the upper end but you certainly won't be disappointed. so if you're ever in the las vegas area for a special occasion, mix should be on the top of your list for fine dining dinner spots.", 
            "i heard many great things about mix prior to going and it definitely exceeded my expectations. first of all the view is amazing! it's the type of amazing a photograph can't capture, you have go up there and see it for yourself. the food was nothing short of excellent. i had the gnocchi for appetizer and the filet with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>. i was so happy and full by the end. \n\nthe service was also excellent. i went a while back with a group of friends who were still in college. i already knew we were a group of obnoxious students and i could tell the waiter was very frustrated with us, but he patiently endured through the whole time :p by the end i think he was more amused by us than annoyed.", 
            "dining in the restaurant mix by alain ducasse was on my food list of top places to dine around the us. so my husband and i were very excited to finally get the chance to go. \n\nwhen you come up to the elevators the reservationists asks your name, points you to an elevator, you get out of the elevator with no clue as to where to go. you walk accross the lounge looking for anyone to help you. when you get to the restaurant they look at you and ask you for your name again, now why would you not communicate that from downstairs? we were able to find the restaurant quickly, but had it been busy inside i would have no idea where to go. \n\nthe interior design of the restaurant and bathrooms is simply stunning and i was so excited for the meal to begin. we were brought the bread which had peanut butter and butter as a spread, cool idea, but not well executed. the peanut butter had just come out of the refridgerater as well as the butter and was not spreadable. i tried, but it just ripped the bread in half. \n\nthe sommelier came over asked if we needed wine suggestions and i had told him that i was looking at a riesling, by the glass and wanted to know if it was sweet or dry. he said sweet and recommended something a little drier... so i picked the wine he suggested and out came a sickly sweet riesling. weird to have a riesling this sweet by the glass, it reminded me of ethos late harvest as a dessert wine. i suffered through it and never ended up finishing it. \n\nthe food was underseasoned and the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> for my first course was way to sweet.. foie is so delicate, why would you over power it with so much sugary jam? my fish was overcooked and nothing wowed me. i was so disappointed in the food as this is ducasse's place and how could i forget when our waiter was mentioning that it was \"sir ducasse's\" restaurant every five minutes. i get that you are proud, but you're just hurting his culinary reputation by touting it repeatidly. \n\nservice was good, although i had an entire mushroom side vessel spilled on the table and dripping into my lap. i'm sure the manager saw this as he was staring at our table all night, but never came over to appologize. \n\nnot a true representation of michelin stars... i'm not sure why they even came to vegas because compared to europe the restaurants here are not deserving of michelin. \n\nthe one positive note is the view-- so come up for a drink instead of eating and the dessert babarum was amazing!", 
            "impressive... everything from the views to the interior design and food. stellar views of the strip from the lounge but the dining room's decor does not disappoint either as it was the opposite view of the strip. highly recommend the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> which was heavenly melting in our mouths. we also had the <mark>Pepper Crusted Bison Tenderloin</mark> and the red snapper thai ginger dishes. presentation and tastes were perfect. a truly memorable experience!", 
            "came here on the saturday before the 4th of july. in our group of four, me and my bf had the taste of mix tasting menu and got the wine pairing to go with it. the other two had the classic tasting menu and wine pairing. the atmosphere is classy and looks beautiful at night. \n\ni don't remember the whole meal, but here are the things i do remember...\nthe amuse bouches were great. the first course was a salad which was just alright. the next dish had <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and apricot which was amazing. the entree i remember being good...i think it was lamb. the dessert was a \"<mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark>\" which was rich and chocolately..but a little to heavy for my liking. each glass of wine was very well paired with each course.\n\nthe mood of our meal changed drastically when i found a piece of thin glass in my wine. yup...a piece of glass about the size of a half dollar. luckily, it stuck to the side of my wine glass so i didn't get to my mouth. also, the manager came over and apologized took off the cost of 2 wine pairings. they handled it well, but something like that should have never happened. who knows what could've happened if i swallowed that piece of glass.", 
            "food review:\n\nheidi was our server, she was absolutely the sweetest. love.\n\nwe went right when they opened so it was pretty empty. we got to see the sunset.. so beautiful! this place definitely would look better at night though. sit down around 7:30pm.\n\n<mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, mint ice cream, waygu, and sea bass. the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> was amazing (what do those ducks eat?!) and the mint ice cream was a happy melody of all different kinds of mint such as spearmint and wintergreen. we got chocolate syrup and chocolate pearls as toppings. the waygu was delicious, fell apart nicely. the sea bass was light in flavor, really good though.", 
            "this review is for the restaurant. \nmy husband and i came here for our 5 year anniversary dinner tonight. i did my research and thought this would be a good place to go. the food was wonderful. we had, for starters, the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> (half order), <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> (half order), and <mark>Maine Lobster Salad</mark>. for our entrees we had the <mark>Braised Wagyu</mark> and <mark>Cod Brandade</mark>. both were very tasty. for my dessert i had the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> w/ caramel ice cream. \nmy gripes with this restaurant was that we were seated on a round table between two square tables. it was awkwardly situated and did not make for a very comfortable meal. at least we were seated by a window with a pretty nice view. my next gripe is with the waiter (big caucasian blond guy) who talked and laughed with the tables next to us and made no effort with the two of us. i wonder if it's because we didn't order a bottle of wine. i forgot my zantac, so i didn't think drinking wine would be wise. my husband ordered a mojito and he totally forgot about it prompting us to have to remind him and when he wanted a second drink, we had to ask the busboy (sorry, i don't know what to call him). by the way, the busboy and the buslady were nice and friendly. my husband wanted to give the waiter a bad tip, but i convinced him against it because i wanted the other helpful staff to get what they deserved. we tipped the usual 18% even though the waiter clearly didn't deserve it. with the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and wagyu we weren't sure what we were supposed to eat it with. a good waiter would have made suggestions for sides to improve the enjoyment of our meal. \nso the verdict: the food was great, but the experience was lacking considering the amount of money we spent, $200+.\ni've been to many amazing restaurants, including french laundry, jar, lucques, osteria mozza, etc... this was by far the worst experience i've ever had at a fine dining establishment.", 
            "ambiance is on the spot.\n\nservice is top-notched... except when they get a little too busy, but servers are always friendly and accommodating.\n\ntry their tuna tar tar.  they're served with taro chips, which were light and savory.  you should eat the mango bits separately though, because it kinda overpowers the tuna.\n\n<mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> always melts in your mouth like butter.  \n\ni got the halibut with parmesean foam the last time i visited.  it's a very light and interesting way to taste cheese.  i liked it a lot.  portions are good enough to satisfy, but you won't catch yourself overeating.\n\nrestaurant.com coupons make this a pretty good deal too!", 
            "first of all, you can't beat the view from the 64th floor of the hotel at the mandalay bay.  the evening view of the strip is unparalleled.  beyond the hip lounge is the restaurant.  from the lounge you walk through a corridor where you have an opportunity to view the open kitchen.  i like watching chefs work and this was a treat.  then you step into a cream white colored paradise.  feels like you stepped into a glass of bubble filled champagne.  \n\nwe ordered off of the restaurant week menu - go three squares!  the grilled <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> was probably the best that i have ever had and i eat a lot of <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>.  the foie is so much sweeter when it comes from corn fed ducks as opposed to pellet fed ducks (from hudson valley for example).  it shows that the chef knows how to source his ingredients.  \n\nthe rest of the dishes were delicious but i loved the cheesecake dessert.  the sweet fluffy and light mouse cheesecake was paired with a more savory sour cream sorbet which i loved!  the sorbet was such a surprise and delight that i forgot about the cheesecake.  \n\nservice was impeccable.  the waiter knew his cuisine.  overall, a wonderful dining experience.", 
            "had dinner here last night with a few co-workers.  i started with the (duck) <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and then had the <mark>Pepper Crusted Bison Tenderloin</mark> and a quince tart for dessert with some lovely sorbet.  \n\nall in all, it was a good meal, the view was great, the wine was good and the atmosphere is a welcome retreat from the noise and flash of the strip.  yet, somehow, it didn't all add up to a spectacular meal - it was a very good meal, but for whatever reason, this isn't the type of experience that makes me want to bring my wife here the next time we're in vegas.\n\nlet me be clear, you will have a good meal here.  you probably won't make memories here, however.  what's the english translation for je ne sais quoi?  whatever it is, this place is missing that.", 
            "i was invited here by some colleagues during a work retreat and treated to an extravagant place with over-the-top prices on food. there were many areas to mix that ran the gamut of styles. first of all, the entrance to mix was just a hallway to an outdoor elevator that shot up to the top of the hotel; by the way, it was hot! \n\nonce we got in, there was the lounge and bar area which were club-like and very loud. vegas, yes yes. we apparently were in the back past the kitchen so we moved from that very dark, very loud setting to a white bubbly restaurant area. talk about modernized fancy schmancy - even our bread came with square pats of creamy butter and sweet peanut butter. by the way, the pimento bread was very excellent and good on its own without any spread. \n\nso after trying to get a little comfortable in this unfamiliar setting of a swanky restaurant (and staring at the price tags on the food), i decided that since i was already in the situation, i ought to take full advantage of it. i mean, when else am i going to place myself there with a high-priced menu? therefore, what else to order but one of the chef's signature dishes, the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> rossini? it came with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and sliced black truffles. oh and i believe there was also a side of mashed potatoes for me too. when they came out, they honestly weren't presented in a way that made my mouth water (actually, the waiter set the plate down in front of me incorrectly with the insignia not turned properly). however, the tenderness of the steak certainly played its part in charming me. was the best i've had though? no but the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> really helped pull the flavors together. let's not forget the truffle! the mashed potatoes were also both fluffy and still chunky enough to please my palate. now, was the whole entree worth $69? i'd say not. was it delicious and juicy? yes it sure was.\n\ni couldn't resist getting dessert with such wonderful descriptions listed on the menu (turn a blind eye to the price tag, minerva!). i ended up with a hazelnut souffle paired with grapefruit sorbet. uh, who pairs the two together? i was hoping that i'd get them in some kind of complex mix but alas, they were presented separately on one plate. the hazelnut souffle had too much sugar in some parts so that it was unnecessarily cavity-inducing crunchy. i really enjoyed the sorbet but felt that it was odd to include the bits of sugar in the bowl. the candied grapefruit peel was delicious but again, too sweet. i'm glad i had the experience here but once again was proven correct in my thought that the cost and high profile appearance of a place does not say anything about the food. it's all about the diner, and this diner was only somewhat satisfied that night.", 
            "this is a review for the restaurant, which i just walked out of 15 minutes ago. :)  my party and i chose to go for their better tasting menu which included four courses plus an amuse bouche and pre-dessert dish.  here's the breakdown:\n\n1. amuse bouche: thai coconut chicken soup aka tom ka gai.  a nice touch, but i've had better tom ka gai at my local thai restaurant.  too much lemongrass, and not enough sweetness.  not bad, but not great.\n\n2. first course: gnocchi with asparagus and morels in a cream sauce.  i personally liked this dish, i felt that the delicate flavors were well balanced and a perfect introduction for what was to come.  my sister felt that this dish was a little on the bland side, but then again, she has a cold, so i'm not sure if her taste buds are fully functioning, lol.\n\n3. second course: roasted maine lobster \"au curry\" with coconut basmati rice.  i was a little apprehensive when i saw \"curry\" and \"lobster\" in the same sentence, but this was actually a very unique and pleasant twist on how i normally experience lobster.  when dining at gary danko in san francisco, my go-to dish is the butter-poached maine lobster with risotto, and here we have a similar dish with an indian touch...delicious!\n\n4. third course: <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> rossini with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and black truffle.  i do love my tournedos rossini and mix does it beautifully here.  my velvety filet practically melted in my mouth and the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> was richer than butter.  the chef was also very generous with the black truffle slices.  definitely the star of tonight's meal!\n\n5. pre-dessert: mango puree with coconut foam.  this light and airy precursor to dessert looked like a fancy cocktail served in a martini glass.  exotic, fruity, and a refreshing palate cleanser after such a rich main dish!\n\n6. fourth course/dessert: <mark>Baba a L'armagnac</mark> (monte carlo style).  this was an irish sponge cake drizzled with armagnac and served alongside an airy vanilla bean whipped cream.  decadent without being over-the-top, but i was still so stuffed that i could only finish half...what a waste!  still, being a chocolate lover, i would have chosen a mousse or lava cake a la mode over this any day.  sorry mix!\n\ni also had two glasses of the sparkling rose and an irish coffee to accompany my meal.  the rose was nice, but the irish coffee had such a kick that i could only finish half for fear of being unable to walk out of the restaurant!\n\nthe location, view, and decor was amazing!  i'm sure you've all seen photos of the \"floating\" glass bubbles that adorn the center of the restaurant.  the floor is also made to emulate a lace pattern.  service was friendly, but unfortunately on the slow side.  it took them over 2.5 hours to serve us four courses.  also, i felt like the price was a little on the high side for only four courses...i've eaten at comparable restaurants here in vegas and in sf which cost about the same for 6-9 courses.  nonetheless, i would still consider this a very good experience and is worth trying once.  but if you're going to do it, do it all the way and go with the higher tasting menu for the best the chef has to offer!", 
            "i had a great time at mix. i originally reserved for 2 people at 9pm. my horrible airport experience forced me to be 10-15 minutes late and not be able to change into a nicer outfit. they were very nice about the tardiness, assuming how the restaurant hours was until 10pm, and usually these dinners take long. my date and i were not rushed or anything during our dinner.\n\nthis place is beautiful! the bubbly decor coming from the ceiling made me think that i was dining under the sea. yet i'm at the very top of thehotel at mandalay bay. our booth was facing the backside of the strip, so the scenery was more mellow and calming than the glamorous strip, my dinner felt extremely relaxing although i was rushing there and freaking out at the airport.\n\nwe both ordered the tasting menu, which had a spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, halibut, <mark><mark>Colorado Lamb Loin</mark></mark>, and the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark>. i believe the entire table has to choose one of the tasting menus if any wanted to try it. my date didn't want to in the beginning since he wasn't into <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> or lamb. our server offered to switch out the lamb for the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> for $10 extra. \n\nwe started off the meal with a scallop ceviche. i enjoyed it a lot, it's very light, and the lime juice wasn't too overwhelming like most of the places that served ceviche. it was just right. it's interesting how they have some shredded raw mango on top, felt like some type of fusion going on here. \n\ni was enthralled by the looks of the spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>. very detailed with different layers of ingredients stacked up, but i had too high of expectations on the flavors. i don't recall it being spicy or crabby enough. for spiciness, i might be immune so my taste buds are less sensitive to spiciness. i was a bit disappointed there.\n\nsecond course came about with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> with lemon confit & dates. i liked how mine was seared just right, where it's more rare inside. i love the aftertaste and the aroma from each bite. unfortunately, i'm not too educated in <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, all i can tell you is if i liked it and met my expectations of it. i got to eat my date's piece too, since he's not too interested in something this rich in taste. his piece was a bit more cooked than mine, easier to slice, i just prefer a softer texture.\n\nthird course was the best one yet, halibut prepared in chicken jus and vegetable blanquette. every. bite. was. amazing. my general perception of halibut is that it's very bland and tasteless. this dish had such interesting flavors in many different layers. the flavors in every bite were going under transformation inside my mouth. i seriously don't want to finish this dish because i don't want the experience to end. \n\nfourth course was my <mark><mark>Colorado Lamb Loin</mark></mark>, with stuffed piquillo peppers and prommes anna. portions were generous, or maybe i was just very full. the spices on the <mark><mark>Colorado Lamb Loin</mark></mark> didn't take away the flavors of the lamb at all. i didn't like the meat inside the piquillo peppers though, it was a bit too tough. otherwise, the whole pepper was fun to eat; it's not the textures that were interesting but flavors of the pepper and the meat were well blended. the prommes anna was very crispy in the outside, you can feel the flakey texture with your tongue too. unfortunately i was hitting my maximum capacity.\n\nthat's when they brought out our pre-dessert. it was a sweet drink with mango puree tasted sweet and sour, topped with some coconut rum foam. it reminded me of thailand, maybe because of the tropical taste. the tart taste ease up the digestion, which was just what i needed!\n\nand finally, the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> of mix served with coconut/lime sorbet. the looks of it wasn't too spectacular, just a bar with a piece of gold flake and two half nuts on top. yes gold flake isn't too spectacular. i liked the simplicity of it though. it tasted like a ferrero rocher in a bar form served with the sorbet on the side. the combination is great. the sweetness of the chocolate is evened out with a light citrus.\n\nour dinner ended at 11:30-11:45. it would have been a nightmare if they didn't tolerate that 10 minutes of tardiness. in addition, our server offered us to their lounge with no covers. it was a great offer monetary-wise, but we were just in such a rush before that we were nowhere close in dressed properly for lounges. maybe next time :)", 
            "i have been to this restaurant 5-6 times and i always enjoy it. my friends from japan loved it so much too. their <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> is wonderful!! their signature dish, lobster curry, is crazy good. i never really care for lobster but this is different. i wish i could make it at home!! i always have issue with their portion...(in a good way). their portion is pretty decent that i always feel too full after a full course menu!! sometimes i can't even eat dessert because i'm too full!! i like the ambiance. i would not \"expect\" a window seating as window seatings are limited (does not matter how early you make your reservation.) the view is available from the bar anyway.\n\nalso, their deserts, especially the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark>.... is amazing!\n\nas far as service goes, i have never had issue personally.i believe it's worth a visit and great place for a great meal!", 
            "i've had a lot of spectacular meals, but the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> topped with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> topped with black truffles was honestly one of the best things i've ever tasted in my life. then put that on top of an amazing location at the top of the hotel looking over the whole vegas strip makes it amazing!", 
            "-saturday night, (8/25/12), right before the dinner rush.\n\ni had never heard of mix restaurant until a week before i was invited to go there for dinner.  mix is more known in vegas as a bar/lounge with great views of the strip and is located at the top of the thehotel, a part of the mandalay bay resort.  you can get up to the lounge by two elevators.  one is a great all glass elevator on the outside of the hotel that provides fantastic views of the strip and the valley beyond as the elevator whisks you to the top of the hotel.  the other is an inside elevator for those afraid of heights.   this outside elevator opens up into the very large bar area.  the bar also offers a balcony where you can sit outside and enjoy sweeping views while you drink and socialize.  you can walk through the bar into the adjoining restaurant.  the restaurant is a circular room done in white and chrome colors with contrasting bright red glassware and windows almost all the way around.  there are strings of clear glass balls hanging down from the ceiling that help to separate the space from the bar.  i suppose it is meant to look sophisticated but it instead it just looks dated, like a set from an old austin powers movie.\n\nwe started off with an appetizer of the chicken and coconut thai soup ($16) and a half order of <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> ($17/full order is $32).  the soup had similar ingredients to the traditional thai tom ka however it was watered down and bland.  it tasted as if an amateur chef was trying to replicate a thai dish and failed.  the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, on the other hand, was luscious and fatty with just a smattering of lemon confit on the top to balance the tastes.  \n\nfor dinner, we had the john dory \"meuniere\" ($38) and the slightly glazed \"ne3\" pork belly with spicy \"mangavocao\" salad ($34).  the fish was slightly overcooked and somewhat dry but served with enough fennel and tomatoes to cover the mistake.  the pork, on the other hand, was cooked well but very, very salty.  the mango and avocado salad tasted fine and was artfully presented in a small lettuce leaf, but did not go well with the salty pork meat.  i like fusion cuisine but this tasted more like throwing flavors together simply for the sake of it, rather than for the taste.  perhaps they should stop trying to think up cute phrases to put in quotation marks on their menu, and concentrate more on cooking well.  we would not order either of these dishes again.\n\nfor dessert, we both had the home made ice-cream and sorbet.  you can create your own plate by picking any combination of four ice creams flavors, sorbets or toppings from an extended list of choices ($9).  i had the pistachio and almond ice creams with maraschino cherries and brownie bites toppings.  your \"creation\" is served simply as two small (and i mean small) ice-cream scoops on a plate with two little cups on the side filled with your choice of toppings.  while the ice cream tasted fine, the maraschino cherries were straight out of a jar from the supermarket and the brownie crumbles were a tad stale.  you could get something tastier and cheaper at your local frozen yogurt store.  this is from a michelin star chef?\n\nthe service was good and the waiter was attentive but there were several times when we had to ask for water.  to quote the waiter's own words, \"it is a bad idea for a restaurant to use red glassware; you can never tell when the glasses are empty\".  if only the restaurant management would note the same point.  overall, the food was just ok.  but you expect more from a michelin star chef.  perhaps the executive chef is not replicating chef ducasse's dishes correctly, perhaps the restaurant is just a second thought to the bar or perhaps they are just hoping that you are so tipsy from the bar that you don't notice the imperfections in the food.  in any event, i would definitely recommend bringing your guests to the lounge to enjoy the view and drinks, but then bring them elsewhere to eat.", 
            "i selected the chef's tasting menu along with the wine pairing. i was not impressed with the restaurant at all. i can not believe alain ducasse put his name on this restaurant. \n\nthe bread basket that came out(yawn) and the cold butter (peanut butter-butter and unsalted) that crumbled on my bread when i tried smearing it, really? i do not know where to start from the boring curry lobster on coconut bastmati rice to the highly alcoholic baba armagnac for dessert. the one thing that was tasty was the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> on top of the beef fillet, along with the rioja(really good) was the only thing i enjoyed. i really wished i had gone with the some thing from a-la carte menu. \n\nfor the price of the tasting menu with wine pairing you should go to sage in the aria hotel, talk about a spectacular meal. \n\nwell, i hope you find my review helpful.", 
            "***mix provides a great view of the strip and the service is very nice, but the food is below average when compared to fine dining spots outside of las vegas***\n\nmix is the second alain ducasse restaurant i've tried.  the other one was in tokyo and it was decent but not special.  occasionally, the food at mix felt pretty good, but often the food felt a little below average.  the food tastes slightly better than nearby aureole (and the service is better too), but mix just does not feel like a great fine dining spot.\n\nthe alain ducasse name is definitely a draw for mix, but the atmosphere is too.  mix sits on the 64th floor of the mandalay bay and you get a good view of the strip (best at night) from most tables; there are some obstructed views.  the dining room is nice--mostly an all white room with white tablecloth; there are splashes of red here and there.  the lounge area is different; it utilizes darker and more typical lounge colors.\n\nmix offers several menu options.  there is an a la carte menu, which features starters and entrees including several prime steaks.  there is also a seasonal mix tasting menu as well as a tasting menu comprised of alain ducasse signature dishes.  i decided to opt for the alain ducasse tasting menu.\n\n(sweet corn soup amuse) the sweet corn flavor was good and it was creamy, but it was way too hot--almost like they zapped it in the microwave.\n\n(assorted bread with butter and peanut butter) the breadbasket was a decent variety of options, but it was just okay.  the addition of peanut butter was interesting, but the actual peanut butter itself was not that great.\n\n(<mark>Tender Potato Gnocchi</mark>, asparagus, mushrooms, aged cheese) the gnocchi was okay; it was a little doughy and i prefer gnocchi with a seared outside.  the asparagus was good.  the mushrooms were just okay, but i really liked the aged cheese, which was sharp and hard but still surprisingly creamy and not dry (there should have been more of it on the plate).\n\n(<mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, date puree, lemon confit) i added this as an a la carte item to the tasting menu and the date puree was a good sweet compliment to the more salty <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>.  the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> was not that good though.  it was a little stringy and it was not that smooth or creamy.\n\n(roasted maine lobster au curry, coconut basmati rice) the lobster was tender, but it just lacked the softness and moistness you get at really great fine dining restaurants. the coconut basmati rice was nice and creamy and the curry sauce was fragrant, but the flavors did not really develop.  it just became a decent curry dish and nothing else.  and because it was such a big portion, it became kind of a task to eat (instead of a really great dish where you can't put your fork down).\n\n(<mark>Filet Mignon</mark> rossini, <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, black truffle) this was the main course and it was quite rich and heavy.  the filet was decent.  it was cooked okay and was juicy and tender enough, but i did not think the quality of the meat was great.  the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> was similar to the a la carte <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> where it just did not have that velvety smoothness you get with great <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> (the texture kind of reminded me of when you don't do creme brulee right and it becomes like scrambled egg).\n\nthe black truffle was not that great either.  it was probably australian truffle and not the peak season for it.  this truffle part might be better in the winter.\n\n(mango puree) the first dessert was a palate cleanser and it was not that great.  it was mango puree and a soda foam.  it was just tart and fizzy and not that refreshing.\n\n(baba a 'larmagnac, brioche, blueberry compote, cream) this was a kind of make-your-own dessert because they serve it in parts.  the sponge cake-like brioche sits atop a good blueberry compote and there is very strong brandy on the side for pouring and a very good cream for applying, dipping and such.  as individual parts, this dessert was decent, but i did not really love it as a whole.\n\n(madeleines with chocolate dipping sauce).  i liked that the madeleines were freshly baked, but they were too big.  i wish they had more of a defined edge/crust.  the chocolate dipping sauce did not have a great flavor and was too thick.\n\ndespite a lot of the food being mediocre, the service was very good.  the staff was pleasant and attentive and the food came out at a good pace.\n\nprices were high, but you do get a very generous amount of food with the tasting menu.  and because a lot of the food is rich and heavy, you definitely will not leave hungry.\n\ni thought the service at mix was very good, but the food was about the same quality as mandalay bay's other lackluster fine dining spot aureole.  there is a lot mediocre fine dining in las vegas and, unfortunately, alain ducasse's mix falls in that bunch.  if you are looking for better and more contemporary french dining, you should check out l'atelier de joel robuchon in the mgm grand instead.\n\nthe mandalay bay offers both complimentary valet and self parking.", 
            "tip: gluten free friendly!!\n\nwent here on a monday night for 2nd wedding anniversary with the husband per yelper reviews. \n\natmosphere/first impressions: \ntip: check in at the desk off the gaming floor (right by the sporting betting area). take the elevators up to the top. \n\nwe had reservations, so we got a table by the windows (a must).  the view is from the south strip looking north. as the hotel is on the top floor of thehotel (mandalay bay) you get to see the entire strip. incredible. atmosphere is modern trendy yet still manages to feel relaxed and warm. \n\nstaff:\noutstanding.  the waiter we had was very friendly yet professional. you know you are in the presence of a good staff when you don't notice your water glass being refilled. also staff has great knowledge of the menu.\n\nfood:\nappetizer- ok don't judge, but we got the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>. a-ma-zing. \nmain course- i got the seared tuna and i think it was the most perfectly piece of seared tuna i've ever had. and i eat it a lot. i asked about the sauce, as i am gf, they put it on the side and checked with the chef. points for that! husband got the john dory \"meuniere\", also delish. \ndessert- per our waiters suggestion for gf desserts, we tried the strawberry rhubarb. excellently cooked, a little sweet and sour...perfect light end for a great meal.\n\ntip: all in all a fantastic meal! there is also this fantastic bar you walk through to get to the restaurant with an outdoor patio. check it out before or after for cocktails",

            "i would have given this place five stars but the service could have been a little better. i had the prefix menu for about $90 or so and it was truly amazing. i loved the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and scallops, but the chocolate bar dessert was just okay.\n\ni sat outside and it was just an amazing view, wasn't cold at all. the decor of the place was simple but sophisticated, just my style.", 
            "i ate dinner here twice. the first time was 3 yrs ago and the second time was this past weekend. we were seated outside and fortunately the weather was warm...when it did get chilly there were plenty of heat lamps to keep us warm. located at the top of the hotel, the restaurant is simply decorated with a gorgeous bubble chandelier lighting as the masterpiece. the view of the strip and vegas all around is amazing. the lounge area is nice and mellow but both times i didn't have the chance to try it out.\n\nwe ordered the prefix menu which included the spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, seared diver scallops, <mark><mark>Colorado Lamb Loin</mark></mark> and <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark>. we skipped the beverage pairing and ordered two bottles separately - a delicious and fruity sauvignon blanc by honig and a merlot (forgot name). the food was outstanding, the first and second time. i particularly liked the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, scallops and <mark><mark>Colorado Lamb Loin</mark></mark>. all prepared just perfectly. they even provided us complimentary dish at the beginning and a drink in the middle to clean our palette. the frothy, peachy drink was delicious...so yummy we asked our waiter to hook us up with another round which he was nice enough to oblige. the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> was okay...we all agreed they taste similar to a kit kat bar.\n\nthe whole experience was fantastic...food, service, experience!",

            "excellent food and just as stellar service.  this place was wonderful.\nstarted off with the spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> and <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> (both must haves).. and then for the main courses, went with maine lobster \"au curry\" and <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> rossini.  the lobster was tasty but that <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> was taken to a new level being paired with the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>.  it just melts in your mouth.. like butter.  \nwe were there for a special occasion and our waiter was super attentive and helpful.  nice hawaiian guy so maybe we had a connection there.  on top of it all, he even asked the chef to sign our menu!", 
            "perhaps having eaten at a lot of highly acclaimed restaurants my expectation were too high, but a michelin star should be better.\n\nthe <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> with chicken was good, but too much chicken.  the <mark>Filet Mingnon Rossini</mark> lacked sauce and was overcooked and a bit dry,  the lamb was so over flavored on the crust that only the center was tasty.  excellent buttery potatoes and creamed spinach, the asparagus was good, but tasted mostly like butter..\n\nthe desserts were the most disappointing - the profiteroles were fair and the chocolate souffl\\u00e9 dry, lacking in chocolate flavor and inedible (left almost completely uneaten, complained about and still charged).  the madeleines were cute, but too dry and cakey, lacking the buttery-lemon flavor of true madeleine fame (my wife's are much better).\n\nservice was about the same as the food.  the sommelier was competent and the turley zinfandel excellent, although our waitress managed to spill some while pouring due to her seeming indifference.  we had an early dinner and the room was empty most of the time with too many servers per patron. at times they were overly anxious, at times good and at times intrusive - certainly not first rate.  you shouldn't clear one diner and not the table, but that wasn't the way things worked here.\n\nit seemed like a new venture that hand't yet worked out the kinks, but hearing they'd been open for several years they have no excuses.\n\nlovely space, good view, have a drink, but forget the food, until they get serious about being a real first rate restaurant.  when a big name chef adds his name to a restaurant, i'd expect his continued involvement or at least a higher level of quality control.  his name now just means high prices.  he should learn from thomas keller and the french laundry.\n\nreturned for hosted cocktails during the following week and the waitress smashed into my wife's arm leaving a very nasty black and blue mark.  maybe she'd read my earlier review?", 
            "mix is an absolute beautiful restaurant and bar! located on the 64th floor of the hotel (mandalay bay), mix offers amazing views of the strip and beyond. the theme of the restaurant is quite simple yet classy. the restaurant is divided into two different areas. one side is black. like everything from the walls to the furniture is black. the bar area is red and the kitchen and a private dining table is located in the middle. on the other side it's completely different. everything from the walls to the furniture is white. it's so classy and elegant and also offers spectacular views of the las vegas strip. \n\nthe menu at mix is a very upscale dining menu. they offer quality foods such as caviar, <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, lobster and <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>. i came here for a couple different events so i didn't get the chance to try things off of the menu. \n\n==service==\nthe service here at mix was great. the host was pretty cute and all of the cocktail waitresses were very friendly. they had plenty of servers coming around and delivering hors d'oeuvres. \n\n==food==\nthey had different hors d'oeuvres such as chicken satay, sliders, shrimps, beef skewers, caprese skewers and more. the entrees were <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> with scalloped potatoes, pasta bolognese, mushroom risotto and chicken with saut\\u00e9ed vegetables. out of everything i really enjoyed the sliders, mushroom risotto and the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>. \n\neven though the two events that i attended were free and the food was pre-set, i still looked over the menu and its on the pricier side. although the price is a little high, it's definitely worth it in my opinion since the quality of food and the view are both spectacular. i'm definitely planning on stopping by mix on my next visit to vegas.\n\n**you must stop by the restrooms here! both have amazing views as you are taking care of business. it's not the nicest bathrooms, but the view is definitely worth checking out!", 
            "mix was amazing. the food is mouthwatering and the service was impeccable. the view at the top of mandalay bay was gorgeous. we have never have tastes such tender lamb and both types of beef were nice and tender with the perfect amount. it was nice that they had a bar area with a large outside balcony where you can probably rent out and have a private party there. the main dining was was beautiful. it is the perfect place for a special date or even a small dinner party. it is probably not the place to host a large loud group of friends for a fancy dinner.\n\nwe ordered:\n-<mark>Filet Mignon</mark> rossini\n-<mark>Braised Wagyu</mark>\n-colorado rack of lamb (bone out)\n-<mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> (as appetiser)\n\nthe only con about mix is that it's kind of hard to find, at least it was for us.", 
            "mix was recommend to us by the concierge at the aria (who was great btw) as having the most beautiful view with the loveliest french cuisine in all of vegas, and it did not disappoint. everything was marvelous. for someone used to dining in fine restaurants, in the u.s. as well as in europe, i don't say this often or lightly. i very rarely write reviews.\n\nthe dishes were genuine and well executed. the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> au torchon was exactly as it is served in france. the best way to judge is by going somewhere else the next day, which we did, and honestly, you'll want to go back to mix. i especially liked the way the menu offered classic dishes as well as newer creations. mom was happy as well as my indie-film-loving brother. \n\nhowever, the real reason to go is for the service. i have read some of the previous reviews and see what's going on. but here's the deal. i hope it is useful:\n\ni respect that customers come in with all kinds of expectations on the level of service. we were 10, with a baby and a 4 year girl, celebrating a pre-wedding dinner with the bride and groom. i asked for the chef's table for privacy, but we were disappointed to find out that it was not available. nonetheless, the hostess assured me that we would be in a special area of the restaurant that would not bother anyone else and offered us a glass of champagne, as well, for the inconvenience. she was wonderful! and she was right.\n\ni was very skeptical about sitting in the main dining room because we did not want to spoil any one else evening. but the entire staff was so attentive to our every need that i must say, the entire evening went without a hitch. of note was a moment, early in the evening, when our 4-year-old spilled her grenadine water with its fancy straw and then had that tense frozen look that precedes the oncoming torrential scream. within seconds, our servers swooped down with a a napkin, cleaned up and replaced her place setting with a big smile letting her know that everything was okay. wow! it was nothing short of amazing. they treated her like a princess and she really felt like one. \n\nit's easy to provide good service when everything goes well. but the true note of distinctively great service is how swiftly and professionally the staff handles problems when something goes wrong. at mix, mr. ducasse has a top-notch, experienced staff of professionals -- something often lacking in today's restaurant scene. so, about the $10 sparkling water that you didn't order... it's important to brush up on 5-star restaurant etiquette, because you'll get a lot of that at this restaurant.\n\nthe whole evening was filled with extremely good service, timeliness and friendliness that matched the deliciousness of the cuisine and exceeded the expectations of each and every one of us. a memorable evening in every way.", 
            "ate here on a recent visit to lv, and it was recommended by a young lady (she sounded young anyway) at picasso when i couldn't make a reservation there (because i waited to late to reserve).  server's name was scott and he was so nice and helpful which made for a great dining experience.  ordered a couple of appetizers - <mark>Charcuterie Sampler</mark> and <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> - both really, really good.  dinner was surf & turf with some kind of beautiful fish topped with more <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> over brussel sprouts.. again, really, really good.  companion had <mark>Boneless Ribeye</mark> and mashed potatoes.  i thought the prices for everything were reasonable.  and let's face it..  you know going in it's more expensive than the average fish/steak house so its silly to complain it's pricey.  i really liked this place.  i would totally recommend this place if you want a great view of vegas with excellent food, wine and top notch servers.", 
            "so my gf and i were in vegas for the new years and we were dying to try <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> (which is illegal in ca) and a lot of people recommended to us mix. luckily, we were staying in mandalay bay so we just walked up to mix and went up to the elevator which took us to the 64th floor.\n\nfirst off, the lounge at mix is amazing! since mandalay is at the end of the strip, you get a full view of the strip and you can really appreciate the lights of vegas. additionally, the chairs are comfy and the heat lamps will keep you cozy.\n\nas for the restaurant, the decor is all white and very chic. you start out by walking through the open kitchen which is really cool. we were able to get a table next to the window, which made no difference since our backs were to the windows.\n\nas for the food:\n\nassorted bread with sea salt butter and peanut butter- 5/5- hey it's free bread, anything at this restaurant that is free is a 5/5 for me. xd\n\nfoies gras <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>- 5/5- for $60, i was pretty disappointed when the plate came out and there was a tiny piece of meat. however, this baby must be made from dehydrated food because it expands quickly in your stomach! the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> pretty much melts in your mouth and the flavor is really strong and decadent. i definitely, recommend this dish at mix.\n\nmash potatoes- 3/5- pretty plain. kind of tastes like instant mash potatoes to me...\n\n<mark>Creamy Spinach</mark>- 3/5- nothing out of the ordinary here.\n\nwagyu beef- 4/5- this baby just melts in your mouth. however, it's a little bit salty for my taste. luckily, the potatoes and carrots offset some of the saltiness.\n\noverall, the food is overpriced; however, the dishes are very flavorful here and the decor and view is top notch. if you're tired of the buffet scene, this is definitely, a worthy try.",

            "recommended by a friend to come here, i paid them a visit on my most recent vegas trip. have your cab driver drop you off at thehotel since the elevators to go up to the 64th floor where the restaurant is located is right when you walk in!\n\nthe minute that i stepped out of the elevator and approached the restaurant, i was taken back by the all white decorations. i love it! absolutely sleek and chic. we were seated by the window. it's kinda weird how they have it so that your backs are to the windows but no big complaints there. it was nice to enjoy our meal and when we occasionally turn around, we were able to take in the view.\n\nthey started us off with a bread basket that includes 2 kinds of butter: sea salt & peanut. now, i'm normally not a peanut butter fan but this was so good! it was creamy with a hint of sweetness. i would've been happy just eating bread with the peanut butter but wait! it doesn't stop here, it gets better!\n\ni ordered the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> rossini w/ <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and my date ordered the rib-eye with asparagus as a side. although i enjoyed the rib-eye, i believe the dish worth raving about is the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>! it came with mashed potatoes. the filet was tender and juicy at the same time. the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> just melts in your mouth and was so tasty! i couldn't get enough. prior to ordering we had ask the waitress for recommendations on red wine. she recommended the syrah which went extremely well with our steaks.\n\nour waitress was extremely soft spoken it was sometimes hard to hear her. i also felt the service was not as attentive as it could've been. the bus boy seems to be around our table more and was extremely friendly. i noticed he was conversing with other guests at other tables too. when he learned that we were on the trip for my birthday celebration, he got me a complimentary dessert which consisted of  sweet breads and nutella spread. so sweet of him! aside from that, we also ordered the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> which has coconut and lime sorbet. totally worth it!!! the chocolate was sweet while the coconut filled made it a little crunchy. perfect combination.\n\nafter our dinner experience we went to the lounge and wanted to step outside to snap some photos. since mandalay bay is all the way at the end of the strip, you are able to see the view of the whole strip from the lounge area. we were stopped and told that only those with bottle service could be outside. what? lame... \n\noverall, mix has given me such a good experience that i will be back next time and will tell my friends to give it a try!", 
            "my latest visit to mix was quite the disappointment.  i had dined there once before over a year ago and recalled a much better dining experience.  if you are here for the food, you have made a mistake.  there are so many places in lv to go for an amazing gastronomic experience, that mix doesn't even begin to contemplate playing in that ballpark (though they may be fronting like they do by serving hoity-toity dishes like <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> with chicken terrine.) however, it's more than just what you're serving, it really comes down to how it tastes.  our party of four tried several different options and none commanded anything but average reviews, and some were even worse than that.  my ribeye, which our waiter assured was \"excellent,\" was not.  it would have been excellent if i ordered it at denny's or sizzler with some eggs, but it wasn't excellent at some ritzy lv restaurant.  i didn't even care to finish it.  and i always care to finish a good cut of meat.  it tasted like a supermarket bought steak, prepared clumsily at home.  that's how good it was.  the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> was horrible, neither it's taste, appearance or texture were appetizing.  my husband ordered scallops.  again, okay if they were from a buffet.  they were out of the cod entr\\u00e9e, which is what i remembered enjoying on my previous visit.  our meal was so un-spectacular that i can barely recall the other appetizers we ordered or the dessert.  our server was a tad curt and unavailable and not forthcoming with recommendations or suggestions.  in all, we regret having wasted our one night out in lv at mix. the view is nice, but not nearly enough to redeem the poor quality and taste of dinner.  we were so hungry after the michael jackson cirque show downstairs that we ignored our better judgment that was telling us to eat at sw instead.  sorry mix, we won't be coming back.", 
            "the view here was amazingggg. located on top of the hotel by mandalay bay, you can see all the lights from below. make sure you take a trip to the bathroom. on the way walking there, they have a patio where you can walk out and see the huge sign that sparkles and says \"thehotel\" it's quite an amazing view with so many lights. the bathroom has a gold tinted window. great place to take bathroom pictures for girls. \n\nfood wise, the food was delicious and the staff were friendly. must try the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> steak item on their menu.", 
            "i'll preface this review by disclosing that my wife and i had both our wedding ceremony and reception at mix.  on one hand, that may make me biased a bit in my love for this restaurant, but on the other hand, that also made me far more critical of the food, staff and service since we paid them the price of a small car to do an exclusive buy out on a saturday evening in vegas for a seven hour event.  \n\nso, that being said, here goes; saving food for last!  edit: looks like i have to trim my review, i hit the 5000 character limit. :-(\n\n1) ambience - if you like old fashioned or traditional decor in your dining venues, you will probably hate mix.  there is not a wood panel anywhere to be found, nor any green or blue carpeting.  the interior is many modern features with the centerpiece being the thousands of blown glass bulbs hanging from the ceiling around the two level dining area; the idea being to make it look like champagne bubbles rising.\n\nthe main seating area enjoys two story tall open windows with both views of the mountains and views of the strip.  if you're sitting inside, sunset is a perfect time to go because it looks simply incredible.  if you're sitting outside on their balcony, you'll only have a strip view because of where the balcony is located, but the view is still excellent at all times of day since you're 64 stories up looking north up the strip.  i recommend after dark for balcony seating.\n\n2) service - i've never had a bad experience at mix.  my wife and i visited vegas several times in advance of our wedding and dined at mix each time just to reassure ourselves that we had made the right decision.  we did not let them know in advance that we were coming to ensure we got to experience service as it normally is.  drinks are always full, they'll pick your napkin up and re-fold it if you get up to go to the bathroom, they check on your needs frequently, everyone is very congenial and outgoing.\n\nwe've been back numerous times since our wedding and yes, now we probably get extra service as many of the staff are still there and recognize us (it was a pretty memorable wedding), but they're really great folks.  i'm sure over the years as staff come and go we'll be a distant memory and service will go back to 'normal' but for the three years we've been back so far they've really made it special.\n\n3) special requests.  they've been very accommodating to us both for our wedding/reception and since then.  for example, on our first anniversary when we went back, i arranged with a cake bakery to make a small version of our wedding cake and deliver it to mix to surprise my wife after dinner.  the restaurant ensured someone was available to receive the cake that day and then they cut and served it for us.  if you're having a special occasion, talk to the staff and see if there's anything special you would want.\n\n4) food!  okay, the view sold me on this place to begin with, and fortunately, the food lived up to, and exceeded, expectations.  here's what we've had and when:\n\na) the <mark>Pepper Crusted Bison Tenderloin</mark>, <mark>Cod Brandade</mark> and roasted free range chicken (not always a menu option) were our wedding choices for guests.  the bison was awesome; many steak lovers who had never had bison remarked at how great the flavor was.  on the fish, we also had quite a few comments where significant others had shared their fish entree with someone who was not a fan of fish and they loved it, so that speaks for itself.\n\nb) surf & turf.  although it's not always on the menu, they'll do a filet and lobster if you ask.  my wife gets this religiously and loves it.  i will note that it is not as good as the surf & turf from n9ne at the palms.  there's regular surf & turf, then there's mix's surf & turf, then there's the n9ne surf & turf which is the best one in the universe.\n\nc) <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> rossini with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> & black truffle sauce.  if you're into truffles, i'm sure you'll love this.  the steak comes out perfectly.  i'm not a huge fan of the sauce so this is one of those love/hate meals for me.  perhaps ask to try the sauce before you order; not sure if that's possible.\n\nd) roasted maine lobster \"au curry\".  i love spicy, i love indian food, i love this meal.  it's my go-to mix meal; i get it every time once i tried it.  it's perfect combo of everything i love; lobster, spicy, curry, veggies, etc.\n\ndon't forget to go visit the mix lounge next door after dinner!  great place to relax and have a drink and cigar (on the balcony only of course).", 
            "perched atop the 64th floor of the majestic hotel at mandalay, mix boasts some of the best views of the south strip in vegas. once you set foot inside the lavish ivory themed dining room, you know you're in an alain ducasse restaurant. the space simply oozes the charm and elegance of his signature opulent style reminiscent of the dining room at the hotel plaza ath\\u00e9n\\u00e9e in paris.  the glitz and glamour of vegas is also quite apparent and you can't help but be dazzled by the contemporary and elegant atmosphere that envelops you.\n\nwith the beautiful weather i had been  experiencing over the weekend, i opted for patio seating with a direct view of the vegas strip below. \n\nafter glancing through the menu, i decided  to try chef ducasse's signature tasting menu with wine pairings.\n\nbreads came out soon after with a selection of focaccia, french baguette, dinner rolls and sourdough with unsalted and an interesting \"peanut\" butter. the breads were room temperature and butters were cold so spreading was not pleasant but the breads served their purpose of filling my gullet til the main courses arrived. \n\namuse\n\n<mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> royale with port reduction and mushroom foam \n\n- this enticing little number exhibited a pleasant airiness and irresistible aroma from the mushroom foam and the interesting mix of flavors and textures married well together lending a savory yet earthy element to this whimsically fascinating dish\n\ngnocci\nwith parmigiano reggiano, veal jus and sun chokes.\n\nnot the best gnocci i've ever had but satisfying nonetheless. this dish had an incredibly comforting feel to it. i especially enjoyed the contrasting textures from the light & crispy chips and tender enoki mushrooms served with the dish. warm, rustic yet subtle and familiar flavors were easy on my palate. \n\nmain lobster curry with coconut basmati rice \n\n- it's hard to go wrong with lobster, especially when you infuse thai flavors into a dish. the perfectly cooked lobster was bathed in a pool of curry and served stop luscious coconut rice. a delectable marriage of flavors.\n\n<mark>Filet Mignon</mark> rossini with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and black truffle sauce \n\n- this was easily my favorite dish of the night. the combination of <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>, <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and black truffle is like the holy trinity of fine dining.  the result will almost always result in endless drooling and licking the porcelain off your plate. \n\npredessert\n\ncoconut foam and mango rum cocktail. an exhilarating drink with bright notes and a sweet finish. excellent palate cleanser and a perfect way to prepare my taste buds for the sweet finale.\n\nbaba a la marnagnac\n\nunfortunately i wasn't as impressed with my dessert.\nthe liqueur for the cake was too strong and pungent while the flavors were just were too heavy handed. i may have myself to blame for that, as i may have given the cakes too heavy of a pour of the accompanying liqueur.\n\noverall, food was good but i must admit that i expected more from a multi michelin star chef like alain ducasse.  imo, the dishes lacked that wow factor that i was eagerly anticipating.  service was also on the clumsy and awkward side the night i dined, as well. for instance, my wine pairing for one of my dishes was completely forgotten until i reminded the sommelier. additionally, the wait staff seemed a bit hurried and rushed.  the furniture itself, which has probably seen better days, was in desperate need of an update, too. during my dinner one of my guests had to change their seat out because the chair was collapsing. for a restaurant of this caliber, i expected a bit more, at least chairs that weren't falling apart at the seams. \nwith that said, they changed the chair out without a hitch and there were some redeeming factors which included the stunning views, beautiful setting and expansive bar next door.  \n3.5 stars for now and hoping the restaurant makes some improvements on the menu, furniture, and service in the future.\n\nuntil then...\n\nhappy eats!",

            "touting itself as french cuisine with an american influence, this restaurant sits in an enviable location at the very tippy top of thehotel in las vegas.\n\nmy first trip to las vegas was due to an it expo going on, and we had been sent out armed with a list of places to try and restaurants to visit, with mix being a regularly recommended location.\n\nsome of our friends had decided to meet up with us for a few days during our vegas trip, and they were equally excited to eat at mix for the first time.\n\nfrom the discreet glass elevator that shoots up the outside of the hotel and offers a changing view of vegas, to the stunning d\\u00e9cor inside the varied bar and eating areas, to the panoramic view from the restaurant that comes alive as the sun goes down and the vegas lights come up, everything at mix is designed to be an experience that will leave you with a fantastic impression.\n\nthe staff are softly spoken and perform at the caliber you expect from an alain ducasse restaurant: quick on their feet, taking the time to discuss the menu without rushing any decisions, respectfully disappearing if more time is needed and knowledgeable about everything on offer and nicely versed on the wine list and suitable pairings.\n\nbetween everyone at our table we sampled the following:\n* complimentary bread basket sampler accompanied by perfectly spreadable butter studded with peanuts.\n* we ordered <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> with palm hearts, guacamole & cilantro, shrimp cocktail with horseradish and spring baby vegetable salad with an herby basil dressing as starters for the table to share.\n* 2x <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> rossini with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> & a black truffle sauce\n* 1x roasted maine lobster au curry with basmati rice\n* 1x <mark>Cod Brandade</mark> with lemon, capers, brown butter, croutons and fried parsley\n* we ordered fork crushed (the fancy way of saying expensively mashed) potatoes, <mark>Creamy Spinach</mark> and saut\\u00e9ed <mark>Sauteed Green Asparagus</mark> as sides to share.\n* complimentary madeleines (which were absolutely perfect) with a chocolate dipping sauce for everyone after dinner to bide us over while we decided on what to try for dessert.\n* 1x <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> with a textured coconut & lime sorbet\n* 1x chocolate cherry pudding with chocolate crisps & black cherries\n\nthe food was fantastic, but at mix prices i would expect it to do everything but dance on the table while singing a show tune.  \n\neverything was perfectly cooked, seasoned and flavoured: \n* the steaks were done exactly as requested, although the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> lacked the impact i was hoping for and tasted just like any other goose liver pate i've had (it was my first time trying it and i was a little underwhelmed)\n* the cod was glorious and the accompanying sauce was perfect\n* the lobster curry was phenomenal\n\nhowever, as someone with a raging, barely controlled sweet tooth the dessert options were a little limited but still of a superb quality nonetheless.\n\nthe wines suggested by our server were superb and all the cocktails we had at the bar afterwards were excellent.\n\non the way out i noticed what appeared to be the smallest dance floor in the world tucked away almost as an afterthought, however at a vegas altitude where every square metre of space comes at a premium i don't blame them for compromising their dance floor for extra dining space.\n\ni get the feeling that the staff were specifically chosen to bring a warm touch to what had the potential to be a very pretentious experience.  this is definitely a restaurant to try at least once, and i recommend that you try to time your visit around the sunset as this will give you a memorable view of vegas.", 
            "we had dinner here last night and went for the executive tasting menu by alan ducasse with paired wine. now this was a fine dining experience at this michelin starred restaurant and not cheap at $175 per person. \n\nthe restaurant boasts beautiful views being on the 50 something floor, even the ladies restroom had a floor to ceiling picture window in it, stunning. \n\nwe had an amuse bouche of broccoli pur\\u00e9e and sweet pickled vegetables followed by 4 courses. my husband had gnocchi with wild mushrooms and asparagus, maine lobster, fillet mignon with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> then rum armagnac then madeleines and dipping chocolate.\n\ni had a vegetarian alternative menu also starting with the gnocchi, followed by a warm vegetable salad then swede pickled veg and mushroom tapenade rum armagnac and madeleines. \n\nthat was all very delicious and we were totally spoilt with the food which us he'd our taste buds to the extreme with new flavours and combinations. not everything was to our tastes like my husband couldn't take the fois gras. \n\nthe one star was reduced more with the service. we were left waiting for a while at the front for a server to seat us and we got the menus but they were whisked away before we got to look at them when they realised that we had the executive tasting menu pre-booked, i asked for one back to read the full listings of each course to savour it more. they did talk through each course but so quickly that a couple of times i asked how that would be cooked etc. \n\nthe door to the balcony tables kept blowing open with the wind which sent our pristine starched white table cloth flapping and the servers running to close it many times! \n\nthe decor was white minimal with glass spheres suspended by wires that reminded me of jelly fish. \n\ni really enjoyed the experience and the food was first class.",

            "funny thing is, we went to a burger place at mandalay first. but they didn't come to our table for 5 minutes to even say hello. and 5 minutes is longer than you think when you just spent 90 minutes at the mj one show and you're ready to eat off your hand with hunger. so we left. and came here. a bit different, to put it mildly. service was impeccable, but not snooty. the missus and i both got different tasting menus. mine was the alain ducasse 4 course one sans wine. from the cold broccoli soup amuse to the amazing lobster curry to the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> topped filet to the armagnac dessert, almost everything was very well presented and tasted amazing. first time with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>. would definitely have been beyond the pale if served solo, but topping the perfectly cooked medium rare filet balanced it's richness. all i know is the junk was tasty. the only misstep was the mashed potatoes that accompanied  the filet. they were served in a bowl separate from the plate, and surprisingly...basic.  \n\natmosphere was romantic, view was stunning, of course, and definitely an experience to remember. not cheap. but actually worth it.", 
            "my first visit to this restaurant--overall was very good.  the  views are excellent, i thought the service was wonderful--matt , the sommelier, was excellent.  started with the <mark>Maine Lobster Salad</mark>--wonderful presentation, had just the right amount of seasonings.  this was followed with the scallops--they were prepared well, how ever, the mushrooms that accompanied them seemed to me to be too earthy for this light seafood.  had the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> accompanied with a wonderful date and raisin compote--sweet and delicate.  tried the charcuterie plate, was surprised with the simple yet tasty samples of prosciutto and rosemary cotto ham . main course was the lamb--excellent preparation and presentation.  seasoned very well.  finished every thing off with the chocolate souffle--very light and flavorful.  overall had a wonderful time, atmosphere was very upscale and modern, as i said earlier, the views are great. definitely a good place to visit.",

            "for my birthday, my wife took me to mix at mandalay bay. the restaurant is on the top floor of the mandalay bay hotel with a great view of the strip. \n\nwe had the 7 course tasting menu with the wine pairing. it was a formidable meal which took us over 3 hours to complete. the <mark><mark>Colorado Lamb Loin</mark></mark> was the best lamb i have ever had. the loin was seared with some herbs and then put in the oven for a little bit. it was still very rare inside. the meat, sourced from a special breeder in colorado, was evenly marbled, and had all the wonderful goodness of lamb without any of the gaminess that some diners object to. the lamb was paired with some syrah whose name i can't remember, but it was also good. \n\nhttp://www.bluewaikiki.com/bw_lasvegas.html", 
            "this is a 4 star restaurant that i'm tempted to give 3 stars.\n\n1.  the waiter was way too pushy when it came to alcohol - every conversation was an excuse to recommend and push alcohol.\n2.  my martini was not great and there was a \"surcharge\" for a premium alcohol i hadn't requested.\n3.  my wife's gnocchi with morels and asparagus had no morels.\n4.  service was way too fast - it's fine dining, not mcdonald's.\n\nso why 4 stars?  well, the food was very good, the service was impeccable from everyone, even the waiter who pushed alcohol.  i don't know that this is as good as other michelin star restaurants i've been to, but it certainly was good.\n\ni had <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> with rhubarb compote that was delicious and an excellent piece of veal.  my wife had the gnocchi, which despite the lack of morels, she loved, and lamb that were two big meaty <mark><mark>Colorado Lamb Loin</mark></mark> chops.  her chocolate souffle was ok, my kirsch parfait was wonderful (though it was served like cherries on a meringue and wasn't really like a parfait.)  i loved the coffee and the waiter's assistant kept refilling it.\n\none other note: they knew it was our anniversary and there was no acknowledgement.  it's not mandatory that they do or say anything, but it's nice when they do it.  that's more of a comment - it doesn't factor into the review.", 
            "i had a great time at mix. i originally reserved for 2 people at 9pm. my horrible airport experience forced me to be 10-15 minutes late and not be able to change into a nicer outfit. they were very nice about the tardiness, assuming how the restaurant hours was until 10pm, and usually these dinners take long. my date and i were not rushed or anything during our dinner.\n\nthis place is beautiful! the bubbly decor coming from the ceiling made me think that i was dining under the sea. yet i'm at the very top of thehotel at mandalay bay. our booth was facing the backside of the strip, so the scenery was more mellow and calming than the glamorous strip, my dinner felt extremely relaxing although i was rushing there and freaking out at the airport.\n\nwe both ordered the tasting menu, which had a spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, halibut, <mark><mark>Colorado Lamb Loin</mark></mark>, and the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark>. i believe the entire table has to choose one of the tasting menus if any wanted to try it. my date didn't want to in the beginning since he wasn't into <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> or lamb. our server offered to switch out the lamb for the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> for $10 extra. \n\nwe started off the meal with a scallop ceviche. i enjoyed it a lot, it's very light, and the lime juice wasn't too overwhelming like most of the places that served ceviche. it was just right. it's interesting how they have some shredded raw mango on top, felt like some type of fusion going on here. \n\ni was enthralled by the looks of the spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>. very detailed with different layers of ingredients stacked up, but i had too high of expectations on the flavors. i don't recall it being spicy or crabby enough. for spiciness, i might be immune so my taste buds are less sensitive to spiciness. i was a bit disappointed there.\n\nsecond course came about with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> with lemon confit & dates. i liked how mine was seared just right, where it's more rare inside. i love the aftertaste and the aroma from each bite. unfortunately, i'm not too educated in <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, all i can tell you is if i liked it and met my expectations of it. i got to eat my date's piece too, since he's not too interested in something this rich in taste. his piece was a bit more cooked than mine, easier to slice, i just prefer a softer texture.\n\nthird course was the best one yet, halibut prepared in chicken jus and vegetable blanquette. every. bite. was. amazing. my general perception of halibut is that it's very bland and tasteless. this dish had such interesting flavors in many different layers. the flavors in every bite were going under transformation inside my mouth. i seriously don't want to finish this dish because i don't want the experience to end. \n\nfourth course was my <mark><mark>Colorado Lamb Loin</mark></mark>, with stuffed piquillo peppers and prommes anna. portions were generous, or maybe i was just very full. the spices on the <mark><mark>Colorado Lamb Loin</mark></mark> didn't take away the flavors of the lamb at all. i didn't like the meat inside the piquillo peppers though, it was a bit too tough. otherwise, the whole pepper was fun to eat; it's not the textures that were interesting but flavors of the pepper and the meat were well blended. the prommes anna was very crispy in the outside, you can feel the flakey texture with your tongue too. unfortunately i was hitting my maximum capacity.\n\nthat's when they brought out our pre-dessert. it was a sweet drink with mango puree tasted sweet and sour, topped with some coconut rum foam. it reminded me of thailand, maybe because of the tropical taste. the tart taste ease up the digestion, which was just what i needed!\n\nand finally, the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> of mix served with coconut/lime sorbet. the looks of it wasn't too spectacular, just a bar with a piece of gold flake and two half nuts on top. yes gold flake isn't too spectacular. i liked the simplicity of it though. it tasted like a ferrero rocher in a bar form served with the sorbet on the side. the combination is great. the sweetness of the chocolate is evened out with a light citrus.\n\nour dinner ended at 11:30-11:45. it would have been a nightmare if they didn't tolerate that 10 minutes of tardiness. in addition, our server offered us to their lounge with no covers. it was a great offer monetary-wise, but we were just in such a rush before that we were nowhere close in dressed properly for lounges. maybe next time :)", 
            "the decor is amazing and elegant. plus, it is located in the 64 floor of the hotel, the view is just breath-taking. (the elevator ride was fun!)\nsometimes, if you find some restaurants with a great view, you need to expect the food to be not as good. but mix is different, the food is amazing!! \ni order a very boring appetizer: shrimp cocktail, but man that was no ordinary shrimp cocktail. it is so refreshing, and the sauce they made was so good.\nfor main course, i ordered the <mark><mark>Colorado Lamb Loin</mark></mark> which was sooooo delicious too. the favor of the lamb is so refined and you wount find that bad lamb smell. it was cooked perfectly medium rare and it was so tender. the layered potato was such a great plus as well, and there was even a lamb stuffed chili which was unique and flavorful.\na must try, if not for the food, please enjoy their lounge area!! \ni went with my girlfriends and we had a great time. i cant wait to take my husband there, it is also very romantic place!!",

            "the lighting in the photos made this all-white restaurant looked really good but in person, they looked like cheap plastics.\n\ncame here on a weeknight at around 9.30pm. very empty but better than crowded. the view was nice because we're on the top floor, but ok because there was nothing else besides lighted houses. \n\ngoat cheese w/whatever- do not like this because i don't like goat cheese. the top part that comprises of whatever was pretty good.\n\nroast maine lobster w/au curry & coconut rice- an american cum indian cum thai dish. very interesting. good this because it sounded so fusion. when i had my first bit at the threesome, all i could think of was how interesting it tasted. it wasn't phenomenal or aweful, but just not bad. not bad in an interesting way. i'm not even sure the coconut rice was made to have that kind of texture. lobster was well cooked just like the many i'd tried. \n\nchicken dish- can't remember the name but it baasically comprises of 2 chicken breast with a different marinate. one's good, one's so-so. skin's a little too salty but was cooked well. anybody who cooks knew that chicken was not an easy animal to cook. not easy to get it juicy and tender. one of the chicken was about 0.09% too dry.\n\n<mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark>(dessert)- our server twice what this was but still couldn't catch it. way too many layers. however, i love this for the taste of chocolate cake and candy. something like brownie, chocolate something and toffee. \n\nmaidelaine dipped in hazelnut chocolate cream- very good maidelaine. cream was good, not too sweet.\n\nour server was very cool and nice. they had bathrooms at 2 different location. one's at the restaurant itself and the other was at the adjoining lounge(which played some kinda euro/trance music i think). opted for the lounge because he mentioned the view. oh boy oh boy... sitting on the toilet bowl enjoying the magnificent view(of mandalay bay) was just awesome. it wasn't really the view but it was just sitting on the toilet bowl at the highest floor.", 
            "this restaurant is located on top of thehotel at mandalay bay and has one of best views in the city, imo. the decor is modern and has a really awesome glass chandelier that looks like a waterfall of bubbles. servers were very attentive and helpful. the food is pricey, but super fancy and well-thought-out.  i ordered the veggie terrine, which name alone, doesn't really sound great, but in actuality was totally fan-f*cking-tastic! the <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> was also delish. for dessert we split the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark>. omg. it's the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> of your wildest dreams.", 
            "let me start by saying that my experience at this restaurant was so good that i joined yelp! to write about it.\n\nwe arrived about 15 minutes early to our 6pm reservation. after a nice trip to the top of the hotel in a glass elevator, we were sitting in the fantastic lounge that overlooks the strip. the view is as amazing as everyone has said, and we enjoyed two very good cocktails which we then took over to our table when we were ready to eat.\n\nthe dinning room is a beautiful white with glass, contrasting the very dark lounge. we were seated on the outdoor patio, with the strip view accompanying our meal. it was a perfect night in the lv, no heat lamps were needed and it was a phenomenal setting.\n\nour server was extremely knowledgeable about food, and not just the food he was serving. he made great suggestions without trying to force particular dishes. waters were regularly refilled and plates cleared in a timely manner. great service.\n\nwe ordered a bacon, pumpkin and gnocchi appetizer. it was delicious, but i could have used a little bigger portion. bread was tasty, especially with the house made peanut butter.\n\nfor dinner my wife ordered the scallops. she loves scallops and thought these were particularly good. i order the steak au poivre, which was heavily crusted in black peppercorns, accompanied with various veggies and cooked perfectly. very tasty. the gruyere mac and cheese was also delicious.\n\nfor dessert were ordered the apple dish, mix is known for its <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> desert, but sadly i'm allergic to chocolate, so i had to settle for something else. the apple mulliere was tasty, but nothing life changing. i would say the best part of the dish was the green apple sorbet that accompanied it. \n\noverall the atmosphere combined with some pretty tasty food ensures that i will be returning here. two cocktails, an appetizer, a side, two entrees and dessert ended up being $177, but $50 was covered by the great deal on restaurant.com. for $127 this was fantastic.\n\neven if the meal is out of your price range, i would recommend trying to make it up here for a cocktail and the view. one of my favorite of many, many experiences in las vegas.", 
            "i wish i loved the food as much as the views and atmosphere. breads were good, especially enjoyed peanutbutter butter. shrimp cocktail had a fun twist. the beef tenderloin and cod were good. the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> was a tasty dessert. service was a bit snooty, but otherwise good.", 
            "i had had enough of watching the creation of impressive high-end dishes on top chef with relentless envy.  never could i taste and enjoy.  my frustration led me to the need to be wined and dined at an amazing restaurant.  fellow yelpers led me here: to mix restaurant.\n\nmy bf and i headed over to mandalay bay and started with some confusion as to the location of the restaurant.  after some inquires and a long walk, we found it!  well we found mix lounge and walked through the dark area into the light.  i would describe this restaurant with its hanging clear globes and immaculately white decor as trendy.  on a busy friday night with a 9pm reservation, the dining room was a bit loud and full.  we weren't looking for romantic, just impressive.  along with the amazing vegas views, the room was breathtaking.\n\nfood\nwe were looking to be completely indulgent and opted for the grand tasting menu-more than six courses.  in addition, we went with the wine pairings as an extra!  we began with the amuse bouche: a ceviche with apple gelee.  nice way to start the meal.  the spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> was a refreshing follow-up, one of my favorite courses.  the <mark>Tender Potato Gnocchi</mark> sat atop a pumkin puree and was topped with applewood smoked bacon-delicious.  the scallop dish had only one scallop but boy was it amazing!  for me, the lobser curry and rice dish was the showstopper.  i was delighted with the generous lobster portions-perfect!  for the bf, he loved the next course: lamb accompanied by eggplant and tomato.  i enjoyed the lamb but dislike the consistency of the roasted eggplant.  the visual appeal was also lacking (the only one out of all the previous dishes).  the one-noted brown on the plate did little to impress.  the pre-dessert was a fruity martini 2-layer concoction:  frothy pina colada on taop and thick guava nectar on bottom.  last came the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> plated along side a coconut lime ice cream.  the contrast between the chocolate and citrus ice cream was interesting and tasty.  we thought we were through but a server brought freshly baked madelines with a chocolate sauce.  although we appreciated the dessert, the other dessert far surpassed the cookies.\n\nwine pairings\nbe careful!  we were tipsy mid-way through the dinner even though we did not finish each of the 3oz. pourings of each wine.  all the wines complimented each dish perfectly.  the last wine was a dessert sherry that we didn't want to leave behind so we took it over to the lounge and enjoyed it there.\n\nservice\nthe service was impeccable from the beginning, however, we didn't appreciate being rushed through the end, especially with the amount of money we were spending.  the waiter informed us that the staff was waiting for us to pay off our check as he brought it over so that they could leave their shifts.  we weren't being asked to leave, he said, just pay quickly.  it was just 11pm (closing time) and a few other patrons were still there.  they lost a star for making us feel uncomfortable towards the end of the meal. i didn't expect that from an establishment such as this one and don't want to be made to feel that way again.\n\ni absolutely would recommend mix and return again but i'll make sure to plan on an earlier reservation.", 
            "there was a lot of build up coming into dinner here, and i can say that it lived up to it - barely. i expect a lot out of a restaurant that has a michelin star, and rightly so. those things aren't thrown around willy-nilly. \ni'll give my quick rundown then get into the details:\natmosphere: 4\nservice: 5\nfood: 4\n\nthe atmosphere is hard to beat when you're on the 64th floor facing out over the gorgeous las vegas strip. you enter the restaurant through the lounge which is dark and moody, but really lovely. it goes from nearly pitch black to an overwhelming sensation of light when you round the corner to the dining room. there is a massive 35 foot champagne bubble chandelier that takes over the center of the room. it's truly gorgeous and sets the mood for a classy but nouveau style experience. we were seated at a half booth, and one of my complaints was that the seating arrangements felt crowded. not only could we hear the conversations on both sides of us, but i had to put my jacket behind me because my neighbors' jacket was nearly touching me. when the waiters have to slide the tables to let you get in, i think it's a little close. that bothered me just a bit as this was our romantic valentines day dinner and i was hoping for a little more intimacy. \n\nthe service was impeccable. it seemed like all we had to do was think of something that we wanted and someone appeared to make it happen. they have multiple attendants along with your individual server for each section and it pays off. we were never let wanting or waiting. we asked for a slow service and to not have our entrees fired until our appetizer had been cleared to give us time to enjoy the meal and it was done perfectly. some places prefer not to do that because you take up time at the table, but they were very gracious and accommodated our request. the other thing i appreciated was the fact that they were there just enough-never over bearing. \n\nthe food is what i was really looking forward to. their bread basket contained 5 types of bread and 2 butters. the ciabatta and sourdough were my favorites. their house made peanut butter was to die for but didn't go with any of the breads. the house sommelier stopped by and we picked out first glass of wine to go with out appetizer, <mark>Tender Potato Gnocchi</mark> with pumpkin, crispy bacon, and veal jus. it was to die for. my boyfriend who is just beginning his foray into the gastronomic world was blown away. in a different setting, i dare say he would have licked the plate. my entr\\u00e9e was the surf & turf; lobster and stuffed chicken breast with salsify and wild mushrooms. the only dark spot on the plate was the chicken. i usually don't order chicken at restaurants because is it always overcooked, but i really wanted everything else on the plate. the chicken wasn't overcooked, but the 'stuffing' was lacking flavor and was so minimal. however, it was quickly picked up by the amazing flavor of the lobster and wild mushrooms. the salsify was cooked to perfection as well. it was incredibly delicious and there was so much lobster that i ate only a small portion of the chicken. my honey got the pork loin and belly over grits which he loved. there was also pulled pork in the pot that it came cooked in that tasted a little too much like its sauce came out of a heinz can, but that's just my opinion. he enjoyed it all. the creamy grits really complemented the heavy smoky flavor of the pork belly. for dessert we split the '<mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark>' which is their homemade cookie center <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark>. it was really good. the chocolate was smooth and creamy and the filling was crunchy and sweet. we were so full at that point, but they brought around freshly baked vanilla-bean madelines and nutella as a 'parting gift.' of course i put mine away quickly seeing as how madelines and nutella are two of my favorite things. their madelines were perfection. \n\nthe bill came out to $220 with tax and tip, and i find that to be very reasonable for what it was. it was a great dinner and we finished with a drink in the lounge looking out over the strip. good times!", 
            "i was wary of mix because of the mixed reviews(pun intended), and asked, when making our reservations, if the exec chef would be in that tuesday night.   it would be our only michelin restaurant  on this trip and i wanted to visit the mix lounge next door.  we had an early reservation in order to make it to le reve, so there was almost no one in the restaurant, and there was still sunlight.   the restaurant seems to face east and west, so there was really no direct view of the strip, so the view was a little overstated.  the room was marvelous, with the thousand bubble chandelier--glass balls handblown in italy and imported to mix.  the service was attentive and pleasant.  we always had our water and iced tea refilled with smiles.  they served us a french butter and a chocolate butter, which paired wonderfully with the walnut bread provided.\n\nwe started with the spicy tuna salad, which was really a <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> and the sea bream sashimi.  the sashimi had a popcorn garnish to add an interesting texture, and it was fresh, but we weren't wowed by it.  the <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> though was delicious--you could smell its freshness as it was placed on our table, and we enjoyed every morsel of this dish!  for entrees, we had the tenderloin and the surf n turf, which was stuffed chicken with a small piece of lobster.  my lovely wife gobbled up the delicious lobster and had a little harder time with the chicken, which i eventually finished.  the tenderloin was small, but tender and flavorful and was one of the best steaks i've had--better than morton's, but not as good as jiraffe's.  for dessert, we had their signature \"<mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark>\", which is kind of a combination of a cake bar with a crunchy waffle-like bottom--very good--and the decaf coffee had that nice \"cigarette\" taste to it.  \n\nafterwards, we walked over to the empty lounge and marveled at the view there.  it had a northern exposure and you could see the las vegas strip in all its gaudy magnificence.  we enjoyed our meal very much, and would like to return to enjoy a cocktail in the lounge afterwards.", 
            "the rating is really a 4.5. my boyfriend took me here for during our bi-annual trip to vegas. what a great choice! first off, this place is, hands down, nicest decor i've ever seen for a restaurant/lounge. second, the appetizers and desserts here are amazing. third, the view is breathtaking.\n\ndecor: 5\nfood: appetizers 5, entrees 3.5, dessert 5\nservice: 3.5\nprice: it's what you expect to pay. note** we didn't end up ordering any drinks so i can't tell you how good (or bad) those are\n\nfood: for the appetizers we ordered the tuna tar tar and <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> (the bigger portion). the tuna tartar was delicious but the<mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> was amazing. the pieces are pretty damn generous and it sits in this slightly sweet sauce (but i like the taste of it by itself). my gosh, this really set my standard for good <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>. i would come back just to order a bunch of <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> for myself. for the entrees, we ordered halibut and sea bass. now, i'm not a big fan of those two fishes to begin with so to me, the entrees were just okay. however, my boyfriend loves halibut and he said that it was cooked very well. now comes the dessert, we ordered the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark>. yum yum yum!  it's basically a chocolate, peanut butter and graham cracker (with other stuff i don't remember) bar with a lime coconut sorbet on the side. the rich chocolate and light sorbet really really complemented each other well.\n\nservice: our waiter wasn't the most attentive but he was definitely the most honest, which i appreciate. the downside was, he always seemed to be walking away and was always hard to track down. he was also a big fan of upselling everything. sheesh, please stop. however, the upside? he would straight up tell us whether something was good or not. i loved it. \"is this good?\" \"no not at all\" haha i do appreciate that he didn't try to water down how much he hated something.\n\ni would've given this place a 5 if the entrees weren't so underwhelming (maybe i just ordered the wrong things?) but oh well. i loved everything else\n\none more thing, when they ask you if you want sparkling or flat water, just say tap. i made the mistake of thinking it was tap and they ended up bringing over voss water which cost a whopping $10. $10 for water? come on now. i will know better for next time.\n\nobviously people come here for the view, which, from the restaurant is nice. but if you want the really good view, head over to the lounge area and take a look. it's easily the best view i've seen of the strip so far.", 
            "has dinner at mix tonight for our last meal in vegas. we decided to come a little early and check out the lounge, which opens at 5pm. there were families there partaking in hh and the gorgeous views from the 64th floor. we ordered a bottle of white wine, and enjoyed a glass overlooking the strip. the views are fabulous. the rest of our bottle was brought to our table. our waiter was from the big island of hawaii and he was very nice. he recommended several things. i typically ask the wait staff what their favorite items are the menu are. bread basket was yummy and diverse. we ordered: shrimp cocktail: 5 medium shrimp on a \"horseradish crust\" with some greens and cocktail sauce. was not impressed. couldnt taste the horseradish. when i asked for more horseradish, they didnt have any? is that weird if it was made with it? asked for lemons and tabasco; salad: greens came in a huge bowl w balsamic vinaigrette. bf liked it; chicken: loved the chicken. best chicken i have ever had. great crust. <mark>Braised Wagyu</mark>: amazingly tender. kind of like beef stew, but the sauce was reduced a bit more. it was awesome!; <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> dessert: good. tasted almost like a kit kat. homemade vanilla ice cream was good. they also gave us some fresh profiteroles that we dipped in melted chocolate. so yummy. decor and location was gorgeous, food was very good. service was top notch. will return!", 
            "hmmm, mix is more like a 3.5...\n\nthe atmosphere, decor, views etc, are amazing! the view overlooking the strip at night is really pretty fantastic.\n\nthe service was so so. we sat in the lounge before dinner, and we could not get service and the place was not very busy. the dinner service was decent and our server was a nice guy, he was just slow. and towards the end of the night, he was downright holding us hostage.\n\nfood was hit and miss... for apps, we had the tuna tartar and the shrimp cocktail. the tuna was pretty good. they could have had a few more \"chips\" on the plate. the shrimp cocktail was more like a salad. it was unique and delicious.\n\nfor dinner, we had sea bass and filet, and mac and cheese, creamed spinach, and mashed potatoes. the sea bass was ok. filet was good. i ordered the filet with pepper crusted with a side of black pepper corn sauce. that was pretty tasty. the mac and cheese was sooooo yummy, and quite frankly, the highlight of this meal. the mashed potatoes were decent. the creamed spinach was forgettable.\n\nfor dessert, we ordered the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark>. it was a hazelnutty delight topped off with a lime coconut sorbet. \n\nall in all, we spent about $115 per person, not including tip. the experience was fun and definitely \"vegas\", but i have had much better dining experiences (in vegas and outside of vegas) for the price, and for much less.", 
            "towering over the strip at the top of mandalay bay awaits a stunning view, and not much else.  alain ducasse's mix, offers little more than a brilliant view, and a unique decor.  think, eating inside a champagne bottle in a swedish furniture store.\n\nbefore getting to your table, you will walk through mix's club/lounge.  this awkward identity crisis of an area is enough to throw off what could be a very relaxing and luxurious ambience.  \n\nthe food was good, not great.  especially disappointing was the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> on the dessert menu.  the cucumber sorbet was light, breezy and refreshing, and certainly the highlight of the meal.  \n\neven after the delicious sorbet, i left mix with a bitter taste in my mouth.  \n\nstop up for a cocktail and take in the view.  it is far more satisfying than the food.",

            "fortunately, a fabulous view and gorgeous decor can save mix from what would have otherwise been a 3 star review. i had my bachelorette dinner here, and had talked to the banqueting manager to arrange a private room for a party of 18. however, when we arrived, we were a little disappointed that we weren't in any kind of private section, but instead, smack dab in the middle of the restaurant. also, instead of having all of us sit at one table, they arranged it so that we had to be divided into three tables, which was kind of a bummer and a little awkward for some of my guests. we all ordered off a set menu which came with: chilled zucchini soup with fresh ricotta and basil, either the free range chicken with wild mushrooms or the slow cooked salmon served with apple mustard, jasmine rice, and seasonal vegetables, and the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> which was basically a chocolate wafer dessert. sadly, the dessert was the only redeeming course of the entire meal for me as i could barely touch my soup and salmon. first of all, what is with vegas and cold soup? i guess it's because of the scorching hot weather out there, but still, i do not need to drink cold soup when i'm inside a perfectly air-conditioned room. then after my brother made the comment \"this soup reminds me of 2 girls 1 cup\", it was definitely game over for everyone at our table. also, from what i heard from my friends, the chicken was a little better than the salmon, but unfortunately, i ordered the salmon and had one bite and was so turned off from the overbearing mustard sauce that was poured all over my dish... i know, this is a lot of hating for a 4-star review, but honestly, i'm sure if we weren't limited to the prix fixe menu, the food would have been a lot better because the ala carte items on their menu sound amazing. would definitely come back to try this place again with a smaller party and hopefully the food won't disappoint me again...",

            "this place earned the 5 stars.  service was exceptional.  all the staff were smiling, no one walked by without checking my table to see if i needed anything or to remove a dirty dish or pick up and empty sweet 'n low packet.  my server was haydee, and she was marvelous!\n\ni got the ducasse classics, the grand tasting menu.  before ordering, i asked the area manager for my section of the restaurant--who took my order--if i could switch dessert because i didn't want to have the baba au rhum with the small bottles of rum and cream alternately poured on the cake.  he had me look at their \\u00e0 la carte menu and pick any dessert from that--even the souffl\\u00e9 and he would substitute.  that's customer service and it's very accommodating. \n\nbread basket:  standard types of bread.  one in particular had red bell pepper baked in it.  that was great!  there was regular butter in a small holder with two sides.  on the other side was a peanut butter spread.  it was excellent when you let it come to room temperature.  heavenly flavors.\n\nthe courses:\n\namuse bouche:  mango and shrimp coulis with sliced daikon and sliced red radish.  very light and tasty.\n\nappetizer:  <mark>Tender Potato Gnocchi</mark> with two varieties of mushrooms, sunchoke, parmigiano reggiano with veal jus.  there were a couple of baby escarole pieces that just set off the presentation of the items.  the gnocchi were absolutely the softest gnocchi i have had!  superb!\n\nfish:  roasted maine lobster \"au curry\" on bed of coconut basmati rice.  there was not much curry flavor at all which would please some because there was certainly no flavor to overwhelm the delicate and sweet lobster. i tasted no coconut flavor in the basmati rice.     one small glitch here--there was a piece of lobster shell i bit into.  now, if i were scott conant on \"chopped\" i would have made that deep frown and made some remark about good chefs being careful about what they serve.  it happens and was no big deal.\n\nmeat:  <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> rossini.  a perfectly cooked filet--rare just as i asked with a large piece of delicate <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and several slices of black truffle.  it's the first truffle i ever had.  before, someone merely waved some truffle above the food and said, \"ok, here's your xxxxxxx with black truffle oil.\"  this was very tasty!\n\npre-dessert:  a martini glass with a passion fruit base and a rum foam for a topping.  very refreshing and an excellent palate cleanser.\n\ndessert:  <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark>.  a <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> made with alternate layers of graham cracker and chocolate all dipped in chocolate.  there was some edible gold leaf on the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark>.  with it was a lime coconut sorbet.  the lime was very dominating such that again i tasted no coconut.  they must use only a small amount of coconut flavoring.\n\npost dessert, dessert:  a different server brings to your table some warm madeleines in their mold fresh from the oven.  you remove your own madeleines with your fingers.  you also get a small bowl of nutella with a very small spoon to spread the heavenly hazelnut-chocolate goodness on your madeleine.\n\ni think i'll make a return visit here when it's winter and it's darker early.  the city's lights were just coming on but it wasn't yet dark enough to fully enjoy the lights of this great city!", 
            "came here on the saturday before the 4th of july. in our group of four, me and my bf had the taste of mix tasting menu and got the wine pairing to go with it. the other two had the classic tasting menu and wine pairing. the atmosphere is classy and looks beautiful at night. \n\ni don't remember the whole meal, but here are the things i do remember...\nthe amuse bouches were great. the first course was a salad which was just alright. the next dish had <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and apricot which was amazing. the entree i remember being good...i think it was lamb. the dessert was a \"<mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark>\" which was rich and chocolately..but a little to heavy for my liking. each glass of wine was very well paired with each course.\n\nthe mood of our meal changed drastically when i found a piece of thin glass in my wine. yup...a piece of glass about the size of a half dollar. luckily, it stuck to the side of my wine glass so i didn't get to my mouth. also, the manager came over and apologized took off the cost of 2 wine pairings. they handled it well, but something like that should have never happened. who knows what could've happened if i swallowed that piece of glass.", 
            "this review is for the restaurant. \nmy husband and i came here for our 5 year anniversary dinner tonight. i did my research and thought this would be a good place to go. the food was wonderful. we had, for starters, the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> (half order), <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> (half order), and <mark>Maine Lobster Salad</mark>. for our entrees we had the <mark>Braised Wagyu</mark> and <mark>Cod Brandade</mark>. both were very tasty. for my dessert i had the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> w/ caramel ice cream. \nmy gripes with this restaurant was that we were seated on a round table between two square tables. it was awkwardly situated and did not make for a very comfortable meal. at least we were seated by a window with a pretty nice view. my next gripe is with the waiter (big caucasian blond guy) who talked and laughed with the tables next to us and made no effort with the two of us. i wonder if it's because we didn't order a bottle of wine. i forgot my zantac, so i didn't think drinking wine would be wise. my husband ordered a mojito and he totally forgot about it prompting us to have to remind him and when he wanted a second drink, we had to ask the busboy (sorry, i don't know what to call him). by the way, the busboy and the buslady were nice and friendly. my husband wanted to give the waiter a bad tip, but i convinced him against it because i wanted the other helpful staff to get what they deserved. we tipped the usual 18% even though the waiter clearly didn't deserve it. with the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and wagyu we weren't sure what we were supposed to eat it with. a good waiter would have made suggestions for sides to improve the enjoyment of our meal. \nso the verdict: the food was great, but the experience was lacking considering the amount of money we spent, $200+.\ni've been to many amazing restaurants, including french laundry, jar, lucques, osteria mozza, etc... this was by far the worst experience i've ever had at a fine dining establishment.", 
            "i had two amazing dinners here on a recent trip to vegas. i had to go twice because the first time was so wonderful, i had to see if it wasn't just a fluke. \n\nfirst off - if you get a waiter named randy, you are set! he is so attentive and friendly (without being invasive). \n\nthe ambiance of the entire room is like you're floating on a cloud - the glass bubbles that surround the central seating creates a fun vibe. we wondered why many of the tables near the window in the restaurant don't have the best view of the strip. we figured it was for two reasons: (1) so the mix nightclub and balcony dining could have the amazing view; (2) so the diners would focus inward on the clean and bright decor. \n\nafter reviewing the menu, randy gave us his suggestions for dinner. definitely get the shrimp cocktail with the spicy sauce to start. the horseradish isn't overwhelming since it's tempered by the tomato sauce. \n\nwe also tried the steak rossini - one of chef ducasse's specialties. for my taste, it was a little heavy for me, but still very flavorful and tender. \n\nthe pepper-crusted buffalo is another great choice if you're looking for a leaner cut of beef. \n\nthe star of the menu (in my opinion) is the <mark>Cod Brandade</mark> with lemon, capers, brown butter, and fried parsley. amazing doesn't begin to describe how velvety smooth this fish is prepared. it simply melts into your mouth and you wish that the dish will never end! \n\nif it's summer, try the asparagus as a side - they shave down the sides of the stalk, relieving some of that woody texture to it. steamed, then finished in olive oil and butter, it'll make you want to finish all your vegetables. \n\nno dinner is complete without dessert....but what does mix do? they bring you a complementary lemon cookie (warm) from the pastry kitchen to be eaten with nutella. wow!! but, don't you dare stop there! be sure you have the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> (and ask for another scoop of caramel ice cream to be served with it). simply the perfect finish. \n\ni'd happily go back here again and hope you have the same experience as i did. cheers!", 
            "great service! spectacular view! good food!\nhad the ribeye, lobster au curry, mac n cheese,  too bad no room for dessert. \nribeye(med-rare)- perfectly pan seared\nlobster au curry- party in my mouth, delicious.\nmac n' cheese- way too cheesy! consisitancy made it seem like they melted some cheese in heavy whipping cream, but went cheap on the quality ofcheese, the bits of ham were just weird.\ndrinks- green tea, surpisingly served at the right temperature and loose leaf, no tea bags here, wait staff even told me to wait a few minutes for it to properly steep (brownie points), & seirra nevada, nice pairing with  steak for non vinophiles.\n2nd visit still 5 stars. this time it was a toss up between lamb and <mark>Braised Wagyu</mark>. i got the wagyu on waiters suggestion, it tasted like pot roast, oh well. steak was again perfect. i finally got to try the lemon verbana tea, excellent. the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> itself tasted like a freshly made kit kat, mixed with the lime sorbet, it becomes that perfect nye kiss. service was on point.", 
            "first dinner of the new year @mix. we came for the view and the food and the restaurant did not disappoint.  \n\na private glass elevator takes you directly to the top while you enjoy the view on the ascent to the 65th floor. it was a little confusing arriving in the dark and walking thru a long bar/club area and then past the kitchens before we were greeted (a hostest was not present at the booth either so we were confused on where to go). however, we did eventually find our table. the decor is a curtain of glass bubbles with white and red accents.  this place looked ready for a great valentine's day date. \n\nour cheerful and friendly server arrived soon after we were seated in our booth and was eager to please us. throughout our service, he provided detailed descriptions about the dishes and knowledgeable explanations about how each entree was prepared.  he was as excited talking about the food as we were to try it!\n\nwe started with the <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>.  it had all my favorite ingredients (fresh crab, avocado, cilantro, cucumber, etc) but there was a lingering bitter aftertaste that we could not place. it distracted from the flavors of the dish and we were ready to move on to the  next course.\n\nfor the main course, i tried the rack of lamb/tenderloin with a tian of eggplant.  the lamb was so flavorful and tender (prepared seared and then sous vide) on a bed of caramelized onions with tomato and the eggplant, tomato tian was bursting with fresh flavor that complemented the lamb well.  my husband ordered the atlantic seabass in a shellfish sauce.  also well prepared (seared and then baked) with melt in your mouth flavors. \n\nevery meal should end on a sweet note and mix reserves a whole page of their menu just for dessert!  i ordered the profiteroles for one.  it's 6 mini cream puffs served with some homemade chocolate sauce and a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream.  it reminded me of a \"deconstructed\" eclair. my husband opted for the signature <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark>. covered in chocolate with gold leaf and delicate wafer thin slices inside - it's a <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> to eat with a fork, if only to savor it a little bit longer. the lime coconut sorbet that comes with the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> is more lime than coconut and provides a tart contrast (maybe too much) to the delicately sweet <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark>.  compliments of our server, we received another delight with a freshly baked lemon madeleine (served right out of the pan) to dip in chocolate spread to top off our evening. \n\nas you stroll along on your way out, there are bathrooms tucked away just before the elevator. in the ladies room, two of the stalls have floor to ceiling windows for you to gaze outside as you go about your business (i'm told there's a similar set up in the men's room).  it takes a moment to remind yourself that it's one-way glass and what you really came to the ladies room to do. \n\nall in all, dinner at mix was a great start to the new year. \n\nsummary: delicious food, awesome views, great service. definitely would recommend to a friend and we will return again.", 
            "ate dinner at the restaurant -- overall a very nice experience.  food was generally very good, service is nice, and atmosphere and view are great.\n\ngreat\n- hazelnut souffle -- the best souffle i have ever had i can recall.   top was crispy while the inside was still light and not overly sweet.\n- the curry lobster over coconut rice --  wonderfully rich sauce\n- <mark>Tender Potato Gnocchi</mark> app - great, light texture.  loved how they peeled the asparagus to make it extra tender\n\njust ok\n- foie appetizer was average (needed more seasoning)\n- the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> - would be better if it was dark chocolate\n\nbut overall nice experience.   the bathrooms have a unique view too!", 
            "i had a great time at mix. i originally reserved for 2 people at 9pm. my horrible airport experience forced me to be 10-15 minutes late and not be able to change into a nicer outfit. they were very nice about the tardiness, assuming how the restaurant hours was until 10pm, and usually these dinners take long. my date and i were not rushed or anything during our dinner.\n\nthis place is beautiful! the bubbly decor coming from the ceiling made me think that i was dining under the sea. yet i'm at the very top of thehotel at mandalay bay. our booth was facing the backside of the strip, so the scenery was more mellow and calming than the glamorous strip, my dinner felt extremely relaxing although i was rushing there and freaking out at the airport.\n\nwe both ordered the tasting menu, which had a spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, halibut, <mark><mark>Colorado Lamb Loin</mark></mark>, and the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark>. i believe the entire table has to choose one of the tasting menus if any wanted to try it. my date didn't want to in the beginning since he wasn't into <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> or lamb. our server offered to switch out the lamb for the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> for $10 extra. \n\nwe started off the meal with a scallop ceviche. i enjoyed it a lot, it's very light, and the lime juice wasn't too overwhelming like most of the places that served ceviche. it was just right. it's interesting how they have some shredded raw mango on top, felt like some type of fusion going on here. \n\ni was enthralled by the looks of the spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>. very detailed with different layers of ingredients stacked up, but i had too high of expectations on the flavors. i don't recall it being spicy or crabby enough. for spiciness, i might be immune so my taste buds are less sensitive to spiciness. i was a bit disappointed there.\n\nsecond course came about with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> with lemon confit & dates. i liked how mine was seared just right, where it's more rare inside. i love the aftertaste and the aroma from each bite. unfortunately, i'm not too educated in <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, all i can tell you is if i liked it and met my expectations of it. i got to eat my date's piece too, since he's not too interested in something this rich in taste. his piece was a bit more cooked than mine, easier to slice, i just prefer a softer texture.\n\nthird course was the best one yet, halibut prepared in chicken jus and vegetable blanquette. every. bite. was. amazing. my general perception of halibut is that it's very bland and tasteless. this dish had such interesting flavors in many different layers. the flavors in every bite were going under transformation inside my mouth. i seriously don't want to finish this dish because i don't want the experience to end. \n\nfourth course was my <mark><mark>Colorado Lamb Loin</mark></mark>, with stuffed piquillo peppers and prommes anna. portions were generous, or maybe i was just very full. the spices on the <mark><mark>Colorado Lamb Loin</mark></mark> didn't take away the flavors of the lamb at all. i didn't like the meat inside the piquillo peppers though, it was a bit too tough. otherwise, the whole pepper was fun to eat; it's not the textures that were interesting but flavors of the pepper and the meat were well blended. the prommes anna was very crispy in the outside, you can feel the flakey texture with your tongue too. unfortunately i was hitting my maximum capacity.\n\nthat's when they brought out our pre-dessert. it was a sweet drink with mango puree tasted sweet and sour, topped with some coconut rum foam. it reminded me of thailand, maybe because of the tropical taste. the tart taste ease up the digestion, which was just what i needed!\n\nand finally, the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> of mix served with coconut/lime sorbet. the looks of it wasn't too spectacular, just a bar with a piece of gold flake and two half nuts on top. yes gold flake isn't too spectacular. i liked the simplicity of it though. it tasted like a ferrero rocher in a bar form served with the sorbet on the side. the combination is great. the sweetness of the chocolate is evened out with a light citrus.\n\nour dinner ended at 11:30-11:45. it would have been a nightmare if they didn't tolerate that 10 minutes of tardiness. in addition, our server offered us to their lounge with no covers. it was a great offer monetary-wise, but we were just in such a rush before that we were nowhere close in dressed properly for lounges. maybe next time :)", 
            "i have been to this restaurant 5-6 times and i always enjoy it. my friends from japan loved it so much too. their <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> is wonderful!! their signature dish, lobster curry, is crazy good. i never really care for lobster but this is different. i wish i could make it at home!! i always have issue with their portion...(in a good way). their portion is pretty decent that i always feel too full after a full course menu!! sometimes i can't even eat dessert because i'm too full!! i like the ambiance. i would not \"expect\" a window seating as window seatings are limited (does not matter how early you make your reservation.) the view is available from the bar anyway.\n\nalso, their deserts, especially the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark>.... is amazing!\n\nas far as service goes, i have never had issue personally.i believe it's worth a visit and great place for a great meal!", 
            "i ate dinner here twice. the first time was 3 yrs ago and the second time was this past weekend. we were seated outside and fortunately the weather was warm...when it did get chilly there were plenty of heat lamps to keep us warm. located at the top of the hotel, the restaurant is simply decorated with a gorgeous bubble chandelier lighting as the masterpiece. the view of the strip and vegas all around is amazing. the lounge area is nice and mellow but both times i didn't have the chance to try it out.\n\nwe ordered the prefix menu which included the spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, seared diver scallops, <mark><mark>Colorado Lamb Loin</mark></mark> and <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark>. we skipped the beverage pairing and ordered two bottles separately - a delicious and fruity sauvignon blanc by honig and a merlot (forgot name). the food was outstanding, the first and second time. i particularly liked the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, scallops and <mark><mark>Colorado Lamb Loin</mark></mark>. all prepared just perfectly. they even provided us complimentary dish at the beginning and a drink in the middle to clean our palette. the frothy, peachy drink was delicious...so yummy we asked our waiter to hook us up with another round which he was nice enough to oblige. the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> was okay...we all agreed they taste similar to a kit kat bar.\n\nthe whole experience was fantastic...food, service, experience!", 
            "amazing views of vegas and a great patio setup, i also enjoyed the minimalist decor. however, the food is more than overpriced and the service was average at best.. \n\nwe had a different head server after our mains, only to go back to the original server when the check was brought out..\n\nour salads and soups were average, but it was all down hill from there..\n\ni've never seen a peppercorn crusted steak with so much pepper before and cooked way over mid-rare..\n\nwhatever you do skip the souffle and the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark>, first off the souffle was way under baked, liquid in the center and cold. the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> is dressed up whatchamacallit.\n\nmaybe we were there on a bad night, but i wouldn't recommend anyone risk it at these prices.", 
            "i've eaten at mix three times now and while it's definitely only a three star as far as cuisine is concerned, i would still probably return...\n\nfirst of all, the restaurant is absolutely gorgeous. fantastic ambiance. the lounge area is a vegas absolute must and the main reason i'll probably return again and again. if i were to rate <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> on the lounge (view) and the decor, i'd have to give it 5 stars. \n\nnow to the food and service. the food is just okay. not good... i promise you won't be blown away... not bad either. just food on a plate that tastes okay. \n\ni ordered the lobster curry for my latest meal. it was lobster in a non-spicy, light curry sauce. nothing fancy or brilliant about it. i probably could have done something better at home. \n\ni had the <mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> for an appetizer. it was very good... but again... something i could have easily created in my home kitchen. when i go out i'd rather be wow'd by wondering how the chef could have prepared something so wonderful. you won't find any of that at mix. \n\nthe service was good. we had two large tables and they serviced our needs quite well... though the meal probably took a little longer you'd expect, but they try to time everything just right.\n\nthis is pretty much how i'd summarize every meal i've eaten at mix. something you can easily prepare at home that tastes good but you'll pay a pretty penny for at a nicely decorated restaurant with good service. \n\nif you've never been there... i'd highly recommend at least checking out the lounge area. it's probably one of the top two or three places that i love having an evening cocktail at and watch the sunset. get tipsy enough and you certainly won't mind paying for a meal there.", 
            "this was the gem of our trip to las vegas. first we arrived about fifteen minutes early so we were able to enjoy a drink out on the patio. it was very hot, but worth it for the view.\nour favorites: bass ceviche, cod, creamed spinach and the deserts: <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> and coffee and chocolate opera\nnot so great: spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> (too fishy)  and mac and cheese (too many noodles, not enough cheese)\nwe also had the braised waygu, a filet, a <mark>New York Strip</mark> and fork smashed potatoes, all great.\nour server was great until we had our main course and then it was difficult to find him again to order coffee and dessert. his helper was phenomenal all night.\nwe will definitely be back for both the view and the fabulous food. our bill included a bottle of wine and about 7 cocktails and was just under 500 dollars.",

            "recommended by a friend to come here, i paid them a visit on my most recent vegas trip. have your cab driver drop you off at thehotel since the elevators to go up to the 64th floor where the restaurant is located is right when you walk in!\n\nthe minute that i stepped out of the elevator and approached the restaurant, i was taken back by the all white decorations. i love it! absolutely sleek and chic. we were seated by the window. it's kinda weird how they have it so that your backs are to the windows but no big complaints there. it was nice to enjoy our meal and when we occasionally turn around, we were able to take in the view.\n\nthey started us off with a bread basket that includes 2 kinds of butter: sea salt & peanut. now, i'm normally not a peanut butter fan but this was so good! it was creamy with a hint of sweetness. i would've been happy just eating bread with the peanut butter but wait! it doesn't stop here, it gets better!\n\ni ordered the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> rossini w/ <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and my date ordered the rib-eye with asparagus as a side. although i enjoyed the rib-eye, i believe the dish worth raving about is the <mark>Filet Mignon</mark>! it came with mashed potatoes. the filet was tender and juicy at the same time. the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> just melts in your mouth and was so tasty! i couldn't get enough. prior to ordering we had ask the waitress for recommendations on red wine. she recommended the syrah which went extremely well with our steaks.\n\nour waitress was extremely soft spoken it was sometimes hard to hear her. i also felt the service was not as attentive as it could've been. the bus boy seems to be around our table more and was extremely friendly. i noticed he was conversing with other guests at other tables too. when he learned that we were on the trip for my birthday celebration, he got me a complimentary dessert which consisted of  sweet breads and nutella spread. so sweet of him! aside from that, we also ordered the <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> which has coconut and lime sorbet. totally worth it!!! the chocolate was sweet while the coconut filled made it a little crunchy. perfect combination.\n\nafter our dinner experience we went to the lounge and wanted to step outside to snap some photos. since mandalay bay is all the way at the end of the strip, you are able to see the view of the whole strip from the lounge area. we were stopped and told that only those with bottle service could be outside. what? lame... \n\noverall, mix has given me such a good experience that i will be back next time and will tell my friends to give it a try!", 
            "totally amazing view that is only surpassed by the incredible level of service you will receive.   our personal favorites are stephanie who has a great personality and truly understands that there is an art to providing perfect service, being very attentive and greeting you with a warm smile.  the manager, tram, is likewise incredible. she will greet you with a smile, take time to talk with you and see how your experience is progressing and will help out when needed.  the food is outstanding with the braised short rib tacos being out of this world, amazingly tender and delicious short rib meat in a corn tortilla with chopped onion and cilantro combined with a squeeze of lime tops this marvel of flavor off.  there is a <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> desert that is equally on the \"to die for\" scale.  decadently rich hand made <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> similar to a snicker's bar with an amazing coconut sorbet that cleanses the palate   you have not been to vegas until you have been to the mix", 
            "touting itself as french cuisine with an american influence, this restaurant sits in an enviable location at the very tippy top of thehotel in las vegas.\n\nmy first trip to las vegas was due to an it expo going on, and we had been sent out armed with a list of places to try and restaurants to visit, with mix being a regularly recommended location.\n\nsome of our friends had decided to meet up with us for a few days during our vegas trip, and they were equally excited to eat at mix for the first time.\n\nfrom the discreet glass elevator that shoots up the outside of the hotel and offers a changing view of vegas, to the stunning d\\u00e9cor inside the varied bar and eating areas, to the panoramic view from the restaurant that comes alive as the sun goes down and the vegas lights come up, everything at mix is designed to be an experience that will leave you with a fantastic impression.\n\nthe staff are softly spoken and perform at the caliber you expect from an alain ducasse restaurant: quick on their feet, taking the time to discuss the menu without rushing any decisions, respectfully disappearing if more time is needed and knowledgeable about everything on offer and nicely versed on the wine list and suitable pairings.\n\nbetween everyone at our table we sampled the following:\n* complimentary bread basket sampler accompanied by perfectly spreadable butter studded with peanuts.\n* we ordered <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> with palm hearts, guacamole & cilantro, shrimp cocktail with horseradish and spring baby vegetable salad with an herby basil dressing as starters for the table to share.\n* 2x <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> rossini with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> & a black truffle sauce\n* 1x roasted maine lobster au curry with basmati rice\n* 1x <mark>Cod Brandade</mark> with lemon, capers, brown butter, croutons and fried parsley\n* we ordered fork crushed (the fancy way of saying expensively mashed) potatoes, <mark>Creamy Spinach</mark> and saut\\u00e9ed <mark>Sauteed Green Asparagus</mark> as sides to share.\n* complimentary madeleines (which were absolutely perfect) with a chocolate dipping sauce for everyone after dinner to bide us over while we decided on what to try for dessert.\n* 1x <mark>Mix Candy Bar</mark> with a textured coconut & lime sorbet\n* 1x chocolate cherry pudding with chocolate crisps & black cherries\n\nthe food was fantastic, but at mix prices i would expect it to do everything but dance on the table while singing a show tune.  \n\neverything was perfectly cooked, seasoned and flavoured: \n* the steaks were done exactly as requested, although the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> lacked the impact i was hoping for and tasted just like any other goose liver pate i've had (it was my first time trying it and i was a little underwhelmed)\n* the cod was glorious and the accompanying sauce was perfect\n* the lobster curry was phenomenal\n\nhowever, as someone with a raging, barely controlled sweet tooth the dessert options were a little limited but still of a superb quality nonetheless.\n\nthe wines suggested by our server were superb and all the cocktails we had at the bar afterwards were excellent.\n\non the way out i noticed what appeared to be the smallest dance floor in the world tucked away almost as an afterthought, however at a vegas altitude where every square metre of space comes at a premium i don't blame them for compromising their dance floor for extra dining space.\n\ni get the feeling that the staff were specifically chosen to bring a warm touch to what had the potential to be a very pretentious experience.  this is definitely a restaurant to try at least once, and i recommend that you try to time your visit around the sunset as this will give you a memorable view of vegas."

            "i can't really think of a better \"special occasion\" restaurant in america. right off the bat, the view of the las vegas strip from the lounge is breathtaking. it's a fantastic place to have a few drinks before dinner, or just in general if you aren't there to dine. even the view from the restroom is fantastic. the main dining room is very contemporary and minimalistic. hundreds of hand-blown glass bubbles fill the area, so it almost feels like you're sitting in a glass of champagne. but what really sets this restaurant apart is the food. from start to finish, everything we tried was exceptional. the one dish that really stands out in my mind was the fillet <mark>Filet Mignon Rossini</mark>. being a big fan of <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark>, chef alain ducasse really hit a grand slam with this dish. it was easily the best steak i've ever had. on the downside, the prices are a bit on the upper end but you certainly won't be disappointed. so if you're ever in the las vegas area for a special occasion, mix should be on the top of your list for fine dining dinner spots.", 
            "we were in vegas for a conference and went to mix as a second choice as the restaurant we wanted to go to was full. i cannot believe our luck. the food was incredible, the decor was excellent, and the view was unbeatable. very impressive. would highly recommend. \n\nwe started with the gnocchi which was pillowy and the mushrooms were flavorful and fresh. for the main dishes we had the roasted lobster curry which was wonderful and i had the fillet <mark>Filet Mignon Rossini</mark> (fillet with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and black truffle) which was frankly one of the best things i have ever eaten. the pairing of foie and beef is incredible. finished off with a chocolate souffle. who could ask for anything more.\n\nafter dinner we went to the mix lounge for a cocktail and some music. incredible service and fun people. \n\ngreat time at the mix.  my new favorite las vegas restaurant."

            "this is a review for the restaurant, which i just walked out of 15 minutes ago. :)  my party and i chose to go for their better tasting menu which included four courses plus an amuse bouche and pre-dessert dish.  here's the breakdown:\n\n1. amuse bouche: thai coconut chicken soup aka tom ka gai.  a nice touch, but i've had better tom ka gai at my local thai restaurant.  too much lemongrass, and not enough sweetness.  not bad, but not great.\n\n2. first course: gnocchi with asparagus and morels in a cream sauce.  i personally liked this dish, i felt that the delicate flavors were well balanced and a perfect introduction for what was to come.  my sister felt that this dish was a little on the bland side, but then again, she has a cold, so i'm not sure if her taste buds are fully functioning, lol.\n\n3. second course: roasted maine lobster \"au curry\" with coconut basmati rice.  i was a little apprehensive when i saw \"curry\" and \"lobster\" in the same sentence, but this was actually a very unique and pleasant twist on how i normally experience lobster.  when dining at gary danko in san francisco, my go-to dish is the butter-poached maine lobster with risotto, and here we have a similar dish with an indian touch...delicious!\n\n4. third course: <mark>Filet Mignon</mark> rossini with <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> and black truffle.  i do love my tournedos rossini and mix does it beautifully here.  my velvety filet practically melted in my mouth and the <mark><mark>Seared Duck Foie Gras</mark></mark> was richer than butter.  the chef was also very generous with the black truffle slices.  definitely the star of tonight's meal!\n\n5. pre-dessert: mango puree with coconut foam.  this light and airy precursor to dessert looked like a fancy cocktail served in a martini glass.  exotic, fruity, and a refreshing palate cleanser after such a rich main dish!\n\n6. fourth course/dessert: <mark>Baba a L'armagnac</mark> (monte carlo style).  this was an irish sponge cake drizzled with armagnac and served alongside an airy vanilla bean whipped cream.  decadent without being over-the-top, but i was still so stuffed that i could only finish half...what a waste!  still, being a chocolate lover, i would have chosen a mousse or lava cake a la mode over this any day.  sorry mix!\n\ni also had two glasses of the sparkling rose and an irish coffee to accompany my meal.  the rose was nice, but the irish coffee had such a kick that i could only finish half for fear of being unable to walk out of the restaurant!\n\nthe location, view, and decor was amazing!  i'm sure you've all seen photos of the \"floating\" glass bubbles that adorn the center of the restaurant.  the floor is also made to emulate a lace pattern.  service was friendly, but unfortunately on the slow side.  it took them over 2.5 hours to serve us four courses.  also, i felt like the price was a little on the high side for only four courses...i've eaten at comparable restaurants here in vegas and in sf which cost about the same for 6-9 courses.  nonetheless, i would still consider this a very good experience and is worth trying once.  but if you're going to do it, do it all the way and go with the higher tasting menu for the best the chef has to offer!", 
            "my most recent visit was not like the first one. the hostess was very pleasant. i'd hate to call him a busboy but the man who brought water and cleared the dishes was also awesome. however, our waiter was less than enthusiastic being there. it seems he didn't spend any time studying the menu. \n\ni remember mix as having a staff that knows the menu inside out, how every dish was prepared and the best way to enjoy each course. our waiter seemed like he was filling in for someone, having difficulty explaining the menu. \n\nwe didn't do the tasting menu this time, and instead ordered a la carte.\n\nthe spicy <mark><mark>Dungeness Crab Salad</mark></mark> was not the least bit spicy, but very good otherwise.\n<mark>Bigeye Tuna Tartare</mark> & the seabass were both delicious\nthe ribeye was cooked perfectly, but contained a huge chunk of fat, signaling it was a bad cut of meat.\n\nperhaps the least impressive was the dessert. the <mark>Baba a L'armagnac</mark> was a plain cake served on a citrus reduction, w/ whipped cream and liquer to pour over it.  unfortunately, our waiter couldn't explain the best way to enjoy the dessert, nor anything else about it. however, the table next to ours ordered the same dessert and got a full explanation and i had to ease drop.  \n\nperhaps if we received better service, this experience could have been a 4 or 4.5, but 3 is the best this time, and that's a damn shame."
