            "a local spot that no one should miss.  it's a relaxed atmosphere where people want the feeling of being in japan while eating the food.  i've been here so many times already and i'm always amazed and in awe with their food, service, and overall atmosphere.  the experience is also one i've never had.  i don't know what authentic japanese food really means but i would assume ichiza gives that full meaning.\n\njust like any other japanese restaurants, when i walk in i'm greeted loudly by all the employees in their language.  the past two times this week i've been i was with my cousins and this was the night to devirginize christine with sake.  muahahahahahaha!!!!  we were seated at the bar to watch the careful preparation of each food that was ordered by all customers.  it's a small and cute little restaurant that may sometimes have a wait because of seating capacity.  \n\nthe menu is either in a form of a book or hanging from the ceiling in the bar area with pictures so you can see what the food looks like before ordering it.  i have found this very useful.  also, you can just ask one of the servers what they would recommend and always will they give you a straight up answer.  they know their shit!  what's good?  okay, you can order their shrimp <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, garlic <mark>Boiled Cold Bok Choy</mark>, oysters (mmm... their oysters here are bomb!), sushi is also good, kimchi pork (this is something you have to order too), shrimp tempura, sake (large bottle), and there's just so much to choose from.  the only item i wasn't very hot for was the fried udon.  i can't put my finger on it but i know i wouldn't order it again.  although i've been informed it's a popular item amongst majority of the customers.  by the end of it all, i was very full and satisfied as we ordered just the exact amount for everyone.\n\nnow, the moment of truth.  it was time to sink the shot in christine's mouth.  we were like little school girls pouring the shots.  christine took the shot and didn't like it but got used to it after a while drinking.  i think this is where i'm gonna take my god sister when she comes to visit me.  i'm excited.", 
            "what is wrong with you people?! despite my high expectations, this restaurant barely made mediocre.\n\nthe first time i went was for lunch. i didn't like any of it, but you can't order any of the groovy stuff on the board at lunch so i figured maybe i just needed to come back for a magical dinner.\n\nwe ordered some <mark>Boiled Cold Bok Choy</mark> that was fine but nothing to write home about. we ordered some kind of sashimi thing that i thought was supposed to have sweet potato but it came with daikon and though the menu mentioned nothing about quail egg, there is the gloopy thing in the middle. i barely eat even chicken eggs. eggs gross me out. so i tried to scoop out the quail egg but the whole thing felt contaminated.\n\ni tasted it anyway and the fish, while not off in any way, was just not wonderful. it was kind of stringy and somehow lacking in that super fresh tuna taste that i love. \n\nthen we got some tempura green beans. they were fine but no sauce came with them. we had an octopus and cucumber/seaweed thing that had little taste, but was fine. we had a spider roll that was one of the most tasteless spider rolls i've ever had. we had some other things, but nothing memorable. even the kimchee was bland!!\n\nnot one single thing impressed me. most everything was bland. at best, perhaps i could say i liked the sake.\n\nnot recommended by me. don't believe the hype. meh.", 
            "my parents were visiting from la and out of all restaurants i chose ichiza. big mistake. wow! i am in shock with the service we got tonight. i've been here about 3 times and never had a problem until tonight. the moment we walked in the waitress sat us by the door and my parents didn't want to sit there because they were cold. so we asked to sit somewhere else, she would not move us even though half the restaurant was empty. it was confusing and did not make sense. \n\nthen we continued to order and there were two specific problems we encountered. 1- we ordered garlic <mark>Boiled Cold Bok Choy</mark>. granted i never ordered this before, but for 4.95 you literally got 3 bites of <mark>Boiled Cold Bok Choy</mark>. i can honestly say it was one stem that was broken up into the individual pieces. it blew my mind!! i almost thought it was a joke. yes everything is small there, but this was beyond a small portion, it was miniature. i thought no way-how can this be?\n\nthen i ordered 2 tuna sashimi salads and asked for the dressing on the side. she brought one small bowl half filled with ponzu sauce (which is the dressing used for the salad) then she brought one small bowl filled with sesame oil. ok no thanks i dont want to pour oil right onto my dressing. i asked for one more bowl of ponzu sauce and she made the biggest deal out of it, sending it back and talking to everyone about it-like i was a crazy and asking for something out of the ordinary. i'm sorry, but for two salads i don't think its that difficult to bring two bowls of dressing on the side and do it with a smile. i order dressing on the side everywhere and they acted like i was an alien for asking for it this way. so she brings back literally 1 tablespoon of ponzu in a big bowl. wow! i was so humiliated and embarassed that i took my parents here telling them it's a really good place. they know they can always trust my food taste and i was blown away by the waitress. now i don't want to judge a place simply by one waitress, but both waitresses were this way and the guy in the back who shook his head when she brought back the oil to ask him what it was. i guess she didn't know what sesame oil looks like even though she works there and should know the menu????? poor service, again. if a customer asks for more dressing, bring it. we paid %60 for our food, that's the least you can do. also, the waitresses never came by to refill water or ask if everything is ok, not even once. i guess she was pissed off about the dressing incident. \n\nnow, i don't want to sound like one of those annoying people that one thing wrong and i change my mind about a restaurant. but if i am going to bring out of town visitors here and i am a loyal customer, i think i deserve some decent service. i will never come back and never tell others to come here. also, i am not missing out on anything-the food is really ok-not bad-but i've had way better elsewhere. ichiza, we are broken up forever!", 
            "since moving to vegas from new york city i have really struggled to find great food at reasonable prices.  i've always heard people say \"youre so lucky to live in nyc they have the best food!\" but i never believed the talk until i left.  i have been really disappointed with most of the food out here.  it seems that unless you want to spend a ton of money most meals are just mediocre i found the same was true at ichiza.\n\nwalking in, i liked the atmosphere- busy, lots of locals, a little choatic, i was prepared to have a great meal after all the fantastic reviews.  the first two dishes we had- <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> and garlic stir fried <mark>Boiled Cold Bok Choy</mark> were probably the best things we ate all night.  they were simply prepared and the indgredients fresh.\n\nwe moved on to the broiled butterfish which was way too greasy to finish.  the sushi- which we were especially looking forward to is about the quality one would find in a nyc supermarket.  the avocado in my spider roll was browning and the crabmeat was not fresh.  the tuna and spinach roll was fine but the fish was nothing very memorable.\n\nmaybe i've learned my lesson- youve gotta drop some cash to eat well in vegas.  and steer clear of fish in a land locked state!\n\ni would not go back and anyone who appreciates fresh fish and ingredients will stay away.", 
            "not sure why it comes up as a sushi bar??? \nits really not where i would come for sushi.\nbut....the kushi tan  is incredible!!! \nas for the bacon wrapped mochi i wish the bacon could have been cooked a little more the second time eating there.\nbut the beef carpaccio deeeee-lish, oooh and the garlic <mark>Boiled Cold Bok Choy</mark>! \nand the honey toast yummm i know from the pics on here it looks burnt but really it's not.\npretty good place but you have to know where to find it too!", 
            "after 1 visit during dinner service:\n\nambience: b- smelled like something had died in the genkan. seats were filthy. reminds me of an...izakaya, funny enough. didn't expect a nice restaurant anyway. \nservice: a friendly and quick\nfood: b+ izakaya food isn't known for its refinement. it's beer food. the american equivalent would be fried cheese, and chicken wings. however, it is so much better than fried cheese and chicken wings. \n\nbaby <mark>Boiled Cold Bok Choy</mark> in clear garlic broth\nthe broth is so subtle, but so flavorful, oddly enough. baby <mark>Boiled Cold Bok Choy</mark> was very nice, and crunchy.\n\nyakitori\nthe hero of all izakaya food, in my opinion. and the most delicious\n\nfried chicken cartilage\ngood fried item, if you like cartilage\n\nkushikatsu or fried pork cutlet on skewers (zucchini on skewer as well)\ncan't go wrong with breaded pork cutlet fresh out of the frier. served with the house tonkatsu sauce", 
            "you know it's good when all you can see are asian people lined up waiting to be seated. it was a delightful experience.\n\ni wanted to take the lover for a nice authentic asian food experience. during our stay in las vegas, i searched for places where the locals eat and stumbled upon ichiza. when we got there, the place was packed for dinner. there were menus scattered all over the four walls, all written in japanese with english translations for some. to make this short and simple, we ended up visiting ichiza twice during our week-long stay in sin city. it was that good.\n\nbelow are what we managed to taste at ichiza:\n\npotato crisps = with a mayo wasabi sauce dip. a complimentary appetizer we got for our first visit.\n\nskewered sweet peppers = it was a little bitter for my taste but it had some nice texture and worked with the sapporo. \n\nskewered beef tongue = oh, i really can't express how good this one is. you just have to find out for yourselves. perfectly seasoned.\n\ngarlic grilled baby <mark>Boiled Cold Bok Choy</mark> in soup =  i'm on a mission to perfect this dish. had a little bit of fresh crunch on the outside but perfectly steamed inside. the soup broth was amazing. it is really mouth-orgasmic.\n\nbeef tataki with ponzu sauce = again, amazing. the beef was so fresh and tender that it just melts in your mouth. well seasoned and you can taste the layers of flavor. definitely a must-have at ichiza. fyi, i don't even like rare beef!\n\nskewered beef livers =  i can eat this for days. don't be scared to try it. i promise you'll never look at beef livers the same way again after tasting this one.\n\nstir fried chicken gizzards with garlic sprouts = the lover's favorite. he finished 70% of the plate. the lemon juice really complements the dish. an awesome \"pulutan\" (finger-food, often served alongside alcoholic beverages) for those of you who just want to enjoy a couple of sapporos.\n\nkaku-ni = deeply boiled diced pork belly with egg. so bad for you but it was sooo delicious. \n\nred bean mochi ice cream = i think this one might just be the best mochi i've tasted in a while or maybe i might have just forgotten how awesome they taste.\n\nfried whole garlic bulbs = the lover insisted on getting these. it was flavorful but i wasn't a fan of smelling like garlic afterwards.\n\nsushi = we ordered an assortment of fish from mackerel to tuna to squid. fresh, melts in your mouth sushi. nothing fishy here.\n\nsweet honey toast = so good. definitely a perfect way to end a meal here at ichiza. \n\nyou can find some of the photos on my page. enjoy!", 
            "i am so in love with yelp right now. because of everyone on here i checked this place out last night. we had to take our shoes off, so for me this was a totally new and amazing experience.\n\nwe had:\nsaki: good quality and good size\nbaby <mark>Boiled Cold Bok Choy</mark>: soooo good and it was in a garlic sauce\nramen with egg and short rib: that short rib was so killer i wish they put in more than 1 piece\nspicy tuna roll: really good quality (and i am a sushi snob) so i was very happy\nyellowtail tar tar: sweet and buttery and that chip brings it to a whole new level i was very impressed. my favorite thing i had.\nshrimp <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>: i thought it would be standard, but it wasn't. with 4 people we had 2 orders and ate everything that is how good it was.\n\nwhile i had saki, my friends ordered these drinks that you squeeze your own lemon and pour it in your drink. i forgot what it was called, but i tried some and it was delicious. the service was also spot on and everyone that works there was really nice. \n\nnext time i go back i need to order that honey toast that everyone is talking about. we didn't order it because we were so full and we ate everything! \n\ni gave it 4 stars because i wish they put in more short ribs in the ramen. that is the best tasting short rib i have ever had in my life. and i need to order the honey toast so i can finally give this place 5 stars. you'll be seeing an update from me soon.", 
            "this amazing place is what i would like to have near my home. but it's now 281 miles away. not fair. i have to start searching here in la for a place like this.\n\ni had the yellowtail sashimi, some <mark>Boiled Cold Bok Choy</mark> and fried yellowtail jowl. when i looked on the receipt to see the actual name of this dish it said \"hamakata\". i checked and there's nothing on hamakata for yellowtail. \n\nnevertheless, i loved everything about this place. not too large, not too noisy, infinite amounts of dishes and all at a reasonable price. i really got to give thanks to yelpers in general. i can still remember exactly how each dish tasted like. incredible.\n\nnext door is a bakery that's also japanese and supremely delicious. \n\nmy expectations were far exceeded and hopefully i'll find a place similar to this one. la is bound to have something like this and close to me.", 
            "went back last night for a late dinner with friends and was again impressed with everything we tried. best dishes were: miso butterfish, beef tongue stir fry, garlic baby <mark>Boiled Cold Bok Choy</mark>, yellowtail tar tar, <mark>Udon Noodle Soup</mark>, and beef tataki. :) delicious once again!", 
            "boomerang\n\nichiza, to me is a contradiction.  it's a fun spot, but always packed, which in the summer means i've sweat off 10 pounds before my table's ready.  the seating can be tight and friendly, but sometimes the employees forget about me.  they have good food, but sometimes i get something meant for another table (and i eat it anyway, because, hell, i'm hungry from waiting).  all that would normally spell three stars from me.  but...\n\n...before i get to my rating, here's what was right with ichiza on my most recent trip:\n\n1.  bacon wrapped mochi - my two favorite items in one sticky, savory mess. \n2.  sake marinated salmon - i could eat four orders with a bowl of rice and be a happy camper.\n3.  baby <mark>Boiled Cold Bok Choy</mark> - so simple, yet i can't replicate this at home.  this will make someone allergic to greens change their tune.\n4.  agedashi tofu - perfect texture and always executed well.\n5.  grilled ika - sometimes overcooked, but always tasty.\n6.  geso age - these little baby octopi flash fried in an extraordinarily light batter makes my tummy smile and my mouth growl (when someone tries to take one from me).\n7.  seared ahi belly - not the most interesting dish, but def a pleaser.\n8.  honey toast - bread.  honey.  ice cream.  yum.\n\ni have no idea how much this stuff costs, all i know is that we're usually down at least a benjamin by the time we're outta here.\n\noh, and add to that they have a good sake list.  small, but they have stuff you can't really get at many of the other japanese joints around vegas.  \n\nso, back to my rating.  the wait can't be helped; they're small and people are always coming back for more.  being forgotten is a huge negative in my book and something they really need to remedy.  maybe it's just a function of how busy they are (in which case they need to hire more people), but i don't know.  however, the food is good and i usually get to try someone else's order to expand my taste buds. \n\nat the end of the day, i keep coming back for the food despite the shortcomings.  and that's kind of says it all, doesn't it?", 
            "great japanese food with a twist.\n\nthings to try:\nbaby <mark>Boiled Cold Bok Choy</mark> - i only ordered this because i need some sort of veggies in my meal, but i was really impressed!  it looks to be in a clear broth, but it is surprisingly very flavorful.  i think it's the black pepper?  very good.\n\nred snapper capriccio - zesty and fresh. bite into it with the salmon fish roe - orgasmic.\n\ntuna tar tar - not what you'd usually get at other restaurants.  it's served with fried wonton and rice.  \n\nhoney toast - great to share. i'm a big fan of honey, so i thought it was delicious, but if you're not.. it's really nothing that special.\n\nthings to skip:\n\nbeef tataki - bland and flavorless.", 
            "i read the reviews and was pleased with my experience at ichiza. the place is cozy and the service was ok. \nthere wasn't much on the menu that i wanted to try (or so i thought), so i settled for the <mark>Miso Soup</mark> with <mark>Ichiza's <mark>Half Ramen Noodles</mark></mark> (small), the garlic sauteed baby <mark>Boiled Cold Bok Choy</mark>, and the cold spinach with sesame. my husband ordered the grilled calamari. he felt bad that i \"didnt have enough\" so he ordered the broiled eggplant with tomatoes and mozzarella cheese.\nthe cold spinach salad is delicious. very very flavorful and tasty! i recommend if you like spinach and/or tahini.\nthe baby <mark>Boiled Cold Bok Choy</mark> was amazing. in a garlic soup broth, it was sooooo good. i recommend this as well.\nthe <mark>Miso Soup</mark> with <mark>Ichiza's <mark>Half Ramen Noodles</mark></mark>. when she came over with the soup, i thought \"oh boy, i ordered the small and she just gave me the large\"...uurrgh. it was so so yummy. it was so flavorful. it wasn't a stepped on <mark>Miso Soup</mark> where it's watery. it was just delicious.\nmy husband loved his calamari. i tasted a piece and it was very good. cooked perfectly, nice clean flavor.\nnow, the broiled eggplant dish. completely doesnt go with what we ordered above. at all. it doesn't taste right, doesnt' look right on table (lol). to me, it felt like they were putting \"something\" on the menu for someone who is weary of japanese food. this wasn't the dish to do it. we each took one bite each and that was it. it had zero flavor. none. \nfor dessert we tried the honey toast. it was not what all the reviews rave about in my opinion. at least not what we were served. however, when we purchased our own bread from chinatown and made it at home the next night, it was amazing. i will be making that dessert again......and soon!\ni disregard the eggplant dish and focus on the wonderful and delicious items i did enjoy. \nfyi, if you have 2 ice tea's they charge for the 2nd. no free refills. and, good news, she didn't charge me for the large soup!", 
            "having been to japan many times and having izakaya style food has always been a delight for me.  i love going to these japanese pubs that focus on serving sake and drinks, an having tapas at the same time. there is some hit or miss with the food. the choice is outstanding, yet the quality is hit or miss. and, to get a bit more help from the servers would really help.\n\n1.  the hours - 5 star - hey, going to an izakaya for several rounds of drinking and drinking and eating, this is the place to go. they are like open until 3 or 4 in the morning....\n\n2.  the food - 3.5  star - we ordered a ton of stuff\n\nfood choice - 5 star - awesome. from your basics to your noodles and rice, this place has everything. \n\nshishamo - 4 star - very tasty overall, one order is 4 pieces of small grilled fish. \n\nbluefin toro - 5 star - i like the large cuts they give you and bout 5 in each serving. we were looking for o-toro and they did not have it. still good, flavorful, nice texture.\n\nmarinated grilled chicken - 2 star - this was on their specials board, it kinda looked like panda express orange chicken, yet it was soggy and not really a texture that i would call, inspiring.  taste was decent. \n\ncalimari - 2 star - this is my fault, as i am not an expert, just a fan. i figured calimari would be lightly breaded and fried, this was sauteed squid and while i enjoy squid in all forms, i was really expecting something else. it was not bad, i ate a lot of it, since others did not.\n\n<mark>Boiled Cold Bok Choy</mark> - 3 star - we got two orders, so you know we wanted more. however, i am a huge <mark>Boiled Cold Bok Choy</mark> fan.  the taste was great, nice garlic.  just way over cooked. i like it al dente or just a bit more cooked than al dente. this was like real limpy.  now i often overcook it at home when i am not paying attention and eat it all the time. i love it. just that in restaurants i am picky and if i am paying for it, i want it perfect..... again, we ordered a second serving, so the taste was good.\n\nshrimp <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> - 3 star - not bad at all. not sure how all the drunks eat this though as the dish comes out with a serving spoon, but all of us had small tapas plates and chopsticks. no bowl, not easy to eat.  good thing i like to pick up dishes and shovel food in my mouth with the chopsticks.  do you think they saw me and recognized my cantonese-esque eating habits?\n\nteba - 4 star - love chicken wings.  grilled on a grill, skewered.  these were overall flavorful in a simple grilled chicken way.  to me the teba has to be moist and they were.    not sure which baby chick these little bits of a wing came from.  they were skinned (de-skinned?) spread and skewered and grilled. i guess i like big meaty wings grilled.  i should have maybe ordered 10 more plates.\n\ntsukune - 2 star - little chicken meatballs. these were four 1 inch meatballs on one skewer. the taste was adequate, but kinda forgetful.  and, specifically i asked for how many were in order and she said four.  there were three of us. would have been better if i asked how many three adult men should order.  these were like popping aspirin.  good because they disappeared quickly.\n\ntai carpaccio - 4 star - red snapper (tai) raw.  nice. served on a bed of shredded daikon like vege and then on top of a sliced lemon.\n\n3.  ambiance - the look and feel 4 star.  amount of seating - 3 star.  for an izakaya and people drinking, the toilet is a bit small.  2 star.  the air conditioning on a summer  day in las vegas 1 star.  service 4 star sometime they know and don't know the menu items. they cannot or have a trouble to relate size of each dish so you know how to order.  they are all very pleasant, nice, smiling and make you feel welcome.\n\nthis is my third time to ichiza, first time to get in. parking is terrible, the restaurant will reserve tables so you can get there, it can be half ful and you cannot get it or you have to wait, in the heat, outside...\n\ngk says, check it out for sure. go off hours to get a quick table and enjoy izakaya style japanese food. it is a great experience.", 
            "i was excited to try this place because of all the things i've heard about their honey toast. the wait was quite long (45 minutes) which i was prepared for because of what i read in previous reviews. the place was tight and small but  seemed to look like the happening place to be. the food was pretty good (miso butterfish, garlic <mark>Boiled Cold Bok Choy</mark>, fried duck gizzards, rice, yakitori and ramen) along with the sake and glasses of wine that my bf and i consumed. however, the honey toast was my least favorite. it was too sweet for my liking. the overall experience was great but i can't say that i'd wait another 45 minutes to do it all over again.", 
            "ichiza is my favorite restaurant on the planet. when i first started coming here ten years ago, i was generally the only white person in the restaurant. recognizing that my presence was probably bad for business, they always seated me in the back near the restrooms, regardless of how empty the restaurant was. i can respect this kind of racism and have been a loyal customer ever since.\n\nthe menu only lists about 1/5 of the items available; the rest are written on pieces of paper taped to the walls. it is truly a dizzying number of choices, but that is part of the beauty of ichiza. though ordering randomly isn't the worst idea, here are few suggestions to get started: red snapper carpaccio, grilled corn, bacon wrapped mochi, pork with shiso leaf, tofu salad with tuna sashimi, garlic baby <mark>Boiled Cold Bok Choy</mark>, and wagyu beef <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. if you still have room for dessert, the honey toast is a unique experience, best for parties of three or more (or as a meal on its own for two).\n\ni would eat here at almost any price, but the fact is it's amazing affordable. you can eat like a hog for about $20 per person. it's also a great late-night choice, open until 3 or 4am, depending on the night. on the off chance it's closed, head west a few blocks to pho kim long for great vietnamese food.", 
            "i came because of the great review on the food but sadly i was let down by a few of the dishes:\n\n <mark>Boiled Cold Bok Choy</mark> $3.95 = bad choice and a total rip-off! 1 large head of <mark>Boiled Cold Bok Choy</mark> and a few scattered pieces drowned in salty soy sauce. \n\nfamous beef tataki = thin slice beef; some unevenly cut; easy to swallow when dip in the ponzu sauce but the lemon-y condiment sauce with it made the entire bite taste like dish soap\n\nyellowtail tuna tartare = very good combination with the crispy fried wonton sheet between rice and avocado, tuna mix. however, there was barely any pieces of tuna ( 3 tic tac size pieces at most) presentation look ok but closely looking at it, the avocado mix look like someone vomit up some nasty green gloop.\n\nramen with the pork belly = nothing special that's worth $8 but it will fill you up so you don't have to order too much\n\nchicken yakatori = a dried piece of chicken drowned in cheap store-bought teriyaki sauce. i took a bite and didn't want it anymore\n\nhoney toast =$8 probably the savor of the entire meal. crispy edges, enough honey to go with bread and vanilla ice cream compliments the bite. towards the center, there is condensed milk that adds extra sweetness to it. very filling-- 1 order can feed 4 people at most.\n\n$40 meal for 2 people = not worth the price to eat while in vegas. \n\nservice- f", 
            "first time here and definitely coming back. it's packed, and on a monday. was not impressed with the limited menu at first but quickly realized there were dishes listed on the wall.  a lot of them.  we sat near the kitchen which gave me a chance to eye out dishes i'll try in the future.  service was quick, and the food came out quick which helps the crowd turnover.  speed did not impede on quality.  started off with the <mark>Fire Roasted Eggplant</mark> and cold baby <mark>Boiled Cold Bok Choy</mark>. both were refreshing.  <mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark> did not disappoint. neither did an inexpensive and satisfying shrimp tempura bowl, served over a bed of rice and tempura flakes.  of course, do not leave without a serving of honey toast.", 
            "izakaya in vegas? sure, why not?\n\nsome of the advantages about coming here early (like 5 pm when the store just open) are plenty of available parking spaces and none of crazy waiting line. nothing superb about the service, staffs got the job done and we all got our food in an orderly fashion. \n\n31. garlic baby <mark>Boiled Cold Bok Choy</mark> (stir-fried baby <mark>Boiled Cold Bok Choy</mark> with garlic soup - $3.95): simple and decent dish. tasted just like how my mom would cook it - garlic soup wasn't too crazily salty, but i do think $4 is a bit pricey. \n\n45. kushi-tan (most tender beef tongue - $2.25 each): a huge hit. beef tongue was grilled perfectly with just the right seasoning. now that's something you don't get to enjoy everyday. \n\n52. black cod fish fillet (black cod fish [butterfish] marinated with miso-sauce - $9.95): definitely a miss for me. texture is pretty good, but simply too salty. i would rather exchange one black cod for four beef tongues. \n\n91. <mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark> (ichiza's ramen with kakuni and half egg, half size): a hit for me. this ramen reminded me of champon ramen at hana ichimonme in los angeles (http://www.yelp.com/biz/hana-ichimonme-restaurant-los-angeles). broth is milky and flavorful. kakuni wasn't too bad and i can taste vegetable in the bowl here and there. not the most amazing ramen, but i was pretty impressed with it. \n\nmore hits than misses - just stick with yelp's recommendation and you will have an enjoyable experience.",

            "there's an amazing selection of authentic japanese dishes at ichiza. both times i came here for dinner, we ended up over-ordering since there were so many of our favorite dishes. we also sat at the bar both times and the head sushi chef is super nice/friendly. the chef challenged us to order any kind of handroll we can think of! \n\ni would recommend saving room for the honey toast dessert. i had no idea how toast, honey and ice cream can taste like heaven in your mouth! no joke.\n\nother recommended dishes - chicken skewers, tuna tofu salad, <mark>Miso Soup</mark> (tastes lighter than other restaurants'), handrolls, diced steak", 
            "the business hours in the header are wrong.  ichiza is open for lunch.  they close at 2:30am on sunday.  we were told that they take reservations for after 10:00 pm only.  maybe this is a sunday only thing, not sure.\n\nthis is a great place.  first time there we went for a late dinner on sunday 3-29-2009.  my dinner guest and i had to wait 20 minutes for a table with chairs, not bad for such a small, popular place.  it's immediately clear that this is an izakaya; very social, low key, and culturally interesting.  this is a place for real people, not wannabe players or high brows concerned about impressing people with their image.  ichiza is all about great food, great drink, and good, honest social fun.\n\nminimal sake list, but a few decent selections both hot and cold.  we ordered a 720ml bottle of masumi yumedono junmai daiginjo, a very nice chilled sake that matched well with the food we ordered.  most restaurants charge around 2x what you would pay at a wine/liquor retail store and this bottle was only marked up about 1.4x, so this was the first sign that this establishment offers quality for a decent price.   they also seemed to have a nice selection of sochus, but with the bottle of sake i wasn't able to order my #2 japanese beverage of choice; imo sochu oyu-wari. \n\na few of the things we wanted to try were sold out, this was my only disappointment.  ichiza offers a lot of great treats i'd typically only expect to find in japan or california.  the okra-natto was superb, as was the shisyamo, tatsuta-age, tsukune, and black cod miso-yaki.  i rolled my eyes and bit my tongue when my guest ordered a curried beef plate.  i really wanted to try the grilled whole ika-yaki, but this wouldn't have allowed any room for dessert.  we couldn't pass up on an order of honey toast and it was everything honey toast should be.  our tummies were stuffed and thirst quenched.  the bill came to $175, but the bottle of sake accounted for $125 of this.  we left feeling very pleased and happy.\n\nthe following day (monday 3-30-2009) we were in the area looking for a place to have lunch.  as noted at the beginning, we didn't think ichiza would be open because the yelp info indicates 5:00pm - 3:00am only.  i just happened to look up wishfully as we were driving by and saw people inside and the open sign - prayers answered - so we just had to go back.  lunch has a limited menu.  we first ordered onigiri rice cakes with a pickled plum inside and hot tea, a rare treat.  my guest ordered udon and a side salad.  the udon broth was very tasty and flavorable.  i ordered the combo box of yummy grilled pike mackeral (sanma) and tempura, which also came with a small side salad, a cup of <mark>Miso Soup</mark>, gohan, some daikon garnish, etc.   again, we were completely satisfied with everything we ordered.\n\nboth times the service was great for us.  i was especially pleased to practice my minimal japanese language skills and the servers seemed to be just as pleased by it.  whether we received better or more friendly service as a result is hard to say.  we were thankful to have received it, regardless.", 
            "if there was another star to rate this restaurant, i would give it 6 stars! we found this restaurant at total random during a late evening in vegas. we were craving noodles for dinner and it was between ichiza and a neighboring chinese noodle house downstairs. ichiza was definitely a great find and a restaurant i will probably remember for a long time!\n\nthe restaurant is a cozy little place, packed with people. it looks like you stepped into a ramen house in japan. the staff greets you with a friendly smile. once you're seated, you look at the menu. that night, we were all craving noodles, and looked at the ramen menu. intially, i thought the menu lacked a lot because there were only a few to choose from.  i asked the waitress which she'd recommend and she said the one with the pork belly. so, both my buddy and i ordered it and waited. \n\nwhen the ramen arrived, the smell was exhilarating! the beautiful sight of the creamy broth, veggies and the noodles was overwhelming.  we digged in and man, it was the best ramen we ever had! we enjoyed every bite of it down to the last drop of broth! \n\nthis place was so good that we came back on the last day of our trip, but this time during lunch hour and had their beef katsu, bento combo box with cod fish, salad, <mark>Miso Soup</mark> and beef bowl, and fried chicken curry and man...again, it was so good! i also ordered a spicy tuna handroll and it was rockin'!\n\nthis place really does not and will not disappoint! if you're in the area, please check this joint out. you'll be happy that you stopped by!", 
            "once again yelp to the rescue... we went to a 9pm show without eating dinner, by the time it was over we were ravenous but didn't want 'casino' food. so we decided on japanese food, i did a quick search on the mobile device and entered late night dining. this was the third place to pop up. to our surprise this place is open until 3am on a sunday!?! wow. the reviews were great so we drove over to lv's chinatown area and boy were we glad! this place is in a strip mall on the second floor, its looks like a mom and pop type place. the restaurant mainly had japanese clients, another good sign, if natives eat there then you know its good. anyway we were promptly seated in one of the last spots, it was almost 11pm and it was bustling in there. the menu is rather perplexing, we were overwhelmed and were not sure what to order when she asked for drinks and appetizers. i would characterize this place as japanese 'tapas'. we proceeded to order a bunch of little plates. we started with basics like <mark>Miso Soup</mark> and house salad, the dressing was to die for and a rather huge salad nicely presented with all the fixings. we tried their house special roll, very unique in presentation, think california roll with tempura onions and eel on top, f-ing fantastic! we also had a spicy tuna roll and an order of their marinated fried chicken and shrimp <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. again remember these are small plates but plates of yummy flavorful food. the shrimp <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was awesome, think benihana but better, not greasy and large shrimp properly de-veined! i was in love and i told my husband so. he was in love with the spicy tuna roll himself, i believe the sushi chef also noticed because they gave us an additional one on the house. the prices here are reasonable too. i would definitely return because there were many many more items left to try on the menu.",

            "definitely a locals find.. thanks to yelp.  the same great, fun open atmosphere i usually expect from a good japanese restaurant.  memorable dish was the ahi <mark>Egg & Tuna Salad</mark> and....\n\nso what is all this talk about the honey toast?  i was quite hesitant because how can toast +honey+butter+a scoop of ice cream get that many citings on yelp reviews...and it's like $10. so because of yelpers, i had to try it...and i must say thank you. it was the most scrumptiously delicious dessert i've eaten in a long time.  it had a great natural honey sweetness, a creamy vanilla ice to balance  and all on top of this huge piece of buttered crispy toast that gave it awesome texture.   \n\nso why not a 5 star? because my group had at least 10 different items, and i could only remember 2 things that really stood out.  hmm, 2 out of 10 isn't that great of a ratio. but at least i don't remember anything bad, right?", 
            "we waited for 20 minutes to be seated.  i wish we had left.  \n\nmaybe we just didn't know what to order.  i was really overwhelmed by the menu.  i had expected it to be a traditional japanese sushi restaurant offering traditional sushi and such, but it's not.  \n\ni saw quite a few people ordered the ichiza ramen, so i decided to try it, too.  it was quite possibly the worst ramen i've ever had.  i don't know how to describe the flavor, or rather the lack of it.  i tried adding tons of chili powder and it just didn't work.  i barely finished 1/3 of it.  \n\ni also ordered some kind of diced <mark>Egg & Tuna Salad</mark>.  it came with a raw quail egg on top.  probably my fault that i didn't read the menu carefully.  i don't eat raw egg of any kind!\n\nmy fiance's pork katsu was the only thing good.  it was small but i just had to steal a bite from him.  \n\nlastly was the famous honey toast.  one word - over-rated!!!!  there was barely honey drizzled on the toast.  the ice cream was too too sweet.  if you like thick piece of toast with very sweet ice cream, this is for you.  \n\ni had such high hope for this place, but i left disappointed and hungry!", 
            "everytime i come to vegas i try to make a stop here. it's definitely worth the trip off the strip and the long wait for a taxi to come pick you up.\n\ngrilled rice balls mm...\ntofu and <mark>Egg & Tuna Salad</mark>..light and fresh\nmy friends love the buttered clams\nthe homemade pork gyoza were ok\ngrilled corn, sweet crunchy and tasty\nwagyu beef carpaccio was all gobbled down\nsundried squid chewy tasty goodness\nthe stewed pork with egg was a huge disappointment, it was dry and looked like it had been chilling for awhile, flavor was ok tho\n<mark>Egg Drop Soup</mark> was very rich and large.. yums\nchicken karaage was  battered fried goodness\nfriend baby octopus, my friends liked it\n my favorite is the honey toast dessert, so simple yet so damn good", 
            "i love the <mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark> or ds? with pork belly! the eel roll with spicy tuna, tofu <mark>Egg & Tuna Salad</mark>! the ambiance, and plenty of sake!", 
            "can i just have everything on the menu? i wish! the daily specials are always the best, it's fresh fish and tastes as if it was just fished from the sea. the tofu <mark>Egg & Tuna Salad</mark> is my go-to-food, i always have to get that when i' m there. the only thing i dislike is how most their menu is on the wall. i like that it's interactive but having to get up and read all of it is a pain, especially when it's jam packed with people.\n\ntip: make a reservation! it saves so much time and you get your table right away.", 
            "ichiza is one of the oldest izakaya place in vegas and it has been opened for more than 10 years. i'm always neutral about this place because i haven't had a dish that makes me drool when i think about the place. \n\nokay let me get to my complains first. the waitress that served us yesterday was rude and idiotic. she was short and annoyed from the start when she was taking order of the drinks. and my second complain was they charged $3.50 on the damn green tea but you can't get refills which makes absolutely no sense to me. third complain was they charged us a fee to have birthday cakes. they don't even serve cakes in there and they are not a high end restaurant. it's ridiculous to me why they would charge a fee.\n\nthey have a lot of stuff written on the wall that's not on the menu. if you go to this place, make sure to read the wall too. \n\ni like tacoyaki( octopus with batter and fried), tofu and <mark>Egg & Tuna Salad</mark>, kimchi pork, grilled octopus and their assorted skewers. \n\ntheir food is not bad but at the same time not the greatest either. i still love raku the most. i don't think i will return here anytime soon with this kinda service unless someone else wants to go.", 
            "thank god for yelp in helping me find this place.  when we got there, we actually waited 40 minutes for a table.  i never wait that long, but i figure there was a reason why.  i made use of my time and observed plates while waiting.  if you really don't want to wait, they just opened a sister restaurant down the street.  i have no idea why the hostess didn't tell us this when we decided to wait.  also, you can just put in your name, and give them your cell, go grab a drink, and they will call you when your table is ready.  an asian woman actually tried to get a table without waiting by claiming she & her 3 friends eat really fast and that she was there because she didn't like nobu-lol, are you kidding me lady?  well after having dinner there,  i would fly back to vegas for some more! i just wish i could read japanese. writings of menu items all over the walls, you kind've wonder if you're missing out on something.  it was amazing to be seated right by the sushi bar where platings were placed to be picked up. we saw items that didn't even appear on the menu but are located on the walls around the restaurant(written in japanese).\n\nit was like dining in nobu's kitchen before he became popular! we ordered the wasabi octopus which was out of this world - live octopus marinated in wasabi/yuzu sauce. we also ordered the wagyu beef carpaccio - the best carpaccio i've had.  it tastes similar to vietnamese filet mignon carpaccio but better.  i has a yuzu sauce to flavor it up & fried shallots & shaved onions.  it literally tasted like a medium rare burger with all the fixins.  a dish you really need to try if you're a foodie like me.  we also ordered the tofu/<mark>Egg & Tuna Salad</mark> which is very refreshing and delicious.  the yellowtail sashimi was served with the fatty part of the tuna along with some of the fat under the skin.  i've never had yellowtail with these parts still attached but it was heavenly like butter.  there were so many orders of stuffed french toast coming out of the kitchen & i promise the next time i will try it but for now, yeah i'm stuffed.  can't wait to come back for more at this gem."

            "this is by far one of my most favorite restaurants in las vegas.  ever since discovering this place about 3-4 years ago, i have always been coming back.  this isn't your high end japanese restaurant.   the decor is simple, the prices are very reasonable, the food is extensive and excellent, and the place is great place to be merry.  right when you walk in you are greeted in japanese and when you leave your thanked in japanese.  the workers there all seem to be young students.  \nthere are so many dishes to choose from.  the only thing i can do is tell you about what i always order: 1) menu items:  kushi-katsu - crunchy breaded pork w/lemony teriyaki dip; ika yaki - broiled squid;  ichiza <mark>Ichiza's <mark>Half Ramen Noodles</mark></mark> - yummy; <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>; beef tataki - rare beef slice to dip in a ponzu-dailkon radish mixture (sublime); kim chee <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>; and a sashimi plate w/ tuna, albacore, mackerel, yellow tail, salmon, octopus, and squid. 2) non-menu items (sheets of paper that have daily/common specials are posted over the walls)  monk fish liver, fried smelt (my most favorite b/c the eggs are cooked in the belly), and beef cubes in ponzu sauce.  yeah, there are a lot of dishes that i like, but im so impressed that ichiza's has not disappointed me for the many times i've been there.  they have large group seating areas, which i've enjoyed many times with friends and family eating and drinking up cold sake, sake bombs, and japanese beer.  i really recommend their house cold sake, so much better and smoother than drinking it warm.  i've been there a many nights till closing leaving with my belly full and ridiculously buzzed from all the sake we drank.   i always have to put this on the itinerary of any of my visiting friends and family that come to las vegas.  that's how much i love and trust this place.  anybody who knows me, can back me up for whatever say about this restaurant b/c most likely i've taken them there....\nadditional note...don't think that this restaurant is one of those upscale dress up places b/c of the amount of stars i gave it.  it gets five stars b/c all around it's hella awesome!!!", 
            "my vegas go to man brought me here - it's on the top of his list, so he has to always bring us out-of-towners there! \n\ni've been there a couple of times already and can definitely tell you this is one of those joints for only the locals.  no tourists would be venturing out over here.  all that much better!  \n\nwhen looking at the bar and all the special menu items posted on the wall, it can be quite difficult when deciding what to order.  so, when in doubt, let the expert go at it.\n\ni fondly remember the fried smelt (less than $3 for three fish).  these plump babies are loaded up 'cuz their eggs are still sitting inside of them.  and with a little bit of salt and some fresh lemon juice, yum yum!  and who doesn't love ankimo?!  monkfish liver that melts in your mouth...ahhhh...i love ankimo!  i've tried a bunch of other things there like the red snapper carpaccio with ikura, <mark>Ichiza's <mark>Half Ramen Noodles</mark></mark>, the beef tataki w/ lemon juice, fresh oysters on the half shell w/ ponzu sauce (2 for $4.25), <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>, and the beef cubes.  i don't remember anything bad about the place, but just good food with good company.\n\nthe first time i went, they had those fancy japanese toilets with all those buttons to try out.  i attempted to use it but had no luck.  on my last visit, their special toilet was no longer there!  =(  i guess too many people were having way too much fun with it and it went into retirement.  \n\nif possible, go with a large group and sit in the back where you have to take your shoes off to swing your feet under the table.  and this way, you can also order a lot more random things and share them with everyone.  it makes it all that much merrier.  overall, pretty extensive menu...i think i want some of that fried smelt roe just about now!  bring it!\n\nupdated: 10/10/06 - they also offer a free membership card.  you get 5% off whenever you dine there when you bring this card and it eventually adds up to 10-15% off your bill for next time.\n\ni also like getting the agedashi tofu soup.  it's light and delicate without being overly infused with the bonito flakes.  yum yum!\n\nthe salmon skin salad was okay.  the dressing overpowers the salmon skin, so you can't taste a whole lot.  i wouldn't bother getting it again.  \n\nthe deep fried crabs are a plate of baby crabs with an aioli type dipping sauce.  an interesting taste and a nice crunch! \n\nside note: they give you a wet towelette thing and that will be your napkin for the entire meal.  don't bother looking around for regular paper napkins here!\n\nupdated: 11/27/06 - i recently tried the okra with natto (less than $3).  first off, the idea of natto grosses me out.  the texture alone is nasty, and the smell...geez, that's a whole other subject.  since it was my dining partner's first time w/ the stuff, i suggested he give it a go at some a cheap price.  it comes with thin slices of fresh okra, seaweed slivers, and hot mustard on the side.  overall, i would not recommend it unless you're a fan of this stuff.  i definitely am not one. blah.  \n\nalso, the last two times i went, they were out of the lovely ankimo!  argh!\n\nupdated: 01/24/07 - i changed my ratings from four stars to five because i find myself craving the fried smelt roe more often than not.  and ichiza has apparently become my comfort restaurant to turn to when i can't decide where else to go.  i have only been to one other izakaya, and that was musha in torrance, ca.  how can this place not be special?\n\nupdated: 06/12/07 - went back the past weekend after a few month hiatus.  they were out of uni and ankimo!  argh!  but we had the beef tongue - tasty, and gotta eat it when it's hot; minced spanish mackerel on cucumber - fresh, lots of flavors on your palatte, fried garlic - put salt on it instead of the miso, and oh-so good!, tartar yellowtail - with avocado, crisp things, and salsa - refreshing flavors and light, and honey toast - they need more bread chunks, but yummy!  (they had a few new dishes that were listed in japanese.  if you ask the waitresses or owner to translate, they'll try their best!  be daring and give it a go!)\n\nupdate! 08/06/07 - out of ankimo again!  argh!  but they do have a soft shell crab appetizer that comes with a ponzu dipping sauce and japanese mayonnaise.  it's a fatty crab with lots of meat!  yum!  their red snapper carpaccio is a bit different, it comes with olive oil, tomatoes, and mozzarella!  \n\nupdate! 10/09/07 - where the heck is all the ankimo?!  argh!  brought some out-of-town guests to ichiza to experience where the locals eat.  ate all the standard stuff, of course.  new thing tried here - live scallop.  i warn you now, don't sniff the squiggly things...it may turn you off!  but the scallop slices dipped in ponzu sauce is oh so tasty.  also shared a ramen bowl.  i'm personally not a big fan of ramen (it's a filler), so i'll pass on it.  everyone else seemed to swallow it down without any problems! =)\n\n(i added some photos of my eats above!)", 
            "thank you yelp!!!!  this is hands down one of my favorite places to eat in vegas.   the only problem we had was there was so much to choose from we didn't know where to start.  we kept thinking they would think we were pigs, cause we couldn't stop.  the <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> is amazing, the bacon wrapped mochi to die for, every skewer we ordered was full of flavor and all the fish was incredibly fresh.  the bill was cheap too!  after we walked to the 99 ranch market and loaded up on food for our stay.  parking is a pain, but well worth it.", 
            "since moving to vegas from new york city i have really struggled to find great food at reasonable prices.  i've always heard people say \"youre so lucky to live in nyc they have the best food!\" but i never believed the talk until i left.  i have been really disappointed with most of the food out here.  it seems that unless you want to spend a ton of money most meals are just mediocre i found the same was true at ichiza.\n\nwalking in, i liked the atmosphere- busy, lots of locals, a little choatic, i was prepared to have a great meal after all the fantastic reviews.  the first two dishes we had- <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> and garlic stir fried <mark>Boiled Cold Bok Choy</mark> were probably the best things we ate all night.  they were simply prepared and the indgredients fresh.\n\nwe moved on to the broiled butterfish which was way too greasy to finish.  the sushi- which we were especially looking forward to is about the quality one would find in a nyc supermarket.  the avocado in my spider roll was browning and the crabmeat was not fresh.  the tuna and spinach roll was fine but the fish was nothing very memorable.\n\nmaybe i've learned my lesson- youve gotta drop some cash to eat well in vegas.  and steer clear of fish in a land locked state!\n\ni would not go back and anyone who appreciates fresh fish and ingredients will stay away.", 
            "this little japanese spot is absolutely fabulous! its a hidden gem and now one of my favorite spots on spring mountain. i felt like i was on the streets of japan instead of vegas with all the little hand written specials taped all over the walls.\n \ni love the fact that this is not the typical japanese sushi joint that you see around vegas, its definetly on its own level and pretty authentic.\n\nstarting off with the <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>, not the usual bright green salad you get, it was yummy and different. next we got sashimi of albacore and hamachi, ahh heaven! the hamachi was as buttery as it should have been, little bit of soy, shiso, and daikon....phemonal. moving on we got the grilled squid and well as the grilled pike mackerel, both very nice. i so wanted to try more things but after barely finishing a split beer and all of that which doesnt sound like alot...we left there happy and content...thumbs up..", 
            "excellent food, great homey atmosphere. just bring your patience for being seated and getting the bill...\n\ntry the butterfish, if you like seafood. also the <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> shouldn't be overlooked.\n\nfriendly, upbeat and very affordably priced. not bad for a good cultural experience at japanese dining.", 
            "best japanese i've had in vegas yet.  i was surprised to find the inside somewhat low-key and comfortable, a must for me since i have to eat and do stuff all the time.  the service was attentive and friendly, pretty amazing since it is fairly busy inside. \n\ni had the <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>, a light and delectable dish featuring a combination of different varieties of seaweed.  i was very impressed that the plate nailed both texture, taste and managed to include a garden variety of vegetables such as cucumber and lettuce.  \n\ni also had a tempura eel roll, ridiculously delicious.  the ingredients in the roll, although components of a ca roll, were very fresh, and impressed on what would normally be a cliche.  the agedashi tofu, another winner, served at the perfect temperature, had the right sauce, just perfect execution.  <mark>Chicken Cutlet</mark>, better than chicken at a lot of chicken places.  to finish, i tried the honey toast, just great.\n\nthe only downside is the shopping center, the lot is narrow and packed.  it's open late, so i'll be back many times.", 
            "i've enver had japanese small plates before, so this was a first for me. i felt like we were ordering everything and there was only 4 of us! but it was perfect, filling, and came out to be fairly inexpensive. the food was all well prepared, the waitress was kind enough to suggest several options, most of which we tried and was really good. we also wanted onigiri and wasn't sure which we wanted but could recall the taste. so we tried to describe it to her and she was helpful in bringing out a small bit of what she thought we were trying to describe to let us taste it before we ordered.. very helpful. \n\nportions were a good size, service was great too. definitely liked the octopus, cooked perfectly. their <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> was an awesome array of different types of seaweed, lightly sauced and very refreshing, not the usual u'd get at an americanized japanese place. their rolls were a good size, and when they said tempura, they really mean a whole another portion of tempura in there, er, on there =p, depends on what u get. i definitely recommend this spot. my favorite, tho it wasn't clearly stated on the menu, was their onigiri.. i know it's simple and hard to f-up, but the rice was perfect, the amount of fish eggs was perfect, and the seaweed was crisp and seem fresh. i'd come back just for that ;)\n\nwe didn't get drinks tho, and weren't in the mood for drinks so i forget what their collection is like.\n\noverall, service was good, food was good, atmosphere was very chill.. love the onigiri =)", 
            "went there on a tuesday night. it was busy but no wait for counter seating. the place is a hole in the wall and doesn't feel clean. we ordered the crab <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, salmon skin salad, grilled squid, mountain yam with <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>, and a variety of yakitori including beef tongue. nothing really stood out. our neighbor ordered a yellowtail sashimi which actually looked better than all our dishes. the most tasteless were the yakitori/skewers. no special sauces thus quite bland. the best dish was the grilled squid. left rather unsatisfied.", 
            "my friends and i went here late night and experienced the following:\n1) slow, bad service despite the lack of a crowd on a weekday night\n2) the sashimi (especially squid) was not fresh, and tasted \"fishy\" and \"plastic\"\n3) the <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> i had was decent, so that's why there's two stars instead of one", 
            "after arriving in las vegas late night on friday, my friend and i were looking for a good sushi place to eat that was open until 4am so we ended up here. this was more in \"china town\" so it was a bit off the strip but it was well worth it. the place was located upstairs in the plaza and it was very cozy. even around 1:30am there were quite a few people there. the hostess and servers were really nice and very accommodating but our server was a bit hard to understand at times but she didn't mind repeating things for us. i loved how attentive they were to us and how the manager himself called the cab for us when we requested it.\n\nnote: there is more to the menu than what they hand you. there are a lot of items that they serve on the wall. if anything, just ask your server for help deciding what to order. ours was amazing and we liked everything she recommended.\n\nthe food will be annotated since i'm already a week late:\n\nbeef tongue: one skewer with thick grilled slices of beef tongue. it had a good flavor to it and the meat was tender with a nice texture.\n\ntoro (tuna): they had all 3 grades. we bought the highest grade and it was served with the under-skin attached. the sashimi was served in huge thick slices. the sashimi came with sliced radish, black fish eggs, and wasabi. this was delicious as the tuna just melted in your mouth and then the skin added a nice texture to the fish.\n\nyellowtail cocktail: reminded me of a sushi taco. it had two friend wonton wrappers with rice in between with a mix of diced tomatoes, kewpie, green onions, yellowtail sashimi, and avocado. i really enjoyed the crunch of the wonton wrappers and the wonderful \"cocktail\" on top. the flavor was delicious, the sashimi was fresh and prominent, and the tomatoes, green onions, and avocado added a nice flavor and texture to it all.\n\ngizzard: one skewer with slightly charred gizzard. i liked this overall for the taste and texture, but i think i was more distracted by the other dishes.\n\nblack cod fish filet: if you like a really buttery tasting fish, you'll love this one. this was grilled so it had a nice crispy skin, but on the inside was flakey, buttery, and oily like a well-cooked chilean sea bass. this had a fall-apart-and-melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness that was slightly sweet and savory.\n\nsaba grilled miso: had a good savory flavor with a touch of miso. i really liked the crisp skin that contrasted the juicy but slightly chewy meat. as with any saba, it had a bit of a fishy flavor, but the fishy flavor wasn't as prominent like when you eat the sashimi.\n\nsalmon sashimi: well worth the price! there were 5 thick, 1 cm cuts of salmon. it was an amazingly good portion, beautiful presentation, and good marbling on each piece.\ntuna poki: this was fresh blue fin tuna mixed with <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> that had 4 different types of seaweed in it. each one added a different but nice texture to the dish. i liked the nice soy sauce and sesame seed flavor.\n\nanother thing to note here was a good selection of sake.\n\noverall, i had an amazing experience. the place is open late. the service was great: really nice, always refilled our waters, cleared our plates, made sure we didn't need anything, got everything we needed promptly, and helped us order delicious food. the food was amazing: the portions were good, sushi was fresh, flavor was amazing, and the presentation of each plate was pretty. i can't wait to come back here again!",

            "made a stop here while on vacation.  this place was packed on a wednesday night at 7 pm.  should have a made a reservation as this place is very small.  they have a small sushi menu so if you are one of those high end sushi snobs you'll be disappointed .  if you want to experience a traditional japanese cooked cuisine then you've come to the right place.. saw lots of reviews for the miso cod and the <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>.. cod was melt  in your mouth delicious ! salad had a nice variety of seaweeds mixed with greens and cucumbers.  my kids ate the ramen with miso broth and loved it.  just a note we didn't see other kids around , mostly young hipsters before hitting the night club scene .  also got sticker shock on iced green tea.  although it was very good, just wished they would have let me know they charge for refills .  should have read the  reviews on the wall menu items... would have been nice to know other options..  overall we had a nice dinner and good food.", 
            "ah, ichiza. i gotta give it up, yo. it's most certainly always a good time when i roll through and i have no problem bringing friends to enjoy in your delectable delights. as some of my good friends know, i have this love-love relationship with  japanese food and anytime the option presents itself to get my grub on, i am sure to follow through. ichiza is one of those spots that i usually don't frequent too often like i do other japanese establishments but if i have a pretty good sized group gathered willing to drink some beer or sake and have some small plates to accompany, this is usually my go to.  as far as food goes, i usually hit up the specials menu to start off the night.  last time i stopped in, they had shigoku oysters, chu-toro, and kohada (as you can tell, i love me some seafood!.. or if you don't, google it heehee) on the special menu for the day and i delightfully ordered it up. the special menu rotates daily (?) so be sure to check it out whenever you stop in as it changes and presents some new stuff upon each visit.  from the regular menu, i am always happy to suggest the oyako don <mark>Chicken & Egg Bowl</mark>, ikayaki whole grilled squid, and the uni in ponzu sauce (if they still have any in stock).  i always round it out with some sunomono cucumber or wakame <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> to make my meal somewhat complete and to my definite satisfaction.  not a big dessert guy but gotta give a shoutout to the honey toast here; definitely a fan favorite.\n\ntip: look at the menu posted on the wall as some of it is not mentioned in the menu; if you have a big group, go early to get a table in before your patrons fully arrive to grub; and be sure to check out some of the bottled stuff aside from the house sake and beer as they have some tasty items chillin' in the back\n\nenjoy!!", 
            "in vegas for a bachelorette party, and it was our last night in town. after a lot of gambling, a 5-course meal at picasso, a show at thunder down under, and the v lounge, we were ready for our second dinner.. aka midnight schmorgusborg. took a cab from the venetian, and in 5 minutes we were at ichiza, at 2:30am. how awesome that their kitchen was still open? how great was it that there was the shortest wait, and the staff was enthusiastic and kind? it was all great. 5 stars, no joke.\n\nrandom sheets of 8.5x11 sheets of paper taped up on the walls with various delectable items to order, as well as dry erase boards that have specialties listed. you also get a small half-sheet printout of what the daily special is. each diner also gets a small tofu+<mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> to start.\n\nchicken gizzards - main reason we came, was craving this all day, and we got them two ways - garlic fried and also skewered and grilled -- delicious!! just the right amount of chew, and it was delectable\nwhole grilled squid - it was fairly impressive to see an entire squid on a plate, and it was cut up to quarter inch lengths -- char-grilled and very flavorful\nuni - uni uni uni oooooooo--neeeee - wow this was amazing, the uni is served in half a lemon, and we ordered 7 of these -- fresh, sweet, so worth it\ncrab row <mark>Croquette</mark> - crispy outside, and yummy not-too-gooey inside, served with a side of tangy dippy sauce\nbroiled mushrooms - more than 4 types of mushrooms, cooked to perfection -- however, if you want lots of flavor because you are somewhat tipsy, then you gotta add some soy sauce, otherwise the natural mushroom flavors may seem a bit tame\nhoney toast - so my friend said they forgot to toast the interior cube of bread, but it was my first time having it, so i didn't miss the toasting. basically, a big cube of texas toast hollowed out, and served up buttered and drizzled with honey, and a side of vanilla ice cream\n\ni regret that i was so eager to try their small plates that i completely neglected to order any of their <mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark>. i would definitely come here again, and i do recommend it for late night dining and a great place to bring friends.\n\nthis place is in chinatown, so it's not walking distance to the strip, and there is a shortage of taxicabs in this side of town. be prepared to order a cab to pick you up, and the restaurant staff is helpful at placing the call and giving directions on your behalf.", 
            "this place is definitely a gem. it's a small restaurant hidden in an asian plaza. there's not too much seating but it's worth the wait. the pricing is decent, i know how sushi can get pretty pricey. their <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> was light and fresh. i enjoyed their gyoza and spider roll. i also tried their grapefruit soju?  - they give you fresh grapefruit to squeeze into your soju. yummy! if i lived in lv i would definitely be a regular! i'll just be sure to visit again the next time i'm in town.", 
            "came here late, like around 1am with a party of 3. they were packed. the place is located  in the heart of chinatown on the upstairs. \n\nthe location is small. definitely not suitable for big groups. they can probably accommodate and make it work, but it's snug there. \n\nvery very very authentic menu. i recommend ordering from the \"menu\" on the wall. they even have a menu in all japanese, so this place is traditional as it comes. you can pretty much can order anything and they will make it how you request and order it. just don't know how much they will charge.  \n\nthe raw shaken beef appetizer is a must try. very very  delicious and it doesn't taste raw... it just melts in your mouth. \n\nwe also salmon nigiri. super fresh tasting. we also had udon and <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>. definitely a different way the seaweed is presented and prepared. \n\neverything taste wonderful here and definitely very traditional. it's a bit on the expensive side but it's japanese so it's expected. but definitely worth it.", 
            "<mark>Chicken Cutlet</mark>: i didn't like this dish. it was okay. \n\nkushi-katsu: breaded and delicious. would recommend this. \n\nagedashi tofu: i didn't like this one in particular because i had one before that is better. \n\nocha-zuka (salmon): this was surprisingly delicious. first time trying it and warning: there's little wasabi things in it so if you can't handle spicy make sure to ask for it without it. \n\n<mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark>: i really liked this ramen. i liked how the noodles were cooked and brother was yummy. would definitely get this again. \n\n<mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>: was yummy. \n\nyellow tail (hamachi): it was okay wasn't delicious. \n\nsalmon (sake): okay as well. \n\nservice: in between attentive and not. \n\ni would recommend this place if you want to try everything with a group of friends. ramen is a ng portion though.", 
            "ichiza definitely not a five star sushi place and very casual with a good point of it. we got black cod fish filet, whole ika yaki, octopus with cucumber and fire rosted eggplant and later added sewed salad. \noctopus was fresh and juicy. eggplant was so so, nothing special, just roasted and unseasoned .\nblack cod was star of the dishes, very good and whole grilled squid was nit bad at all. \nthe waitress came later and said that <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>   is sold out. how <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> can be sold out in japanese place). overall was good experience, but as la residence driving to vegas ones a while i will not come back and try to see what else is around", 
            "i went to ichiza yesterday for the first time, and i loved it there ! anything in china town on a friday night is busy so i made sure to make reservation. good thing i did because there would have been a wait. it is a restaurant w sushi, seafood \nsmall tapas, etc, so my friend and i ordered a bunch of stuff all at different times.  i was impressed w the service. waitstaff is great, and the food comes out fast. \n\nmy friend ordered most of the food so i can't really tell u everything we got. i did not like the vegetable pancake very much so i will not get that again. i loved the <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> !! and the honey toast was delicious! i wish this spot was 24 hour because i would totally come here after a night of drinking to eat the honey toast. \n\ni wish i had gotten all of our servers' names. they were awesome and deserve recognition. it was very busy and a lot going on, and none of our orders were ever forgotten. i served tables for many years and i know how hard it is during a dinner rush. \n\n5/5 stars, i will definately be coming back and i will bring my friends and family :)\n\nps. parking sucks. park in the shopping center next door and walk over !!!"

            "best japanese i've had in vegas yet.  i was surprised to find the inside somewhat low-key and comfortable, a must for me since i have to eat and do stuff all the time.  the service was attentive and friendly, pretty amazing since it is fairly busy inside. \n\ni had the <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>, a light and delectable dish featuring a combination of different varieties of seaweed.  i was very impressed that the plate nailed both texture, taste and managed to include a garden variety of vegetables such as cucumber and lettuce.  \n\ni also had a tempura eel roll, ridiculously delicious.  the ingredients in the roll, although components of a ca roll, were very fresh, and impressed on what would normally be a cliche.  the agedashi tofu, another winner, served at the perfect temperature, had the right sauce, just perfect execution.  <mark>Chicken Cutlet</mark>, better than chicken at a lot of chicken places.  to finish, i tried the honey toast, just great.\n\nthe only downside is the shopping center, the lot is narrow and packed.  it's open late, so i'll be back many times.", 
            "second time visiting this place. first time, we walked in and found the wait to be about an hour. so made a quick u-turn and decided to go elsewhere.. this time, no different.. 45 min. - 1 hr. wait.. i'm not used to waiting in vegas?! seriously?!.. ok, this time we waited.\n\nwhat we had at the bar counter:\n\n21. <mark>Chicken Cutlet</mark>: deep fried breaded chicken (like katsu or chicken fried steak). nice crust and the dark brown dipping sauce brought it alive! sauce was thick and semi-sweet ilke (katsu/teriyaki sauce). chicken was moist and sliced into finger tenders. plain good.\n\n62. kaku - ni (pork belly w/ egg): small bowl filled with tender and juicy pork in some type of broth/sauce and a half a boiled egg. full of pork goodness!\n\n81. <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> - kimchi: nice portion, mild balanced flavor of kimchi, rice was soft, not mushy and went great with all the proteins.\n\n*off the wall/paper menu:\n\nsalmon belly: decent slab of salmon belly fillet with an evident taste of some kind of light vinegar/alcohol flavoring. came with a tiny mound of super minced radish. salmon was 'melt in your mouth or on the dish' consistency. it was kind of rich, fatty and delicious (the radish settled down the richness and fattiness a bit). \n\nyellowtail tar tar: i usually don't do raw but this time i made an exception because of all the praising on past reviews. 4 pieces, each piece was a fluffy and crunchy tortilla chips layered with rice, avocado and.. yellowtail on top. i couldn't taste the fish much, i just noticed a slight chewiness. everything worked really well, the texture was amazing and it was an awesome tortialla chip sandwich!\n\natmosphere reminded me of some restaurants in little tokyo, los angeles (it felt like i was eating somewhere in japan). no complaints on service. value was fair, japanese portions are hardly ever huge but quality makes up for it. the food was satisfied but nothing really stood out.. i'd come back but i wouldn't wait more than 10 minutes to dine here.", 
            "so, here we go. i feel like i should never write an review unless i've been to the place more than three times. and yes folks. i have been there more than three times. \n\nthis particular time was just as awesome as the previous were, except for one little hiccup. a very concerning one at that. \n\nso what did i order you ask? \n\ntakoyaki balls- japanese staple in my opinion meant to be searing as it enters your mouth. basically a dough ball filled with octopus. topped with neon red ginger and teriyaki sauce. so delicious. lets face it it's hard to mess up this dish. \n\nbeef curry and rice with <mark>Chicken Cutlet</mark> - warm hot rice mixed with some japanese not too spicy but oh so hot curry. it is a taste sensation. the mix of an aromatic curry always gives me tingles in me's boy parts i gotta tell ya. \n\nsakana pinchos - i should asked someone about the etymology about this one. for those not in the known etymology means study origin. cus lets face it, pinchos if ever been in the east coast either north or south means the puerto rican always good meat on a stick. not a sushi roll sandwhich topped to sky with seafood goodness. its 6 pieces two of each kind of sushi mountain goodness. the first is masago ( fish eggs ) with spicy mayo on top of a a slice of squid on top of a large slice of tuna. on top of the rice. out of breath yet ? i know i am...!  keep in mind this is one sushi nigiri all held together by a toothpick! the second kind is the large salmon fish eggs on top of mackrel on top of a miso leaf and rice. talk about a problem in a mystery wrapped with an enigma... ! finally is the third kind which is the salmon eggs on top of steamed orange shrimp on top of tamago ( egg). \n\nare you tired yet? salivating ? both? well keep reading cus i got more.\n\nfinally the last thing was. the always yellowtail tar tar. \n\nthis thing is kind of a bore at times better left for those novice sushi or japanese eaters and one truth i would like to have kept hidden but ichiza caught me in a clandestine mood and decided to go for it. crunchy chilled yellowtail mixed some  yummy veggies. go great with some beer. \n\ni also had two kirin ichiban to drink it down with. i don't know what it was but all of this food and full tummy might almost make up for the large pill bug walking across the bartop...!!!! yes girlfriend , i went there. i was with the gf and as gentleman i covered it up with a napkin and but it escaped my clutches and went to the table space reserved for my very nervous female neighbors. it was a funny site to see. which in retrospect made up for some of the incident. but what are you gonna do ? \n\nthe service was nice. the waitresses did check on us frequently and i tipped them 15-20% as any normal upstanding patron would do. but man that owner. someone's gotta do something about him. he made my gf wait out front before letting her sit down. and in i walk 5 mins later. this wasn't the first incident that something like this happened. when i was there before we were on the waiting list and they said 20 minutes nearly a half an hour ago. so i go up to him and ask and all he has to say is sorry sorry sorry but we called your name. don't think so pal. without letting me finish. nope that won't do at all. so i let my grievance out. he politely listens and say sorry again as he shows us our table. \n\nso, my star rating you ask ? 3/5 \n\nbut other than that it's usually an ok time. my tab was around 50 dollars plus tip.", 
            "on a sunday night, to celebrate a friend's bday, we came here and ordered lots of food and drinks\n1. <mark>Chicken Cutlet</mark> \n2. shrimp tempura and rice \n3. red snapper \n4. jalapeno <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> \n5. vegetable croquette \n6. chicken gizzards \n7. brick toast with ice cream\n8. yakatori \n9. grilled mackerel\n10. a whole lotta warm sake and sapparo \n\n- we were able to get a big table for a group of eight where we got to take our shoes off but didn't have to sit \"cross cross apple sauce hands on lap ginger snap!\" lol ok ok..side tracked...kids...\n- food came out quickly. service was nice. they turned off the lights and surprised him with a banana crepe with a candle and sang happy bday. \n- no rush to push us out of the restaurant.\n- language barrier check! that's when you'll know the food will be legit, if you know what i mean. \n- i definitely get the japapeno <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, grilled mackerel, and brick toast again.",

            "i have been using yelp for restaurant ideas now for several months, but have never been moved to write a review until tonight.  tonight, there was no way that i would pass up this opportunity to rave about the first true izakaya tavern that i have found here in las vegas.\n\ni have never even heard of izakaya taverns until a good friend of ours introduced us to musha in torrance, ca and it's been a whirlwind love affair since then.  i love the casual, authentic japanese atmosphere of these places.  from the entire restaurant staff greeting you with a hearty \"irashaimashite!\" as you walk in to the almost-guaranteed \"we'll see you next time!\"  it's never a goodbye, as they know that you will be back..... oh yes, you will be back.   there is just that special feeling that you get when you go to an izakaya tavern.\nand it was no different for me this time around.  at first we were leery of this place, seeing as how we have never heard of it until i did a google search for \"izakaya vegas\".  but the fact that the first hit was a review on yelp with multiple 5-star recommendations, there was no way i was going to be swayed by my belief that there is no such thing as \"genuine\" in las vegas.   am i ever glad that we did.  this place brought back such fond memories of the fun that we had with our friends at musha.  from the buta kakuni to the broiled beef tongue and the garlic butter clams, this place had everything that i liked including more reasonable pricing!  dishes ranged from $1.75 for assorted single skewered meats (beef tongue, chicken wings, chicken balls) to around $8.95+  for the sashimi plates, with most items ranging in the $4-$5 range.\nfor our first visit, we tried out the:\n-shisyamo age - which are crisp deep fried smelt(3 pieces) stuffed with roe - boneless and absolutely delicious with either the provided salt or some asked-for ponzu.\n\n-beef tataki - tender seared beef slices dipped in ponzu\n\n-yamakake - tuna sashimi with yam potato and some slimy stuff that i just could not identify (i liked it, but people who judge food by texture may be turned off by it. - not for everybody)\n\n-vegetable <mark>Croquette</mark> - mashed potatoes, veggies, wrapped in panko and fried until the outside is crisp and crunchy while the inside if hot and well.... mashed potatoe'y?  kind of like a breaded and deep fried sheperd's pie, i suppose.\n\n- broiled black cod - the hands-down star of tonight's dinner.  yummy buttery black cod with a sweet tangy marinade and the skin broiled to a crisp ... absolutely delightful.\n\n- kushi-tan - broiled beef tongue on a skewer - the staple of every izakaya tavern i've ever been to.  a squeeze of lemon and you're good to go.\n\n- kaku-ni - pork belly, simmered for hours in mirin, shoyu, sugar etc. until it's chopstick-tender and practically melts in your mouth.  can sometimes be really fatty because of the cut of the meat, but lucikly ours was fairly lean, maybe we got lucky, or maybe they select leaner cuts?  guess i'll have to order it again next time to find out!  a small bowl of rice is a must.\n\n- and the clencher - bacon wrapped mochi on a stick. broiled to a crisp, yet chewy .... and bacon'y .....  and mochi'y ... it's freaking mocchi and bacon, how else would you describe it? ... you need to try this for yourself if you're adventurous enough, or just hate your heart.\n\nichiza is definitely an instant favorite and a must-visit for all of my out-of-town buds.", 
            "continues to be great food!  after ordering about 15 items or so, here's the standouts:\n\nvegetable <mark>Croquette</mark> - perfect crisp, awesome flavor.\n\nichiza <mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark> - continues to be great broth, springy noodles, and perfectly cooked half egg.  pork belly was a little bit overdone, but the only weakness i'd say.\n\nbroiled rice - so simple, so delicious, so surprisingly good.\n\nchicken skewers - phenomenal!  so tender, so delicious...\n\nchicken balls - i wasn't as big of a fan, but two of my dining mates loved it and dubbed it the best dish of the night.\n\ntofu steak - super tender tofu, a nice crisped outing, very tasty!\n\nbeef tongue skewer - tender and well seasoned!  excellent.\n\nhoney toast - honestly, solely because of this dish, i may make my way to ichiza every time i'm in vegas.... soooo good and what a way to end a great meal already.\n\nverdict:  do it.  go early if you can before it fills up (even on weekends) and enjoy a great meal.  the four of us had a ton of dishes, two bottles of sake, and came out to around $25 a person for some spectacular food.  and vegetarian friendly!",

            "ichiza deserves all the credit in the world (at least vegas) for making non-japanese people of las vegas aware of something called izakaya.  they started the craze by offering up good japanese-style tapas in a communal setting, in the heart of spring mountain, way ahead of their time.  they've been around for at least 10 years, at it's just recently that this run of izakayas have emerged in town.  perhaps that's why, but this perennially packed joint has lost some of its crowd.  not to a point of detriment, but i remember going here when you literally had to wait 45-60 minutes to get in, and now it's maybe 5-10 minutes, if at all.\n\nthey have a lot of items, many of which i have no idea what they are.  aside from getting menus, they are individually pasted all over the walls and i never bothered to check whether it's the same stuff as on the menu.  i think many are not, so it would be worthwhile if you can read japanese.  the setting is wide open so it's great for people watching, especially since it is frequented by mostly young patrons.  service is passable, some girls are really nice and others are pretty much all business.  but your stuff comes promptly, and service is rarely something to complain about.\n\nthe food, as may be expected from a place with such a large menu, can be hit-or-miss.  i would say most are good to very good, such as myriad of their tofu dishes and excellent fried items (e.g. <mark>Croquette</mark>).  some are pretty good (don dishes & grilled fishes), and a few are not recommended (didn't like their udon).  chances are that you will find their dishes at least acceptable in most cases, so don't be afraid to order.  i have been here many times and i can't say i've ever left with a sour taste in my mouth.\n\ntable-for-1 factor:  while they have bar seating across from the chefs, i would not recommend hitting up an izakaya by yourself, especially this one.  just awkward.",

            "this is by far one of my most favorite restaurants in las vegas.  ever since discovering this place about 3-4 years ago, i have always been coming back.  this isn't your high end japanese restaurant.   the decor is simple, the prices are very reasonable, the food is extensive and excellent, and the place is great place to be merry.  right when you walk in you are greeted in japanese and when you leave your thanked in japanese.  the workers there all seem to be young students.  \nthere are so many dishes to choose from.  the only thing i can do is tell you about what i always order: 1) menu items:  kushi-katsu - crunchy breaded pork w/lemony teriyaki dip; ika yaki - broiled squid;  ichiza <mark>Ichiza's <mark>Half Ramen Noodles</mark></mark> - yummy; <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>; beef tataki - rare beef slice to dip in a ponzu-dailkon radish mixture (sublime); kim chee <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>; and a sashimi plate w/ tuna, albacore, mackerel, yellow tail, salmon, octopus, and squid. 2) non-menu items (sheets of paper that have daily/common specials are posted over the walls)  monk fish liver, fried smelt (my most favorite b/c the eggs are cooked in the belly), and beef cubes in ponzu sauce.  yeah, there are a lot of dishes that i like, but im so impressed that ichiza's has not disappointed me for the many times i've been there.  they have large group seating areas, which i've enjoyed many times with friends and family eating and drinking up cold sake, sake bombs, and japanese beer.  i really recommend their house cold sake, so much better and smoother than drinking it warm.  i've been there a many nights till closing leaving with my belly full and ridiculously buzzed from all the sake we drank.   i always have to put this on the itinerary of any of my visiting friends and family that come to las vegas.  that's how much i love and trust this place.  anybody who knows me, can back me up for whatever say about this restaurant b/c most likely i've taken them there....\nadditional note...don't think that this restaurant is one of those upscale dress up places b/c of the amount of stars i gave it.  it gets five stars b/c all around it's hella awesome!!!", 
            "itadakimasu! it's exactly how you feel when you walk into this quaint little place above tea planet. yes....you would never know it was here except for the sounds of fun and mmm mmm smells of japanese goodness. ichiza is definitely a jewel  hidden in vegas. there's nothing more authentic than ichiza. i just like saying it...ichiza ichiza ichiza.\ni have taken and introduced people to this place and they have all agreed how fun it is. not your typical, \"yea dude let me get a california roll\" or your run of the mill chicken teriyaki. that's not japanese. we're looking at mmm mmm broiled squid, and katsu, real <mark>Ichiza's <mark>Half Ramen Noodles</mark></mark> - mmmm tampopo! kirin ichiban on draft! i love the veggie tempura bowls where there's just a nest of veggies over rice with real teriyaki sauce. how can you go wrong? yea! you won't find your typical teppanyaki chef there making onion volcanos.  sure there's things here that white people may cringe upon like the gizzard skewers...or even beef tongue....sweet fried garlic with natto(a fermented soybean).....the service is a little slow. i figure it's because the place is usually really busy. i like having a place to go to in the middle of the night that can make me feel all warm and fuzzy....and that's not from the kirin.  if you have enough room. you gotta try the honey toast. it takes some time so order it when you're halfway finished. it's japanese toast (like half a loaf of bread) partially hollowed out with butter....honey....and vanilla ice cream. simple, delicious....and to the point. \ni definitely enjoy the ramen, jalepeno <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> - yakitori - and the grilled squid...oooo and grilled makerel, black cod in miso....so much to choose from!\nthis place can fit anyone's budget. the ambiance is traditional japanese, with pictures and specials on the walls, there's a group area that you can sit, but you gotta take your shoes off. the bar is great because you can watch them cook in the kitchen. overall - a must go place.\n\nif you're a regular here - get your ichiza stamp card for a discount.", 
            "thank goodness for yelp. i wouldn't have discovered this restaurant without all the good reviews about it. \n\ni love tastings of different  dishes when i dine out. ichiza has quality tapas size dishes at very reasonable prices. for those reasons, this is now my favorite japanese restaurant. \n\nthe bf and i shared:\n\nuni w/ponzu\ngrilled squid \nyellowtail, salmon, mackerel, tuna, albacore sashimi combo\ngrilled smelt roe - fellow yelpers influence :) \nfried oyster - i was craving the fresh oysters, but they were out :(\nshrimp <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> \nbeef tataki\nbeer  \ncalpico shu\n=========\n$70\n\nthe sashimi and uni were very fresh. after reading some of the reviews, i had to try the smelt roe.  i didn't know how to eat the smelt roe, but shared the dish with another patron at the bar and watched him eat it first. it was tasty. all the dishes we ordered were yummy! i will definitely come back here on each vegas trip.", 
            "went and ate at ichiza last night based off of all the reviews i have read on yelp. and i have to say that i loved it. had a short wait when we arrived, but i think you get that at all good places, and we were seated in less then 10 minutes. the menu items written all over the walls were fun to read and interpret, but i wonder if i missed out on anything good because i didnt see it written somewhere. :) and some of them were written only in japanese, so i wondered what they were. next time i am going to order all the items i cant read, and just be surprised when thing show up.  \"i'll take that, and that, and that...\" \nwe ordered the deep fried baby soft shell crabs, marinated minced spanish mackerel, kimchi <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, tartar yellowtail, wasabi green bean tempura, and the mapo-tofu (all for only $44, including 2 large sapporos).  everthing was great. the yellowtail was recommended by several people on yelp, and i agree with them. it was great. a little messy, but i didnt mind that. the baby soft shell crabs kind of caught me by surprise, because they werent kidding about \"baby\" these little things looked like they had just been born, and hadnt had time to grow a shell yet...but they were very tasty. i liked the marinated spanish mackerel, served on top of a cucumber wedge, and the kimchi <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was very good too. the beer prices were great too. $5.50 for a large sapporo, i have paid alot more than that at other places. \nthe staff was all very friendly, and helpful, and i think everyone who worked there said good bye, and see you next time, as we were leaving. i will diffinately be going back. in fact, i cant wait too.\n\nupdate: went here again saturday evening and it was even better the second time. i'm upgrading ichiza to 5 stars.", 
            "i have been to ichiza twice and i have had great experiences both times. both times i have been there, there was a short wait.  i have been seated at both a table and at the bar.  service was good, and everyone was friendly. the first time i went i was with an ichiza veteran who knew exactly what to order, so i had a whole mess of stuff, and can't really remember what any of it was, could have been the fact her expertise included mass quantities of sake. i remembered the kimchi <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and mapo-tofu and ordered those again on my second visit.  the next time i went we were a little more daring and did most of our ordering off the walls. once again everything was yummy.  i was not a huge fan of the minced spanish mackerel, but it was okay.  the tartar yellowtail was delicious, but a bit of a challenge to eat. when i lost about half of it down my shirt, it was good for a laugh. :) the prices are very reasonable, and i left full and happy.\n\nsince my first review, i have been back many times, and i have always had a great experience.  tonight the folks at ichiza went above and beyond!!  there was a bit of a wait, so we went downstairs to tea planet, and we didn't have enough time to finish our drinks.  we went in ichiza half expecting them to tell us no outside drinks, which they did...however, they offered to put our drinks in the refrigerator for us so they wouldn't go to waste! just another reason to love ichiza, and in case you need another...two words...honey toast. yum!", 
            "this place was what started my ramen craze!  their udon dish and <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was so delicous, actually everything is!  not only that, this is the only sushi spot that i know of... opening until 2a.m. and the food is authentic japanese cuisine, since the staff is literally only japanese.  the tables maybe small and everything, and the size of the restaurant isn't all that big... but the service is great.   \n\nif we had a restuarant that was similar to this place in the area, i think it would be banking in hella money and on top of that, its not very often that you go to a restuarant and order ramen noodle.\n\n*still thinking about*..... gawd..... i'm hungry for ramen.", 
            "a local spot that no one should miss.  it's a relaxed atmosphere where people want the feeling of being in japan while eating the food.  i've been here so many times already and i'm always amazed and in awe with their food, service, and overall atmosphere.  the experience is also one i've never had.  i don't know what authentic japanese food really means but i would assume ichiza gives that full meaning.\n\njust like any other japanese restaurants, when i walk in i'm greeted loudly by all the employees in their language.  the past two times this week i've been i was with my cousins and this was the night to devirginize christine with sake.  muahahahahahaha!!!!  we were seated at the bar to watch the careful preparation of each food that was ordered by all customers.  it's a small and cute little restaurant that may sometimes have a wait because of seating capacity.  \n\nthe menu is either in a form of a book or hanging from the ceiling in the bar area with pictures so you can see what the food looks like before ordering it.  i have found this very useful.  also, you can just ask one of the servers what they would recommend and always will they give you a straight up answer.  they know their shit!  what's good?  okay, you can order their shrimp <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, garlic <mark>Boiled Cold Bok Choy</mark>, oysters (mmm... their oysters here are bomb!), sushi is also good, kimchi pork (this is something you have to order too), shrimp tempura, sake (large bottle), and there's just so much to choose from.  the only item i wasn't very hot for was the fried udon.  i can't put my finger on it but i know i wouldn't order it again.  although i've been informed it's a popular item amongst majority of the customers.  by the end of it all, i was very full and satisfied as we ordered just the exact amount for everyone.\n\nnow, the moment of truth.  it was time to sink the shot in christine's mouth.  we were like little school girls pouring the shots.  christine took the shot and didn't like it but got used to it after a while drinking.  i think this is where i'm gonna take my god sister when she comes to visit me.  i'm excited.", 
            "once again, thank you yelp for helping me find another great restaurant to satisfy my hungry tummy... my boyfriend's parents live in vegas, so we come here a couple of times a year.  for the past year, i've been wanting to try this place out, and finally got around to it tonight.  i really liked how the restaurant was set up - small, simple, and traditional looking - they're not trying to look super nice, rather than giving off a more comfortable eating atmosphere.\n\nthe inside of ichiza consists of around 10 tables, and then there's a tatami (i don't know if there's a spelling for it) section with 2 long tables, where you take your shoes off and sit on the ground.  then besides that, there's the kitchen area.\n\nthe service here is ok, not great but not bad.  it is what it is.  however, the food is really good.  like richard l. said, it's like tapas, but japanese style.  i guess this type of cuisine is called \"izakaya\" as i have learned after reading all of these reviews.  living in the bay area, i actually have yet to find a place with this type of cuisine - everyone in the bay is really hung up on sushi (hey, which i love, dont get me wrong). \n\nanyhow, my boyfriend and i came here tonight and we ordered an order of their udon, chicken skewers, agedashi tofu, kimchi <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, and spicy tuna roll.  the udon was really tasty and they added some seaweed, egg, and veggies to it.  i didn't try the chicken skewers, but they looked like teryaki chicken pieces on a stick, and my boyfriend liked them a lot.  the agedashi tofu, which is one of my favorite appetizers, came with a generous portion of fruit, and 4 huge slices of tofu.  the tofu was very fresh and soft, and the dish was very good.  spicy tuna roll was pretty good, but not amazing.  lastly, i loved their kimchi <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.. ichiza's <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> definitely kicks some @ss... it was sooooo tasty and with the kimchi, it was the perfect amount of spicyness.\n\noverall, 4 stars for above average food and very low prices.  (all of those dishes only came out to about $22.)  definitely a lot lower than the prices we're used to.  all of the smaller dishes run from $3-$5, and larger dishes run from $6-$9.. none of it is expensive.  if i lived in the area, i would definitely come back.\n\nand, they're open till 3am!", 
            "ichiza is where tourists come to die. and by that, i mean i wish the tourists here would die. something about being white, middle aged, and vacationing in vegas brings out the worst in people. add sake and gen-u-wine japanese food, and you get fourty-somethings licking food off of each other's bodies (and then applauding each other's courage for doing something so indecent in public) while opting to forgo the wearing of footwear (and not as a display of respect, but as a display of drunken negligence- who walks around in a parking lot without shoes @ 2am?) while the menu at ichiza is dynamic, drunken tourists are always on the menu. yes: kirin on tap, seared salmon belly, miso butterfish, kimchi <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, seared bonito, sashimi, rolled sushi, braised pork belly, mixed mushrooms, honey toast.  no: hamachi collar (salty and dry), skewers (blach- greasy), octopus and cucumber (not so fresh), anything with egg in it.", 
            "definitely my favorite of las vegas. i was bummed they ran out of the honey toast, cuz i heard so much about it from fellow yelpers. so don't go so late like i did (12am).  i had the best beef ever!!! even better than korean bbq...wait, nothing can beat korean bbq. anyhoo, it's called \"beef tataki.\" for like $6, it's a tiny dish with several slices of this deliciously flavored meat. i would rather have several dishes of this stuff than some plain boring american steak. another fantastic dish: \"crab <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.\" around $7, and it's a perfect size for one person. i think it's fake crab meat, but it's the best <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> ever! they used some magical oils for sure. not oily, just incredibly flavorful! this place uses fresh ingredients and makes every dish soooo intense with flavor, but still healthy!! i had the red snapper carpaccio as well,very fresh thinly sliced fish with some eggs and some veggies, but it felt too light like salad without much dressing. but seriously, i will come back to try everything :) i trust their taste. and the japanese girls that work there are so cute and sweet. the manager is also very personable.", 
            "an off the strip hole in the wall that was very satisfying...\n\nduring my best friend's bachelorette party weekend in vegas, a fellow bridesmaid (who uses yelp religiously for good eat recommendations as well) suggested to dine here. luckily we had a minivan that could pack in 9 girls and take a 10-15 minute drive away from the strip.\n\nichiza is located on the second floor of an asian strip mall. in comparison to the other vegas restaurants on the strip, this was definitely no fancy place (a bit of a hole in the wall) but definitely had character. since we arrived early for dinner we got to eat in one of the two group tables in the back where you take your shoes off.\n\ni can honestly say i've never been to a japanese restaurant like this before....when we looked at the menu we were all a little taken back (i guess i'm a bit sheltered when it comes to authetic japanese food).....what no bento boxes? no large sushi menu?.....then what do they serve? this place was everything but ordinary....on the walls they posted signs with the various small dishes that ranged from $2 to $6 and various things on the menu i've never heard off. each lady ordered 2-4 mini appetizers or dishes and we all just shared everything. it was super fun getting to sample alot of things in one siting. we kind of played it safe because alot of the choices sounded a bit scary. from what i remember we grubbed on:\n\n-japanese style crab <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> (yumm)\n-kimchi with pork (this was one of my favorites)\n-grilled mackarel\n-grilled bacon wrapped mochi (sounded so weird we had to try it)\n-sweet grilled corn\n-deep fried chow mein (kinda like pan fried noodles)\n-fried calamari\n-mini fried chicken pieces\n-a couple sushi speciality rolls (unagi & scallop) of the few choices they had\n-and can't forget about the famous honey toast (sweet bread ala mode)!!!!....note: it does takes about 15 minutes to cook and we ordered 3 seperate ones so that there was 3 people to each honey toast. this dessert really topped off the meal and is probably what pushed this to a 4 star review! \n\nthe waitresses were overall friendly but kind of hard to understand since i think they were more fleunt in japanese than english. by the time we left the place, which was about 8:30pm on a saturday night this small place was packed with several costumers waiting outside...so again it was comforting to know that it can be a popular place during peak dining times.\n\nalthough we were skeptical when we first walked in, this ended up being a memorable dinner with the ladies for $25 a person (which inlcuding us treating the bride to be). so if you are tired of the vegas buffets, want something more authentic, wanna try something new, and have a car (as i don't thinnk it's necessarily worth a cab ride from the strip), i'd definitely recommend giving this place a shot if you wanna dine with all the locals.\n\nthis unique japanese-style tapas place hit the spot!!!", 
            "we ordered a few things items but i especially enjoyed a sushi with unagi on a fried tempura thing on top of sushi, pork tataki, and the kimchi <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. \n\nthe honey toast was made up of really simple ingredients... honey, hawaiian bread, butter, and vanilla ice cream..... but it was a really satisfying treat at the end of our meal.", 
            "another late night in vegas and hunger calls... straight to yelp for recommendations! ichiza is located in the chinatown/spring mountain road area in vegas, just a short 10 minute drive from the strip, and imo better food. we got here around midnight saturday night with a grumbling tummy. the place was crowded and lively. we ordered: \n\ntofu salad w/ tuna sashimi - standard, not bad\ntsukune & kushi tan - decent\nsteamed pork dumplings - actually siomai but very good. juicy and flavorful\ndeep fried garlic - first time seeing this, served with miso paste, very yummy.\ncrab <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> - decent\nagadashi tofu - decent\n\ni would definitely come back next time we're in vegas... good food, lively atmosphere and good value.", 
            "i don't know why this place has such a high rating.  i thought the food was okay.  and the price was pretty reasonable.  i'm guessing in the late night after drinking and partying this is a great place to go.  otherwise, i would recommend some of the other places in vegas that the yelpers recommend.\n\nwe ordered the agadeshi tofu, jalapeno <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, chicken gizzards, braised pork belly, and a roll recommended by the waitress.  everything was decently cooked but some of it was too greasy and the food tasted rushed.  there were a lot of people in the restaurant and waiting outside.\n\nfinally we got the honey toast.  really.... i don't understand the hype.  it's a cube of bread toasted with vanilla ice cream and honey poured on the top.  really, that's it.\n\nif you want to try something a little quirky and raku is closed (where we initially wanted to go) i would say okay.  but this place isn't really that special and there are so many places to go for food in vegas.", 
            "once again yelp to the rescue... we went to a 9pm show without eating dinner, by the time it was over we were ravenous but didn't want 'casino' food. so we decided on japanese food, i did a quick search on the mobile device and entered late night dining. this was the third place to pop up. to our surprise this place is open until 3am on a sunday!?! wow. the reviews were great so we drove over to lv's chinatown area and boy were we glad! this place is in a strip mall on the second floor, its looks like a mom and pop type place. the restaurant mainly had japanese clients, another good sign, if natives eat there then you know its good. anyway we were promptly seated in one of the last spots, it was almost 11pm and it was bustling in there. the menu is rather perplexing, we were overwhelmed and were not sure what to order when she asked for drinks and appetizers. i would characterize this place as japanese 'tapas'. we proceeded to order a bunch of little plates. we started with basics like <mark>Miso Soup</mark> and house salad, the dressing was to die for and a rather huge salad nicely presented with all the fixings. we tried their house special roll, very unique in presentation, think california roll with tempura onions and eel on top, f-ing fantastic! we also had a spicy tuna roll and an order of their marinated fried chicken and shrimp <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. again remember these are small plates but plates of yummy flavorful food. the shrimp <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was awesome, think benihana but better, not greasy and large shrimp properly de-veined! i was in love and i told my husband so. he was in love with the spicy tuna roll himself, i believe the sushi chef also noticed because they gave us an additional one on the house. the prices here are reasonable too. i would definitely return because there were many many more items left to try on the menu.",

(he thought it was delicious)\n\nthe bacon asparagus was delicious\n\nthe enoki wrapped chicken skin was a bust.  the mushroom was mushy, unflavored, and skin was fatty.\n\nthe yellowtail tar tar was unusual.  definitely a combination of western and asian.  my friend loved it and i personally wouldn't order it again.\n\ni enjoyed the buta kimchi with pork more korean style and ate that with a bowl of rice.\n\ni would like to go again and try the ramen looks awesome.\n\nand maybe the curry, some more seafood like grilled squid.  the table next to us got it and it looked good. \n\nthe <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> looked good but, i try to avoid the huge meals and get more tapas style.\n\nthe other table got bread with honey and ice cream.  looked wonderful but, i was way to stuffed just from what we ordered and we eat alot.  \n\ntotal bill with two teas (yummy toasted rice green tea)\n\nexcluding tip $35.\n\nnot bad to try so many different dishes.", 
            "this little japanese joint is off the charts! the decor is street-ish japanese.  from the tables to the writing to the kitchen.\n\nwhat's unique about the place is the 'special' menu is written on the walls.  so if you are daring, by all means, order from it.  this place is one of a kind, it's not your typical bennihana's or kyoto bowl, this is a direct import from japan! =) love it!\n\nyou can almost say this place serve 'tapas' but japanese-style.  i had grilled squid to <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> to raw sliced meat.  all i can say is this was a different dining experience but so good!\n\ngreat place to hit up after a long night of dancing and mingling, opens super late!", 
            "i am adding ichiza to my list of favorite japanese restaurants. \n\ndh and i went here for dinner @ 8pm on a friday night. i was anticipating a long wait but when we got there, we were immediately seated at the sushi bar/counter. im glad that i checked yelp for suggestions before coming here since their menu is practically plastered all over the walls of the restaurant!\n\nwe ordered the shrimp <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, sakana roll, uni in ponzu sauce, mochi wrapped in bacon, fried whole garlic, chicken and gizzard yakitori.\n\nthe uni and sakana were sooooo good and by far are my 2 favorites from ichiza. the garlic was not strong and tasted really good with the salty paste it was served with. the chicken and mochi skewers were very tasty and moist!\n\nof course we have saved room for their famous honey toast which was absolutely to die for! the honey and vanilla ice cream were a perfect combination on top of the big crunchy chunk of bread.\n\nthis place also gives me a happy vibe and combining that with the good food for a great price, ichiza earns 5 stars from me :)\n\nwe will be coming back to try other items on their menu the next time we are in vegas!", 
            "this place was great! the pork belly is *unbelievable* -- the grilled salmon was perfect. we had tuna rolls and perfect <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, all excellent. the wilted spinach with peanut sauce (?) was good, too -- but could be skipped.  the chicken gizzards were good as well. \n\nfor desert we all (4 men) shared this sweet bread with ice cream on top, and there was still some left. very good!\n\nthe only turn-off (and the reason this isn't 5 stars) was while sitting you notice the cloth-covered seats showed all the \"history\" of the place, if you can imagine what i mean. blech. but that's the price you pay for authentic japanese. \n\nget off the strip and check this place out!",

            "one word \"superlicious!\" ok a made up word.  i've been going to this place since 2007, we decided to try it since there were sooo many people waiting for such a small hole in the wall place.  we fell in love!  i've taken my ex-hisband there, my current husband and most of all my friends, and u know it's good if my ex will go w me even though we hate each other.  i luv there broiled rice balls w/umeboshi (plum) inside and ther tatsu-age (fried boneless chicken),  the ochazke w/plum is a must when you're feeling sick, at first u wouldn't like it, but now everyone craves it when they're sick.\n\na few things that's a must when you go:\nyellow tail tatake\nbroiled rice balls (they come in 2's)\ncharamushi (<mark>Egg Drop Soup</mark> w/shrimp, chicken, mushrooms, spinach)\ntatsu-age (fried bonelss chicken)\nbeef patty\nbuta kimchi (stir fried kimchi/pork)\ntuna tofu salad w/ponzu (citrus) sauce\njalapeno or kimchi <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. mmmm..mmm.. good!\n\nlast but not least the honey french toast for dessert", 
            "yummy authentic japanese bar food\n\nwhat i ate:\n- garlic gizzards (stir fry) excellent if you like gizzards and if you like garlic. perfect balance of flavors!\n- deep fried sweet shrimp: honestly the best bar food ever! perfect crunchy little shrimp that you can pop into your mouth whole! (think of the deep fried head of the sweet shrimp sushi, but bite sized!) the real shrimp chip!\n- whole grilled squid: perfectly grilled. so flavorful!\n- broiled fish... sorry i totally forget the name, but its the broiled fish filled with roe. also very tasty\n- beef tataki: very very tasty! super fresh and flavorful. the beef was amazingly tender\n- yakitori of beef tongue: not the most tender ive had, but still pretty good\n- bacon wrapped potato (skewered): perfect hot fluffy potato, wrapped in crispy bacon... whats not to love??\n- crab <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>: yummy\n\nthis was probably the perfect amount of food for two girls.. hahaha jk, this was an enormous amount of food, but ate everything over the course of two hours in combination with four large sapporos. ... we spent almost $100 including a nice tip, so... not cheap, but we did eat and drink quite a bit.\n\npros:\n- food! if you like japanese food, or are interested in trying something other than the typical sushi, try this place! definitely try to sit at the bar! you can ogle all the food that leaves the kitchen!\n- service: all the servers were super friendly and cute and attentive... but i think you need to be a bit assertive with the guy at the host stand (i think he was the owner?) so that you can get seated promptly. its not that he was unfriendly, just a bit scattered trying to handle so many different things at once.\n- decor: cute jap pub feel. homey, not fancy or stuffy, but like your neighborhood place that you go right after work... bathroom was not the cleanest, but the typical pub/bar restroom.\n- hours: im not used to restaurants being open after 2 (darn la's liquor license!), so the closing time surprised me. i guess this is normal so they can accommodate people in the service industry in vegas\n\ncons:\n- seating... its a bit odd. since is small i would always call and ask to put your name down on the list. we got there at 830 and still had to wait even though we called ahead. when we left 1030 there was a huge wait! they have two large tables toward the back for larger groups, a number of smaller tables around the perimeter of the place, some bar seating for pairs, and then two large tables in the middle that are communal\n- parking lot: typical of most asian parking lots - theyre never big enough. dont forget to try driving around to the back\n- menu on the walls... while i am a big fan of the whole authentic look of a jap pub with \"new\" menu items on the wall... its an utter pain to have to crane your neck, and then squint (cursed with the typical asian trait of myopia) around the room to read items not listed on the menu... im horribly greedy.. i want to know all my options, not just the ones i can read. id highly suggest ichiza spend a few more dollars and write up a complete menu for guests!",

            "coming from san jose, we are blessed to have great izakaya/japanese tapas restaurants (gochi, tanto), so i was not expecting to be blown away by ichiza.  in actuality, i was pleasantly surprised at how good this little joint is.\n\nichiza is located on the second floor of an unassuming strip mall in vegas.  the interior is homey, with seating at a bar, communal tables and individual tables.  there are postings for a ton of different tapas you can order posted all over the walls; it will take a good few minutes to scan them all (and 99% of them sound delicious).\n\nwe ordered:\n\n-tuna tofu salad: very fresh lettuce and cherry tomatoes, avocado, raw tuna, tofu chunks, with a tangy dressing.  very light, refreshing and rich at the same time with the creaminess of the tuna, tofu and avocado.  \n\n-spinach salad (gomaae): mm, boiled, cold spinach with sesame sauce.  love this stuff.  typical serving size.\n\n-miso black cod: a must order.  delicious!  perfectly cooked, sweet, tender cod with a little tempura daikon on the side.  watch out, there was a bone when we bit into it.\n\n-jalapeno <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>: we were hesitant to order this but it turned out to be one of our favorite things.  the <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was so buttery but that's what made it so delicious.  who cares if it's artery clogging, your taste buds will jump for joy.  there's a big, charbroiled (or grilled?) jalapeno on top, giving it a nice smoky, spicy flavor.\n\n-uni mochi: meh, so-so.  the mochi was crispy on the outside but toooo mochi-ish (just super chewy and glutinous).  it reminded us of eating a marshmallow with the consistency of peanut butter (that feeling where you're chewing and chewing and chewing).  there was a spoonful of uni on top with some green onion garnish.\n\n-some sort of sake (raw salmon) wrapped something, sitting on a lemon slice: i can't remember exactly what it was, but it was very tasty :) i think it had scallop inside?  in any case, see my pic and drool.\n\n-red snapper carpaccio: raw red snapper wrapped around shredded daikon with a dollop of something and 3 ikura (raw salmon egg) on top with a (i think) ponzu sauce.  mmm!  refreshing, nice texture.\n\n-half order of ramen: half order size was perfect.  we couldn't even finish it all.  nice savory broth and chewy noodles.  i can't remember much else but i do remember that it was good, though i've had better ramen.\n\nhoney toast: oh em gee.  this is a f*cking cube of deliciousness.  mindblowingly good.  toasted asian bread, gutted out, with honey and butter on the inside, served with a giant scoop of vanilla ice cream, and drizzled with more honey.  who knew that such a simple concept could be so damn tasty?!  this was definitely the defining dish of the meal, and of the restaurant.  i've tried to make it at home and it wasn't the same.  i would come back just for the honey toast, and i would make love to it if i could, it was that good.\n\noverall, i can't recall it being too expensive, actually, if anything, i remember it being a good deal for the amount of food and quality.  the owner (or manager?), a tallish, japanese gentleman was even nice enough to help us call a cab when we were done with dinner as we had to rush to the airport.  \n\n4 stars for service and food.  would definitely recommend this place, though it is a bit out of the way from the strip.", 
            "a few doors down from crown bakery (http://www.yelp.com/biz/crown-bakery-las-vegas) is ichiza. creative, packed, and a vast menu selection help this izakaya stand out from many other japanese restaurants. different menu items are posted japanese style all over the dark walls. tons and tons of them. strips of paper with kanji and their english translations. it definitely has a great atmosphere. \n\nlet's start off by saying that reservations are a must. this place was loud and packed. additionally, from what i hear, it is always packed. the patrons are a eclectic hodgepodge of ethnic backgrounds. this is a place where the rules of \"see a bunch of japanese in a japanese restaurant, then it must be good\" is thrown out the window. it's because almost everything here is good, no matter who is eating it. i won't lie, it will help immensely to have someone who speaks japanese though. we went off menu for one dish. just a note that many of the dishes aren't just based in japan. we ordered a (off)menu kim chee <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> that was really good. one of those that you know you'll have \"issues\" later on, but you eat it anyway.\n\nso in addition to the <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, the aburage, karaage, tofu salad, and tonkatsu were all good as well. none of them stood out as mind blowing, but they held their own. the misoyaki butterfish with tempura hasu was really light and let's say, \"buttery\" (duh) and flaky for lack of a better word. i'm not a butterfish guy myself, but this was really good. add in the rarely served hasu and it was a winner. we also ordered the hamburger steak. for those of you that don't know, there are real differences in a hs from america and ones made like the ones in japan. this one was more japanese, with a spongy and fluffy texture, like if you added plenty of bread to the meat mix before making your patties. it's really really juicy and soft in texture. \n\nthe one misstep was my own \"bad.\" it was the tataki sashimi. this one was odd. it was different from all the tataki sashimi i have ever had. it was still on the skin and was chewy and difficult to separate from the other pieces. it was like it wasn't cut well enough to separate. it was also overly fishy. definite thumbs down on that one, but it's all about trying things out. right?\n\nthe final topper of the night was the honey vanilla toast. it is really good and is similar to shokudo (http://www.yelp.com/biz/shokudo-japanese-restaurant-and-bar-honolulu) in honolulu, but better. the toast is more crisp which to me makes all the difference between the two. add on the fact that they dump gobs of honey into the toast cavity and you've got a delightful dessert. although to fill up on toast at the end of a meal is a tall order. it's best if you have a large group to share.\n\nthe service is really good despite the fact that it's nuts inside with tons of patrons packed into a small restaurant and groups of people waiting outside. we were there late night as well.\n\nparking fills up fast during dinner, so i'd say make your reservations earlier if you can. again, reservations are highly recommended.", 
            "went here with a bunch of japanese/filopino friends who love the place.  i was weary being that the only japanese restaurants i usually patronize have cook top going on or sushi bars...but it was really really good :-) being \"safe\" i only ordered the pork potstickers and the chicken on a stick (sorry forget the name!).  they were both great, especially the potstickers.  i also tried a few bites from my friends dishes (a <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> i'd never seen before, some kind of pork dish, etc) which were also tasty.  for dessert, someone ordered the banana crepes which was delicious as well.  i need to go back and be more adventurous next time for sure!", 
            "it is difficult to explain in words what makes ichiza so special.  when you walk in the doors of the small, upstairs restaurant, you immediately feel a sense that this restaurant is special.  if you ask any chef or cook in las vegas where they would go if you gave them an unlimited feeding spree, they would undoubtedly pick ichiza.  sure, you may get a better \"value\" by going to one of the overpriced places on the strip, but no where else could you receive the variety, quality, and uniqueness other than ichiza.  \n\nthe menu is astronomically large.  in fact, most of the menu is posted on the walls around the restaurant.  i have been to ichiza well over 50 times, and i can honestly say i haven't tried most of the things on the menu itself, i get most of the dishes off the wall.  that's not to say i haven't had most of the things, because our table is usually filled with 10-15 different items at a time, and our palates are always interested in the new items ichiza puts up.\n\nbefore going to ichiza, there is something everyone should understand.  this is not a sushi restaurant.  yes, ichiza does have sushi.  they will make you basically anything you want.  but if you want to see 40 menu items that interchange random types of fish together in different ways that have no distinction from the other (much like most sushi restaurants), then this is not your place.  but, if you're looking for one of the best and most unique dining experiences you will ever have while trying new things, you should definitely go to ichiza.  ichiza is \"izakaya\" style japanese cuisine.  while it's hard to define izakaya, the easiest way to understand it is to think of japanese tapas.  small plates served in a family-style setting focusing on japanese cuisine is what ichiza is about.  \n\nif for some reason god (or whoever you believe in) came down and told you that you were not allowed to order more than one thing at ichiza, you should, hands-down, order the yellowtail sashimi.  for $11.95, you get 5 thick slices of the best yellowtail you will ever have served on fresh shiso leaf.  i'm not joking, this will be the best yellowtail you have ever had.  unless you are literally a fish monger in osaka, you will not find better yellowtail.  \nother items that are musts at ichiza:\n- salmon sashimi\n-pork wrapped in shiso leaf skewers\n-kimchi <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>\n-ikayaki: grilled squid served with ginger.  simple, yet amazing.  \n-beef tongue stew\n-boiled pork belly\n-<mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark>: giant bowl of ramen with pork belly and egg.  very tasty.  \n-rare organic pork steak: lightly breaded pork, slightly seared and topped with japanese eggplant.  \n- skewers of: garlic, shishito peppers, chicken, beef tongue, corn.  \n- dice cut beef steak: sauteed beef cubes with garlic and shallots.  \n- stir fried bacon potato: potatoes, bacon, corn, garlic, white wine, and stock sauteed together.  one of the least japanese influenced dishes on the menu.  \n- sake marinated salmon collar\n- miso-glazed black cod\n- beef tataki\n- honey toast:  you must get this!  freshly baked sweet bread loaf topped with honey, butter, and ice cream.  i have taken over 20 people to this place, all with different personalities, and every one of them loves it.  if you don't like this dish, you should probably go get your head checked out because something wrong is happening inside of your brain.  \n\nthe most expensive item on the menu is the toro sashimi for around $18.  other than the sashimi's, most of the items on the menu are between $2- $8.  the way to order is to start off ordering a lot of stuff, and eventually your table will be filled with lots of small plates.  it makes for a very social eating environment, and a very fun time.  oh ya, and did i mention that it's open til 3 am.  go here... right now. i mean it, now!", 
            "i just have to say, i love finding these little local places. and the fact that this is in vegas, where its all about glitz and glamour makes it that much better. upstairs in a strip mall. menu items written on sheets of paper on the wall. community tables....\n\nso we found this place by just asking a local walking on the street and they said we had to try it. after we were told it was going to be an hour wait (make a ressie if you can) i was able to talk our way into one of the corner community tables.\n\nthey menu is huge, so i just told the owner to bring out things that he thinks were really good...so he did... the 3 of us split...\n\n-jalapeno <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>- great flavor. right amount of oil and jalapenos. awesome kick\n-some sort of california roll topped with tempura carrots and a piece of eel (which i normally dont like) its was great!\n-shrimp steamed dumplings- probably one of the best i have ever had\n-some sort of tofu and tuna sashimi salad- sooooo good\n-cold buckwheat noodle salad- very good. tons of flavor. some sort of creamy ginger dressing\n-some sort of fried japanese spicy chicken nuggets. this was probably my least favorite dish.\n- honey toast. omg. you have to get the honey toast. delish!\n\nenjoy!",

            "went here with with a group of friends (including tiffany l.) while we were in las vegas for a trip. it was so good, like she mentioned, that we went here every night that we were there. \n\nwe didn't really order off the menu, we looked around for their specials and ordered off there. anyways, everything was so good. my personal favorites were the miso ramen, wagyu beef carpaccio, their uni, salmon <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, and the list goes on!",

            "if you can get a table this is a great place to come with a small group of friends and try a variety of small japanese dishes.  service once you get seated is great and the dishes come out as they are made.  somethings to keep in mind though: 1. it is a small restaurant and gets packed on the weekends.  i highly recommend making reservations before coming here.  2.  the parking in this area is also terrible.  if you get lucky and get a spot, go you!  more likely though you'll have to park a plaza over and walk over.\n\nthere are so many dishes here are a couple of my must tries:\n\ncrab <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> - it is worth the splurge for the crab meat.  you will be able to see the chunks of meat and the flavor comes out beautifully.\n\nbutterfish - yes, this is one of the more expensive dishes and you may be sad at the size of the fish, but the taste is amazing.  it is worth every penny!!  \n\nskewers - for the more adventurous eaters this is always fun to introduce to new visitors of ichiza.  they do have usual beef and chicken skewers, but my favorites are the chicken gizzard, tongue, and liver skewers.  the out of the box skewers are my go to\n\nalso always remember to check out the specials!  my most memorable special i have had was flying fish sashimi and it was delicious and had an amazing presentation.  i've never gone wrong off the special menu, but it is always changing\n\nthis is definitely a fun restaurant to try :)"

            "this is by far one of my most favorite restaurants in las vegas.  ever since discovering this place about 3-4 years ago, i have always been coming back.  this isn't your high end japanese restaurant.   the decor is simple, the prices are very reasonable, the food is extensive and excellent, and the place is great place to be merry.  right when you walk in you are greeted in japanese and when you leave your thanked in japanese.  the workers there all seem to be young students.  \nthere are so many dishes to choose from.  the only thing i can do is tell you about what i always order: 1) menu items:  kushi-katsu - crunchy breaded pork w/lemony teriyaki dip; ika yaki - broiled squid;  ichiza <mark>Ichiza's <mark>Half Ramen Noodles</mark></mark> - yummy; <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>; beef tataki - rare beef slice to dip in a ponzu-dailkon radish mixture (sublime); kim chee <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>; and a sashimi plate w/ tuna, albacore, mackerel, yellow tail, salmon, octopus, and squid. 2) non-menu items (sheets of paper that have daily/common specials are posted over the walls)  monk fish liver, fried smelt (my most favorite b/c the eggs are cooked in the belly), and beef cubes in ponzu sauce.  yeah, there are a lot of dishes that i like, but im so impressed that ichiza's has not disappointed me for the many times i've been there.  they have large group seating areas, which i've enjoyed many times with friends and family eating and drinking up cold sake, sake bombs, and japanese beer.  i really recommend their house cold sake, so much better and smoother than drinking it warm.  i've been there a many nights till closing leaving with my belly full and ridiculously buzzed from all the sake we drank.   i always have to put this on the itinerary of any of my visiting friends and family that come to las vegas.  that's how much i love and trust this place.  anybody who knows me, can back me up for whatever say about this restaurant b/c most likely i've taken them there....\nadditional note...don't think that this restaurant is one of those upscale dress up places b/c of the amount of stars i gave it.  it gets five stars b/c all around it's hella awesome!!!", 
            "itadakimasu! it's exactly how you feel when you walk into this quaint little place above tea planet. yes....you would never know it was here except for the sounds of fun and mmm mmm smells of japanese goodness. ichiza is definitely a jewel  hidden in vegas. there's nothing more authentic than ichiza. i just like saying it...ichiza ichiza ichiza.\ni have taken and introduced people to this place and they have all agreed how fun it is. not your typical, \"yea dude let me get a california roll\" or your run of the mill chicken teriyaki. that's not japanese. we're looking at mmm mmm broiled squid, and katsu, real <mark>Ichiza's <mark>Half Ramen Noodles</mark></mark> - mmmm tampopo! kirin ichiban on draft! i love the veggie tempura bowls where there's just a nest of veggies over rice with real teriyaki sauce. how can you go wrong? yea! you won't find your typical teppanyaki chef there making onion volcanos.  sure there's things here that white people may cringe upon like the gizzard skewers...or even beef tongue....sweet fried garlic with natto(a fermented soybean).....the service is a little slow. i figure it's because the place is usually really busy. i like having a place to go to in the middle of the night that can make me feel all warm and fuzzy....and that's not from the kirin.  if you have enough room. you gotta try the honey toast. it takes some time so order it when you're halfway finished. it's japanese toast (like half a loaf of bread) partially hollowed out with butter....honey....and vanilla ice cream. simple, delicious....and to the point. \ni definitely enjoy the ramen, jalepeno <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> - yakitori - and the grilled squid...oooo and grilled makerel, black cod in miso....so much to choose from!\nthis place can fit anyone's budget. the ambiance is traditional japanese, with pictures and specials on the walls, there's a group area that you can sit, but you gotta take your shoes off. the bar is great because you can watch them cook in the kitchen. overall - a must go place.\n\nif you're a regular here - get your ichiza stamp card for a discount.", 
            "thank goodness for yelp. i wouldn't have discovered this restaurant without all the good reviews about it. \n\ni love tastings of different  dishes when i dine out. ichiza has quality tapas size dishes at very reasonable prices. for those reasons, this is now my favorite japanese restaurant. \n\nthe bf and i shared:\n\nuni w/ponzu\ngrilled squid \nyellowtail, salmon, mackerel, tuna, albacore sashimi combo\ngrilled smelt roe - fellow yelpers influence :) \nfried oyster - i was craving the fresh oysters, but they were out :(\nshrimp <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> \nbeef tataki\nbeer  \ncalpico shu\n=========\n$70\n\nthe sashimi and uni were very fresh. after reading some of the reviews, i had to try the smelt roe.  i didn't know how to eat the smelt roe, but shared the dish with another patron at the bar and watched him eat it first. it was tasty. all the dishes we ordered were yummy! i will definitely come back here on each vegas trip.", 
            "went and ate at ichiza last night based off of all the reviews i have read on yelp. and i have to say that i loved it. had a short wait when we arrived, but i think you get that at all good places, and we were seated in less then 10 minutes. the menu items written all over the walls were fun to read and interpret, but i wonder if i missed out on anything good because i didnt see it written somewhere. :) and some of them were written only in japanese, so i wondered what they were. next time i am going to order all the items i cant read, and just be surprised when thing show up.  \"i'll take that, and that, and that...\" \nwe ordered the deep fried baby soft shell crabs, marinated minced spanish mackerel, kimchi <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, tartar yellowtail, wasabi green bean tempura, and the mapo-tofu (all for only $44, including 2 large sapporos).  everthing was great. the yellowtail was recommended by several people on yelp, and i agree with them. it was great. a little messy, but i didnt mind that. the baby soft shell crabs kind of caught me by surprise, because they werent kidding about \"baby\" these little things looked like they had just been born, and hadnt had time to grow a shell yet...but they were very tasty. i liked the marinated spanish mackerel, served on top of a cucumber wedge, and the kimchi <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was very good too. the beer prices were great too. $5.50 for a large sapporo, i have paid alot more than that at other places. \nthe staff was all very friendly, and helpful, and i think everyone who worked there said good bye, and see you next time, as we were leaving. i will diffinately be going back. in fact, i cant wait too.\n\nupdate: went here again saturday evening and it was even better the second time. i'm upgrading ichiza to 5 stars.", 
            "i have been to ichiza twice and i have had great experiences both times. both times i have been there, there was a short wait.  i have been seated at both a table and at the bar.  service was good, and everyone was friendly. the first time i went i was with an ichiza veteran who knew exactly what to order, so i had a whole mess of stuff, and can't really remember what any of it was, could have been the fact her expertise included mass quantities of sake. i remembered the kimchi <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and mapo-tofu and ordered those again on my second visit.  the next time i went we were a little more daring and did most of our ordering off the walls. once again everything was yummy.  i was not a huge fan of the minced spanish mackerel, but it was okay.  the tartar yellowtail was delicious, but a bit of a challenge to eat. when i lost about half of it down my shirt, it was good for a laugh. :) the prices are very reasonable, and i left full and happy.\n\nsince my first review, i have been back many times, and i have always had a great experience.  tonight the folks at ichiza went above and beyond!!  there was a bit of a wait, so we went downstairs to tea planet, and we didn't have enough time to finish our drinks.  we went in ichiza half expecting them to tell us no outside drinks, which they did...however, they offered to put our drinks in the refrigerator for us so they wouldn't go to waste! just another reason to love ichiza, and in case you need another...two words...honey toast. yum!", 
            "this place was what started my ramen craze!  their udon dish and <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was so delicous, actually everything is!  not only that, this is the only sushi spot that i know of... opening until 2a.m. and the food is authentic japanese cuisine, since the staff is literally only japanese.  the tables maybe small and everything, and the size of the restaurant isn't all that big... but the service is great.   \n\nif we had a restuarant that was similar to this place in the area, i think it would be banking in hella money and on top of that, its not very often that you go to a restuarant and order ramen noodle.\n\n*still thinking about*..... gawd..... i'm hungry for ramen.", 
            "a local spot that no one should miss.  it's a relaxed atmosphere where people want the feeling of being in japan while eating the food.  i've been here so many times already and i'm always amazed and in awe with their food, service, and overall atmosphere.  the experience is also one i've never had.  i don't know what authentic japanese food really means but i would assume ichiza gives that full meaning.\n\njust like any other japanese restaurants, when i walk in i'm greeted loudly by all the employees in their language.  the past two times this week i've been i was with my cousins and this was the night to devirginize christine with sake.  muahahahahahaha!!!!  we were seated at the bar to watch the careful preparation of each food that was ordered by all customers.  it's a small and cute little restaurant that may sometimes have a wait because of seating capacity.  \n\nthe menu is either in a form of a book or hanging from the ceiling in the bar area with pictures so you can see what the food looks like before ordering it.  i have found this very useful.  also, you can just ask one of the servers what they would recommend and always will they give you a straight up answer.  they know their shit!  what's good?  okay, you can order their shrimp <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, garlic <mark>Boiled Cold Bok Choy</mark>, oysters (mmm... their oysters here are bomb!), sushi is also good, kimchi pork (this is something you have to order too), shrimp tempura, sake (large bottle), and there's just so much to choose from.  the only item i wasn't very hot for was the fried udon.  i can't put my finger on it but i know i wouldn't order it again.  although i've been informed it's a popular item amongst majority of the customers.  by the end of it all, i was very full and satisfied as we ordered just the exact amount for everyone.\n\nnow, the moment of truth.  it was time to sink the shot in christine's mouth.  we were like little school girls pouring the shots.  christine took the shot and didn't like it but got used to it after a while drinking.  i think this is where i'm gonna take my god sister when she comes to visit me.  i'm excited.", 
            "once again, thank you yelp for helping me find another great restaurant to satisfy my hungry tummy... my boyfriend's parents live in vegas, so we come here a couple of times a year.  for the past year, i've been wanting to try this place out, and finally got around to it tonight.  i really liked how the restaurant was set up - small, simple, and traditional looking - they're not trying to look super nice, rather than giving off a more comfortable eating atmosphere.\n\nthe inside of ichiza consists of around 10 tables, and then there's a tatami (i don't know if there's a spelling for it) section with 2 long tables, where you take your shoes off and sit on the ground.  then besides that, there's the kitchen area.\n\nthe service here is ok, not great but not bad.  it is what it is.  however, the food is really good.  like richard l. said, it's like tapas, but japanese style.  i guess this type of cuisine is called \"izakaya\" as i have learned after reading all of these reviews.  living in the bay area, i actually have yet to find a place with this type of cuisine - everyone in the bay is really hung up on sushi (hey, which i love, dont get me wrong). \n\nanyhow, my boyfriend and i came here tonight and we ordered an order of their udon, chicken skewers, agedashi tofu, kimchi <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, and spicy tuna roll.  the udon was really tasty and they added some seaweed, egg, and veggies to it.  i didn't try the chicken skewers, but they looked like teryaki chicken pieces on a stick, and my boyfriend liked them a lot.  the agedashi tofu, which is one of my favorite appetizers, came with a generous portion of fruit, and 4 huge slices of tofu.  the tofu was very fresh and soft, and the dish was very good.  spicy tuna roll was pretty good, but not amazing.  lastly, i loved their kimchi <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.. ichiza's <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> definitely kicks some @ss... it was sooooo tasty and with the kimchi, it was the perfect amount of spicyness.\n\noverall, 4 stars for above average food and very low prices.  (all of those dishes only came out to about $22.)  definitely a lot lower than the prices we're used to.  all of the smaller dishes run from $3-$5, and larger dishes run from $6-$9.. none of it is expensive.  if i lived in the area, i would definitely come back.\n\nand, they're open till 3am!", 
            "ichiza is where tourists come to die. and by that, i mean i wish the tourists here would die. something about being white, middle aged, and vacationing in vegas brings out the worst in people. add sake and gen-u-wine japanese food, and you get fourty-somethings licking food off of each other's bodies (and then applauding each other's courage for doing something so indecent in public) while opting to forgo the wearing of footwear (and not as a display of respect, but as a display of drunken negligence- who walks around in a parking lot without shoes @ 2am?) while the menu at ichiza is dynamic, drunken tourists are always on the menu. yes: kirin on tap, seared salmon belly, miso butterfish, kimchi <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, seared bonito, sashimi, rolled sushi, braised pork belly, mixed mushrooms, honey toast.  no: hamachi collar (salty and dry), skewers (blach- greasy), octopus and cucumber (not so fresh), anything with egg in it.", 
            "definitely my favorite of las vegas. i was bummed they ran out of the honey toast, cuz i heard so much about it from fellow yelpers. so don't go so late like i did (12am).  i had the best beef ever!!! even better than korean bbq...wait, nothing can beat korean bbq. anyhoo, it's called \"beef tataki.\" for like $6, it's a tiny dish with several slices of this deliciously flavored meat. i would rather have several dishes of this stuff than some plain boring american steak. another fantastic dish: \"crab <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.\" around $7, and it's a perfect size for one person. i think it's fake crab meat, but it's the best <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> ever! they used some magical oils for sure. not oily, just incredibly flavorful! this place uses fresh ingredients and makes every dish soooo intense with flavor, but still healthy!! i had the red snapper carpaccio as well,very fresh thinly sliced fish with some eggs and some veggies, but it felt too light like salad without much dressing. but seriously, i will come back to try everything :) i trust their taste. and the japanese girls that work there are so cute and sweet. the manager is also very personable.", 
            "an off the strip hole in the wall that was very satisfying...\n\nduring my best friend's bachelorette party weekend in vegas, a fellow bridesmaid (who uses yelp religiously for good eat recommendations as well) suggested to dine here. luckily we had a minivan that could pack in 9 girls and take a 10-15 minute drive away from the strip.\n\nichiza is located on the second floor of an asian strip mall. in comparison to the other vegas restaurants on the strip, this was definitely no fancy place (a bit of a hole in the wall) but definitely had character. since we arrived early for dinner we got to eat in one of the two group tables in the back where you take your shoes off.\n\ni can honestly say i've never been to a japanese restaurant like this before....when we looked at the menu we were all a little taken back (i guess i'm a bit sheltered when it comes to authetic japanese food).....what no bento boxes? no large sushi menu?.....then what do they serve? this place was everything but ordinary....on the walls they posted signs with the various small dishes that ranged from $2 to $6 and various things on the menu i've never heard off. each lady ordered 2-4 mini appetizers or dishes and we all just shared everything. it was super fun getting to sample alot of things in one siting. we kind of played it safe because alot of the choices sounded a bit scary. from what i remember we grubbed on:\n\n-japanese style crab <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> (yumm)\n-kimchi with pork (this was one of my favorites)\n-grilled mackarel\n-grilled bacon wrapped mochi (sounded so weird we had to try it)\n-sweet grilled corn\n-deep fried chow mein (kinda like pan fried noodles)\n-fried calamari\n-mini fried chicken pieces\n-a couple sushi speciality rolls (unagi & scallop) of the few choices they had\n-and can't forget about the famous honey toast (sweet bread ala mode)!!!!....note: it does takes about 15 minutes to cook and we ordered 3 seperate ones so that there was 3 people to each honey toast. this dessert really topped off the meal and is probably what pushed this to a 4 star review! \n\nthe waitresses were overall friendly but kind of hard to understand since i think they were more fleunt in japanese than english. by the time we left the place, which was about 8:30pm on a saturday night this small place was packed with several costumers waiting outside...so again it was comforting to know that it can be a popular place during peak dining times.\n\nalthough we were skeptical when we first walked in, this ended up being a memorable dinner with the ladies for $25 a person (which inlcuding us treating the bride to be). so if you are tired of the vegas buffets, want something more authentic, wanna try something new, and have a car (as i don't thinnk it's necessarily worth a cab ride from the strip), i'd definitely recommend giving this place a shot if you wanna dine with all the locals.\n\nthis unique japanese-style tapas place hit the spot!!!", 
            "we ordered a few things items but i especially enjoyed a sushi with unagi on a fried tempura thing on top of sushi, pork tataki, and the kimchi <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. \n\nthe honey toast was made up of really simple ingredients... honey, hawaiian bread, butter, and vanilla ice cream..... but it was a really satisfying treat at the end of our meal.", 
            "another late night in vegas and hunger calls... straight to yelp for recommendations! ichiza is located in the chinatown/spring mountain road area in vegas, just a short 10 minute drive from the strip, and imo better food. we got here around midnight saturday night with a grumbling tummy. the place was crowded and lively. we ordered: \n\ntofu salad w/ tuna sashimi - standard, not bad\ntsukune & kushi tan - decent\nsteamed pork dumplings - actually siomai but very good. juicy and flavorful\ndeep fried garlic - first time seeing this, served with miso paste, very yummy.\ncrab <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> - decent\nagadashi tofu - decent\n\ni would definitely come back next time we're in vegas... good food, lively atmosphere and good value.", 
            "i don't know why this place has such a high rating.  i thought the food was okay.  and the price was pretty reasonable.  i'm guessing in the late night after drinking and partying this is a great place to go.  otherwise, i would recommend some of the other places in vegas that the yelpers recommend.\n\nwe ordered the agadeshi tofu, jalapeno <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, chicken gizzards, braised pork belly, and a roll recommended by the waitress.  everything was decently cooked but some of it was too greasy and the food tasted rushed.  there were a lot of people in the restaurant and waiting outside.\n\nfinally we got the honey toast.  really.... i don't understand the hype.  it's a cube of bread toasted with vanilla ice cream and honey poured on the top.  really, that's it.\n\nif you want to try something a little quirky and raku is closed (where we initially wanted to go) i would say okay.  but this place isn't really that special and there are so many places to go for food in vegas.", 
            "once again yelp to the rescue... we went to a 9pm show without eating dinner, by the time it was over we were ravenous but didn't want 'casino' food. so we decided on japanese food, i did a quick search on the mobile device and entered late night dining. this was the third place to pop up. to our surprise this place is open until 3am on a sunday!?! wow. the reviews were great so we drove over to lv's chinatown area and boy were we glad! this place is in a strip mall on the second floor, its looks like a mom and pop type place. the restaurant mainly had japanese clients, another good sign, if natives eat there then you know its good. anyway we were promptly seated in one of the last spots, it was almost 11pm and it was bustling in there. the menu is rather perplexing, we were overwhelmed and were not sure what to order when she asked for drinks and appetizers. i would characterize this place as japanese 'tapas'. we proceeded to order a bunch of little plates. we started with basics like <mark>Miso Soup</mark> and house salad, the dressing was to die for and a rather huge salad nicely presented with all the fixings. we tried their house special roll, very unique in presentation, think california roll with tempura onions and eel on top, f-ing fantastic! we also had a spicy tuna roll and an order of their marinated fried chicken and shrimp <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. again remember these are small plates but plates of yummy flavorful food. the shrimp <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was awesome, think benihana but better, not greasy and large shrimp properly de-veined! i was in love and i told my husband so. he was in love with the spicy tuna roll himself, i believe the sushi chef also noticed because they gave us an additional one on the house. the prices here are reasonable too. i would definitely return because there were many many more items left to try on the menu.",

(think of the deep fried head of the sweet shrimp sushi, but bite sized!) the real shrimp chip!\n- whole grilled squid: perfectly grilled. so flavorful!\n- broiled fish... sorry i totally forget the name, but its the broiled fish filled with roe. also very tasty\n- beef tataki: very very tasty! super fresh and flavorful. the beef was amazingly tender\n- yakitori of beef tongue: not the most tender ive had, but still pretty good\n- bacon wrapped potato (skewered): perfect hot fluffy potato, wrapped in crispy bacon... whats not to love??\n- crab <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>: yummy\n\nthis was probably the perfect amount of food for two girls.. hahaha jk, this was an enormous amount of food, but ate everything over the course of two hours in combination with four large sapporos. ... we spent almost $100 including a nice tip, so... not cheap, but we did eat and drink quite a bit.\n\npros:\n- food! if you like japanese food, or are interested in trying something other than the typical sushi, try this place! definitely try to sit at the bar! you can ogle all the food that leaves the kitchen!\n- service: all the servers were super friendly and cute and attentive... but i think you need to be a bit assertive with the guy at the host stand (i think he was the owner?) so that you can get seated promptly. its not that he was unfriendly, just a bit scattered trying to handle so many different things at once.\n- decor: cute jap pub feel. homey, not fancy or stuffy, but like your neighborhood place that you go right after work... bathroom was not the cleanest, but the typical pub/bar restroom.\n- hours: im not used to restaurants being open after 2 (darn la's liquor license!), so the closing time surprised me. i guess this is normal so they can accommodate people in the service industry in vegas\n\ncons:\n- seating... its a bit odd. since is small i would always call and ask to put your name down on the list. we got there at 830 and still had to wait even though we called ahead. when we left 1030 there was a huge wait! they have two large tables toward the back for larger groups, a number of smaller tables around the perimeter of the place, some bar seating for pairs, and then two large tables in the middle that are communal\n- parking lot: typical of most asian parking lots - theyre never big enough. dont forget to try driving around to the back\n- menu on the walls... while i am a big fan of the whole authentic look of a jap pub with \"new\" menu items on the wall... its an utter pain to have to crane your neck, and then squint (cursed with the typical asian trait of myopia) around the room to read items not listed on the menu... im horribly greedy.. i want to know all my options, not just the ones i can read. id highly suggest ichiza spend a few more dollars and write up a complete menu for guests!",

            "coming from san jose, we are blessed to have great izakaya/japanese tapas restaurants (gochi, tanto), so i was not expecting to be blown away by ichiza.  in actuality, i was pleasantly surprised at how good this little joint is.\n\nichiza is located on the second floor of an unassuming strip mall in vegas.  the interior is homey, with seating at a bar, communal tables and individual tables.  there are postings for a ton of different tapas you can order posted all over the walls; it will take a good few minutes to scan them all (and 99% of them sound delicious).\n\nwe ordered:\n\n-tuna tofu salad: very fresh lettuce and cherry tomatoes, avocado, raw tuna, tofu chunks, with a tangy dressing.  very light, refreshing and rich at the same time with the creaminess of the tuna, tofu and avocado.  \n\n-spinach salad (gomaae): mm, boiled, cold spinach with sesame sauce.  love this stuff.  typical serving size.\n\n-miso black cod: a must order.  delicious!  perfectly cooked, sweet, tender cod with a little tempura daikon on the side.  watch out, there was a bone when we bit into it.\n\n-jalapeno <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>: we were hesitant to order this but it turned out to be one of our favorite things.  the <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was so buttery but that's what made it so delicious.  who cares if it's artery clogging, your taste buds will jump for joy.  there's a big, charbroiled (or grilled?) jalapeno on top, giving it a nice smoky, spicy flavor.\n\n-uni mochi: meh, so-so.  the mochi was crispy on the outside but toooo mochi-ish (just super chewy and glutinous).  it reminded us of eating a marshmallow with the consistency of peanut butter (that feeling where you're chewing and chewing and chewing).  there was a spoonful of uni on top with some green onion garnish.\n\n-some sort of sake (raw salmon) wrapped something, sitting on a lemon slice: i can't remember exactly what it was, but it was very tasty :) i think it had scallop inside?  in any case, see my pic and drool.\n\n-red snapper carpaccio: raw red snapper wrapped around shredded daikon with a dollop of something and 3 ikura (raw salmon egg) on top with a (i think) ponzu sauce.  mmm!  refreshing, nice texture.\n\n-half order of ramen: half order size was perfect.  we couldn't even finish it all.  nice savory broth and chewy noodles.  i can't remember much else but i do remember that it was good, though i've had better ramen.\n\nhoney toast: oh em gee.  this is a f*cking cube of deliciousness.  mindblowingly good.  toasted asian bread, gutted out, with honey and butter on the inside, served with a giant scoop of vanilla ice cream, and drizzled with more honey.  who knew that such a simple concept could be so damn tasty?!  this was definitely the defining dish of the meal, and of the restaurant.  i've tried to make it at home and it wasn't the same.  i would come back just for the honey toast, and i would make love to it if i could, it was that good.\n\noverall, i can't recall it being too expensive, actually, if anything, i remember it being a good deal for the amount of food and quality.  the owner (or manager?), a tallish, japanese gentleman was even nice enough to help us call a cab when we were done with dinner as we had to rush to the airport.  \n\n4 stars for service and food.  would definitely recommend this place, though it is a bit out of the way from the strip.", 
            "a few doors down from crown bakery (http://www.yelp.com/biz/crown-bakery-las-vegas) is ichiza. creative, packed, and a vast menu selection help this izakaya stand out from many other japanese restaurants. different menu items are posted japanese style all over the dark walls. tons and tons of them. strips of paper with kanji and their english translations. it definitely has a great atmosphere. \n\nlet's start off by saying that reservations are a must. this place was loud and packed. additionally, from what i hear, it is always packed. the patrons are a eclectic hodgepodge of ethnic backgrounds. this is a place where the rules of \"see a bunch of japanese in a japanese restaurant, then it must be good\" is thrown out the window. it's because almost everything here is good, no matter who is eating it. i won't lie, it will help immensely to have someone who speaks japanese though. we went off menu for one dish. just a note that many of the dishes aren't just based in japan. we ordered a (off)menu kim chee <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> that was really good. one of those that you know you'll have \"issues\" later on, but you eat it anyway.\n\nso in addition to the <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, the aburage, karaage, tofu salad, and tonkatsu were all good as well. none of them stood out as mind blowing, but they held their own. the misoyaki butterfish with tempura hasu was really light and let's say, \"buttery\" (duh) and flaky for lack of a better word. i'm not a butterfish guy myself, but this was really good. add in the rarely served hasu and it was a winner. we also ordered the hamburger steak. for those of you that don't know, there are real differences in a hs from america and ones made like the ones in japan. this one was more japanese, with a spongy and fluffy texture, like if you added plenty of bread to the meat mix before making your patties. it's really really juicy and soft in texture. \n\nthe one misstep was my own \"bad.\" it was the tataki sashimi. this one was odd. it was different from all the tataki sashimi i have ever had. it was still on the skin and was chewy and difficult to separate from the other pieces. it was like it wasn't cut well enough to separate. it was also overly fishy. definite thumbs down on that one, but it's all about trying things out. right?\n\nthe final topper of the night was the honey vanilla toast. it is really good and is similar to shokudo (http://www.yelp.com/biz/shokudo-japanese-restaurant-and-bar-honolulu) in honolulu, but better. the toast is more crisp which to me makes all the difference between the two. add on the fact that they dump gobs of honey into the toast cavity and you've got a delightful dessert. although to fill up on toast at the end of a meal is a tall order. it's best if you have a large group to share.\n\nthe service is really good despite the fact that it's nuts inside with tons of patrons packed into a small restaurant and groups of people waiting outside. we were there late night as well.\n\nparking fills up fast during dinner, so i'd say make your reservations earlier if you can. again, reservations are highly recommended.", 
            "went here with a bunch of japanese/filopino friends who love the place.  i was weary being that the only japanese restaurants i usually patronize have cook top going on or sushi bars...but it was really really good :-) being \"safe\" i only ordered the pork potstickers and the chicken on a stick (sorry forget the name!).  they were both great, especially the potstickers.  i also tried a few bites from my friends dishes (a <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> i'd never seen before, some kind of pork dish, etc) which were also tasty.  for dessert, someone ordered the banana crepes which was delicious as well.  i need to go back and be more adventurous next time for sure!", 
            "it is difficult to explain in words what makes ichiza so special.  when you walk in the doors of the small, upstairs restaurant, you immediately feel a sense that this restaurant is special.  if you ask any chef or cook in las vegas where they would go if you gave them an unlimited feeding spree, they would undoubtedly pick ichiza.  sure, you may get a better \"value\" by going to one of the overpriced places on the strip, but no where else could you receive the variety, quality, and uniqueness other than ichiza.  \n\nthe menu is astronomically large.  in fact, most of the menu is posted on the walls around the restaurant.  i have been to ichiza well over 50 times, and i can honestly say i haven't tried most of the things on the menu itself, i get most of the dishes off the wall.  that's not to say i haven't had most of the things, because our table is usually filled with 10-15 different items at a time, and our palates are always interested in the new items ichiza puts up.\n\nbefore going to ichiza, there is something everyone should understand.  this is not a sushi restaurant.  yes, ichiza does have sushi.  they will make you basically anything you want.  but if you want to see 40 menu items that interchange random types of fish together in different ways that have no distinction from the other (much like most sushi restaurants), then this is not your place.  but, if you're looking for one of the best and most unique dining experiences you will ever have while trying new things, you should definitely go to ichiza.  ichiza is \"izakaya\" style japanese cuisine.  while it's hard to define izakaya, the easiest way to understand it is to think of japanese tapas.  small plates served in a family-style setting focusing on japanese cuisine is what ichiza is about.  \n\nif for some reason god (or whoever you believe in) came down and told you that you were not allowed to order more than one thing at ichiza, you should, hands-down, order the yellowtail sashimi.  for $11.95, you get 5 thick slices of the best yellowtail you will ever have served on fresh shiso leaf.  i'm not joking, this will be the best yellowtail you have ever had.  unless you are literally a fish monger in osaka, you will not find better yellowtail.  \nother items that are musts at ichiza:\n- salmon sashimi\n-pork wrapped in shiso leaf skewers\n-kimchi <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>\n-ikayaki: grilled squid served with ginger.  simple, yet amazing.  \n-beef tongue stew\n-boiled pork belly\n-<mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark>: giant bowl of ramen with pork belly and egg.  very tasty.  \n-rare organic pork steak: lightly breaded pork, slightly seared and topped with japanese eggplant.  \n- skewers of: garlic, shishito peppers, chicken, beef tongue, corn.  \n- dice cut beef steak: sauteed beef cubes with garlic and shallots.  \n- stir fried bacon potato: potatoes, bacon, corn, garlic, white wine, and stock sauteed together.  one of the least japanese influenced dishes on the menu.  \n- sake marinated salmon collar\n- miso-glazed black cod\n- beef tataki\n- honey toast:  you must get this!  freshly baked sweet bread loaf topped with honey, butter, and ice cream.  i have taken over 20 people to this place, all with different personalities, and every one of them loves it.  if you don't like this dish, you should probably go get your head checked out because something wrong is happening inside of your brain.  \n\nthe most expensive item on the menu is the toro sashimi for around $18.  other than the sashimi's, most of the items on the menu are between $2- $8.  the way to order is to start off ordering a lot of stuff, and eventually your table will be filled with lots of small plates.  it makes for a very social eating environment, and a very fun time.  oh ya, and did i mention that it's open til 3 am.  go here... right now. i mean it, now!", 
            "i just have to say, i love finding these little local places. and the fact that this is in vegas, where its all about glitz and glamour makes it that much better. upstairs in a strip mall. menu items written on sheets of paper on the wall. community tables....\n\nso we found this place by just asking a local walking on the street and they said we had to try it. after we were told it was going to be an hour wait (make a ressie if you can) i was able to talk our way into one of the corner community tables.\n\nthey menu is huge, so i just told the owner to bring out things that he thinks were really good...so he did... the 3 of us split...\n\n-jalapeno <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>- great flavor. right amount of oil and jalapenos. awesome kick\n-some sort of california roll topped with tempura carrots and a piece of eel (which i normally dont like) its was great!\n-shrimp steamed dumplings- probably one of the best i have ever had\n-some sort of tofu and tuna sashimi salad- sooooo good\n-cold buckwheat noodle salad- very good. tons of flavor. some sort of creamy ginger dressing\n-some sort of fried japanese spicy chicken nuggets. this was probably my least favorite dish.\n- honey toast. omg. you have to get the honey toast. delish!\n\nenjoy!",

            "been in this plaza and ate at two other restaurants there, i'm surprised it took me this long to find ichiza! the food here is sooo delicious. \n\nit was a little annoying to find consistent information about when they are open, their website (on the home page and the contact page) and yelp have different times listed. their door says 5pm-2:30am with the last call at 2:30am. i guess this means they don't have happy hour anymore?\n\ni went with one other person, we sat at the bar. it's an open kitchen, so we can see what the chefs are doing the whole time. \n\nwe ordered and shared:\nbeef tongue skewers\nchicken yakitori skewers\ncrab meat <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>\nyellowtail tartar\ntuna tartar\nsalmon sashimi\nbeef tataki\n\neverything came out perfect. the tartar was so yummy, we had to order both the tuna and the yellowtail. the salmon sashimi was the best i've had thus far, it was so buttery and fresh. our bill came out around ~$70 because we ordered two large beers, but it was definitely worth it for the quality. i'm probably going to come back here every time i'm in vegas now.\n\nit's located in a small plaza with limited parking during dinner time.", 
            "this place is the best. good food. jalape\\u00f1o <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> is to die for...highly recommend!", 
            "great good and awesome service. \nmy boyfriend and i came here on a sunday around 9:30pm and waited five minutes for a table. we ordered ichiza ramen, shrimp tempura bowl, crab <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, and cod (miso butterfish). the crab rice and cod was absolutely delicious. i'd definitely come back and recommend this place to anyone. :-)", 
            "great izakaya!  it's definitely a place that you go to have drinks and eat small tapa style dishes.\ni love tako wasabi and they have it here.  everything is made really well so you won't be disappointed with anything that you order.  kids can eat here too because they do have ramen and udon as well as <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> dishes.  the honey toast was good,  but nothing too spectacular.  i would go back for the savory dishes before i go for honey toast.  the service was efficient and prompt.  waitress gave good suggestions.  not far from the strip.  worth the trip.", 
            "the shrimp and maki roll\ncrab <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was good\nblue fin tuna was fresh\nquesadilla was okay", 
            "great food : marinate chicken and crab <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>\n\nnot worth it : assorted sashimi \n\n\ncheap and affordable japanese food if u are tired of a regular sushi place.", 
            "i'm shocked i have not written a review for one of my favorite restaurant. this is my go to place for late night food, or catching up with friends. i love the sushi bar and the sitting down japanese area in the back of the restaurant.\n\ni've always had great service even at its busiest times. my favorite drink is the grape fruit sochu! it's so cool juicing your own fruit and pouring it's remnants into this sour nasty rubbing alcohol thing.\n\ntheir food is so amazing. i love the wasabi green beans, crab <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, ramen, sushi, and so many other dishes. their specials are posted all over the restaurant on index cards so it's fun walking around seeing if they have anything new or weird to try. their prices are always super reasonable, and their food quality is superb. confused why they were closed last year like 4 times by the health department.... cause i mean i've been fine and i eat here all the time lol! i love you ichiza!", 
            "if you can get a table this is a great place to come with a small group of friends and try a variety of small japanese dishes.  service once you get seated is great and the dishes come out as they are made.  somethings to keep in mind though: 1. it is a small restaurant and gets packed on the weekends.  i highly recommend making reservations before coming here.  2.  the parking in this area is also terrible.  if you get lucky and get a spot, go you!  more likely though you'll have to park a plaza over and walk over.\n\nthere are so many dishes here are a couple of my must tries:\n\ncrab <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> - it is worth the splurge for the crab meat.  you will be able to see the chunks of meat and the flavor comes out beautifully.\n\nbutterfish - yes, this is one of the more expensive dishes and you may be sad at the size of the fish, but the taste is amazing.  it is worth every penny!!  \n\nskewers - for the more adventurous eaters this is always fun to introduce to new visitors of ichiza.  they do have usual beef and chicken skewers, but my favorites are the chicken gizzard, tongue, and liver skewers.  the out of the box skewers are my go to\n\nalso always remember to check out the specials!  my most memorable special i have had was flying fish sashimi and it was delicious and had an amazing presentation.  i've never gone wrong off the special menu, but it is always changing\n\nthis is definitely a fun restaurant to try :)"

            "this is by far one of my most favorite restaurants in las vegas.  ever since discovering this place about 3-4 years ago, i have always been coming back.  this isn't your high end japanese restaurant.   the decor is simple, the prices are very reasonable, the food is extensive and excellent, and the place is great place to be merry.  right when you walk in you are greeted in japanese and when you leave your thanked in japanese.  the workers there all seem to be young students.  \nthere are so many dishes to choose from.  the only thing i can do is tell you about what i always order: 1) menu items:  kushi-katsu - crunchy breaded pork w/lemony teriyaki dip; ika yaki - broiled squid;  ichiza <mark>Ichiza's <mark>Half Ramen Noodles</mark></mark> - yummy; <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>; beef tataki - rare beef slice to dip in a ponzu-dailkon radish mixture (sublime); kim chee <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>; and a sashimi plate w/ tuna, albacore, mackerel, yellow tail, salmon, octopus, and squid. 2) non-menu items (sheets of paper that have daily/common specials are posted over the walls)  monk fish liver, fried smelt (my most favorite b/c the eggs are cooked in the belly), and beef cubes in ponzu sauce.  yeah, there are a lot of dishes that i like, but im so impressed that ichiza's has not disappointed me for the many times i've been there.  they have large group seating areas, which i've enjoyed many times with friends and family eating and drinking up cold sake, sake bombs, and japanese beer.  i really recommend their house cold sake, so much better and smoother than drinking it warm.  i've been there a many nights till closing leaving with my belly full and ridiculously buzzed from all the sake we drank.   i always have to put this on the itinerary of any of my visiting friends and family that come to las vegas.  that's how much i love and trust this place.  anybody who knows me, can back me up for whatever say about this restaurant b/c most likely i've taken them there....\nadditional note...don't think that this restaurant is one of those upscale dress up places b/c of the amount of stars i gave it.  it gets five stars b/c all around it's hella awesome!!!", 
            "itadakimasu! it's exactly how you feel when you walk into this quaint little place above tea planet. yes....you would never know it was here except for the sounds of fun and mmm mmm smells of japanese goodness. ichiza is definitely a jewel  hidden in vegas. there's nothing more authentic than ichiza. i just like saying it...ichiza ichiza ichiza.\ni have taken and introduced people to this place and they have all agreed how fun it is. not your typical, \"yea dude let me get a california roll\" or your run of the mill chicken teriyaki. that's not japanese. we're looking at mmm mmm broiled squid, and katsu, real <mark>Ichiza's <mark>Half Ramen Noodles</mark></mark> - mmmm tampopo! kirin ichiban on draft! i love the veggie tempura bowls where there's just a nest of veggies over rice with real teriyaki sauce. how can you go wrong? yea! you won't find your typical teppanyaki chef there making onion volcanos.  sure there's things here that white people may cringe upon like the gizzard skewers...or even beef tongue....sweet fried garlic with natto(a fermented soybean).....the service is a little slow. i figure it's because the place is usually really busy. i like having a place to go to in the middle of the night that can make me feel all warm and fuzzy....and that's not from the kirin.  if you have enough room. you gotta try the honey toast. it takes some time so order it when you're halfway finished. it's japanese toast (like half a loaf of bread) partially hollowed out with butter....honey....and vanilla ice cream. simple, delicious....and to the point. \ni definitely enjoy the ramen, jalepeno <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> - yakitori - and the grilled squid...oooo and grilled makerel, black cod in miso....so much to choose from!\nthis place can fit anyone's budget. the ambiance is traditional japanese, with pictures and specials on the walls, there's a group area that you can sit, but you gotta take your shoes off. the bar is great because you can watch them cook in the kitchen. overall - a must go place.\n\nif you're a regular here - get your ichiza stamp card for a discount.", 
            "thank goodness for yelp. i wouldn't have discovered this restaurant without all the good reviews about it. \n\ni love tastings of different  dishes when i dine out. ichiza has quality tapas size dishes at very reasonable prices. for those reasons, this is now my favorite japanese restaurant. \n\nthe bf and i shared:\n\nuni w/ponzu\ngrilled squid \nyellowtail, salmon, mackerel, tuna, albacore sashimi combo\ngrilled smelt roe - fellow yelpers influence :) \nfried oyster - i was craving the fresh oysters, but they were out :(\nshrimp <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> \nbeef tataki\nbeer  \ncalpico shu\n=========\n$70\n\nthe sashimi and uni were very fresh. after reading some of the reviews, i had to try the smelt roe.  i didn't know how to eat the smelt roe, but shared the dish with another patron at the bar and watched him eat it first. it was tasty. all the dishes we ordered were yummy! i will definitely come back here on each vegas trip.", 
            "went and ate at ichiza last night based off of all the reviews i have read on yelp. and i have to say that i loved it. had a short wait when we arrived, but i think you get that at all good places, and we were seated in less then 10 minutes. the menu items written all over the walls were fun to read and interpret, but i wonder if i missed out on anything good because i didnt see it written somewhere. :) and some of them were written only in japanese, so i wondered what they were. next time i am going to order all the items i cant read, and just be surprised when thing show up.  \"i'll take that, and that, and that...\" \nwe ordered the deep fried baby soft shell crabs, marinated minced spanish mackerel, kimchi <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, tartar yellowtail, wasabi green bean tempura, and the mapo-tofu (all for only $44, including 2 large sapporos).  everthing was great. the yellowtail was recommended by several people on yelp, and i agree with them. it was great. a little messy, but i didnt mind that. the baby soft shell crabs kind of caught me by surprise, because they werent kidding about \"baby\" these little things looked like they had just been born, and hadnt had time to grow a shell yet...but they were very tasty. i liked the marinated spanish mackerel, served on top of a cucumber wedge, and the kimchi <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was very good too. the beer prices were great too. $5.50 for a large sapporo, i have paid alot more than that at other places. \nthe staff was all very friendly, and helpful, and i think everyone who worked there said good bye, and see you next time, as we were leaving. i will diffinately be going back. in fact, i cant wait too.\n\nupdate: went here again saturday evening and it was even better the second time. i'm upgrading ichiza to 5 stars.", 
            "i have been to ichiza twice and i have had great experiences both times. both times i have been there, there was a short wait.  i have been seated at both a table and at the bar.  service was good, and everyone was friendly. the first time i went i was with an ichiza veteran who knew exactly what to order, so i had a whole mess of stuff, and can't really remember what any of it was, could have been the fact her expertise included mass quantities of sake. i remembered the kimchi <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and mapo-tofu and ordered those again on my second visit.  the next time i went we were a little more daring and did most of our ordering off the walls. once again everything was yummy.  i was not a huge fan of the minced spanish mackerel, but it was okay.  the tartar yellowtail was delicious, but a bit of a challenge to eat. when i lost about half of it down my shirt, it was good for a laugh. :) the prices are very reasonable, and i left full and happy.\n\nsince my first review, i have been back many times, and i have always had a great experience.  tonight the folks at ichiza went above and beyond!!  there was a bit of a wait, so we went downstairs to tea planet, and we didn't have enough time to finish our drinks.  we went in ichiza half expecting them to tell us no outside drinks, which they did...however, they offered to put our drinks in the refrigerator for us so they wouldn't go to waste! just another reason to love ichiza, and in case you need another...two words...honey toast. yum!", 
            "this place was what started my ramen craze!  their udon dish and <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was so delicous, actually everything is!  not only that, this is the only sushi spot that i know of... opening until 2a.m. and the food is authentic japanese cuisine, since the staff is literally only japanese.  the tables maybe small and everything, and the size of the restaurant isn't all that big... but the service is great.   \n\nif we had a restuarant that was similar to this place in the area, i think it would be banking in hella money and on top of that, its not very often that you go to a restuarant and order ramen noodle.\n\n*still thinking about*..... gawd..... i'm hungry for ramen.", 
            "a local spot that no one should miss.  it's a relaxed atmosphere where people want the feeling of being in japan while eating the food.  i've been here so many times already and i'm always amazed and in awe with their food, service, and overall atmosphere.  the experience is also one i've never had.  i don't know what authentic japanese food really means but i would assume ichiza gives that full meaning.\n\njust like any other japanese restaurants, when i walk in i'm greeted loudly by all the employees in their language.  the past two times this week i've been i was with my cousins and this was the night to devirginize christine with sake.  muahahahahahaha!!!!  we were seated at the bar to watch the careful preparation of each food that was ordered by all customers.  it's a small and cute little restaurant that may sometimes have a wait because of seating capacity.  \n\nthe menu is either in a form of a book or hanging from the ceiling in the bar area with pictures so you can see what the food looks like before ordering it.  i have found this very useful.  also, you can just ask one of the servers what they would recommend and always will they give you a straight up answer.  they know their shit!  what's good?  okay, you can order their shrimp <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, garlic <mark>Boiled Cold Bok Choy</mark>, oysters (mmm... their oysters here are bomb!), sushi is also good, kimchi pork (this is something you have to order too), shrimp tempura, sake (large bottle), and there's just so much to choose from.  the only item i wasn't very hot for was the fried udon.  i can't put my finger on it but i know i wouldn't order it again.  although i've been informed it's a popular item amongst majority of the customers.  by the end of it all, i was very full and satisfied as we ordered just the exact amount for everyone.\n\nnow, the moment of truth.  it was time to sink the shot in christine's mouth.  we were like little school girls pouring the shots.  christine took the shot and didn't like it but got used to it after a while drinking.  i think this is where i'm gonna take my god sister when she comes to visit me.  i'm excited.", 
            "once again, thank you yelp for helping me find another great restaurant to satisfy my hungry tummy... my boyfriend's parents live in vegas, so we come here a couple of times a year.  for the past year, i've been wanting to try this place out, and finally got around to it tonight.  i really liked how the restaurant was set up - small, simple, and traditional looking - they're not trying to look super nice, rather than giving off a more comfortable eating atmosphere.\n\nthe inside of ichiza consists of around 10 tables, and then there's a tatami (i don't know if there's a spelling for it) section with 2 long tables, where you take your shoes off and sit on the ground.  then besides that, there's the kitchen area.\n\nthe service here is ok, not great but not bad.  it is what it is.  however, the food is really good.  like richard l. said, it's like tapas, but japanese style.  i guess this type of cuisine is called \"izakaya\" as i have learned after reading all of these reviews.  living in the bay area, i actually have yet to find a place with this type of cuisine - everyone in the bay is really hung up on sushi (hey, which i love, dont get me wrong). \n\nanyhow, my boyfriend and i came here tonight and we ordered an order of their udon, chicken skewers, agedashi tofu, kimchi <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, and spicy tuna roll.  the udon was really tasty and they added some seaweed, egg, and veggies to it.  i didn't try the chicken skewers, but they looked like teryaki chicken pieces on a stick, and my boyfriend liked them a lot.  the agedashi tofu, which is one of my favorite appetizers, came with a generous portion of fruit, and 4 huge slices of tofu.  the tofu was very fresh and soft, and the dish was very good.  spicy tuna roll was pretty good, but not amazing.  lastly, i loved their kimchi <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.. ichiza's <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> definitely kicks some @ss... it was sooooo tasty and with the kimchi, it was the perfect amount of spicyness.\n\noverall, 4 stars for above average food and very low prices.  (all of those dishes only came out to about $22.)  definitely a lot lower than the prices we're used to.  all of the smaller dishes run from $3-$5, and larger dishes run from $6-$9.. none of it is expensive.  if i lived in the area, i would definitely come back.\n\nand, they're open till 3am!", 
            "ichiza is where tourists come to die. and by that, i mean i wish the tourists here would die. something about being white, middle aged, and vacationing in vegas brings out the worst in people. add sake and gen-u-wine japanese food, and you get fourty-somethings licking food off of each other's bodies (and then applauding each other's courage for doing something so indecent in public) while opting to forgo the wearing of footwear (and not as a display of respect, but as a display of drunken negligence- who walks around in a parking lot without shoes @ 2am?) while the menu at ichiza is dynamic, drunken tourists are always on the menu. yes: kirin on tap, seared salmon belly, miso butterfish, kimchi <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, seared bonito, sashimi, rolled sushi, braised pork belly, mixed mushrooms, honey toast.  no: hamachi collar (salty and dry), skewers (blach- greasy), octopus and cucumber (not so fresh), anything with egg in it.", 
            "definitely my favorite of las vegas. i was bummed they ran out of the honey toast, cuz i heard so much about it from fellow yelpers. so don't go so late like i did (12am).  i had the best beef ever!!! even better than korean bbq...wait, nothing can beat korean bbq. anyhoo, it's called \"beef tataki.\" for like $6, it's a tiny dish with several slices of this deliciously flavored meat. i would rather have several dishes of this stuff than some plain boring american steak. another fantastic dish: \"crab <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>.\" around $7, and it's a perfect size for one person. i think it's fake crab meat, but it's the best <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> ever! they used some magical oils for sure. not oily, just incredibly flavorful! this place uses fresh ingredients and makes every dish soooo intense with flavor, but still healthy!! i had the red snapper carpaccio as well,very fresh thinly sliced fish with some eggs and some veggies, but it felt too light like salad without much dressing. but seriously, i will come back to try everything :) i trust their taste. and the japanese girls that work there are so cute and sweet. the manager is also very personable.", 
            "an off the strip hole in the wall that was very satisfying...\n\nduring my best friend's bachelorette party weekend in vegas, a fellow bridesmaid (who uses yelp religiously for good eat recommendations as well) suggested to dine here. luckily we had a minivan that could pack in 9 girls and take a 10-15 minute drive away from the strip.\n\nichiza is located on the second floor of an asian strip mall. in comparison to the other vegas restaurants on the strip, this was definitely no fancy place (a bit of a hole in the wall) but definitely had character. since we arrived early for dinner we got to eat in one of the two group tables in the back where you take your shoes off.\n\ni can honestly say i've never been to a japanese restaurant like this before....when we looked at the menu we were all a little taken back (i guess i'm a bit sheltered when it comes to authetic japanese food).....what no bento boxes? no large sushi menu?.....then what do they serve? this place was everything but ordinary....on the walls they posted signs with the various small dishes that ranged from $2 to $6 and various things on the menu i've never heard off. each lady ordered 2-4 mini appetizers or dishes and we all just shared everything. it was super fun getting to sample alot of things in one siting. we kind of played it safe because alot of the choices sounded a bit scary. from what i remember we grubbed on:\n\n-japanese style crab <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> (yumm)\n-kimchi with pork (this was one of my favorites)\n-grilled mackarel\n-grilled bacon wrapped mochi (sounded so weird we had to try it)\n-sweet grilled corn\n-deep fried chow mein (kinda like pan fried noodles)\n-fried calamari\n-mini fried chicken pieces\n-a couple sushi speciality rolls (unagi & scallop) of the few choices they had\n-and can't forget about the famous honey toast (sweet bread ala mode)!!!!....note: it does takes about 15 minutes to cook and we ordered 3 seperate ones so that there was 3 people to each honey toast. this dessert really topped off the meal and is probably what pushed this to a 4 star review! \n\nthe waitresses were overall friendly but kind of hard to understand since i think they were more fleunt in japanese than english. by the time we left the place, which was about 8:30pm on a saturday night this small place was packed with several costumers waiting outside...so again it was comforting to know that it can be a popular place during peak dining times.\n\nalthough we were skeptical when we first walked in, this ended up being a memorable dinner with the ladies for $25 a person (which inlcuding us treating the bride to be). so if you are tired of the vegas buffets, want something more authentic, wanna try something new, and have a car (as i don't thinnk it's necessarily worth a cab ride from the strip), i'd definitely recommend giving this place a shot if you wanna dine with all the locals.\n\nthis unique japanese-style tapas place hit the spot!!!", 
            "we ordered a few things items but i especially enjoyed a sushi with unagi on a fried tempura thing on top of sushi, pork tataki, and the kimchi <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. \n\nthe honey toast was made up of really simple ingredients... honey, hawaiian bread, butter, and vanilla ice cream..... but it was a really satisfying treat at the end of our meal.", 
            "another late night in vegas and hunger calls... straight to yelp for recommendations! ichiza is located in the chinatown/spring mountain road area in vegas, just a short 10 minute drive from the strip, and imo better food. we got here around midnight saturday night with a grumbling tummy. the place was crowded and lively. we ordered: \n\ntofu salad w/ tuna sashimi - standard, not bad\ntsukune & kushi tan - decent\nsteamed pork dumplings - actually siomai but very good. juicy and flavorful\ndeep fried garlic - first time seeing this, served with miso paste, very yummy.\ncrab <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> - decent\nagadashi tofu - decent\n\ni would definitely come back next time we're in vegas... good food, lively atmosphere and good value.", 
            "i don't know why this place has such a high rating.  i thought the food was okay.  and the price was pretty reasonable.  i'm guessing in the late night after drinking and partying this is a great place to go.  otherwise, i would recommend some of the other places in vegas that the yelpers recommend.\n\nwe ordered the agadeshi tofu, jalapeno <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, chicken gizzards, braised pork belly, and a roll recommended by the waitress.  everything was decently cooked but some of it was too greasy and the food tasted rushed.  there were a lot of people in the restaurant and waiting outside.\n\nfinally we got the honey toast.  really.... i don't understand the hype.  it's a cube of bread toasted with vanilla ice cream and honey poured on the top.  really, that's it.\n\nif you want to try something a little quirky and raku is closed (where we initially wanted to go) i would say okay.  but this place isn't really that special and there are so many places to go for food in vegas.", 
            "once again yelp to the rescue... we went to a 9pm show without eating dinner, by the time it was over we were ravenous but didn't want 'casino' food. so we decided on japanese food, i did a quick search on the mobile device and entered late night dining. this was the third place to pop up. to our surprise this place is open until 3am on a sunday!?! wow. the reviews were great so we drove over to lv's chinatown area and boy were we glad! this place is in a strip mall on the second floor, its looks like a mom and pop type place. the restaurant mainly had japanese clients, another good sign, if natives eat there then you know its good. anyway we were promptly seated in one of the last spots, it was almost 11pm and it was bustling in there. the menu is rather perplexing, we were overwhelmed and were not sure what to order when she asked for drinks and appetizers. i would characterize this place as japanese 'tapas'. we proceeded to order a bunch of little plates. we started with basics like <mark>Miso Soup</mark> and house salad, the dressing was to die for and a rather huge salad nicely presented with all the fixings. we tried their house special roll, very unique in presentation, think california roll with tempura onions and eel on top, f-ing fantastic! we also had a spicy tuna roll and an order of their marinated fried chicken and shrimp <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>. again remember these are small plates but plates of yummy flavorful food. the shrimp <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was awesome, think benihana but better, not greasy and large shrimp properly de-veined! i was in love and i told my husband so. he was in love with the spicy tuna roll himself, i believe the sushi chef also noticed because they gave us an additional one on the house. the prices here are reasonable too. i would definitely return because there were many many more items left to try on the menu.",

(think of the deep fried head of the sweet shrimp sushi, but bite sized!) the real shrimp chip!\n- whole grilled squid: perfectly grilled. so flavorful!\n- broiled fish... sorry i totally forget the name, but its the broiled fish filled with roe. also very tasty\n- beef tataki: very very tasty! super fresh and flavorful. the beef was amazingly tender\n- yakitori of beef tongue: not the most tender ive had, but still pretty good\n- bacon wrapped potato (skewered): perfect hot fluffy potato, wrapped in crispy bacon... whats not to love??\n- crab <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>: yummy\n\nthis was probably the perfect amount of food for two girls.. hahaha jk, this was an enormous amount of food, but ate everything over the course of two hours in combination with four large sapporos. ... we spent almost $100 including a nice tip, so... not cheap, but we did eat and drink quite a bit.\n\npros:\n- food! if you like japanese food, or are interested in trying something other than the typical sushi, try this place! definitely try to sit at the bar! you can ogle all the food that leaves the kitchen!\n- service: all the servers were super friendly and cute and attentive... but i think you need to be a bit assertive with the guy at the host stand (i think he was the owner?) so that you can get seated promptly. its not that he was unfriendly, just a bit scattered trying to handle so many different things at once.\n- decor: cute jap pub feel. homey, not fancy or stuffy, but like your neighborhood place that you go right after work... bathroom was not the cleanest, but the typical pub/bar restroom.\n- hours: im not used to restaurants being open after 2 (darn la's liquor license!), so the closing time surprised me. i guess this is normal so they can accommodate people in the service industry in vegas\n\ncons:\n- seating... its a bit odd. since is small i would always call and ask to put your name down on the list. we got there at 830 and still had to wait even though we called ahead. when we left 1030 there was a huge wait! they have two large tables toward the back for larger groups, a number of smaller tables around the perimeter of the place, some bar seating for pairs, and then two large tables in the middle that are communal\n- parking lot: typical of most asian parking lots - theyre never big enough. dont forget to try driving around to the back\n- menu on the walls... while i am a big fan of the whole authentic look of a jap pub with \"new\" menu items on the wall... its an utter pain to have to crane your neck, and then squint (cursed with the typical asian trait of myopia) around the room to read items not listed on the menu... im horribly greedy.. i want to know all my options, not just the ones i can read. id highly suggest ichiza spend a few more dollars and write up a complete menu for guests!",

            "coming from san jose, we are blessed to have great izakaya/japanese tapas restaurants (gochi, tanto), so i was not expecting to be blown away by ichiza.  in actuality, i was pleasantly surprised at how good this little joint is.\n\nichiza is located on the second floor of an unassuming strip mall in vegas.  the interior is homey, with seating at a bar, communal tables and individual tables.  there are postings for a ton of different tapas you can order posted all over the walls; it will take a good few minutes to scan them all (and 99% of them sound delicious).\n\nwe ordered:\n\n-tuna tofu salad: very fresh lettuce and cherry tomatoes, avocado, raw tuna, tofu chunks, with a tangy dressing.  very light, refreshing and rich at the same time with the creaminess of the tuna, tofu and avocado.  \n\n-spinach salad (gomaae): mm, boiled, cold spinach with sesame sauce.  love this stuff.  typical serving size.\n\n-miso black cod: a must order.  delicious!  perfectly cooked, sweet, tender cod with a little tempura daikon on the side.  watch out, there was a bone when we bit into it.\n\n-jalapeno <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>: we were hesitant to order this but it turned out to be one of our favorite things.  the <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> was so buttery but that's what made it so delicious.  who cares if it's artery clogging, your taste buds will jump for joy.  there's a big, charbroiled (or grilled?) jalapeno on top, giving it a nice smoky, spicy flavor.\n\n-uni mochi: meh, so-so.  the mochi was crispy on the outside but toooo mochi-ish (just super chewy and glutinous).  it reminded us of eating a marshmallow with the consistency of peanut butter (that feeling where you're chewing and chewing and chewing).  there was a spoonful of uni on top with some green onion garnish.\n\n-some sort of sake (raw salmon) wrapped something, sitting on a lemon slice: i can't remember exactly what it was, but it was very tasty :) i think it had scallop inside?  in any case, see my pic and drool.\n\n-red snapper carpaccio: raw red snapper wrapped around shredded daikon with a dollop of something and 3 ikura (raw salmon egg) on top with a (i think) ponzu sauce.  mmm!  refreshing, nice texture.\n\n-half order of ramen: half order size was perfect.  we couldn't even finish it all.  nice savory broth and chewy noodles.  i can't remember much else but i do remember that it was good, though i've had better ramen.\n\nhoney toast: oh em gee.  this is a f*cking cube of deliciousness.  mindblowingly good.  toasted asian bread, gutted out, with honey and butter on the inside, served with a giant scoop of vanilla ice cream, and drizzled with more honey.  who knew that such a simple concept could be so damn tasty?!  this was definitely the defining dish of the meal, and of the restaurant.  i've tried to make it at home and it wasn't the same.  i would come back just for the honey toast, and i would make love to it if i could, it was that good.\n\noverall, i can't recall it being too expensive, actually, if anything, i remember it being a good deal for the amount of food and quality.  the owner (or manager?), a tallish, japanese gentleman was even nice enough to help us call a cab when we were done with dinner as we had to rush to the airport.  \n\n4 stars for service and food.  would definitely recommend this place, though it is a bit out of the way from the strip.", 
            "a few doors down from crown bakery (http://www.yelp.com/biz/crown-bakery-las-vegas) is ichiza. creative, packed, and a vast menu selection help this izakaya stand out from many other japanese restaurants. different menu items are posted japanese style all over the dark walls. tons and tons of them. strips of paper with kanji and their english translations. it definitely has a great atmosphere. \n\nlet's start off by saying that reservations are a must. this place was loud and packed. additionally, from what i hear, it is always packed. the patrons are a eclectic hodgepodge of ethnic backgrounds. this is a place where the rules of \"see a bunch of japanese in a japanese restaurant, then it must be good\" is thrown out the window. it's because almost everything here is good, no matter who is eating it. i won't lie, it will help immensely to have someone who speaks japanese though. we went off menu for one dish. just a note that many of the dishes aren't just based in japan. we ordered a (off)menu kim chee <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> that was really good. one of those that you know you'll have \"issues\" later on, but you eat it anyway.\n\nso in addition to the <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, the aburage, karaage, tofu salad, and tonkatsu were all good as well. none of them stood out as mind blowing, but they held their own. the misoyaki butterfish with tempura hasu was really light and let's say, \"buttery\" (duh) and flaky for lack of a better word. i'm not a butterfish guy myself, but this was really good. add in the rarely served hasu and it was a winner. we also ordered the hamburger steak. for those of you that don't know, there are real differences in a hs from america and ones made like the ones in japan. this one was more japanese, with a spongy and fluffy texture, like if you added plenty of bread to the meat mix before making your patties. it's really really juicy and soft in texture. \n\nthe one misstep was my own \"bad.\" it was the tataki sashimi. this one was odd. it was different from all the tataki sashimi i have ever had. it was still on the skin and was chewy and difficult to separate from the other pieces. it was like it wasn't cut well enough to separate. it was also overly fishy. definite thumbs down on that one, but it's all about trying things out. right?\n\nthe final topper of the night was the honey vanilla toast. it is really good and is similar to shokudo (http://www.yelp.com/biz/shokudo-japanese-restaurant-and-bar-honolulu) in honolulu, but better. the toast is more crisp which to me makes all the difference between the two. add on the fact that they dump gobs of honey into the toast cavity and you've got a delightful dessert. although to fill up on toast at the end of a meal is a tall order. it's best if you have a large group to share.\n\nthe service is really good despite the fact that it's nuts inside with tons of patrons packed into a small restaurant and groups of people waiting outside. we were there late night as well.\n\nparking fills up fast during dinner, so i'd say make your reservations earlier if you can. again, reservations are highly recommended.", 
            "went here with a bunch of japanese/filopino friends who love the place.  i was weary being that the only japanese restaurants i usually patronize have cook top going on or sushi bars...but it was really really good :-) being \"safe\" i only ordered the pork potstickers and the chicken on a stick (sorry forget the name!).  they were both great, especially the potstickers.  i also tried a few bites from my friends dishes (a <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> i'd never seen before, some kind of pork dish, etc) which were also tasty.  for dessert, someone ordered the banana crepes which was delicious as well.  i need to go back and be more adventurous next time for sure!", 
            "it is difficult to explain in words what makes ichiza so special.  when you walk in the doors of the small, upstairs restaurant, you immediately feel a sense that this restaurant is special.  if you ask any chef or cook in las vegas where they would go if you gave them an unlimited feeding spree, they would undoubtedly pick ichiza.  sure, you may get a better \"value\" by going to one of the overpriced places on the strip, but no where else could you receive the variety, quality, and uniqueness other than ichiza.  \n\nthe menu is astronomically large.  in fact, most of the menu is posted on the walls around the restaurant.  i have been to ichiza well over 50 times, and i can honestly say i haven't tried most of the things on the menu itself, i get most of the dishes off the wall.  that's not to say i haven't had most of the things, because our table is usually filled with 10-15 different items at a time, and our palates are always interested in the new items ichiza puts up.\n\nbefore going to ichiza, there is something everyone should understand.  this is not a sushi restaurant.  yes, ichiza does have sushi.  they will make you basically anything you want.  but if you want to see 40 menu items that interchange random types of fish together in different ways that have no distinction from the other (much like most sushi restaurants), then this is not your place.  but, if you're looking for one of the best and most unique dining experiences you will ever have while trying new things, you should definitely go to ichiza.  ichiza is \"izakaya\" style japanese cuisine.  while it's hard to define izakaya, the easiest way to understand it is to think of japanese tapas.  small plates served in a family-style setting focusing on japanese cuisine is what ichiza is about.  \n\nif for some reason god (or whoever you believe in) came down and told you that you were not allowed to order more than one thing at ichiza, you should, hands-down, order the yellowtail sashimi.  for $11.95, you get 5 thick slices of the best yellowtail you will ever have served on fresh shiso leaf.  i'm not joking, this will be the best yellowtail you have ever had.  unless you are literally a fish monger in osaka, you will not find better yellowtail.  \nother items that are musts at ichiza:\n- salmon sashimi\n-pork wrapped in shiso leaf skewers\n-kimchi <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>\n-ikayaki: grilled squid served with ginger.  simple, yet amazing.  \n-beef tongue stew\n-boiled pork belly\n-<mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark>: giant bowl of ramen with pork belly and egg.  very tasty.  \n-rare organic pork steak: lightly breaded pork, slightly seared and topped with japanese eggplant.  \n- skewers of: garlic, shishito peppers, chicken, beef tongue, corn.  \n- dice cut beef steak: sauteed beef cubes with garlic and shallots.  \n- stir fried bacon potato: potatoes, bacon, corn, garlic, white wine, and stock sauteed together.  one of the least japanese influenced dishes on the menu.  \n- sake marinated salmon collar\n- miso-glazed black cod\n- beef tataki\n- honey toast:  you must get this!  freshly baked sweet bread loaf topped with honey, butter, and ice cream.  i have taken over 20 people to this place, all with different personalities, and every one of them loves it.  if you don't like this dish, you should probably go get your head checked out because something wrong is happening inside of your brain.  \n\nthe most expensive item on the menu is the toro sashimi for around $18.  other than the sashimi's, most of the items on the menu are between $2- $8.  the way to order is to start off ordering a lot of stuff, and eventually your table will be filled with lots of small plates.  it makes for a very social eating environment, and a very fun time.  oh ya, and did i mention that it's open til 3 am.  go here... right now. i mean it, now!", 
            "i just have to say, i love finding these little local places. and the fact that this is in vegas, where its all about glitz and glamour makes it that much better. upstairs in a strip mall. menu items written on sheets of paper on the wall. community tables....\n\nso we found this place by just asking a local walking on the street and they said we had to try it. after we were told it was going to be an hour wait (make a ressie if you can) i was able to talk our way into one of the corner community tables.\n\nthey menu is huge, so i just told the owner to bring out things that he thinks were really good...so he did... the 3 of us split...\n\n-jalapeno <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>- great flavor. right amount of oil and jalapenos. awesome kick\n-some sort of california roll topped with tempura carrots and a piece of eel (which i normally dont like) its was great!\n-shrimp steamed dumplings- probably one of the best i have ever had\n-some sort of tofu and tuna sashimi salad- sooooo good\n-cold buckwheat noodle salad- very good. tons of flavor. some sort of creamy ginger dressing\n-some sort of fried japanese spicy chicken nuggets. this was probably my least favorite dish.\n- honey toast. omg. you have to get the honey toast. delish!\n\nenjoy!",

            "i don't get it. i have heard rave reviews about this place for the past 7+ years, especially for late nights. perhaps my expectations were too high, but i'm quite certain the food is just sub-par. i went out with 3 lovely ladies and we ordered a ton of food. i'm not certain i even remember it all but it went a little something like this: squid in squid ink, squid roll with uni on top, uni in yuzu sauce, spider roll, spicy tuna roll, shrimp <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, vegetable tempura bowl, ma po tofu, beef tongue skewers, chicken skewers, calamari, wagyu beef carpaccio, and potato and beef stuff. some of the items were alright like the yakitori, and the carpaccio, but everything else we ordered, i have had far better elsewhere. \n\nthe squid in squid ink was far too salted, all the sushi was mediocre and the uni wasn't top notch, potato beef bowl had a pewtrid aftertaste, and the worst was the slimy ma po tofu. it was so slimy and weird! this is a decent spot if you're looking to sample many various types of japanese cuisine in one spot, but they don't seem to do any of it very well. after a disappointing dinner, we figured the honey toast wouldn't let us down. oddly enough, none of us have ever tried to, so we ordered one vanilla and one green tea. i'd say honey toast definitely looks better than it tastes, although the one we received didn't look that great either. the sides were extra toasty, and they didn't seem to saturate the toast enough with honey, so it was very dry. all of us ended up just eating the middles and leaving two huge shells of honey toast on the table. i did however, appreciate the green tea ice cream by itself. the vanilla honey toast was way too sweet being covered in honey. overall, i will certainly never be returning. i'll save that space for all the fobby asians that are stampeding through the doors.",

            "i've been here since my teeny bopper years and it's been like a roller coaster! i remember it use to be much different from now. for some reason the food is just not as good as it use to be. the chefs appear to be the same or at least one of them is so i can't quite pin point as to why. the flavors just isn't there. for example i always order the jalape\\u00f1o <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> and it gets worse everytime i order it. por que?!! i love this joint and it's twist on japanese cuisine but it can definitely improve on it's quality and consistency. service has been and still is decent. maybe we need to bring back #tbt.",

            "this is quite the experience, it's funny cuz my cousin who lives in ca knew about this place and i live here in las vegas! go figure! \nthe place is small and cozy..very traditional.. there are many things to eat there, it was cool cuz the servings of the dishes were just enough to try it and not a whole plate of it...opens the opportunity to try other dishes with out getting to stuffed (like a  buffet but better...it's cooked fresh) ...i left the ordering to my cuz..i had no idea what he was going to order but, hey he's family and i trusted his recommendations. i had no clue he was about to take me on a journey to a whole new realm of food! we ordered a bunch of dishes, he ordered chicken gizzard which was good but, he just told me it was chicken! he ordered beef tongue, told me it was beef...hmm.. he was so vague! and only after i ate it he told me what it was!!! \nnote to self remember to ask the right question! lol! we had sushi too, a bowl of ramen, there were many dishes it was all really good. since then i have brought other people to try their food..although just know they are open for lunch but the menu is down to a few selected items like beef bowls, <mark>Chicken & Egg Bowl</mark>, curry, a very slim menu. they had told me the full menu is only at  dinner time.. i was bummed but, the food at lunch is also good! i would totally recommend this spot to grab some grub! \nso dining with andrew zimmerman  so to speak, lol! , well that was my cousins aka name that night! it was very cool to go there with him, he taught me a lot about foods and flavors! it was awesome to see the passion he has for foods! having someone like that it really helps in the experience of trying new things! thanks cuz!\nwatch out for him one day! he will have his own spot! :) \nso if you haven't been to ichiza! you gotta go!", 
            "one of the great things about this place is that it's open late.  ordered a chicken and <mark>Chicken & Egg Bowl</mark>, a half bowl of ramen, and had the fried chicken appetizer.  the fried chicken was similar to musha back in torrance (for those of you from the area) and the chicken and <mark>Chicken & Egg Bowl</mark> was as good as the one from daiko-kuya in los angeles.  these happen to be some of my favorite japanese dishes (other than sushi) and i generally avoid eating sushi from japanese restaurants that don't specialize sushi.  my friend ordered a spicy tuna roll which was alright, but it had a lot more rice than i'm used to.  \n\nthe honey toast which everyone recommends definitely hits the spot after the meal.  the ingredients are simple yet somehow work so well together - when it first came out, i was doubting whether we could take it down (cuz it's pretty huge).  but after taking the first bite, it wasn't too hard to finish it.\n\ndefinitely recommended, just be prepared to wait a a little while for a seat.  if you like japanese food and need a place to eat late at night don't hesitate to go.",

            "this is by far one of my most favorite restaurants in las vegas.  ever since discovering this place about 3-4 years ago, i have always been coming back.  this isn't your high end japanese restaurant.   the decor is simple, the prices are very reasonable, the food is extensive and excellent, and the place is great place to be merry.  right when you walk in you are greeted in japanese and when you leave your thanked in japanese.  the workers there all seem to be young students.  \nthere are so many dishes to choose from.  the only thing i can do is tell you about what i always order: 1) menu items:  kushi-katsu - crunchy breaded pork w/lemony teriyaki dip; ika yaki - broiled squid;  ichiza <mark>Ichiza's <mark>Half Ramen Noodles</mark></mark> - yummy; <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>; beef tataki - rare beef slice to dip in a ponzu-dailkon radish mixture (sublime); kim chee <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>; and a sashimi plate w/ tuna, albacore, mackerel, yellow tail, salmon, octopus, and squid. 2) non-menu items (sheets of paper that have daily/common specials are posted over the walls)  monk fish liver, fried smelt (my most favorite b/c the eggs are cooked in the belly), and beef cubes in ponzu sauce.  yeah, there are a lot of dishes that i like, but im so impressed that ichiza's has not disappointed me for the many times i've been there.  they have large group seating areas, which i've enjoyed many times with friends and family eating and drinking up cold sake, sake bombs, and japanese beer.  i really recommend their house cold sake, so much better and smoother than drinking it warm.  i've been there a many nights till closing leaving with my belly full and ridiculously buzzed from all the sake we drank.   i always have to put this on the itinerary of any of my visiting friends and family that come to las vegas.  that's how much i love and trust this place.  anybody who knows me, can back me up for whatever say about this restaurant b/c most likely i've taken them there....\nadditional note...don't think that this restaurant is one of those upscale dress up places b/c of the amount of stars i gave it.  it gets five stars b/c all around it's hella awesome!!!", 
            "my vegas go to man brought me here - it's on the top of his list, so he has to always bring us out-of-towners there! \n\ni've been there a couple of times already and can definitely tell you this is one of those joints for only the locals.  no tourists would be venturing out over here.  all that much better!  \n\nwhen looking at the bar and all the special menu items posted on the wall, it can be quite difficult when deciding what to order.  so, when in doubt, let the expert go at it.\n\ni fondly remember the fried smelt (less than $3 for three fish).  these plump babies are loaded up 'cuz their eggs are still sitting inside of them.  and with a little bit of salt and some fresh lemon juice, yum yum!  and who doesn't love ankimo?!  monkfish liver that melts in your mouth...ahhhh...i love ankimo!  i've tried a bunch of other things there like the red snapper carpaccio with ikura, <mark>Ichiza's <mark>Half Ramen Noodles</mark></mark>, the beef tataki w/ lemon juice, fresh oysters on the half shell w/ ponzu sauce (2 for $4.25), <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>, and the beef cubes.  i don't remember anything bad about the place, but just good food with good company.\n\nthe first time i went, they had those fancy japanese toilets with all those buttons to try out.  i attempted to use it but had no luck.  on my last visit, their special toilet was no longer there!  =(  i guess too many people were having way too much fun with it and it went into retirement.  \n\nif possible, go with a large group and sit in the back where you have to take your shoes off to swing your feet under the table.  and this way, you can also order a lot more random things and share them with everyone.  it makes it all that much merrier.  overall, pretty extensive menu...i think i want some of that fried smelt roe just about now!  bring it!\n\nupdated: 10/10/06 - they also offer a free membership card.  you get 5% off whenever you dine there when you bring this card and it eventually adds up to 10-15% off your bill for next time.\n\ni also like getting the agedashi tofu soup.  it's light and delicate without being overly infused with the bonito flakes.  yum yum!\n\nthe salmon skin salad was okay.  the dressing overpowers the salmon skin, so you can't taste a whole lot.  i wouldn't bother getting it again.  \n\nthe deep fried crabs are a plate of baby crabs with an aioli type dipping sauce.  an interesting taste and a nice crunch! \n\nside note: they give you a wet towelette thing and that will be your napkin for the entire meal.  don't bother looking around for regular paper napkins here!\n\nupdated: 11/27/06 - i recently tried the okra with natto (less than $3).  first off, the idea of natto grosses me out.  the texture alone is nasty, and the smell...geez, that's a whole other subject.  since it was my dining partner's first time w/ the stuff, i suggested he give it a go at some a cheap price.  it comes with thin slices of fresh okra, seaweed slivers, and hot mustard on the side.  overall, i would not recommend it unless you're a fan of this stuff.  i definitely am not one. blah.  \n\nalso, the last two times i went, they were out of the lovely ankimo!  argh!\n\nupdated: 01/24/07 - i changed my ratings from four stars to five because i find myself craving the fried smelt roe more often than not.  and ichiza has apparently become my comfort restaurant to turn to when i can't decide where else to go.  i have only been to one other izakaya, and that was musha in torrance, ca.  how can this place not be special?\n\nupdated: 06/12/07 - went back the past weekend after a few month hiatus.  they were out of uni and ankimo!  argh!  but we had the beef tongue - tasty, and gotta eat it when it's hot; minced spanish mackerel on cucumber - fresh, lots of flavors on your palatte, fried garlic - put salt on it instead of the miso, and oh-so good!, tartar yellowtail - with avocado, crisp things, and salsa - refreshing flavors and light, and honey toast - they need more bread chunks, but yummy!  (they had a few new dishes that were listed in japanese.  if you ask the waitresses or owner to translate, they'll try their best!  be daring and give it a go!)\n\nupdate! 08/06/07 - out of ankimo again!  argh!  but they do have a soft shell crab appetizer that comes with a ponzu dipping sauce and japanese mayonnaise.  it's a fatty crab with lots of meat!  yum!  their red snapper carpaccio is a bit different, it comes with olive oil, tomatoes, and mozzarella!  \n\nupdate! 10/09/07 - where the heck is all the ankimo?!  argh!  brought some out-of-town guests to ichiza to experience where the locals eat.  ate all the standard stuff, of course.  new thing tried here - live scallop.  i warn you now, don't sniff the squiggly things...it may turn you off!  but the scallop slices dipped in ponzu sauce is oh so tasty.  also shared a ramen bowl.  i'm personally not a big fan of ramen (it's a filler), so i'll pass on it.  everyone else seemed to swallow it down without any problems! =)\n\n(i added some photos of my eats above!)", 
            "itadakimasu! it's exactly how you feel when you walk into this quaint little place above tea planet. yes....you would never know it was here except for the sounds of fun and mmm mmm smells of japanese goodness. ichiza is definitely a jewel  hidden in vegas. there's nothing more authentic than ichiza. i just like saying it...ichiza ichiza ichiza.\ni have taken and introduced people to this place and they have all agreed how fun it is. not your typical, \"yea dude let me get a california roll\" or your run of the mill chicken teriyaki. that's not japanese. we're looking at mmm mmm broiled squid, and katsu, real <mark>Ichiza's <mark>Half Ramen Noodles</mark></mark> - mmmm tampopo! kirin ichiban on draft! i love the veggie tempura bowls where there's just a nest of veggies over rice with real teriyaki sauce. how can you go wrong? yea! you won't find your typical teppanyaki chef there making onion volcanos.  sure there's things here that white people may cringe upon like the gizzard skewers...or even beef tongue....sweet fried garlic with natto(a fermented soybean).....the service is a little slow. i figure it's because the place is usually really busy. i like having a place to go to in the middle of the night that can make me feel all warm and fuzzy....and that's not from the kirin.  if you have enough room. you gotta try the honey toast. it takes some time so order it when you're halfway finished. it's japanese toast (like half a loaf of bread) partially hollowed out with butter....honey....and vanilla ice cream. simple, delicious....and to the point. \ni definitely enjoy the ramen, jalepeno <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> - yakitori - and the grilled squid...oooo and grilled makerel, black cod in miso....so much to choose from!\nthis place can fit anyone's budget. the ambiance is traditional japanese, with pictures and specials on the walls, there's a group area that you can sit, but you gotta take your shoes off. the bar is great because you can watch them cook in the kitchen. overall - a must go place.\n\nif you're a regular here - get your ichiza stamp card for a discount.", 
            "look it's another f-ing ichiza review.  just an f.y.i. it's pronounced e-chiza...the \"i\" is pronounced w/ an \"e\".   so, here's the breakdown...i love this place.  i think it's the perfect place to take a date.  just grab an intimate seat for two at the sushi bar, get a little sake action going, and get adventurous when you order!\n\ni recommend the squid rings, not the fried ones though.  the agedashi tofu, the mochi bacon, which is just sticky rice wrapped in bacon, but it's so good.  you must order the three kinds of sashimi, which is yellow tail, tuna, and mackerel.  just stay away from the wasabi octopus, or anything w/ <mark>Ichiza's <mark>Half Ramen Noodles</mark></mark>, opt for the udon noodles instead.  and don't forget the mochi ice cream...the perfect little sweet treat to share w/ your date!", 
            "one of my mainstays in vegas.  definitely one of the best and authentic japanese izakayas in vegas, and would amount to a pretty decent one if situated in la.  \n\na review ragged on its green tea in a can (i love my asian drinks in cans, like ucc, grass jelly, barley red tea)... another review mentioned stiff <mark>Ichiza's <mark>Half Ramen Noodles</mark></mark> (many people enjoy al dente ramen, you could ask for cup'o noodles if you want soft soggy ramen)... another complained about the <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>??  anyway, maybe authentic asian food in a pretty authentic overseas asian setting (dumpy american style strip mall with sticky tables) isn't their thing, then they won't like ichiza.\n\nsome recommendations are:\nikayaki\nred snapper carpaccio - the lemon garnish is perfect\ntanmen ramen - stir-fried ingredients gives it a full off the wok flavor, like korean champon.  many other ramen places do a miso-yasai ramen that is also stir-fried first also\nshabu shabu salad - shabu style pork over mixed greens, <mark>Fire Roasted Eggplant</mark>, seaweed, etc. with shabu style mixture of sesame and ponzu dressing\ntofu steak - i like stir-fried bean sprouts\nfried oysters - perfectly breaded to seal in the sweet oyster juices\n\ntheir lunch menu is limited to bento sets, donburi, ramen, and combos, which are good too.\n\nprices are very good, especially compared to hotel offerings at the wynn or palazzo.", 
            "ichiza is a izakaya restaurant located in close proximity to the las vegas strip. my friends and i took a cab from the strip and it came to be ~$10 per ways. compared to other izakaya restaurant, ichiza is suited well for informal gatherings with friends and companions who are adventurous when it comes to food. i would not recommend for dates or casual after-office meetings (as most izakaya's are for). i like to think of ichiza as the younger, hipper version of its upscale, intimate raku, counterpart. \n\nboth raku and ichiza serve decently made traditional izakaya entrees . food presentation at ichiza is lacking compared to raku but they have more varieties of dishes for one to try. the one complaint i have of their menu is that a lot of their more interesting varieties are scribbled on pieces of paper that are pasted against the wall. therefore, making it inconvenient when you are ordering. so, make note of good dishes that are recommended to you either through word of mouth, bloggers or yelpers. i can definitely say that are enough options to feed a mouthful with splitting open your wallet.\n\ni went with a group of 8 friends, ordered many ~16 dishes and it came to a total of ~$17 pp. it is a izakaya, so you can eat/order however much or little you would like. \nmy recommendations are the following (please note that i do like raw fish and sometimes meat, if fresh enough, so i will note any dishes that contain raw items):\n\n-takoyaki: \"octopus balls\" (not literally) if you have never had this, you must try. i am from the bay area where a lot of japanese and asian families live and rarely do i see takoyaki on menus. not only does ichiza have it but it is done to perfection. \n\n-okonomiyaki: i believe this is seasonal. the texture and flavors is very similar to takoyaki except that it has more vegetables and no octopus balls. think of it as traditional japanese pizza\n\n-hamachi tartar: excellent textural contrast between the flaky rice placed between two crisp wonton skins and topped with smooth and buttery hamachi tartar with avocado. this was amazing\n\n-ichiza dx ramen: i enjoyed this very much. perfectly al dente <mark>Ichiza's <mark>Half Ramen Noodles</mark></mark>, beautifully refreshing soup, delicious pork loin? pieces. i can slurp up every bit of it. the normal portion is humongous. we got 2 to share between 8 people and it was plenty. you can also get the half order if the normal size is too large\n\n-fried oyster: burst of oyster juice and flavor in your mouth. i loved the various condiments they provide as well\n\n-grilled eggplant with shrimp: really good sweet and spicy flavors that reminded me of authentic szechuan goodness. the sauce was so addicting that people just started dipping everything in it! haha\n\n-anything hibachi grilled would probably taste excellent! we had the beef tongue (:d), pork with shiso leaf (very unique flavors kind of like mint and basil) and yakitori (loved this)\n\n-bacon wrapped mochi\n-beef tataki\n-broiled miso cod\n\nhoney toast is supposed to be really food but we were already too stuffed to keep going. but to be honest it is a just a huge slice of toasted asian breast drizzled with honey and vanilla ice cream. it does sound good but could be something you could make at home. \n\noverall, ichiza is a lot of fun to eat and converse in. i would recommend!", 
            "if you are expecting very good japanese food, as most americans know it,  you will not like the food at this restaurant.  not compatible is just the plain truth.\ncame here looking to do something off the strip.  after all, how many oversized meals can you handle in a weekend?  grew up in l.a., so no stranger to sushi and japanese food.  but of the 12 or so items we tried, only the shoshito peppers and <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark> were edible.  we sent back the spicy tuna roll after my wife spit it out since it was soooooo fishy.  the albacore sashimi must have been caught a month ago- it, too, found the inside of my napkin. even the other cooked food was horrible.  we hid most everything under the <mark>Ichiza's <mark>Half Ramen Noodles</mark></mark> so the waitress would clear the plates.\nbeing respectful to cultural tastes is one thing, so i did not expect to like everything we ordered.  but as a standard by which to measure, fresh fish is fresh fish, no matter where where you are from.  this was not even close.  i would not send anyone to this restaurant for the food.\nvery friendly staff, and cheap prices for the portion sizes, hence the 1 star.", 
            "i read the reviews and was pleased with my experience at ichiza. the place is cozy and the service was ok. \nthere wasn't much on the menu that i wanted to try (or so i thought), so i settled for the <mark>Miso Soup</mark> with <mark>Ichiza's <mark>Half Ramen Noodles</mark></mark> (small), the garlic sauteed baby <mark>Boiled Cold Bok Choy</mark>, and the cold spinach with sesame. my husband ordered the grilled calamari. he felt bad that i \"didnt have enough\" so he ordered the broiled eggplant with tomatoes and mozzarella cheese.\nthe cold spinach salad is delicious. very very flavorful and tasty! i recommend if you like spinach and/or tahini.\nthe baby <mark>Boiled Cold Bok Choy</mark> was amazing. in a garlic soup broth, it was sooooo good. i recommend this as well.\nthe <mark>Miso Soup</mark> with <mark>Ichiza's <mark>Half Ramen Noodles</mark></mark>. when she came over with the soup, i thought \"oh boy, i ordered the small and she just gave me the large\"...uurrgh. it was so so yummy. it was so flavorful. it wasn't a stepped on <mark>Miso Soup</mark> where it's watery. it was just delicious.\nmy husband loved his calamari. i tasted a piece and it was very good. cooked perfectly, nice clean flavor.\nnow, the broiled eggplant dish. completely doesnt go with what we ordered above. at all. it doesn't taste right, doesnt' look right on table (lol). to me, it felt like they were putting \"something\" on the menu for someone who is weary of japanese food. this wasn't the dish to do it. we each took one bite each and that was it. it had zero flavor. none. \nfor dessert we tried the honey toast. it was not what all the reviews rave about in my opinion. at least not what we were served. however, when we purchased our own bread from chinatown and made it at home the next night, it was amazing. i will be making that dessert again......and soon!\ni disregard the eggplant dish and focus on the wonderful and delicious items i did enjoy. \nfyi, if you have 2 ice tea's they charge for the 2nd. no free refills. and, good news, she didn't charge me for the large soup!", 
            "i used to eat here as a regular when i first moved here.  my ex is more familiar with japanese dishes so i let her do the ordering and i do the eating. its a tapa style place so its impossible to get full from just one dish but on the bright side, you get to try different varieties of food.  \n\neverything we've ordered was very satisfying.  i'll tell you my favorites: tofu salad, kimchi <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, their sashimis and <mark>Ichiza's <mark>Half Ramen Noodles</mark></mark>, sesame chicken....well to cut it short every damn thing was good.  oh except the octopus sashimi, what the hell was i thinking but i like to try things i've never tried before.\n\npeople, don't ever make the mistake of ordering honey toast dessert at tea station which is just downstairs but force your lazy ass to get up those stairs and come here for ichiza's honey toast because its way, way better.\n\nit gets full at times so long waits might be required for bigger parties.  the wait is usually short with me and just another person.  and for you guys with yellow fever, there's this waitress that always wears this purple nike airmax...hella cute.", 
            "i really enjoyed this place. it's a little off the strip, but pretty close. we had several appetizers, all of which were great. beef carpaccio, agedashi tofu, and a couple of sushi items i remember distinctly but do not know the name of - they were all delicious.\n\ni had spicy <mark>Ichiza's <mark>Half Ramen Noodles</mark></mark>, which were also pretty good. my friend got a big plate of sashimi. i had a piece, and it was fantastic. also tried another friend's kimchee <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, which i enjoyed. service was decent, although they confiscated two boba teas from our party until the end of the meal. i hate it when places have silly policies like that.", 
            "ichiza\nparking (4/5)\nparking lot is shared with bunch of other shops in the plaza so its easy to find a spot when they are busy. \n\natmosphere (4/5)\nthis place is always packed every time i've been here. it very loud at night and the wait could be more than 30-60 minutes. also, their waiting area is pretty small so on busy winter nights get ready to spend sometime outside of the building. you can always leave your name on the front desk and go to other shops in the plaza.\n\nservice (3/5)\nservice is prompt and very courteous. the waitresses were very helpful in picking out food and explaining what each item contained.  even the owner of the restaurant was making sure that everyone was being taken care of properly. his suggestion on some of the food items was very helpful.\n\nfood (3/5)\nour dinner primarily contained of everything on their menu; meat stick items, <mark>Ichiza's <mark>Half Ramen Noodles</mark></mark>, mackerel, <mark>Miso Soup</mark>, and my favorite blue fin tuna poke. they have bunch of meat on a stick items, including yakitori and chicken meatballs. \n\nmeat on a stick is always the best opener appetizer item for a gathering, this was followed up by <mark>Miso Soup</mark> and <mark>Ichiza's <mark>Half Ramen Noodles</mark></mark>, which were good, but the noodles were nothing spectacular. if you want better noodles then you can go to sora ramen, which is couple blocks away from this place. mackerel was bit over cooked, which made it bit chewy. bluefin tuna poke was delicious, i felt guilty after ordering it but it was very fresh and practically melted in your mouth. \n\nthe most disappointing item on the menu was their honey toast. this is the worst dessert i've ever had. i just don't see how you can make a dessert out of a loaf of bread, ice cream and honey. it's to heavy and simply the its too sweet.\n\noverall, this is a reasonably prices restaurant, but some of the food items are either not made correctly or the flavor just don't add up, ichiza get 3/5"

            "updated 12-27-07: came here again and this time it wasn't as good as before. i don't know what it is. this time, even though it was good, it just didn't blow me away like last time. so one star off.\n---------------------------------\n\nthank you thank you thank you to all the yelpers who rated this place highly. that was the main reason why we bookmarked it and decided to check it out. i wasn't sure how late they were open but we arrived pretty late, around 10pm and crossed our fingers as we entered. man, it was bustling! turns out they were open until 3am mon-sat, until 2.30am on sundays. however, last call is 45 mins before closing so make sure you arrive on time.\n\nso there were 2 guys waiting for a table and the hostess asked if we wanted to sit at the counter. lil guy was all for it. so, counter it was. i was just fascinated by the atmosphere in here. there were 2 tatami tables with very drunk people singing and carrying on. they were obviously having a good time.\n\nwe were given menus but it was the posted items above our heads which interested me. hubby left the ordering to me. i ordered an udon ($6.35) for little guy with his usual edamame ($3) and agedashi tofu ($4.35). then, i proceeded to order a bunch of items for us adults.\n\nuni pon ($5.50) arrived first. it was 4 plump pieces of uni sitting on thinly sliced cucumbers nestled on daikon spaghetti wading in a pool of ponzu sauce. omg it was fantastic. the uni was soooooo fresh and flavorful. i could've eaten 3 of these.\n\nthen came the salmon skin salad ($5). this was no ordinary salmon skin salad. this was the emperor of all salmon skin salads i've ever had. crunchy slivers of carrot, shreds of lettuce, grape tomatoes, daikon sprouts, perfectly cooked salmon skin, grated daikon, topped with a dollop of roe. hubby and i shared this but were fighting over who got the last morsel. \n\ntaramiso, otherwise known as miso butterfish ($5.50) is something i've been craving since leaving hawaii. i used to eat it at least once a week. after a year of missing it and seeing it on the menu here was enough for me to kiss the ground of this izakaya. the taramiso did not disappoint. in fact, it was so perfect hubby and i again commented on how much we've missed this dish.\n\nall the while, lil guy was enjoying his udon, edamame and agedashi tofu while watching his portable dvd player oblivious of all the ongoings around him. \n\ntofu salad with tuna sashimi ($7.50) was interesting yet refreshingly delicious. romaine lettuce, followed by mashed tofu, topped with diced avocado and cubed tuna sashimi, toss in a few daikon sprouts and a pinch of bonito flakes and voila, a masterpiece. the grape tomatoes complete this both in color and texture.\n\nof course an izakaya meal isn't complete without some sort of alcohol. we had 2 large bottles of asahi draft ($5.50/bottle) and then we finished by sharing a bowl of miso chasu ramen with extra chasu ($10). i'm sorry, but santouka <mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark> not measure up to the ramen here and it was the last item we ate. the broth was perfect, not too salty and not under flavored. the chasu had just the right amount of fat interspersed with the lean bits. it looked like pancetta. hubby was a bit skeptical but i assured him he would like it, and guess what? he did.\n\nthis is definitely bookmarked for our next visit to vegas, and let me tell you this, i'm reliving my meal right now just by writing this review and the bad part is, i'm not eating the food as i'm writing this. bummer!", 
            "vacationing in the lv from the sj (san jose), i just had to check this place out since it was my only chance to really try the place.\n\nmy family & i were driving to this place via gps & we were pleasantly surprised that... there's an asian plaza in las vegas!  wow.  haha.  my parents were noticing all the pho places around  & totally wanted to eat pho for lunch the next day (ah typical asian parents). btw this plaza is called chinatown plaza, but caters to all asian cultures since there are filipino, japanese, vietnamese, chinese, thai, malaysian, and korean restaurants there...\n\nanyways on to the experience!\n\ni entered and it was pretty empty at 7:00pm on a tuesday night, and i immediately felt like i was in japan.  there were tons of specials plastered all over the wall and over on top of the bar, it compliments the very traditional, homey, & cozy feel that this place exudes. \n\nhowever, maybe it was just me & my terrible food choice syndrome, but none of the food really wowed me.  my family & i shared the beef tataki, tofu & shrimp special, <mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark>, 3 beef tongue skewers, onigiri special variety & the salmon steak for dinner.  all the menu items were at about the same level of tastiness, which is pretty good, but nothing mind blowing.\n\nfor dessert we also shared a banana crepe & honey toast which i must say were yummy!  well you can't really mess up crepes, but the honey toast is a really unique dessert that you can't get anywhere else.  the toast is formed like a cube except there is no top part and in the center is topped with honey and vanilla ice cream. yum! just like french toast.\n\nall in all, it's a good experience & the service was great, just the food didn't exceed my expectations", 
            "i've been going to ichiza for 7 years, found out about this place when i first moved to vegas. it used to be a room full of asian customers here and you never needed an reservation. as more people found out about this place, you see half o the restaurant is filled with westerners. unless you go early (before 6), you definitely need to make a reverberation or you will see a line a people waiting outside.  \n \nbesides their regular menu, they have additional items on the wall throughout the restaurant. i've tried a lot of the items off the wall, but my favorites are still the regular menu items.\n\n- <mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark>: delicious ramen broth with a big chunk of fatty pork!\n- agedeshi tofu: lightly breaded fried tofu in broth\n- miso mackerel: this is the best miso fish i've had. \n- honey toast: vanilla ice cream in a toasted texas-toast drizzled w/ honey.\n\nand did i mention you can get japanese beer on tap here? and by the pitcher!", 
            "i  love  you  ichiza\n\nafter watching the beatles love at the mirage, our group headed over to ichiza after reading rave reviews on yelp prior to this trip.  this place did not disappoint!  i'm thinking...finally (extra stressed), good, affordable and unpretentious japanese food in las vegas.  \n\nyou see, i'm not the type of gal who likes to dine in fancy, upscale and overpriced restaurants (maybe once in a blue moon), so i was really happy that ichiza offered the quality of an upscale place (speaking in terms of the food) at such an affordable price and casual atmosphere.  \n\nservice was quick.  we casually walked in and were seated right away.  our waitress always checked up on us and was more than happy to offer little tidbits of information on the menu and specials hanging all over the wall.  the ambiance is very authentic.  i felt like i stepped into a restaurant in japan.\n\nwe ordered the following:\n1.) beef tongue skewers\n2.) fried baby octopus\n3.) three <mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark>\n4.) <mark>Udon Noodle Soup</mark>\n5.) spider roll\n6.) miso butterfish\n7.) fried calamari rings\n8.) fried quail eggs\n9.) three lemon shochu\n\nphew, that's a lot (granted, we were extremely hungry), but this accommodated a group of four very well.  time to break down the taste and flavor!\n\ni was actually a little hesitant to eat this because i've never had beef tongue before.  after taking the first bite, i was hooked.  it was chewy, juicy and packed with a lot of flavor for something so relatively thin.  the fried baby octopus was crunchy on the outside, but chewy on the inside.  it tasted lightly salted and was accompanied with lemon juice.  yum.  then, there's the miso butterfish.  ohhh myyy goshhh.  screw halibut, i'm going for butterfish now!  it had the same consistency as a halibut for a fraction of the cost!  so buttery and delicious.  mmmm.  the last meal i ordered was the <mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark>, which i'm guessing means deluxe, though, i'm not sure.  this bowl was huge and comparable to shinsengumi's hakata ramen.  but, i think i enjoyed this ramen more.  they offered more toppings and bigger pork slices (with the fat attached, yum).  it's not extremely salty either which is nice.\n\neverything else, my group ordered, but from the looks of it, they seem to have enjoyed their meals very much. =)\n\nfor a group of four people, our bill came to a little over $100.  pretty good i must say.  i'm definitely returning.", 
            "had dinner with a friend who was craving ramen, so i searched yelp and found ichiza. its a nice little restaurant, wasnt too crowded at all when we went (saturday around 11pm). we sat at the bar and ordered our food. i cant remember exactly what the name of the dishes were, but she had the <mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark> bowl and i had the udon with shittake mushrooms and egg. both were really good and came out to us fairly quick. we also tried the grilled squid which was really good and something off one of the many many items scattered around the restaurant. it was a fried oyster wrapped in chicken skin which tasted ok. im tempted to keep coming back here to try out everything they have and check off each of the menu items one by one.", 
            "first thing is... this izakaya is crowded on the weekends!  even on the weekdays, it's pretty busy.  the staff is friendly with everyone greeting you as soon as you come in.  \n\nichiza's pretty easy to find.  it's on the left side of spring mountain just before arville if you're coming from the strip.  it's in the plaza with the big korean bbq sign on the second floor above tea station and next to the crown bakery store.\n\nif i'm there for a meal i'll order something like the <mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark> with kakuni (pork belly) or i'll just order a pitcher of kirin when i'm there to just hang out and eat some appetizers like the beef tongue and chicken gizzards.  i enjoy the unique spread of food on the menu as well as the wood interior and the paper menus posted on the wall.\n\nthis place has great food, drinks, and a great atmosphere (unless you don't like crowded places).  i definitely recommend it.", 
            "during my trip from south dakota to cali the bf and i planned it so that we would have a stopover in vegas and we wanted to try something that was off the strip that more locals ate at that was not ridiculously expensive. we love izakaya and frequently go to village yokocho in nyc so we wanted to see how this place would hold up.\n\nwe went there on a saturday and got there about 7ish or so, it was pretty packed and there was a large asian clientele which i always look at as a good thing in an asian establishment. we had to wait for about 5 mins or so, but with a smaller party it's always a shorter wait and we had a seat at the bar.\n\nthe waitresses there were adorable and were very friendly and helpful. you got a regular menu but as people said in other reviews you have to walk around to see what other tasty treats might be posted on the wall around the restaurant.\n\nthere were a few things we had to get, one was the yellowtail tartare. it was...interesting, with tortillas and avocado being the main tastes, i am not sure if i would get it again but it wasn't bad...i wish i got more of a taste of the yellowtail in the dish. a quick breadown of the other thins we got if my memory serves correct:\n\n1) wasabi octopus - seemed like a popular dish, very fresh, cut good so its not to chewy, cheap\n2) fried squid - great sauce, perfectly cooked\n3) red snapper carpaccio - pretty presentation, eh on taste but not terrible\n4) spicy deep fried chicken - another seeminly popular dish, it was drenched in that srirachi sauce (sp?) but the breading wasn't to heavy and reminded me of a tempura\n5) tried to get salmon belly but it was sold out for the night\n6) honey toast of course - i dont know how they get half a loaf of bread to do that but i love carbs and i liked the denser chewy parts that were drenched in honey that you scoop up some melting ice cream with. \n\nwe had to get some asahi super dry which was super cheap for the super big bottle, all together i dont even think our bill came up to $40 with all of that between the two of us, and it was an interesting neighborhood. \n\nthe ladies next to us got a bunch of sushi and a <mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark> which looked good but nothing to spectacular. i wish i saw or thought to ask for monkfish liver because that is really really yummy. we wanted to get some yakitori but they didn't have any combos and the selection was pretty small, overall i think our ny spot is still #1 but this place was solid.\n\none thing i dont like about vegas is it's a little hard to get a cab and you technically can't flag one down on the street, you can call for one and there is a cab stand close by...we happened to see a guy leaving the shopping complex next door and ran up on him to get a ride, which can work as well.", 
            "the skinny: japanese izakaya restaurant with some great yakiniku favourites but unfortunately has some misses (3) service - good only if you're a regular and the manager knows you (2.5), value - pretty poor if you are eating izakaya style. went home and needed a snack even though paid $20/person (note: we did get one small carafe of sake). (1)\n\nnormally, we usually come here for their ramen. however, we came here with a friend who's a regular here (eats here at least once a week). boy, what a different experience that was!\n\nwe got an amuse bouche. the manager actually smiled at us (he normally has a scowl on his face whenever you ask for a table). it was like we stepped into a rabbit hole. seriously.\n\nwe ordered a delicious grilled salmon collar, grilled chicken wings, jalapeno <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, sashimi, fried soft shell crab, tsukune, a sushi roll (eel with various toppings) and zaru soba noodles. all these items were worth ordering again.\n\nthe misses are stirfried beef tongue (which i found to be a little too tough - normally i'm a huge fan of tongue), and shiso-wrapped pork/bacon skewers (which were a little too bland, needing more salt and shiso leaf).\n\nmy complaints are the value of the dishes. serving sizes are small for the money. a better value for your money is the <mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark>.", 
            "i love the miso ramen there, very delicious, always hot and you can get a half bowl to enjoy their other delicious dishes. my normal order when i go; \n\nhalf miso <mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark> chopped beef steak ( not on menu, this is beef chopped into bite size squares and pan seared to a medium with onions and garnished with toasted garlic :d ) \ngyoza \nchicken and <mark>Chicken & Egg Bowl</mark> (oyakudon) \nand tall cold asahi \n\ni highly recommend this place as my new favorite (rip togoshi ramen (-_-) )", 
            "it is difficult to explain in words what makes ichiza so special.  when you walk in the doors of the small, upstairs restaurant, you immediately feel a sense that this restaurant is special.  if you ask any chef or cook in las vegas where they would go if you gave them an unlimited feeding spree, they would undoubtedly pick ichiza.  sure, you may get a better \"value\" by going to one of the overpriced places on the strip, but no where else could you receive the variety, quality, and uniqueness other than ichiza.  \n\nthe menu is astronomically large.  in fact, most of the menu is posted on the walls around the restaurant.  i have been to ichiza well over 50 times, and i can honestly say i haven't tried most of the things on the menu itself, i get most of the dishes off the wall.  that's not to say i haven't had most of the things, because our table is usually filled with 10-15 different items at a time, and our palates are always interested in the new items ichiza puts up.\n\nbefore going to ichiza, there is something everyone should understand.  this is not a sushi restaurant.  yes, ichiza does have sushi.  they will make you basically anything you want.  but if you want to see 40 menu items that interchange random types of fish together in different ways that have no distinction from the other (much like most sushi restaurants), then this is not your place.  but, if you're looking for one of the best and most unique dining experiences you will ever have while trying new things, you should definitely go to ichiza.  ichiza is \"izakaya\" style japanese cuisine.  while it's hard to define izakaya, the easiest way to understand it is to think of japanese tapas.  small plates served in a family-style setting focusing on japanese cuisine is what ichiza is about.  \n\nif for some reason god (or whoever you believe in) came down and told you that you were not allowed to order more than one thing at ichiza, you should, hands-down, order the yellowtail sashimi.  for $11.95, you get 5 thick slices of the best yellowtail you will ever have served on fresh shiso leaf.  i'm not joking, this will be the best yellowtail you have ever had.  unless you are literally a fish monger in osaka, you will not find better yellowtail.  \nother items that are musts at ichiza:\n- salmon sashimi\n-pork wrapped in shiso leaf skewers\n-kimchi <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>\n-ikayaki: grilled squid served with ginger.  simple, yet amazing.  \n-beef tongue stew\n-boiled pork belly\n-<mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark>: giant bowl of ramen with pork belly and egg.  very tasty.  \n-rare organic pork steak: lightly breaded pork, slightly seared and topped with japanese eggplant.  \n- skewers of: garlic, shishito peppers, chicken, beef tongue, corn.  \n- dice cut beef steak: sauteed beef cubes with garlic and shallots.  \n- stir fried bacon potato: potatoes, bacon, corn, garlic, white wine, and stock sauteed together.  one of the least japanese influenced dishes on the menu.  \n- sake marinated salmon collar\n- miso-glazed black cod\n- beef tataki\n- honey toast:  you must get this!  freshly baked sweet bread loaf topped with honey, butter, and ice cream.  i have taken over 20 people to this place, all with different personalities, and every one of them loves it.  if you don't like this dish, you should probably go get your head checked out because something wrong is happening inside of your brain.  \n\nthe most expensive item on the menu is the toro sashimi for around $18.  other than the sashimi's, most of the items on the menu are between $2- $8.  the way to order is to start off ordering a lot of stuff, and eventually your table will be filled with lots of small plates.  it makes for a very social eating environment, and a very fun time.  oh ya, and did i mention that it's open til 3 am.  go here... right now. i mean it, now!", 
            "stopped by here our first night in vegas. we're not into the normal \"tourist\" things so relied heavily on yelp, which was very helpful.the reviews of ichiza are pretty accurate. it's a small-ish, low key place in the chinatown area. crown bakery, which was also good, is next door. \n\nglad we got the tips on the fact that the \"menu\" is hand written signs hanging all on the walls and around the bar. though they have pictures, it's still tough to know what to order.\n\n1) we ordered the grilled salmon belly, but never got it. someone else seemed to be enjoying it at their table, so we looked on in jealousy. oh well, better luck next time.\n\n2) the beef tongue stew is indeed delicious. very strong umami flavor, very simple, tender beef with mushrooms and onions. the hubby didn't think it was salty, but i did. the only downside is that it overpowered the #90 <mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark> that i ordered. thumbs up.\n\n3) #90 ramen. not sure what the fuss is about. not as flavorful as vietnamese pho, various udons and other asian soups i've tried here in texas. again, flavors could have been muted by the beef tongue stew.\n\n4) salmon roll. nothing special. not bad. we sat at the bar, so watched the sushi chef who seemed diligent.\n\n5) chicken gizzards on the skewer came out a little bloody and didn't seem that tasty to me. i'd pass. beef tongue skewer wasn't great to me either. it was a little dry, but flavor was ok. i prefer my tongue stewed i suppose.\n\n6) honey toast. wouldn't have ordered it had i not seen the yelp photos. glad i did. it was unique and tasty, but what wouldn't if it was topped with ice cream, butter and honey. price was a little high at $7. \n\n7) was going to order the eel, but it only comes fried, which seems like a waste of unagi. \n\noverall, i'd come back to get the honey toast, beef tongue stew, salmon belly (since we didn't get to try) and the rest of the menu, if i could. definitely worth a try.", 
            "located in chinatown off the strip, this place is a great find for good asian food.\n\ni would recommend the <mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark>--with its pork belly, seaweed bits, bean sprouts, cabbage, bamboo shoots, and half an egg in yummy broth, it's a great cure for vegas-induced hangovers and vegetable cravings. it comes in half-size and full-size--if you're still recovering from the night before, the half-size is enough. if you're really hungry, get the full-size cuz it's huge.\n\nother good dishes that our party got: the beef tongue (first time i've ever tried it and it was less chewy than i expected with good flavor), jalapeno <mark><mark><mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark>, beef tataki, and tuna tartar. \n\nthe presentation for everything is really nice and the servers are attentive. our waters were constantly filled even though we had a big group. \n\ntip: take some time to look over handwritten menu items taped to the wall because a lot of them are good and not included in the printed menu.",

            "i love this place for a certain favorites.whenever i venture out though, i'm like ehhh. so my top reccommendations include; the eel kakiage tempura roll, the kaku-ni (deeply boiled diced pork belly with egg), the <mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark> (ramen with pork belly and half egg), and the tofu salad with tuna sashimi.\n\nget the honey toast once....just to try the hype.i love sweets, but i don't crave this like crack food that others make it out to appear.", 
            "i've been looking forward to dining here for months. ichiza has come highly recommended by several of my foodie friends. when we arrived, we were greeted with...actually...we weren't greeted at all. i was asked my name by a very rude host/manager and then told it would be about 15-20 minutes. ok, fine. when our table was ready, our very cordial maitre'd (detect the sarcasm) literally pointed at my girlfriend and directed us to the bar. also, we weren't asked if we'd prefer a table or the bar, but if we were, i would've asked for a table. oh well...still forgivable at this point. the server promptly arrived and brought our drinks. when she asked if we were ready to order, i told her this was my first time here and was hoping to get some recommendations. she didn't seem to care. she acted like she was busy, but really she was just looking forward to going to the side area and talking with her coworkers...which was in plain sight to us. very rude. we ordered the grilled squid, grilled salmon belly, some kind of <mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark>, beef tongue skewers, a spider roll, beef tataki and yellowfish tartar. the star was the salmon...juicy and moist, with a little side of grated daikon to cut the fat. everything else was just mediocre. i was very curious about this \"honey toast\" that i kept seeing being brought out to other tables, so i asked our lovely server about it. she said, \"it's honey toast.\" and i replied, \"yes, but what exactly is it?\" and she said, \"it's huh-nee toast.\" thanks..really cleared it up for me. she was incredibly rude about it...like i was putting her out to do her job. so, after about 15 minutes of waiting on our final dish, the yellowtail tartar (which is a cold dish, mind you and should certainly not have taken that long), our frustration led us to cancel the final order and get out of there. bottom line: mediocre, over rated food and a staff that thinks their stuff don't stink because they're popular and busy. i'm sorry that all my reviews are about bad experiences. i'll try to be better about that.", 
            "the food is good and varied enough that there is something for everyone here.  don't limit your selections to the menu in hand, read the walls.  that's where all the new and interesting stuff is.  \n\nthe servers don't speak english, which creates a sense of authenticity...and tons of problems.  we have been there dozens of times, and they have never brought our entire order.  they never charge us for the food they miss, but it's a bit of a joke at this point.  \n\nfood hightlights:  shisyamo (regular and sun dried), beef tongue and chicken skewers (but sometimes they burn it and serve it anyway), <mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark>, and honey toast (takes 20 minutes, but worth the wait).",

            "vegas ramen quest #3 of 3 days in a row...  this restaurant stood out.  not for the ramen, but for all its other dishes.  \n\nfantastic japanese restaurant with a huge variety of offerings.  peruse the menu, browse pics on yelp and find yourself reading all the litter on the walls, featuring everything else you'd like to order.  this, was annoying.  lovely decor, but monkey don't want to read the walls to figure out what to order, especially when trying to read over other tables.  there are yelp pictures of stuff we wanted that are not on the menu.  server was very helpful to narrow down what it was we were looking for.  \n\n#91 <mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark> - good, but still falls below monkey's gold standard of ramen, la's daikokuya.  in fact, i'm writing this 2 weeks later and i can't remember anything worth mentioning about this ramen. \nyellowtail tartare - now this blew our minds when it arrived to our table!  order it and be amazed.  there are bottles of wine we reserve to celebrate with, this dish my wife insists i only order with her.  \nfried oysters - monkey don't do fried oysters and this didn't change my mind\n#45 beef tongue skewer - this arrived first.  savory, chewy, delicious.  think marinated beef chewing gum.  can you imagine?  monkey loved masticating this sliver of cow tongue. ever see a monkey make out with a cow?  loved it so much we ordered another skewer to finish us off, instead of dessert\n#87 broiled rice balls - if you love the toasted rice at the bottom of your stone pot bibimbap, you will absolutely order this.  imagine two tennis ball-sized triangles of rice, toasted crisp on all sides and probably brushed with soy sauce.  fantastic, but oh too salty for monkey.  will definitely order again with less salt.  \n\nopen every day 230pm - 3am ! ! !  great place for after drinking/partying or sampling different items while drinking...  monkey cannot wait to return!", 
            "when in vegas - grab a cab and get to this place.. located about a 10 minute cab ride off the main part of the strip. it is on the 2nd floor of a non descript shopping mall. no extra points for curb appeal at this place.\n\nfirst - the place was packed. we ended up waiting a few minutes, but it was full up. \n\nsecond - big bottles of asahi are $5.95. you should get a few of these. \n\nlastly - the menu crazy! it is on the menu, but it is also plastered to the walls on a ton of little signs. <mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark> and fried pork with kimchi were amazing.\n\nbonus - the place is open until 2am\n\nn*joy.....", 
            "first time here and definitely coming back. it's packed, and on a monday. was not impressed with the limited menu at first but quickly realized there were dishes listed on the wall.  a lot of them.  we sat near the kitchen which gave me a chance to eye out dishes i'll try in the future.  service was quick, and the food came out quick which helps the crowd turnover.  speed did not impede on quality.  started off with the <mark>Fire Roasted Eggplant</mark> and cold baby <mark>Boiled Cold Bok Choy</mark>. both were refreshing.  <mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark> did not disappoint. neither did an inexpensive and satisfying shrimp tempura bowl, served over a bed of rice and tempura flakes.  of course, do not leave without a serving of honey toast.", 
            "izakaya in vegas? sure, why not?\n\nsome of the advantages about coming here early (like 5 pm when the store just open) are plenty of available parking spaces and none of crazy waiting line. nothing superb about the service, staffs got the job done and we all got our food in an orderly fashion. \n\n31. garlic baby <mark>Boiled Cold Bok Choy</mark> (stir-fried baby <mark>Boiled Cold Bok Choy</mark> with garlic soup - $3.95): simple and decent dish. tasted just like how my mom would cook it - garlic soup wasn't too crazily salty, but i do think $4 is a bit pricey. \n\n45. kushi-tan (most tender beef tongue - $2.25 each): a huge hit. beef tongue was grilled perfectly with just the right seasoning. now that's something you don't get to enjoy everyday. \n\n52. black cod fish fillet (black cod fish [butterfish] marinated with miso-sauce - $9.95): definitely a miss for me. texture is pretty good, but simply too salty. i would rather exchange one black cod for four beef tongues. \n\n91. <mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark> (ichiza's ramen with kakuni and half egg, half size): a hit for me. this ramen reminded me of champon ramen at hana ichimonme in los angeles (http://www.yelp.com/biz/hana-ichimonme-restaurant-los-angeles). broth is milky and flavorful. kakuni wasn't too bad and i can taste vegetable in the bowl here and there. not the most amazing ramen, but i was pretty impressed with it. \n\nmore hits than misses - just stick with yelp's recommendation and you will have an enjoyable experience.", 
            "for a moment, it was like i was just sitting in hondaya back in la, sitting on a table, drinking hot sake, eating gyutan ( beef tongue), eating ramen ...oh man......now that's what you call..great experience\n\nit's an izakaya that opens till late, i can imagine all the things that goes on here, get <mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark>, you'll love it, its unique, it's different, its amazing, oyako don is good too (chicken and <mark>Chicken & Egg Bowl</mark>), oh man...i dont even want to start counting the calories..but f**k it.....what happens in vegas stays in vegas....my calories didn't get the memo though......they came back with me ;d", 
            "someone below mentioned hondaya in la, it does remind me of this place. we ordered half-size <mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark>, regular shoyu ramen, kushi katsu (tonkatsu on a stick with onions inside), fried quail eggs, beef tongue yakitori, agedashi tofu,  honey toast and a pitcher of kirin.\n\nfyi, 30 mins after the place opened, it was completely packed.", 
            "in vegas for a bachelorette party, and it was our last night in town. after a lot of gambling, a 5-course meal at picasso, a show at thunder down under, and the v lounge, we were ready for our second dinner.. aka midnight schmorgusborg. took a cab from the venetian, and in 5 minutes we were at ichiza, at 2:30am. how awesome that their kitchen was still open? how great was it that there was the shortest wait, and the staff was enthusiastic and kind? it was all great. 5 stars, no joke.\n\nrandom sheets of 8.5x11 sheets of paper taped up on the walls with various delectable items to order, as well as dry erase boards that have specialties listed. you also get a small half-sheet printout of what the daily special is. each diner also gets a small tofu+<mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> to start.\n\nchicken gizzards - main reason we came, was craving this all day, and we got them two ways - garlic fried and also skewered and grilled -- delicious!! just the right amount of chew, and it was delectable\nwhole grilled squid - it was fairly impressive to see an entire squid on a plate, and it was cut up to quarter inch lengths -- char-grilled and very flavorful\nuni - uni uni uni oooooooo--neeeee - wow this was amazing, the uni is served in half a lemon, and we ordered 7 of these -- fresh, sweet, so worth it\ncrab row <mark>Croquette</mark> - crispy outside, and yummy not-too-gooey inside, served with a side of tangy dippy sauce\nbroiled mushrooms - more than 4 types of mushrooms, cooked to perfection -- however, if you want lots of flavor because you are somewhat tipsy, then you gotta add some soy sauce, otherwise the natural mushroom flavors may seem a bit tame\nhoney toast - so my friend said they forgot to toast the interior cube of bread, but it was my first time having it, so i didn't miss the toasting. basically, a big cube of texas toast hollowed out, and served up buttered and drizzled with honey, and a side of vanilla ice cream\n\ni regret that i was so eager to try their small plates that i completely neglected to order any of their <mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark>. i would definitely come here again, and i do recommend it for late night dining and a great place to bring friends.\n\nthis place is in chinatown, so it's not walking distance to the strip, and there is a shortage of taxicabs in this side of town. be prepared to order a cab to pick you up, and the restaurant staff is helpful at placing the call and giving directions on your behalf.", 
            "<mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark> was salty; skewers were ok but nothing blew me away. we ordered grilled whole squid which was totally forgotten so we ended up canceling it...", 
            "my last night in vegas. ethan and i went to this place for eating after a shopping day and o theater show in bellagio, super late around 1am. it is in second floor. it's hard to see from the outside. it is a small place but got quite a lot selection of food.\n\nwe order the broiled whole squid which is ok, not good as i expected. the yellowtail sashimi is really good, fresh and tasty. ethan had the <mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark> and beef bowl which are ok. the beef tongue yakitori tastes good and tender. well, i mean for the food,i don't think it's surprising, i had sth much better in nyc, but for the price, i will go here next time. it's cheap and worth try. seriously, they get tons of food u can choose. i will try sth else next time and maybe i will find excited food there. i believe their food are good.", 
            "felt like staying in for one of my nights in vegas. picked up some food to go from ichiza so that i can enjoy some nom noms while lounging in front of the tv or from the balcony at the hotel room. \n\ni picked up some: \n\n* tsuku - chicken meat balls\n* sabamiso - mackarel with miso marinated\n* kan - beef tongue\n* kakiagi - eel roll\n* <mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark>\n* shrimp tempura bowl\n\nloved it all! they packaged it well to stay fresh and enjoyed the same as if ordered for dine in. dine in also includes more food options -- just check out the specials they have posted on the walls. worth a trip off the strip.", 
            "this place is good for trying a bit of everything of japanese cuisine, especially since the pricing is good. i'd come here if you want to try experimenting with other types of japanese food. every japanese restaurant has ramen or some sort of rice bowl. you come here to try the other side of japanese food because most likely they'll have it somewhere on their menu. if you don't see it you can always ask them and see if they can make it- which is why i love this place.\n\nwhen you come at night, the ambiance is very authentic to a japanese izakaya (which is like a tapas place). it's busy, it's loud, an all japanese speaking staff, and then there's the overwhelming amount of menus all over the walls. it reminded me very much of japan! (for the record, i used to live in japan.) it's a fun place to bring your friends, drink a few beers, and order a little bit of everything.\n\nlunch time is my favorite time to come eat here. service and the food is always good. \nthey even have lunch specials in which you get a choice between 2 chef choice meals or you can order a bento box type meal.\n\nservice during busy weekend nights can be iffy. sometimes can be inattentive but not always the case. reason why i gave 4 star and not 5. if i could, i'd rate a solid 4.5\n\nrecommendations: daily specials are usually promising, <mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark>, yakisoba, honey toast, and if you're daring takowasa (raw octopus in wasabi)\n\ntips:\n-make a reservation 2 hours beforehand\n- parking on the weekends is horrible, come early to your reservation\n -sign up with them for their membership you get 5% every $20 purchase and when the stamp card is filled you get 10% every visit.", 
            "when i first saw this place, i was happy because it looked like a hole in the wall - a japanese hole in the wall restaurant. \n\nhole in the wall restaurant = delicious food and i was right. we went there on a weeknight and there was still a wait. i can't imagine how it would be on the weekend. \n\nwe ordered the eel kariage tempura roll, grilled squid yakitori, tom yum roll, and the <mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark>. each roll had wonderful sauces that complimented the ingredients very well. i was really surprised that the tom yum roll really tasted like it was thai. i could taste the lemon and the chili. it was so strange, yet satisfying at the same time. i love grilled squid and this one was well cooked. my only complaint and it's a small one, would be that the ramen was under seasoned, but i enjoyed the noodles very much. \n\nthe service is quick and fast. prices are reasonable, but remember that you are ordered small tapas style dishes for the most part so don't expect to order only one or two plates. \n\ni'm definitely coming back the next time i'm in vegas.", 
            "ichiza is my favorite japanese restaurant in town! i love the style of the restaurant and the food is very authentic. the yakitori, <mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark>, and the mochis are the best! since they do have phenomenal food, the wait is always very long and the restaurant itself can be very crowded. maybe they should consider renovating or opening up another one.", 
            "<mark>Chicken Cutlet</mark>: i didn't like this dish. it was okay. \n\nkushi-katsu: breaded and delicious. would recommend this. \n\nagedashi tofu: i didn't like this one in particular because i had one before that is better. \n\nocha-zuka (salmon): this was surprisingly delicious. first time trying it and warning: there's little wasabi things in it so if you can't handle spicy make sure to ask for it without it. \n\n<mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark>: i really liked this ramen. i liked how the noodles were cooked and brother was yummy. would definitely get this again. \n\n<mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>: was yummy. \n\nyellow tail (hamachi): it was okay wasn't delicious. \n\nsalmon (sake): okay as well. \n\nservice: in between attentive and not. \n\ni would recommend this place if you want to try everything with a group of friends. ramen is a ng portion though."

            "i  love  you  ichiza\n\nafter watching the beatles love at the mirage, our group headed over to ichiza after reading rave reviews on yelp prior to this trip.  this place did not disappoint!  i'm thinking...finally (extra stressed), good, affordable and unpretentious japanese food in las vegas.  \n\nyou see, i'm not the type of gal who likes to dine in fancy, upscale and overpriced restaurants (maybe once in a blue moon), so i was really happy that ichiza offered the quality of an upscale place (speaking in terms of the food) at such an affordable price and casual atmosphere.  \n\nservice was quick.  we casually walked in and were seated right away.  our waitress always checked up on us and was more than happy to offer little tidbits of information on the menu and specials hanging all over the wall.  the ambiance is very authentic.  i felt like i stepped into a restaurant in japan.\n\nwe ordered the following:\n1.) beef tongue skewers\n2.) fried baby octopus\n3.) three <mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark>\n4.) <mark>Udon Noodle Soup</mark>\n5.) spider roll\n6.) miso butterfish\n7.) fried calamari rings\n8.) fried quail eggs\n9.) three lemon shochu\n\nphew, that's a lot (granted, we were extremely hungry), but this accommodated a group of four very well.  time to break down the taste and flavor!\n\ni was actually a little hesitant to eat this because i've never had beef tongue before.  after taking the first bite, i was hooked.  it was chewy, juicy and packed with a lot of flavor for something so relatively thin.  the fried baby octopus was crunchy on the outside, but chewy on the inside.  it tasted lightly salted and was accompanied with lemon juice.  yum.  then, there's the miso butterfish.  ohhh myyy goshhh.  screw halibut, i'm going for butterfish now!  it had the same consistency as a halibut for a fraction of the cost!  so buttery and delicious.  mmmm.  the last meal i ordered was the <mark>Ichiza's Ramen Dx</mark>, which i'm guessing means deluxe, though, i'm not sure.  this bowl was huge and comparable to shinsengumi's hakata ramen.  but, i think i enjoyed this ramen more.  they offered more toppings and bigger pork slices (with the fat attached, yum).  it's not extremely salty either which is nice.\n\neverything else, my group ordered, but from the looks of it, they seem to have enjoyed their meals very much. =)\n\nfor a group of four people, our bill came to a little over $100.  pretty good i must say.  i'm definitely returning.", 
            "went here last night. everything was amazing. tom yum roll, <mark>Udon Noodle Soup</mark> and tempura rice bowl!!! try the pork dumplings and honey toast too! :)", 
            "went back last night for a late dinner with friends and was again impressed with everything we tried. best dishes were: miso butterfish, beef tongue stir fry, garlic baby <mark>Boiled Cold Bok Choy</mark>, yellowtail tar tar, <mark>Udon Noodle Soup</mark>, and beef tataki. :) delicious once again!", 
            "we set a reservation for 6 and the place was not too crowded when we arrived on a wednesday night.  the tofu salad was terrific.  the yellowtail tar tar is not to be missed. i really enjoyed the <mark>Udon Noodle Soup</mark> which came with three bowls so we could share. we finished with the honey toast which is simple and delicious.  with the late night hours i fear we might become regulars.", 
            "in light of our upcoming vegas trip, it reminds me that i need to review this place.  \n\ncame upon this place for late night eats and omg, this place seriously blows my mind.  on our last trip, we made at least 2-3 stops here for grub after drinking.  i would say i was a lil buzzed one night, but the other nights, we were just hungry and looking for grub!  even when you are full as s#&8#t, you still wanna come here!  their food is just amazing!  \n\ni love me some <mark>Udon Noodle Soup</mark> and i will eat this dish be it on a hot day or a cold chilly night.  they have an udon dish on their menu, but that's not what i had wanted so i simply asked them for beef udon and they gladly said they would make it for me.  man, something about the broth of the soup, the beef so tender, the texture of the noodles just right.  it was definitely amazeballs!  of course, from the first night in getting this dish, i got it repeatedly after that.  i'm so looking forward to another bowl on the next trip.  drool!  \n\nwe also ordered a special sushi roll from the wall menu, i don't even remember what it's called now..but it had some bbq eel and some deep fried yam/shrimp thing on top and man it was bomb diggity.  the sushi roll itself and the eel and fried whatever it was went perfect together.  mouth full of goodness is all i can remember.  \n\nwe also ordered a couple appetizers as well, i believe one of them may have been the squid dish.  then as you move onto dessert, you know you gotta get the all time famous honey toast.  a big block of toast, warm, soft and yummy tenderness with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and honey... it is the perfect ending to a great dinner.  \n\nfriendly staff, place fills up quick, small joint, reasonable prices, great grub!  looking forward to seeing you again real soon!", 
            "perfect for late nights; closed at 2am.  reasonable, inexpensive foods.  ramen was really good; the pork soup base was flavorful and rich.  the beef rice was delicious, and portion size was huge enough for two ladies to share.  <mark>Udon Noodle Soup</mark> was bland though.  tried some of the skewers including beef tongue, chicken neck, beef liver, etc., of which all were okay and not as impressive as the ramen! \n\nagain, ramen's really really good and you must try it!!"
