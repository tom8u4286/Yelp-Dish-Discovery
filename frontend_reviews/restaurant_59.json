            "as you will see from my reviews i have eaten at high end steak places in ny, philadelphia and dc.....this is definitely in the top 5 of all of them.   \n\nwe went here with a group and ate on a thursday night, we had no problem getting a table for 4 at 8pm with reservations.   \n\ni had the <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> bacon appetizer which was honestly the lowlight of my meal but still very good.   my wife had a beet salad which looked nice and a friend of mine split onion rings with the table.   the free fries were also amazing and we loved the different sauces.\n\nnext came the main courses.   my wife ordered a filet done perfectly.   my friends gf had the halibut which was also excellent.   i had the regular <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> and the <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> options as did my friend.   let me just say this steak was seasoned and cooked perfectly.   the <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> legs that were the side were amazing.   they were split and all of the good parts were left.   a great addition! \n\nwe got the mashed potato sides  as well as a mushroom that was part of a forrest fire.   \n\ni think that this is a great steakhouse and a great place to eat.   i would highly recommend this place in lv.",

((mmmmghghgh))\n\nmy friend and i shared a porterhouse with some <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark>... it was nearly a religious experience. the steak was so tender, i could<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> sworn it simply fell apart in my mouth. i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> never had such an amazing steak. don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> get me wrong, it hasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> ruined me for other places, like ruth<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> chris or boa, but it cer<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> set a very high standard. it needed absolutely no further seasoning and was cooked perfectly. the <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark>, well, it was good, but then again <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> is fairly consistent from place to place. \n\npricey? yeah, but well worth the throwdown. i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> glad my friend dragged me here, because she really made an excellent pick - as i ate, there was nowhere else on earth i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> have rather been.", 
            "compared to other steak houses i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> visited in las vegas, stripsteak is middle-of-the-road. if i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> going to spend a lot of money i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> rather dine at carnevino, cut, or delmonico. if i want a decent steak at a more affordable price, i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> go to twin creeks.\n\nmy wife and i arrived early -- about <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> hour before our reservation. the hostess still seated us promptly at a small circular two-top, but in the back of the lounge, in between the bar and the main dining area. it was very comfy -- her on a long bench with big cushions, me in an oversized chair -- but not ideal for eating a meal because of how low the chairs are in relation to the table. add to that the deafening sound of all the lounge chatter and music and it was difficult to have a conversation.\n\nthe food wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> bad at all. as a matter of fact, some of it was great. but, i think there<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> better value to be had elsewhere.\n\nto start you off, they bring out a complimentary trio of fries (old bay flavored, garlic herb, and truffle oil). all were some of the best fries i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> had, with the garlic herb being my favorite. they were perfectly crispy, light, and addictive. we had to force each other to stop eating them and save room for the rest of our food.\n\n//appetizers//\nsweet onion soup ($17) - morels, parmesan crouton. excellent depth in flavors, earthy and delicious mushrooms.\n\nmain <mark><mark>Grilled Maine Lobster</mark> Fritters</mark> ($20) - bacon-wrapped fritters. three per order. the <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> was masked by the oiliness and saltiness of the dish. but the crispness and coolness of the lettuce wrap was a nice compliment. not worth getting again.\n\n//entree and sides//\n10 oz. filet ($56). they were nice enough to split it for us since we wanted to share. ordered it medium rare, but it came out closer to rare. tender and savory, but not nearly as good as the filet at carnevino.\n\ntwo sides of <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> ($24 ea.). each order con<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> two meaty <mark>King Crab Legs</mark> with lemon. served cold, it could have benefitted from some drawn butter.\n\nshallot potato cakes ($9) - scallion creme fraiche. three cakes. perfectly crispy, great flavor... kinda like the greatest hash browns you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> ever have.\n\nenglish peas ($14) - shaved fennel, pancetta. peas are peas, nothing extraordinary, but the pancetta added a good bit of savoriness and salitness.\n\noverall, the food was pretty good, service not very attentive, the sommelier suggested a wine we weren<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> crazy about, seating was comfy but not functional, and it was too loud to carry a conversation. oh, and i forgot pricey. but we did have a $50 restaurant.com gift card that helped mitigate the damage.\n\n3.5 stars",

            "stripsteak is, by far, the best steak i have ever eaten in my life. i went there first to take clients out to dinner late last year. we all started with the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, which was very impressive. the \"chef<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>\" duck-fat fries that arrive at the table are such a nice treat, and awesome.\n\nfor dinner, i got the skirt steak which was cooked to perfection. for my side, i got the bacon-<mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, which although i was close to a heart-attack, was beyond delicious. we had no room for dessert, but the waitress sent all of the ladies off with some caramel popcorn, a really nice touch. \n\nbecause i went home and raved about the place to my friends and husband, they all wanted to try it. we ended up getting our close friends a giftcard for their anniversary trip to vegas, and they too, loved it, so much so that they went twice on their trip. i took my husband back in july. it was an equally amazing experience. i actually even enjoyed this time better if that<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> possible. i started with a cucumber martini, which can only be made by stripsteak. it was like pure heaven. we both got the filet and shared onion rings and the truffled mac n cheese. i wish i could swim in the mac n cheese.  i will never go to stripsteak again without ordering that side. anyone that is looking for suggestions, trust me on this one!\n\nit was my husband<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> birthday and they brought us out the homemade doughnuts with the dipping sauces and decorated the plate. a nice touch as always. i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> also like to comment on the incredible wait staff. i had a restaurant.com giftcard for my husband<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> birthday dinner and i forgot that gratuity was already included. i tipped the waitress 20% on top of the already included 18% and she came back to tell me that i made a mistake. an honest, hardworking and wonderful addition to stripsteak. anytime i go back to vegas, i will definitely be visiting this restaurant!", 
            "one quote says it all \"the waygu <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> was the best steak i have ever had!\". this was from my dad after we finnished dinner last tuesday night. \n\neverything was perfection. we started with the complimentary duck fat fries. each type had it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> own mouthwatering flavors, but my dad<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> favorite was the truffle, while mine was the old bay seasoning with the herb sauce. yum. \n\nwe also ordered the fresh oysters. we were given the choice of east or west coast, and we chose the smaller, sweeter kusshi oysters from the west. they were perfect. the minuet sauce was fresh and paired with they perfectly. we then split a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>. i loved their dressing and how it came with a anchovie on the side. \n\nonto the steak. which is why you really need to come here in the first place. like i said, he ordered the waygu <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>, which if you read the other reviews is amazing. it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> rich and full of flavor. it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> waygu, so expect it to be a little fatty (but a good, full of flavor fatty). i ordered the filet, which was cooked just the way i like it. both were medium rare. the <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> had a nice charred crust on it which is another sign that it was cooked properly. \n\nthe sides - oh the sides! we ordered the trio of potato puree. horseradish, lobster, and sour cream & onion. my favorite was the horseradish becasue it think it pairs well with the meat. his favorite was the <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> nice big chunks of loster in it. basically to die for. we also had the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> which was another favorite. \n\nhonestly i can<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> say a bad thing about this meal. we finnsihed off a bottle of wine between the two of us. yes it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> expensive, but a nice steakhouse in vegas should be expensive! it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> all about the service, amazing food, and atmosphere. \n\ni wouldn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> hesitate to reccommend this place to all of my friends looking for a nice night out!", 
            "sometimes i wonder about people.  maybe my palate is different but some things i just don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> get.  the duck fat fries.....they were nothing special, they are friggin fries, come on people!  i think people get too caught up in the atmosphere and alleged reputation of places to form an honest opinion.   you ever see those shows where they swap the food at a fancy restaurant with some take out and people still think the food is fabulous and the best they<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> ever had?\n\nthis place was just average.  when i say average i mean average compared to comparable steakhouses.  it was by no means near the quality of sizzler but far from  what i would expect for the price i paid.  the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> was ter<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>.   the side dishes were actually pretty good, i had the scalloped potatoes.  i ordered a kansas city strip steak.  it was ok, somewhat flavorful but was still missing that \"wow factor\".   i was a bit disappointed considering the price.  you don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> always get what you pay for.  my rating of 3 stars is being very generous.\n\ni<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> had a better steak at bj<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>, yes bj<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>!  try their new york strip with bleu cheese garlic butter.  very good!", 
            "like the rest of vegas..overrated ...the fries were cold...and did not have the taste of duck fat!   the service was rushed...they want to get you out to get the next sucker in your table.   the mac and cheese was yucky..the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> was overdressed....and the stake was very salty and near raw!   skip this place!  not worth the price!", 
            "it has taken me a while to get to writing this review, but the experience i had was definitely worth noting. stripsteak is the restaurant i go to every time i go to vegas when i am looking for a great steak. i have dinned here at least a dozen times in the last few years and i have yet to have a bad meal or one that does not meet my expectations.\n\nthe last time i dined there was march second, just prior to the carrie underwood concert as part of my birthday weekend. the experience i had was exceptional! they were very accommodating and the service was spectacular. my parents and i started the evening in the lounge for a couple of happy hour drink specials prior to our seating (we arrived early and prior to the opening of the main dining room). the happy hour drinks were well priced.\n\nonce the main dining room opened, we were promptly seated by the hostess and our server was present to attend to us. he was exceptional with any questions that my parents had and dietary requests were received well and honored by the kitchen.the duck fat fries are a nice change to the regular bread and butter offerings of most restaurants.  we ordered a bottle of joseph phelps opus one wine for our dinner and it was exceptional, but also costly... the wine list is exceptional for a steak house.\n\nwell all had appetizers of salad. i always get the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> (presentation changes every time) and the the kansas city striploin steak. my parents opted for a filet. all steaks cooked to perfection. we shared a couple of side dishes at the table and were also excellent.\n\nwe opted for a desert beverages as opposed to deserts. i opted for the adult root bear float, which was likely kaluha and galliano with  a scoop of ice cream... nice and refreshing. though, as it was a birthday weekend, i did receive a complementary plate of ices cream with \"happy birthday\" written in chocolate sauce.\n\nthere was an element of sticker shock with a tab of over $1,000.00, but worth the celebration of a milestone birthday.", 
            "another amazing steakhouse, michael mina has outdone himself here. we were seated right away and congratulated several times for celebrating our anniversary. their was even a card on the table from the manger/head chef, definitely first class. our server was extraordinary, she knew the menu like the back of her hand. \n\nbefore we even ordered our dinner, a trio plater of duck fat fries delivered, truffle fries with a truffle aioli, garlic parmesan fries with sriracha ketchup and seasoned fries with garlic mustard remoulade. amazing!!!!!!\n\ni ordered the fresh corn soup, it was good, not amazing but good. they delivered a plate with charred corn, edamame, popcorn and a <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> puppy. then the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>, very good and presented nice.\n\nsides were amazing, out of this world good. the creamed corn is perfect, not to much cream so you can still taste the corn. the truffle mac & cheese is just plain amazing and tasty with the black truffle. \n\nthen came the world wide wagyu, 3 ounces of japanese a5 <mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark>, 4 ounces of an <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> and 4 ounces of australian short rib. well worth the cost. the filet and <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> were the best i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> ever had, the short <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> ok but not my fav.\n\nwe passed on desert because we were too full when with the bill came a bag of their famous popcorn did too. yum", 
            "the food is always tasty at strip steak.  however, the portions have gotten smaller and the prices have risen.\n\nthe free appetizers of french fries cooked in duck fat with exotic dipping sauces is a redeeming value.  but for a party of 7 they only brought 2 servings and then wanted to charge us for more.  if we were single diners, we each would have received one?  so why be so cheap?\n\neverything is ala carte - main courses require sides to make them a complete meal.  this really jacks up the price.  \n<mark>Caesar Salad</mark> around $15 was small.  the $65 <mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> was ordered rare with seared outside - it was delivered cooked entirely through.  small in size and cooked incorrectly.\n\nthe spinach side dish is awesome as are the sliced au gratin potatoes.\n\noverall, i was disappointed compared to my visit a few years ago."

            "i arrived before my sis-in-heart to celebrate her birthday. i mentioned the occasion so that we could have a table that wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> stuck in the midst of a bunch of tourists, nor did i want to sit near the bar; we wanted to take our time and enjoy the evening. when the hostess sat us, she found for us a table sort of center-stage... in other words, we could see everything going on and had a fantastic view of the whole place.\n\nas soon as we sat down, we were offered water and a wine list and the restaurant week menu. as that is how my sis chose this place, we were just fine with that idea.\n\nwe also noticed a birthday card from the staff. de<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark>, people, de<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark>!\n\ngetting to the good stuff (well, mostly):\n\nduck-fat fries (3.5/5) - the truffled fries were amazing but their accompanying bleu cheese sauce was bland and boring. the herbed fries were, ironically, refreshing, with a simple ketchup (keep it simple, stripsteak!). the last one, i can<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> remember what it was, was good with the grain mustard sauce (the best sauce offered, just flavorful enough without putting off people [my sis] who don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> like mustard). \n\n<mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark> sliders (1.5/5) - ordered off the main menu as an extra, we originally wanted the <mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark> they list as an extra. we were told it was a single piece, but if we order the sliders there are 2. ok, we thought, we<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> try it. spoiler alert! it was still a single piece, just sliced in half. this made it too thin, overcooked, and dry. the bread (i tasted it, to be fair) was dry and pretty bland. the garnishes were ok. a single piece of arugula and a bright little cherry gelee of sorts. overall, high hopes dashed.\n\nduck <mark>Crab Spring Rolls</mark> (3.5/5) - generous portion and, i was happily surprised, not too heavy. the wrapper was thin and crispy, although a tad (a smidgeon?) too oily. again, however, it was not heavy. the crisp veggies did well to set off the richness of the duck. the meat was well seasoned and had a great flavor. it was a bit dry in spots. i am going to blame presentation and delivery (heat lamps?) versus cooking as it was mostly at the cut edges of the rolls.\n\nheirloom tomato salad (8/5, yes, seriously) - fresh, fresh tomatoes, creamy, rich burrata cheese that didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> weight it down in any way, and the perfect amount of a tangy, sweet, beautiful 25-year old balsamic vinegar that has had me drooling for the past 12 hours.\n\n<mark>16 Oz Ny Strip</mark> (4/5) - slightly overcooked based on our order. we were a bit surprised as the server said they tend to undercook slightly... still, it was a fantastic cut of meat, very well seasoned, and perfectly tender and flavorful. the sides of sauteed mushrooms (another 8/5) and creamed corn with jalapeno (4/5) were great complements.\n\n<mark>Mary<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> Free Range Roasted Chicken</mark> (4/5) - a tad on the dry side in places, the overall dish was fabulous. i love that they left the skin on; i don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> eat the skin, but it imparted a rich flavor to the meat and left those portions really juicy and tender. the truffled mac n<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> (4/5) was really good. almost too much truffle, not enough cheese, and because it was used as the bed for the chicken, it picked up other flavors (meat, greens, sauces) that detracted from it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> own amazing profile.\n\nvanilla bean creme brulee and biegnets (5/5) - the brulee was creamy, perfectly flavored, and delicious. the biegnets were expertly fried, hot and cripsy and dusted with powered sugar without being overly dressed. another de<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> we thought was fantastic, sis<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> dessert came out presented with the words happy birthday in a sweet, dark chocolate!\n\nwines (5/5, nail on the head every time). we started with a pinot gris and a viogner, then with the help of gabriel, the sommelier, chose a fruity, dry-ish oregon pinot noir to go with the meal. we spoke for a moment on trying something new, price points, and flavor profiles (what we liked and what we ordered). given the whole picture, his recommendation was well received and the perfect wine for everything we ate.\n\nthe service was good, though the server could have visited us a little more often. there were a few large parties so we were happy to wait a little here and there, and as other staff were also happy to smile, ask if you needed anything, and be of service, it was not a dark spot at all. \n\nall in all, a solid, enjoyable meal.\n\nwith the restaurant week menu (50.11 each), the 2 wines by the glass and the bottle, plus the additional <mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark>, our total was $300 and change. bonus tip: they are on restaurant.com so another $50 saved!",

(that act alone makes him a keeper!)  once i cut into my newly acquired beef, i was enjoying my medium rare slice with everyone else.  \n\n* mac & cheese \"truffled\" ($12) - yes, it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> all that and a bag of chips.  so creamy and good, and not just a hint of the truffle, but it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> all over! so yum!  worth ordering on its own.\n\n* scalloped potatoes \"caramelized onion & goat cheese\" ($12) - the onions give this dish a sweetness that complements the goat cheese and potatoes.  \n\n* potato puree trio \"lobster, sour cream & onion, horseradish\" ($14) - my personal fave over the other potato dish.  with so many variations of mashed potatoes, how can one not like them.  very smooth, creamy, and just something you want to eat all to yourself.\n\n* creamed corn \"jalapeno\" - i guess we needed some kind of vegetable to offset our meal.  a slight bit of heat from the pepper and it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> more creamy goodness.\n\n* beignets \"chocolate pot de creme, macallan 18 year butterscotch pudding, madagascar vanilla creme brulee\" - take a spoon to the cr\\u00e8me brulee and forget the beignets, just hog the pot to yourself.  dipping wise, i liked the chocolate over the butterscotch in this case.\n\n* coconut candy bar \"caramel ice cream, toasted almonds\" ($12) - a very fancy candy bar that<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> super sweet, and perfect for sharing.\n\n* cucumber martini - surprisingly better than other cucumber martinis out there, good enough that everyone at my table was having one because they are that good.\n\n* cherry caiprihana - the husband enjoyed this signature drink of theirs as well, and the cherry adds a unique taste to the caiprihana.\n\nthe service at strip steak was probably among the best.  there<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> a team waiting on you, and they work as a team - with not just clearing dishes, but bringing your orders in and chatting it up with you.  one of the more personal and better customer service experiences i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> had in awhile.  michael mina obviously knows what he<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> doing with his food and his staff.  it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> no wonder there<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> a cult following of his restaurants.  they also have restrooms within the restaurant, which is a nice touch.

            "the scene: 18 of my closest friends and me for my birthday party.  september 2015\n\nthe menu: the \"holstein\" pre-set dinner menu (with upgrades)\n\nwe all get it - vegas is pricey.  but instead of paying $30-$50 for what amounts to fancy dorm food at a buffet, i decided to live it up a bit for my birthday.  therefore, months of planning led to this epic dinner.\n\nfirst of all, given the sheer size of my party, i knew there would be some small issues.  stripsteak does not have a private dining area, but they set up a nice table for my guests.  the ambiance was perfect for my type of outing - trendy, and cer<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> upscale without being stuffy, where you would have to worry about using the wrong fork and be without another for the rest of your night, as punishment.  i would probably give 4 stars as an individual rating for the \"value\" of the set-up vs. what it cost, but then there was...the food.\n\nahh yes, the food.  what really matters.\n\nfirst of all, pretty much everything at stripsteak is served with complimentary duck fat fries.  deliciously crisp and decadent, and accompanied by 3 dipping sauces (but good enough to not require any accompaniment.)  now here<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> a little secret - still have a small ghetto streak in me where i like my fries served with my steak, so it was a little strange to have these as an appetizer, but surely a great way to start off the meal.\n\nper their menu, my group had the choice of salad or a shrimp cock<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> appetizer, entree of <mark>10 Oz Prime Flat Iron</mark> steak, chicken, or salmon (i have no idea how the non-steak items tasted.)  upgrades to <mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark> or <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> were available.  and given the decadence of my spending, an upgrade for sure was necessary.  (more on that below.)  additionally, sides were served \"family style.\"  broccolini, pureed potatoes of three flavors (sour cream and chive, lobster, and i can<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> remember the other), and truffle mac and cheese.  the truffle mac and cheese was the highlight for many of my guests (the ones that didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> order steak.)\n\nahh yes, the steak.  peruse their menu and you will see that michael mina doesn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> drive to a corner butcher to get his cuts.  with all respect to usda grading of beef, this night required a little international flavor...in the form of...\n\nworld wide wagyu.\n\nanyone who has done steak research knows that japanese beef is luxurious but also a curiosity.  \"kobe sliders\" at your local bar and grill for $12 have more in common with an aging basketball player than they do true kobe beef.  even cows that are designated \"wagyu\" may not be imported from japan.  so, this mini world tour consisted of three cuts of wagyu (beef derived from a line of japanese cows that are bred in other countries.)  these cuts:\n\n<mark><mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> . Australian Wagyu</mark> <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> - <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> is the new trendy top cut of meat.  it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> generally the best couple ounces of your <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark>, made even better when it comes from a well-marbled <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>.  this cut had a perfect sear and set all my umami sensors afire.\n\n<mark><mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> . Australian Wagyu</mark> short rib - tender, fall-apart, as if it were braised.  (i didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> check to see if it was actually braised short <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not.)  \n\nfinally, real japanese \"a5\" grade wagyu <mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark>.  a5 is the highest grading that <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> have in japan, based on beef yield, color, and the all-important marbling score.  i wish i could have seen a photo of it before it was cooked, to visualize all the delicious marbling.  after cooking, it tasted like pure meat butter.  delicious.\n\nafter a meal like this, i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not sure if i can ever go back to eating steaks even at fancy local steakhouses.  of the three, i am declaring the <mark><mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> . Australian Wagyu</mark> <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> the winner in an ever so slight margin over the japanese a5 filet (though, likely, just because it was <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>).  the australian came in third, but was still delicious.  wagyu, you may have ruined me for life!  thank you, stripsteak, for introducing me to it and making me an addict.  \n\nthank you also for an incredible birthday with a ridiculously good meal.",

            "i hope to get through this review without drooling all over my laptop. \n\nso i chose this place for my boyfriend<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> 30th birthday dinner, and it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> one of those happy occasions where i cannot imagine a better choice.  as soon as we sat down in the plush chairs in the middle of the gorgeous but unpretentious dining room, and picked up the happy birthday card the establishment had written out to my beau, it felt right.\n\nthen we started sipping the best cock<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> we<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> ever had.  birthday boy tried the claymore, an intriguing blend of scotch, elderflower syrup, and lambic beer. sounded flat-out weird, but was out-of-this-world good. just a little sweet and you could totally taste the smoothness of that good scotch. \n\nbefore we order, we are presented with a trio of french fries with their own dipping sauces! herb with ketchup, duck fat with truffle sauce, and paprika with barbecue. i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> afraid i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> gonna bust out another superlative. i don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> wanna get discredited that way, but hot damn, these were best fries i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> ever had. specifically the duck fat and truffle sauce. what can i say about those fries? when you ate them, the world fell away. it was just you, the fried potato, and the truffle sauce.\n\nbirthday boy picked an appetizer that the server recommended: <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> bacon fritters wrapped in bibb lettuce with a m<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> lemon creme fraiche. not my thing at all, but he was quite content with it. \n\nmeahwhile, i reveled in a fantastical salad of tri-colored beets with burrata. do you know burrata? it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> a fresh mozzarella that<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> made molten with cream.  it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> hard to make, and its quite expensive. it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> often flaunted on a menu as the star of a dish, but then miniscule in portion compared to the other ingredients. not here, at stripsteak! i enjoyed two healthy-sized, mouth-watering balls of exquisite burrata, which were complimented just perfectly with the lightly dressed roasted beets. at $15, this was a deal. \n\nbetween the cock<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark>, beets, and fries, i probably didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> need to consume much more, but then our steaks came. we both ordered <mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark> ($54). there was nothing mignon about these steaks, they were enormous! i ordered mine \"rare- really rare\" and i was happy to see that the while the outside was seared dark, it was red and cold beyond a few millimeters. it was perfect. perfect, perfect, perfect. \n\nnow, at ruth chris and the like, the $8 sides of sauteed vegetables or <mark>Baked Potato</mark> remind you of the expensive wrappings and bows you have to buy for a wedding gift. a necessary accompaniment to the main event that makes it pretty and complete, but would be utterly useless and ridiculous if purchased on their own. \n\nthe sides here at stripsteak are not wrapping paper. you could bring a vegetarian to stripsteak and they would be just as happy with these sides as the carnivores with their meat. \n\ntruffled macaroni and cheese. **maniacal laugh heard here at the mention of this dish.** according to our server, the best thing on the menu. no arguments here!\n\nwe also had scalloped potatoes with goat cheese. giving the mac a run for its money.\n\nif that wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> enough gluttony to invoke wrath from the gods, we also had an accompaniment of <mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark>. each bite bursted with sinful flavor as it instantly melted on our tongues. \n \ni cannot express to you how blessed we were to be eating these side dishes. it was pure, unfettered bliss. this is comfort-food that grew up to be a gorgeous, confident gourmet. it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> the best of both worlds. \n\nwe played happily with combining these flavors. this bite is filet with truffled mac. this bite is filet with goat cheese. this bite is filet with a bit of the roasted shallot, the most delicious garnish in town. \n\nand then there was the moment that i realized \"hey! what about the trufffle dipping sauce from the fries? i bet that will taste good with the steak!\"\n\ni never thought i was going to be able to eat that enormous steak, but despite being at capacity, i ate and ate and ate until everything was gone. \n\nthe birthday boy chose beignets with chocolate mouse dipping sauce, not my thing, and then i happily paid the $300 bill. \n\nit was worth it.", 
            "my first fancy schmancy meal in vegas that wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> a buffet!\n\nit<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> near all the other fancy restaurants in mandalay bay.  the entrance is very open, glass windows that extend to the roof and you can see the whole restaurant just standing out side.  \n\nlarge cow carcasses hang from hooks in the fridge behind the glass by the kitchen.  i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> guessing these are the delicious ones that they<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> be hacking off for my order.\n\nthe host is formal; he pulls out my chair, hands me a menu, and places a napkin in my lap for me.  thanks guy.  i order the <mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark> (a la carte, as most of the menu items come), the beau orders the fried chicken w/mac & cheese.  meanwhile, compliments of the chef are 3 types of fries and corresponding sauces - truffle, bbq, and ketchup, as well as a small pan of potato foccacia.  the truffle fries won me over.  i could have eaten plenty more of those. \n\nhad i known that they were bringin out the fries and bread, i would have skipped ordering a side of asparagus, which had this citrussy glaze over it, bleh.  i didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> want it to be sweet :p  i also prefer my asparagus unpeeled; i think it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> crispier that way.\n\nwell, onto the steak; wow! that was easily the most tender, juicy and flavorful steak i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> ever experienced. yes, experienced.  it was that good.  i didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> think i could handle 10 ounces of it, but it was that good, tender inside, crusty with steak rub/seasoning on the outside and very lean around the edges, i tried the beau<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> chicken, too.  hyum :) was it juicy!  \n\nall in all, i was very pleased with our meal and the service.  i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> like to say i would return, but it was quite the expensive meal! not that it wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> worth it, but ... well, we<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> poor.", 
            "o-m-g!!  it was just like how it was in the scene from \"i love you man\" where peter just proposed to his fiance and she is sooo excited that she calls all of her friends to spread the good news of their engagement.  only, my similar experience occurred when i took my first bite of their complimentary seasoned fries with their special sauces did i realize that it was the beginning of a good thing.  i was impressed that they have manged to perfect french fries with garlic seasoning, bbq seasoning, and regular fries with a crispy outside and a soft center. \n\nbut, it wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> the fries that had me calling and texting all of my friends and family.  it was when i took the first bite of their special bone-in 14 oz <mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark> that was the taste of perfection.  it was this moment that i realized every <mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark> that i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> ever had was a lie because they never gave me the sensation of knowing that i might have just taken a bite out of the best tasting steak.... ever!!  our waitress, rachel, informed us that it was rare for them to have bone-in <mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark> as their specials.  she recommended it over their <mark><mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> . Australian Wagyu</mark> and 30oz porterhouse!!!  \n\ngranted that i have never paid $57 for a piece of meat a la carte, but i daresay that it was worth every penny of it!! mmmmm, it was soooo good!!  i can<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> even desc<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> into words how amazing this steak was, and i am a steak-lover!!  every new bite of this steak was a surprise because i couldn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> believe how amazing it was, and it was a constant reminder of the flavorful amazing taste with each and every bite until the last piece.  \n\ni was a bit disheartened when my steak was near completion, since that meant that i didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> have anymore left... despite how full i was.  its like reading a really good book and not wanting to reach the last pages because one knew that it would over after those pages.  you didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> want to reach the end of the book since it was soo good, one just wants to keep reading it.... just like how i wanted to keep eating.  it was that good!!!  five stars all the way!!!  \n\nthe bf had their prix-fix $45 clam chowder, prime <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> with three sides, and their amazing chocolate beignets!!  the chocolate beignets  (french donuts) were amazing, but still did not compare to my steak!!   i will definitely need to start saving money just so that i can eat here every time that i am in vegas!!  i gotta start a steak fund!!  hence the reason that i was calling and texting everyone about the amazingness of this steak, i hope they can submit their donations to me soon. =wink=", 
            "this is a fantastic, modern steak-house. i ate here for dinner recently during a visit to vegas for a friends birthday. the service here is outstanding---everyone is friendly, helpful, and on the ball. they even gave my friend (the birthday boy) a birthday note. additionally, the manager sent me a follow up email the next day to thank my party for the visit! \n\non to the meal: we were given two free appetizers---french fries cooked in duck fat, with various dipping sauces, and warm bread with rosemary. both delicious! i ordered off the pre-fix menu (appetizer, entree and desert for $55) and had the crab soup, rib-<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>, and creme broule---all delicious. the steak was cooked perfectly medium rare and was one of the best steaks i have ever eaten. the bday boy had the kobe burger and also said it was fantastic. my boyfriend had the <mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark>, which he said was great. one of the best parts of the meal was the mac n<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> the bday boy ordered as a side dish. i highly recommend ordering this treat---it will be hard to return to that old staple, kraft, after you have eaten this!! \n\noverall: great steak, friendly service, beautiful atmosphere!\n\ntip: i had a restaurant.com $50 gift certificate that we used towards our meal. restaurant.com often has sales, and gift certs are generally 60-80% off. thus, i got my $50 gift cert. for $4! good deal! it really helped lower the cost of the bill, as it is quite an expensive place.", 
            "vegas never fails...and the concierge at the hotel at mandalay bay deserves a raise after recommending this restaurant. my mom was having a craving for prime <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> strip steak was where we were told we had to have it! \n\nwe arrived promptly for our reservations at 10pm. i was already on a happy high from seeing the jersey boys (best show on earth) but wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> as hungry as i thought. they gave us complimentary duck fries (amazing) so after i was done eating those, i knew that i didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> want a big meal. my mom ended up having the prime rib...which reminded more of a <mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark>. it was cooked to perfection. and she also ordered onion rings...which i couldn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> stop gobbling up. (yes i was eating off her plate...but she allowed me to. in fact, we ended up splitting the meal and they didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> charge us for an extra plate.) i ended up ordering 1/2 dozen oysters (can<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> get off this oyster kick) which were just as amazing as the ones i had the night prior at the aria. top that off with the best vodka and tonic (i was drunk after one....) i was in heaven. \nstripsteak was the best way to end such a memorable night. can<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> wait to go back.",

            "i would actually give this place 4 1/2 stars, but it falls just short of being perfect. to start, our server was excellent. she was spot on for all of her recommendations and descriptions. her wine recommendation, which i think was the house cabernet sauvignon, was fantastic. i had the kobe <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>, my other dinner mates had the kobe <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark>, <mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark>, and scallops. my steak was cooked nicely med-rare, and tasted amazing with fantastic marbling. however, it seemed like the other steaks were cooked just a bit less than requested. you can taste the mesquite wood flavor in the meat, although i didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> think it enhanced the flavor too much. the starter duck fat fries are excellent, as is the <mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark> slider appetizer. the truffle mac and cheese is a must try. the mushrooms were a little salty (maybe they<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> supposed to be), but had good mushroom flavor. at the end of the meal, we were too stuffed to try any desserts, but their coffee was a perfect finish to a very nice meal.", 
            "this place is freaking delicious\n\ni went for a company dinner--so you know i got to eat everything possible! for appetizers we had tiger prawns, lettuce cups, and fries as appetizers. they were all very good. flavorful and nicely seasoned\n\nas much as i wanted to abs<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> from beef because i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> been feeling a little heavy lately, i had to get the steak--i mean, the place is called stripsteak for christ<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> sake! i had the 10oz <mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark> (medium rare) and it was cooked to perfection. i think that was the best cooked steak i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> ever had. melted in my mouth like butter!\n\nfor sides, we had the potato puree trio, spinach, and roasted mushrooms. the spinach wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> anything special, but the roasted mushrooms were great. the potato puree was a little \"pureed\" for me, and maybe i had a little bit too much alcohol in me, so it didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> sit quite well in my stomach--but it was ok. \n\nfor dessert, we had a trio of ice cream (chocolate ice cream was amazingggg), strawberry shortcake (really good), a blueberry custard (this is good if you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not into anything overly sweet), and some sort of chocolate concoction. wish i could desc<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> the desserts better, but they don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> have the dessert menu up. \n\noverall, great place, good food, but it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> pretty pricey, but i think the meal is well worth it.", 
            "i ordered the <mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark>. steak was a little too salty and cooked just passed medium rare. \n\ni also had asparagus and the scalloped potatoes, they were both drizzled with a white sauce which was ok tasting. the complimentary fries cooked in duck fat were a nice snack before my meal but will pass on a return visit.", 
            "so i decided to give in and try a fancy schmancy place on the strip over the weekend. usually i try to avoid restaurants on the strip because they<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> overcrowded, overpriced and in general the wait is to long. luckily i had to join my friend as she was meeting a group at stripsteak for happy hour. \n\nwalking up to the restaurant, we were generously greeted by the assistant gm miss ashley and the rest of her hosting staff. our group was easily accommodated since the happy hour was pretty dead. according to miss ashley, that was rare on a saturday night. to me, it was luck because i would then be able to assess a fair review on this place. \n\nthe bar area is fairly small, i would say that the big comfy purple seats do tend to take up a lot of space within that bar area that it really wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> an ideal place for a group of 8 to be sitting. plus we made it a little difficult for the wait staff to maneuver around. their happy hour drink & food menu is reasonably priced. i would highly recommend their specialty, the cucumber martinish drink, it was quite refreshing and a great summertime drink. and this means a lot since i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> more of a beer drinker. the raspberry lemonade & mojitos were just ok, maybe a little to weak, but again that<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> just my opinion. \n\nmy friend and i decided to try dinner so we asked the staff for a table in the dining area and were quickly accommodated. right away we were greeted with complimentary duck fries, which we also had ordered during happy hour. these fries are cooked in duck fat so don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> worry it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not any crazy duck part, which i would have hoped for. there are three different rings of fries - paprika smoked, truffle and garlic parmesan. the sauces were just ok, it was the general concept of ketchup, bbq sauce and truffle aioli but of course more upscale. i preferred to munch on the suckers without any of the sauces. \n\nour waiter, steve, was awesome. he highly recommended the <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> & <mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark>, along with a side of truffle mac & cheese and honestly it was phenomenal. the <mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark> was perfectly cooked (medium rare) and just melted in your mouth. the <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>, which is the end part of the <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark>, was seasoned and cooked perfectly. the truffle mac & cheese was definitely the best truffle mac & cheese i have experienced in a while. most tend to be dry but this one was moist and also had pieces of broccoli that it never lost it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> flavor. we also had a side of asparagus with a horseradish blanc sauce. i couldn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> complain about anything. at first i laughed at the portion size but then as we kept eating i was actually pretty full. also it might have been the alcohol we had prior to dinner! and me not knowing if you are allowed to take a doggy bag from such places, found the inner strength to finish our food, it truly was like a scene out of man vs food. \n\nbut wait, we weren<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> done! wth? steve charmed us into trying dessert, i figured what the heck, let<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> go all out! we ordered the beignets with their chocolate butterscotch pudding. whew! i think i was getting drunk off the pudding, i might have been able to light a fire. however, the beignets were soft and moist and perfectly fried. \n\noverall the ambiance of stripsteak is great, perfect for a date or just to people watch from the bar. it did tend to get busier as the night progressed. yes it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> quite pricey but honesty i have to say it was the best experience i have had in a while at a strip restaurant. michael mina did a phenomenal job with this place and all the employees were great. to see the agm serving drinks, chatting with customers, waiting on guests, cleaning tables and bringing out checks says a lot about the employee morale. she helped making the dining experience that much better.\n\nthe only thing i would say is that yes the meat platters need to have a little more presentation. maybe had a sprig of rosemary or something, just to give it a little more color and pizzazz.. \n\nfood for thought - 1) make sure you have reservations 2) make sure you give yourself enough time to have dinner as our evening lasted over 4 hours 3) if you can<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> stomach rich food, be aware that some of their steaks are cooked with butter. yay for tums! 4) all sides are al a carte so expect to pay over $100 for a 2 person dinner.", 
            "steak here is quite bomb-good! it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> a michael mina restaurant, so his signature style is interpreting an ingredient in 3 different preparations and flavors. so i was excited when this came out first while we decide on drinks.\n\ntrio of duck fat fries (comp amuse) - 5 stars\n1. smoked paprika and mustard fries w/a smoked paprika and mustard cr\\u00e8me fra\\u00eeche dip \n2. truffle fries with a truffle a\\u00efoli dip\n3. rosemary and onion fries with an onion ketchup dip\n\ni love french fries and these were cooked right. fresh potatoes were cut and fried to perfection. the exterior was crispy and the inside was soft with a richer taste coz of the duck fat.\n\nour table didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> get the 2nd complimentary dish, the olive oil focaccia. i should have asked, but i wanted to save room for steak.\n\nstrip-pear ($13) - 4 stars\ni chose the strip-pear martini. it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> made with grey goose la poire (anjou pear flavored vodka), lychee puree (instead of the usual pear puree) and fresh lime juice. pear was the main flavor with a hint of lychee. it was sweet and medium strong... nice.\n\nother drinks we got were: guinness ($8), stella artois ($8), new castle ($7) and lustau solera ($13).\n\n18oz dry-aged bone-<mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> ($51) - 4 stars\n10oz <mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark> ($54) - 4.5 stars\nall of our steaks came out medium/high warm. note, after grilling steaks need to rest for the juices redist<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>. both steaks were super tasty and tender with a smokey and peppery finish. all 4 (1 <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> and 3 filets) steaks were cooked perfectly as requested. \n\nthe plate presentation is simple: steak, a whole roasted shallot and yellow pepper and garnished with a small sprig of thyme. no fluffy presentation for the main dish. there<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> room on the plate to place your sides.  it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> a steakhouse after all.\n\ni asked out server how the steaks are cooked and she said, \"they<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> poached then grilled and basted with a wine butter.\" i did some research to get the de<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> of how they cook their steaks.\n\nstep 1: steaks are placed in slow-poaching chambers, which enhances flavor and tenderness. the meat heats for several hours at a low temperature. \n\nstep 2: steaks are then grilled on a cast iron grill above mesquite wood. the wood gives every cut of steak a nice subtle smokiness.\n\npotato puree trio ($14)  - 4 stars\nanother trio dish we ordered. the 3 flavors were: horseradish, <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> sour cream. the puree was seasoned nicely. all of the purees were smooth, rich and creamy. \n\nbacon-<mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> ($10) - 4 stars\nthe crowd fav was the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>. it was made with spinach, heavy cream, shallot, garlic, butter, nutmeg, s&p and topped with bacon crumbs.\n\npassion fruit panna cotta ($12) - 4 stars\npassion fruit pieces, red grape fruit, thin slices of avocado, and coconut sorbet sit atop the panna cotta. the panna cotta itselft was refreshing, light and subtle sweet. the avocado gave the dessert extra creaminess and weight. while the grapefruit and coconut sorbet gave it a tart and sweet pairing.\n\nmilk chocolate custard ($12) - 3.5 stars\nsmall red velvet cake pieces, powder sugar, toasted pecans, cocoa nib ice cream lay on top of the chocolate custard. this dessert was smooth and rich like a very thick pudding. the topping provided a nice contrast.\n\ni was so full by the end of dinner. anyhow, the steak dinner was a nice way to close out our weekend of vegas fun. cost for a party of 4 with tax was $335 (alcohol $49, steaks $213, sides $24 and dessert $24). \n\nreduce costs by 1) get alkie during happy hour 4-7pm at the bar, 2) non-big eaters share a steak or 3) order the prix fixe menu 3-courses for $55. prix fixe only offers chicken or prime rib. \n\noverall, my experience was good. it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> better than all of the chain steakhouses: fleming<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>, ruth<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> chris, morton<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>, blt steak, etc. next steakhouses, i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> like to try is mastro<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> and cut.",

            "four of us went to dinner here on a friday night.  we were seated quickly and greeted by our waiter who left us the wine list and then did not return for at least 15 minutes.  we finally got up to ask for help and then our order was taken.  an hour later our first course was brought out and 30 minutes after that we received our main course.  so, in a place where our meal for four (with their 3 course special and a bottle of wine) cost $400 it took an hour and a <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> eat.  the place was not full and we saw our waiter only about 4 times throughout that hour and a half.  we did complain to the manager who comped part of our meal, although she seemed to think the wait was not excessive.  the food was also not up to par for the cost.  two people ordered the rib-<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> both were disappointed.  the other two ordered the <mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark> which was much better. i can only afford places this expensive occasionally, but i have been to several others at the same price point and quality/service was exceptional.  so, i would not return here.  there are many better places elsewhere to get good steaks for this price in vegas.", 
            "this is a lovely steak house located in mandalay bay with great decor, excellent service, and a classy ambiance.  so why 2 stars?  quite frankly, our steaks were incorrectly prepared.\n\nfirst some background: i make a middling 5 figure salary, so i can<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> afford to eat $60 steaks very often.  but when i do, it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> usually worth every penny.  i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> happily dropped $300 on a single meal because it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> difficult to find world-class beef that is expertly aged and prepared.\n\ni ordered the <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> medium and my fiancee had the <mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark> medium-well (each is currently $59), we had the spicy zucchini and asparagus sides, and we ordered two glasses of michael mina<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> cabernet.  when our steaks arrived, i was bitterly disappointed to find that my <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> was overcooked, somewhere between medium-well and well-done (no trace of pink whatsoever), while my fiancee<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> filet was completely well-done.  \n\nour vegetable sides were about quantity over quality: i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not sure how many fistfuls of zucchini and asparagus is customary for two people, but the zucchini was hardly spicy and the asparagus was elementary.  i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> cer<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> i could<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> made either side at home blindfolded.\n\nall the work that goes into designing and executing such a beautiful restaurant flies out the window the instant the chef overcooks your steak.  when the apex of your evening on the town is your dinner, and the keystone of your dinner is your incorrectly prepared steak, it puts a damper on your mood.  i am not one to send back food, mostly because it irreparably throws off the timing of the meal, but when i mentioned to our server the problem with our steaks, she informed us that lately customers had been complaining that their steaks were undercooked.  she had received authorization from the manager to give us complimentary desserts, but we declined.\n\nplease keep in mind that the quality of the beef was superb, and the pacing of the meal was comfortable.  we were treated very well, and the wine was satisfying.  this review is not about the price nor the value for your money.  it is simply about two overcooked steaks and two underwhelming sides.  at this level, there is no room for error.",

(no problem) 10 mins goes by and nobody is yet to stop by our table. finally the same host saw that we hadn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> been helped. so he brings up a dinner and drink menu. takes our order for the drink and they come. now we are just back to sitting around waiting for our server to come by.  i then pull out my cell phone and start the stopwatch on it. 23 mins later our server comes by. proceeds to tell us about the menu. at this point my wife and i had 33 mins to decide on what we wanted for dinner. we were ready to order. we place our order and move on. the food finally comes out (another server brings it to us). i had to ask that server for the fries that come on the house because our server never came back or brought them. i ordered the 16oz <mark>16 Oz Ny Strip</mark> and my wife ordered the <mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark>. my steak was \"good\" at best, cer<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> wasnt a usda prime steak. we shared the potatoe gratin. that was about the only good thing about this place. i could go on but i was very disapointed in everything at stripsteak. i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> stick to my local place, peterson<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> steakhouse in indianapolis.",

(more on that below.)  additionally, sides were served \"family style.\"  broccolini, pureed potatoes of three flavors (sour cream and chive, lobster, and i can<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> remember the other), and truffle mac and cheese.  the truffle mac and cheese was the highlight for many of my guests (the ones that didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> order steak.)\n\nahh yes, the steak.  peruse their menu and you will see that michael mina doesn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> drive to a corner butcher to get his cuts.  with all respect to usda grading of beef, this night required a little international flavor...in the form of...\n\nworld wide wagyu.\n\nanyone who has done steak research knows that japanese beef is luxurious but also a curiosity.  \"kobe sliders\" at your local bar and grill for $12 have more in common with an aging basketball player than they do true kobe beef.  even cows that are designated \"wagyu\" may not be imported from japan.  so, this mini world tour consisted of three cuts of wagyu (beef derived from a line of japanese cows that are bred in other countries.)  these cuts:\n\n<mark><mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> . Australian Wagyu</mark> <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> - <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> is the new trendy top cut of meat.  it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> generally the best couple ounces of your <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark>, made even better when it comes from a well-marbled <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>.  this cut had a perfect sear and set all my umami sensors afire.\n\n<mark><mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> . Australian Wagyu</mark> short rib - tender, fall-apart, as if it were braised.  (i didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> check to see if it was actually braised short <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not.)  \n\nfinally, real japanese \"a5\" grade wagyu <mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark>.  a5 is the highest grading that <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> have in japan, based on beef yield, color, and the all-important marbling score.  i wish i could have seen a photo of it before it was cooked, to visualize all the delicious marbling.  after cooking, it tasted like pure meat butter.  delicious.\n\nafter a meal like this, i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not sure if i can ever go back to eating steaks even at fancy local steakhouses.  of the three, i am declaring the <mark><mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> . Australian Wagyu</mark> <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> the winner in an ever so slight margin over the japanese a5 filet (though, likely, just because it was <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>).  the australian came in third, but was still delicious.  wagyu, you may have ruined me for life!  thank you, stripsteak, for introducing me to it and making me an addict.  \n\nthank you also for an incredible birthday with a ridiculously good meal."

            "for my girlfriend<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> first big vegas trip, i decided on stripsteak and will have a hard time going anywhere else from now on. must say the service was top notch from the first second we arrived and carried through to every team member that assisted us. we had the angus <mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark> and <mark>16 Oz Ny Strip</mark>, the filet was the best i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> ever eaten; not a bit left on the plate. my date<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> strip steak was very tender, just right. gotta throw some fuel on the \"duck fat fries\" fire because they were spot on. great service and even better food is my idea of fine dining. will be returning.", 
            "on my most recent trip to vegas, i made stripsteak my steakhouse to try.  i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> been to delmonicos, charlie palmers, and cut which were all way better then stripsteak.\n\nfirst off the restaurant has a hip and modern feel.  the one thing i noticed that i really didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> like was how crowded the room is.  the tables are basically one on top of another, not much spacing at all.  on to the food.\n\nfirst came the trio of duck fat fries.  i was looking forward to the them but came out underwhelmed.  they tasted like french fries.  they were good fries but did not understand all the hype.  next i ordered the crab cake appetizer.  2 pcs filled with dungeness crab fried up like a hush puppy.. it was decent but nothing spectacular.  i found too many shell fragments in the crab cake.  maryland style crab cakes are way better.  for the main course i ordered the 6 oz japanese a5 <mark>16 Oz Ny Strip</mark>, grillled <mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark>, and truffled mac & cheese.  the steak was perfectly cooked and melted in your mouth.  it came with a yuzu dipping sauce on the side which added nothing to the steak.  the one thing i didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> like was that it was way over seasoned. (for a $185 piece of meat it should be perfect)  the foie was good not great.  the mac & cheese was pretty good.  with all the components being so rich, i didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> have room for dessert.\n\nservice was decent.  i was not offered the potato foccacia bread.  not sure if this was because i was solo but i didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> make a fuss about it because i honestly wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> as hungry as i wanted to be because of brunch earlier in the day.  this was my first time at a michael mina restaurant and i came away unimpressed.  i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> try another one of his restaurants before passing final judgment but this is probably the one and only time i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> eat at stripsteak", 
            "steak? yes please!\n\ni can<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> get enough of good ol red meat. i have tried the lamb, <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> and <mark>16 Oz Ny Strip</mark> here. all to die for and all cooked to perfection. what sold me more than any of that were the sides. they were the best part of my meal. that<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> hard to do when there<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> a nice juicy steak sitting in front of me, but the brussel sprouts, mushrooms and french fries stole the show. \n\nall delicious, all the time. the vibe here is pretty great too. perfect for out of town guests, a date with your honey or a family night out. this place is versatile and has a great atmostphere. the servers are all really friendly and helpful too. come for happy hour, it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> pretty groovy.\n\ndefinitely worth a trip to the strip.", 
            "in vegas for a sales conference this past weekend, and after the never ending business buffets exhausted my patience, i was ready for a night out and a good meal. nobody however wanted to leave the hotel, so we decided on shall i say they decided on \"stripsteak\" at mandalay bay.  i tried hard to talk them out of this as i had eaten here about 2 years ago with 8 people and it was absolutely hor<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>, but they insisted. with that said i am very happy they talked me out of it as this experience was completely different from our previous visit.\n\n1st off ambiance wise you can<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> beat the place. very trendy yet elegant. service staff spot on. complimentary appetizer - trio of duck fat fries\neach meal is preceded by a complimentary order of the trio of duck fat fries.  the trio includes:\n\n1.  paprika and mustard fries accompanied with a mustard cr\\u00e8me dip\n2. truffle fries accompanied with truffle a\\u00efoli dip\n3. rosemary and onion fries accompanied with onion ketchup dip\nthe truffle fries great and the best of the 3 but nice touch instead of the regular bread & butter. \n\nonward we go. glasses of wine ordered as nobody wanted the same thing, and a bit pricey per glass but nice selection. \n\n3 of us tonight so it was 3 steaks and two sides i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> keep it simple.\n\na: kc bone in <mark>16 Oz Ny Strip</mark> charred medium. (cooked to perfection)tasty, moist, juicy, a 10 on the steak scale.\n\nb: <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> charred medium (see above perfection)\n\nc.  slow poached prime <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> the weakest of the 3 but still very good, not as thick as i would have preferred if i was ordering it.\n\nsides truffle mac & cheese & bacon cream spinach\n\nspinach \"great\" simply stated\n\ntruffle mac & cheese great except for one thing, no mention of broccoli in this dish yet it had pieces of it and i hate broccoli. taste was exceptional aside from the unwanted greens.\n\nno deserts...  a quick meal with excellent service, super food in great ambiance..  won a few bucks at the dice table afterwards to pay for this thing....", 
            "we went to celebrate my husband<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> birthday, a fact that i didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> think he<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> communicate when he made the reservation.  we<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not big meat eaters, but, hey, you can only take so much chicken before you start sprouting feathers.\n\ni lost count of the number of staff who wished him a happy birthday, from the hostess when we arrived, to the hostess when we left, and all manner of staff before, during and after the meal.  and there was the happy birthday card on the table, and the tiny dessert with a birthday candle at the end.\n\nwe started with the amuse-bouche fries - three kittle cups with different seasonings with three paired dips.  i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not a fry freak, but i have to admit i just couldn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> stop, even with all the salt (i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> giving up on complaining about salt, which is just too pervasive in restaurants).\n\nboth of us ordered the <mark>16 Oz Ny Strip</mark>, and it was good enough to make me a meat eater.  perfectly cooked.  juicy.  tender.  we ordered asparagus in horseradish beurre blanc and the truffled mac & cheese as our sides.  the asparagus was fabulous.  but the mac & cheese, which they<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> famous for, was just too rich for my taste.  i know i would<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> been happier with the scalloped potatoes, but hubby wanted to try the mac, and it was his birthday, so...  besides, i was too full from the complimentary fries to even get through the steak, so it was no problem to eschew (pun intended) the macaroni.\n\nthe service was terrific - not elegant, because this is a casual place, and that<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> just the way i like it.\n\nmy one nit-let about this very stylish space is the chairs.  they<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> very comfy, upholstered arm chairs.  but the arms are as high as the table tops, so i couldn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> sit as close to the table as i like.  it made the comfortable seating a bit uncomfortable for petite moi.  but not so much that i wouldn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> go back.  maybe for my birthday?  october<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not so far away.  hint, hint.", 
            "i arrived before my sis-in-heart to celebrate her birthday. i mentioned the occasion so that we could have a table that wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> stuck in the midst of a bunch of tourists, nor did i want to sit near the bar; we wanted to take our time and enjoy the evening. when the hostess sat us, she found for us a table sort of center-stage... in other words, we could see everything going on and had a fantastic view of the whole place.\n\nas soon as we sat down, we were offered water and a wine list and the restaurant week menu. as that is how my sis chose this place, we were just fine with that idea.\n\nwe also noticed a birthday card from the staff. de<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark>, people, de<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark>!\n\ngetting to the good stuff (well, mostly):\n\nduck-fat fries (3.5/5) - the truffled fries were amazing but their accompanying bleu cheese sauce was bland and boring. the herbed fries were, ironically, refreshing, with a simple ketchup (keep it simple, stripsteak!). the last one, i can<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> remember what it was, was good with the grain mustard sauce (the best sauce offered, just flavorful enough without putting off people [my sis] who don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> like mustard). \n\n<mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark> sliders (1.5/5) - ordered off the main menu as an extra, we originally wanted the <mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark> they list as an extra. we were told it was a single piece, but if we order the sliders there are 2. ok, we thought, we<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> try it. spoiler alert! it was still a single piece, just sliced in half. this made it too thin, overcooked, and dry. the bread (i tasted it, to be fair) was dry and pretty bland. the garnishes were ok. a single piece of arugula and a bright little cherry gelee of sorts. overall, high hopes dashed.\n\nduck <mark>Crab Spring Rolls</mark> (3.5/5) - generous portion and, i was happily surprised, not too heavy. the wrapper was thin and crispy, although a tad (a smidgeon?) too oily. again, however, it was not heavy. the crisp veggies did well to set off the richness of the duck. the meat was well seasoned and had a great flavor. it was a bit dry in spots. i am going to blame presentation and delivery (heat lamps?) versus cooking as it was mostly at the cut edges of the rolls.\n\nheirloom tomato salad (8/5, yes, seriously) - fresh, fresh tomatoes, creamy, rich burrata cheese that didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> weight it down in any way, and the perfect amount of a tangy, sweet, beautiful 25-year old balsamic vinegar that has had me drooling for the past 12 hours.\n\n<mark>16 Oz Ny Strip</mark> (4/5) - slightly overcooked based on our order. we were a bit surprised as the server said they tend to undercook slightly... still, it was a fantastic cut of meat, very well seasoned, and perfectly tender and flavorful. the sides of sauteed mushrooms (another 8/5) and creamed corn with jalapeno (4/5) were great complements.\n\n<mark>Mary<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> Free Range Roasted Chicken</mark> (4/5) - a tad on the dry side in places, the overall dish was fabulous. i love that they left the skin on; i don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> eat the skin, but it imparted a rich flavor to the meat and left those portions really juicy and tender. the truffled mac n<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> (4/5) was really good. almost too much truffle, not enough cheese, and because it was used as the bed for the chicken, it picked up other flavors (meat, greens, sauces) that detracted from it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> own amazing profile.\n\nvanilla bean creme brulee and biegnets (5/5) - the brulee was creamy, perfectly flavored, and delicious. the biegnets were expertly fried, hot and cripsy and dusted with powered sugar without being overly dressed. another de<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> we thought was fantastic, sis<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> dessert came out presented with the words happy birthday in a sweet, dark chocolate!\n\nwines (5/5, nail on the head every time). we started with a pinot gris and a viogner, then with the help of gabriel, the sommelier, chose a fruity, dry-ish oregon pinot noir to go with the meal. we spoke for a moment on trying something new, price points, and flavor profiles (what we liked and what we ordered). given the whole picture, his recommendation was well received and the perfect wine for everything we ate.\n\nthe service was good, though the server could have visited us a little more often. there were a few large parties so we were happy to wait a little here and there, and as other staff were also happy to smile, ask if you needed anything, and be of service, it was not a dark spot at all. \n\nall in all, a solid, enjoyable meal.\n\nwith the restaurant week menu (50.11 each), the 2 wines by the glass and the bottle, plus the additional <mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark>, our total was $300 and change. bonus tip: they are on restaurant.com so another $50 saved!", 
            "my dinner was on june 8th 2014. i will typically give a place a 2nd chance if the first isnt what was expected. in this case we are talking about a vegas, and you only get one shot to impress and hope people spread the word about your steak house. my wife and i decided to have dinner here after we watched the michael jackson show in the hotel. the host escorted us to the table and said a server will be with us shortly. (no problem) 10 mins goes by and nobody is yet to stop by our table. finally the same host saw that we hadn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> been helped. so he brings up a dinner and drink menu. takes our order for the drink and they come. now we are just back to sitting around waiting for our server to come by.  i then pull out my cell phone and start the stopwatch on it. 23 mins later our server comes by. proceeds to tell us about the menu. at this point my wife and i had 33 mins to decide on what we wanted for dinner. we were ready to order. we place our order and move on. the food finally comes out (another server brings it to us). i had to ask that server for the fries that come on the house because our server never came back or brought them. i ordered the 16oz <mark>16 Oz Ny Strip</mark> and my wife ordered the <mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark>. my steak was \"good\" at best, cer<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> wasnt a usda prime steak. we shared the potatoe gratin. that was about the only good thing about this place. i could go on but i was very disapointed in everything at stripsteak. i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> stick to my local place, peterson<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> steakhouse in indianapolis.", 
            "seafood appetizer platter was pretty good. my <mark>16 Oz Ny Strip</mark> was very tasty and tender. ordered medium rare but was closer to medium. beef tartar was good but lackluster. service was good, noise was a little high. prices are steep but there are limited choices in mandalay bay restaurant row. overall very good but not great. i would give this 4 stars except that the meal was close to $130 pp and i didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> think it was worth that much.", 
            "+.5 for service\n\nokay, i get it. there just seems to be the \"vegas factor\" in many non-buffet restaurants (okay...buffet restaurants too). the food prices just seem to be much more than back home in canada, even after taxes. i understand the whole phrase \"go big or go home\", but at the end, is it worth it?\n\nstripsteak is located inside mandalay bay, which mind you is probably one of the largest hotels in the strip...and one of the most poorly accessible from public transit. good thing i was living in nyny so i was able to take the tram there. the first thing you would<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> thought is that with the high prices, the restaurant would<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> been on the quiet side. nope! it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> about as loud as a chinese dim sum restaurant on a saturday afternoon; very loud.\n\nwe ordered the japanese a4 <mark>Japanese <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark>, <mark><mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> . Australian Wagyu</mark> vs. <mark><mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> . Australian Wagyu</mark>, <mark>16 Oz Ny Strip</mark>, and wagyu <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark>. yeah i know, a lot of wagyu...i mean, you don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> get <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> many places in canada! as for the food quality...the two <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> were interesting, but i cer<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> did not feel the value of $69 for all the <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>, and honestly the $59 <mark>16 Oz Ny Strip</mark> tasted a little better. however, this restaurant is definitely something i would recommend trying once if you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> a steak lover, but not twice.\n\nservice was great though. the server explained all our foods when we first ordered, and when they were being delivered one by one. we also got complimentary fries and different dipping sauces for each fries. again, it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> a restaurant i was glad i tried since i was able to experience a non-buffet higher end dining style in vegas, but i wouldn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> do it again.", 
            "disappointing. i expected more from this place, especially considering all the raving reviews and the fact that michael mina owns this place. the complimentary fries were pretty good. basically, the fries were provided in three s<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> steel cups, with each cup filled with different flavored fries: parmesan, truffle, and duck fat. i also tried the west/east coast oysters. those were too fishy for me...maybe the flights that shipped those oysters were delayed. my party ordered a few appetizers of which was the <mark>Roasted Bone Marrow</mark>. the marrow was topped with an overwhelming amount of onions. the richness of the marrow disappeared, as a result. \n\nnow onto the main event. i had the <mark>16 Oz Ny Strip</mark> cooked medium rare. it was cooked perfectly, but served warm. tasted similar to meat cooked an hour ago which sat under a warming lamp; similar to a buffet. don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> get me wrong, the meat tasted dry aged, but the temperature of the meat threw me off. \n\nservice was generally okay, except when my party asked for another set of complimentary fries, we got rejected and was told..$6 please. i expected more from a place that sells $50-75 steaks. \n\ni really wanted to like this place because of the brand and reputation, but unfortunately...i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> experienced better.", 
            "couldnt have been more pleased with food and service.  my girlfriend and i ordered all together the kale salad, 16oz <mark>16 Oz Ny Strip</mark>, truffle mac n cheese, and the <mark>Potato Gratin</mark>.  everything was amazing, but i must single out the <mark>Potato Gratin</mark>...3 thumbs up and a must try!  glen (our waiter) and the entire staff were all amazing, they were very nice, were attentive and engaging.  i definitely recommend this restaurant.", 
            "after camping out at the lazy river all day, i made an  last minute reservation at 6:10pm via hotel for my parents<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>. we arrived  ten minutes early, and the hostess directed us to our table 7:30 sharp. our waitress was extremely well versed on the menu and offered some excellent suggestions. the music was a clubby and electronic feel that didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> overwhelm us. i had the <mark>16 Oz Ny Strip</mark> and <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> legs to share with others which was excellent ! the cream of corn as a side dish is off the chain!! however, i was extremely disappointed in the dessert menu, they offered ice cream, plain cheesecake and beignets. my birthday guests were hoping for some type of cake or chocolate offerings. \nso we settle for coffee - which powered us for long night of partying for our last night of vegas.\n\noverall, our experience at this facility was positive and everyone in my group had a good time. despite a disappointing dessert menu - i wouldn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> mind coming back to getting a bite of those delicious stakes!"

            "ate here last night with friends, and i have to say that i was a little disappointed. i dont normally review places on the strip, or in vegas casinos, since i live here. i usually leave those places up to the tourists. although since my opinion of this restaurant differs from most of the other reviews here, i figured i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> share.\ni had the rare ahi appetizer, which was good, and probably the best part of the meal in my opinion, and then the <mark>30 Oz Dry Aged Porterhouse</mark> steak as my entree. the steak, unfortunately, was nothing to write home about. and for $51 i expected a pretty good steak. i was prepared well, but didnt seem to have any flavor to it. the dry aged steaks at capitol grille, are so much more flavorful. i also had the <mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark> with the steak, and it wasnt too bad. i guess for a steak house in mandalay bay, i expected it to be alot better. \nthe service was very good, and the restaurant itself was very nice. i have eaten at every other restaurant in mandalay bay, and they have all been great, but i think stripsteak fell a little short."

            "this is hands down one of the best steakhouse i went to.   good job micheal.  hopefully he brings this restaurant to san francisco, as it blows away all the other steakhouses there.  i was not disappointed here.  \n\nmy friend and i started off our dinner, after watching \"love\", with the crab cakes, tomato preserve, tabasco vinaigrette and the lobster, chilled, black truffle vinaigrette,baby lettuces.  both were excellent.  they even gave us the stripsteak trio of duck fat fries complementary. the sauces severed with the fries were a barbecue, truffle, and ketchup.  the truffle sauce was the best.  our entrees were the <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> and <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> fillet mignon.  both of the kobe beef was cooked to perfection of medium rare and seasoned perfectly.  it was so soft, that you didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> need a knife to cut it, especially the <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>...gotta love that marbled fat. we accompanied our steaks with the sauteed baby brussel sprouts, bacon lardon steam asparagus, mascarpone beurre blanc.  the brussel sprouts were out of this world...again, cheers to fat, this time the bacon.\n\ni was so stuffed, but i forged on to eat dessert. i had to live it up as it was my last night in vegas.  we both shared the beignet with butterscotch pudding and the dough nut with banana fosters. both desserts were ok, and here is where i think the improvement needs to be made.  the butterscotch pudding was not memorable, as it was not as sweet as i would have liked it to be.  \n\ni would have given it 5 stars, but the dessert was a little let down. but the services was excellent.  shout out to our server kyle, another local boy from hawaii, \"you da best\".  in all, a very enjoyable dinner.  plus they gave me one of the menu<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> when i asked if they had a take home version. \n\ncome here for the <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> beef, and if you really want the authentic kobe a5, that too.   mmmm...marbled beef.......drool.",

            "there<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> two types of steakhouses in vegas: quiet fancy ones that look like they came out of a country club, or loud trendy ones that pump moby into the room and have so much tile and glass that you can barely hear the person across the table talk to you.\n\nstripsteak falls into the latter category. (it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> fairly easy to tell the difference between the two types of restaurants, just watch for the rich old guys wheeling their oxygen tanks towards the former.)\n\ni went for the lamb, my colleagues for the strip steaks.  entrees check in around $50-ish.  all were expertly prepared.  for sides, we shared the <mark>Spinach Souffl</mark> (excellent, imaginative), the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> with bacon (good, but a bit ordinary), and a <mark>Baked Potato</mark> (not much you can do to sex that up).\n\nif you want a good, large hunk of cow before you go out to hit the bars, stripsteak will get you in that mood.  if you want a quiet, relaxing dinner, the atmosphere may overwhelm.  but the quality of the food matches the prices.", 
            "as you will see from my reviews i have eaten at high end steak places in ny, philadelphia and dc.....this is definitely in the top 5 of all of them.   \n\nwe went here with a group and ate on a thursday night, we had no problem getting a table for 4 at 8pm with reservations.   \n\ni had the <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> bacon appetizer which was honestly the lowlight of my meal but still very good.   my wife had a beet salad which looked nice and a friend of mine split onion rings with the table.   the free fries were also amazing and we loved the different sauces.\n\nnext came the main courses.   my wife ordered a filet done perfectly.   my friends gf had the halibut which was also excellent.   i had the regular <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> and the <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> options as did my friend.   let me just say this steak was seasoned and cooked perfectly.   the <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> legs that were the side were amazing.   they were split and all of the good parts were left.   a great addition! \n\nwe got the mashed potato sides  as well as a mushroom that was part of a forrest fire.   \n\ni think that this is a great steakhouse and a great place to eat.   i would highly recommend this place in lv.",

            "i loved this place. this place \"was. an. experience.\" it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> a surprisingly chic place not far from fleur de lys in mandalay bay and right next to a starbucks. it was packed and loud, so i guess that<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> a good sign. \nto be honest, i wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> impressed with our waiter. he seemed like a casual billy corgan type who was interested in talking to you so long as you were increasing your order. no small talk, 0 personality, and the real piss ant is he conveniently didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> add our restaurant.com coupon to our bill. he may have forgotten, but frankly this is the second time this has happened to me in vegas, and seeing how just about every other attraction in vegas is designed to suck the money out of your pocket i can<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> help but wonder if it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not a coincidence. they must slip more than a few bills under the noses of patrons who unknowingly assume they got their discount but fail to check after a bottle of wine, but not me, and i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not too forgiving about this ether, because i think it really is intentional. \nanyway, the food is what saved this place from a more negative review because in the end that is all i really and truly care about anyway. anyone can learn how to carry a plate of food to a table, but it takes a talented individual to craft a work of art in the kitchen. \nwe had salad to start. frankly i wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> impressed with my caesar.  it seemed a bit bland. i was hoping this wouldn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> be precursor to the rest of the meal but in this rare occasion it wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> at all. salad must not be their thing because the rest of the meal was mind blowing. i had a regular filet with a side of peppercorn sauce and another side of the creamed corn. ummmm....the food was utterly fantastic. the filet was of excellent quality. perfect taste and texture throughout, and the accompanying pepper sauce was not a creamy peppercorn sauce like you usually get, but more of a demi glace sauce with peppercorns - truly the sauce i have been after for years.\nthe sides of the mashed potatoes 3 ways was stunning. they serve 3 little bowls of mashed taters. one is sour cream and chives infused, the other is <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark>, and the third is horseradish infused. each was the creamiest, smoothest mashed potato i have ever had, and was accented perfectly with its character ingredient. wow. with the steak it was just superb. the creamed corn with jalapeno was very good, although not the best ever. still very nicely done though and no complaints.\nto top it off, and the reason this place is a solid 5 star experience and worthy of one of the most smitten reviews i have ever posted was the simple divine experience i had with the executive chef, ben (lost his business card but remember his name).\ni was walking out of the restroom, and stopped by to look at their see-through window next to the grill where they cook the steaks and other entrees. i noticed what seemed to be a chef standing nearby, so in a spontaneous moment of gratitude i went up to him and told him how much i enjoyed my food. he was very nice, and after i asked a few more questions about how the steak is prepared, he said \"come on, i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> take you back.\" he actually took me back in the kitchen past all the kitchen staff who were probably thinking \"wtf is this guy doing in here?\", and took me straight up to the grill where a few beautiful steaks were in the home stretch. he explained the process, how the steaks actually soak in clarified butter at a perfectly controlled temperature before they are grilled. this would explain the awesomeness of the steak, actually, but now that i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> tasted it i know that it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> the best. he enthusiastically answered my other questions about the kitchen (\"is it really like hell<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> kitchen??\") and then ushered me out of the kitchen. i don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> know why this is such a big deal to me, but it really just impressed the heck out of me that the executive chef of one of the best restaurants i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> ever been to was so down to earth and gave me an impromptu tour of his kitchen. i remember as a young boy my dad would approach the cockpits of planes even during flights sometimes to talk to the pilots, and they would bring us into the cockpit, explain a few neat things, and then with a wink we<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> be on our way. obviously those days are gone forever, but tonight i had a bit of the same feeling; the man running the ship gave me the tour with no expectation of anything in return. clearly i don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> believe this kind of thing happens that much anymore and that<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> why i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> so ecstatic, but it was a privilege and an honor to meet him and i cannot thank him enough for his exemplary skills as both a chef and a business man. \ni<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> a fan of strip steak for sure. maybe next time if i win big in vegas i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> try the japanese kobe (it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not cheap). until then i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> enjoy a superb domestic cut of beef and be glad i can afford the luxury.", 
            "stripsteak is a fine steakhouse but, unfortunately, doesn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> live up to the hype.\n\ni<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> start with something positive.  the ambience, to be expected, is excellent.  good use of wood, and in an open, non-stuffy, modern way.  \n\nthey start you off with some complimentary french fries and potato bread.  the fries are gourmet (one kind is cooked in duck fat) and are good, but not great.  (in fact, i had some mcdonalds fries the next afternoon which left me just as satisfied).  the bread is a bit dry.  i would never order it.\n\nas for the drinks, i had a glenlivet 12 (can<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> report much there) and a cucumber martini.  the cucumber martini was perfect for a hot vegas day (95 degrees) and was refreshing.  i also haven<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> been to too many places that offer a cucumber martini, so that was nice.  as for the drink itself, it was un-nuanced.  overall, though, i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> get it again.\n\nonto the steaks.  i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> been on a <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> lately and like to compare the different restaurants that offer it, so i was glad to see they offered it here.  the price is supposedly market, so on this night, it was $185 for a 6 oz. new york.  in short, i was disappointed.  first, they serve it pre-sliced.  that pissed me off.  pre-slicing alters the surface/area ratio, which means that each slice gets cold quickly.  i tried to return the steak to get a new one that wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> pre-sliced, but the most they would do was \"flash\" the steak.  b.s.  in any event, the steak itself fell way below expectations.  unlike cut, the <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> stripsteak did not melt in my mouth and i still had to chew (ok, at cut you do have to chew, but barely).  i would never order the <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> again.\n\ni went with four other guys and none of them were impressed with their steaks (they don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> even go to nice steakhouses often).  in fact, one said that the steak at lawry<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> \"destroyed\" the steak at stripsteak.  that gives you some context.\n\non the other hand, stripsteak<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> truffled macarroni and cheese was truly divine.  in all seriousness, and forgive me for the superlatives, it was the best mac & cheese i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> ever had, and by a wide margin.  for the truffled mac & cheese alone, i would go back to stripsteak.  if you go, it is a must order.\n\nfinally, and it must be said since i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> a guy, the other reason to go to stripsteak is that one of their servers, tori, is perhaps the prettiest girl you will ever see in real life.  i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> really not joking on that one (it was the consensus amongst the 5 guys at my table, as well as the table of 8 guys sitting next to us).  ridiculous.\n\nso, at the end of the day, 3 solid stars for stripsteak.  can<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> say it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> the best steakhouse (or even close to it), but it is a place to grab a good meal with a nice ambience and pretty scenery.", 
            "with all the steakhouse options in vegas, do not waste your time with stripsteak.  we were first seated in the bar at a lounge chair and a high table.  i have no idea how they expected us to eat a steak sitting at the kids table.  we were eventually able to move to a normal table and after a good 25 minutes, we got a waiter to come by and take some drink orders and we also placed our food orders.  i got a soup appetizer which was pretty good.  while waiting for the steaks, which arrived a good 35 minutes after appetizers, i started to feel sick and had to run to the restroom.  i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not saying it was their fault, and i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not saying it wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>.  my wife finished her over salted steak while i was in the restroom being sick and the waiter and manager firmly told her that she had to pay the bill in full and they couldn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> comp anything.  she never even asked for it, she just said i wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> feeling well and probably wouldn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> be eating my over salted undercooked steak (medium rare is a cool pink center, not raw and uncooked).  i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not giving a bad review because i got sick or because they put a pound of salt on the steaks.  i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> giving them a bad review on how rude they were and made a big point to let everyone know that my sickness couldn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> possibly be their fault.  i will definitely not be back.",

            "stripsteak was absolutely amazing.. i am in love with the duck fat french fries.. they bring them out to the table instead of bread, i would ask the server to bring two orders of the duck fat fries instead of the foccaia. i had the <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> soup which was amazing. i am slightly lactose intolerant  which was definitely accommodated. our server had no problem finding out what ingredients were used in my soup to make sure i could eat it. i loved the fact that they left whole peas in the soup with gracious portions of lobster. i also had the fillet mignon which was to die for! all of their steaks are dry aged in house and cooked over a mesquite wood burner. i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> definitely be back to stripsteak soon! another michael minna success!", 
            "my first fancy schmancy meal in vegas that wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> a buffet!\n\nit<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> near all the other fancy restaurants in mandalay bay.  the entrance is very open, glass windows that extend to the roof and you can see the whole restaurant just standing out side.  \n\nlarge cow carcasses hang from hooks in the fridge behind the glass by the kitchen.  i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> guessing these are the delicious ones that they<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> be hacking off for my order.\n\nthe host is formal; he pulls out my chair, hands me a menu, and places a napkin in my lap for me.  thanks guy.  i order the <mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark> (a la carte, as most of the menu items come), the beau orders the fried chicken w/mac & cheese.  meanwhile, compliments of the chef are 3 types of fries and corresponding sauces - truffle, bbq, and ketchup, as well as a small pan of potato foccacia.  the truffle fries won me over.  i could have eaten plenty more of those. \n\nhad i known that they were bringin out the fries and bread, i would have skipped ordering a side of asparagus, which had this citrussy glaze over it, bleh.  i didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> want it to be sweet :p  i also prefer my asparagus unpeeled; i think it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> crispier that way.\n\nwell, onto the steak; wow! that was easily the most tender, juicy and flavorful steak i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> ever experienced. yes, experienced.  it was that good.  i didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> think i could handle 10 ounces of it, but it was that good, tender inside, crusty with steak rub/seasoning on the outside and very lean around the edges, i tried the beau<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> chicken, too.  hyum :) was it juicy!  \n\nall in all, i was very pleased with our meal and the service.  i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> like to say i would return, but it was quite the expensive meal! not that it wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> worth it, but ... well, we<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> poor.", 
            "big thanks to restaurant.com for finally convincing me to come here.  wife and i had the filet and <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> along w/ scalloped potatoes and the <mark>Spinach Souffl</mark>.  steaks were cooked perfectly...i usually end up taking home about <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> but i literally inhaled this one..so damn good.  the <mark>Spinach Souffl</mark> was really good...never had anything like that before.  i also liked how they serve foccacia and fries as kind of a complimentary starter as opposed to the loaf of bread/rolls most places do.  def gonna do mac n cheese next time.", 
            "they were nice enough to let us use two restaurant.com gift certificates, since we were planning to split our party of 4.  \n\ni had the rib-eye, cooked medium rare.  it was the best rib-<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark><mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> ever had!  it was a little pricey, but what quality steakhouse isn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>?  i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> definitely going back the next time i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> in vegas.  the staff was really friendly and attentive.", 
            "totally lucky that i came here.  first of all, i had won a few hundred dollars at the blackjack table so i was feeling especially generous.  so after i took my girlfriend to a show, i wanted to treat her to a nice dinner.  and this was the closest steakhouse near the show.\n\nthis place may be the best steak that i had ever tasted.  i ordered the <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> which was very tender and seasoned to perfection. they did not overbutter their steaks like some other nice steakhouses.  \n\nalso, they give you fries as instead of bread.  the fries are seasoned differently with various different dipping sauces.  i dont know if they do this anymore, but they did do this when i was here last. \n\nthe decor is typical of a fancy steak house, but i love the fact that they have some cuts of meat on display on windows.\n\ndrawback of course is the price, but hey, what do you expect..it is a fancy steakhouse.\n\ngreat steak, great sides, great everything.", 
            "i don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> know if i can add much more then any of the other reviews. the food was outstanding. the fries were surprising and delicious. we had the prime rib, <mark>Spinach Souffl</mark> and <mark>Roasted Bone Marrow</mark>. our friends shared some of their onion rings with us. everything was made perfectly. you must try the truffle aioli dipping sauce. i could drink that straight it was so good. we only had budget for one really expensive meal for our vegas vacation and we were not disappointed that we choose stripsteak.\n\ni will add this. it was obvious that we were not in the income bracket of their normal clientele but we never once felt talked down to or made to feel uncomfortable in any way by the staff. our group of four ordered two entrees and shared them for obvious reasons and still there was no questioning or <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> or hesitation from the waiter or host. a great experience.", 
            "during my latest trip to lv, my friends and i came here for dinner one night. my first impressions upon being seated: the hosts are attractive, the decor is modern and dig the extended glass separators, and <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> those complimentary fries look delicious'. the restaurant<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> open space does not make it a quiet evening, but that<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not what i was looking for! i ordered the prime rib, cooked medium. i was a little concerned about the servings being small, but was pleasantly surprised upon it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> arrival. the meat was cooked to perfection. although i was a little surprised with how it was charred at the bottom, as i never had prime <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> this. but it didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> stop me from finishing it. we all shared sides of the creamed corn, mac & cheese, and scalloped potatoes. all the sides were very rich, but delicious.\n\nbut what makes me a fan of this place is their service, and willingness to accept a couple of my requests. one of the chefs actually came by our table and asked how everything was. also - the day after, i received an email from one of the team members, ashley, thanking us for our dining experiences. that was a nice touch...", 
            "my 700th review goes toward a night of decadent eating!\n\nparties of four are really one of the best ways to experience a menu.  with drinks in hand, we took our seats at a table by the floor-to-ceiling glass walls separating us from the outside world.\n\n* trio of duck fat fries with dipping sauces of barbecue, truffle aioli, and ketchup - this complimentary dish was the first to arrive, and yes, they are very delicious and decadent, and oh so good and fatty.  a great way to start any meal!\n\n* potato focaccia - more complimentary stuff to get your palate going, although i found to be just okay, the husband enjoyed it more. \n\n* <mark>Half <mark>Grilled Maine Lobster</mark></mark> \"bacon-wrapped fritters\" ($17) - skewered <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> bacon wrapped around, and then deep-fried.  a refreshing dipping sauce to cut the fat!\n\n* roasted beets \"burrata, walnut oil\" ($15) - the fresh italian cheese, greens, and beets had the three men at my table fighting over the last bits.\n\n* <mark><mark>8 Oz <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> Tartare</mark> \"<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> filet, classic garnish, grilled pocket bread\" ($21) - beautifully presented with the rare beef and a raw quail egg resting on top.  garnishments of mustard, cracked pepper, red onions and the like surrounded it before the waiter artfully mixed it all together and presented it in chilled glass.  so tastefully good, you don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> need or want the bread.  \n\n* shabu shabu \"<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> beef, mushroom consomme\" ($24) - a pot of hot broth took center stage as enoki mushrooms wrapped in beef arrived.  a quick swish and a dip of sauce and into your mouth it goes.\n\n* angus beef cap ($46) - we all ordered this off-menu cut of beef.  i initially wanted it rare, but was dissuaded to have it medium rare instead.  cutting into my beef, it was more medium and i was saddened.  a quick glance around the table, and i realized my piece was definitely more cooked than most.  lucky for me, the husband was willing to switch his piece with mine.  (that act alone makes him a keeper!)  once i cut into my newly acquired beef, i was enjoying my medium rare slice with everyone else.  \n\n* mac & cheese \"truffled\" ($12) - yes, it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> all that and a bag of chips.  so creamy and good, and not just a hint of the truffle, but it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> all over! so yum!  worth ordering on its own.\n\n* scalloped potatoes \"caramelized onion & goat cheese\" ($12) - the onions give this dish a sweetness that complements the goat cheese and potatoes.  \n\n* potato puree trio \"lobster, sour cream & onion, horseradish\" ($14) - my personal fave over the other potato dish.  with so many variations of mashed potatoes, how can one not like them.  very smooth, creamy, and just something you want to eat all to yourself.\n\n* creamed corn \"jalapeno\" - i guess we needed some kind of vegetable to offset our meal.  a slight bit of heat from the pepper and it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> more creamy goodness.\n\n* beignets \"chocolate pot de creme, macallan 18 year butterscotch pudding, madagascar vanilla creme brulee\" - take a spoon to the cr\\u00e8me brulee and forget the beignets, just hog the pot to yourself.  dipping wise, i liked the chocolate over the butterscotch in this case.\n\n* coconut candy bar \"caramel ice cream, toasted almonds\" ($12) - a very fancy candy bar that<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> super sweet, and perfect for sharing.\n\n* cucumber martini - surprisingly better than other cucumber martinis out there, good enough that everyone at my table was having one because they are that good.\n\n* cherry caiprihana - the husband enjoyed this signature drink of theirs as well, and the cherry adds a unique taste to the caiprihana.\n\nthe service at strip steak was probably among the best.  there<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> a team waiting on you, and they work as a team - with not just clearing dishes, but bringing your orders in and chatting it up with you.  one of the more personal and better customer service experiences i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> had in awhile.  michael mina obviously knows what he<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> doing with his food and his staff.  it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> no wonder there<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> a cult following of his restaurants.  they also have restrooms within the restaurant, which is a nice touch. (most restaurants in the casinos don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> have their own restrooms, so you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> forced to walk through the casino to use it.)  but there can be a line, which is the downfall of it.\n\nmy suggestion is to gather a few friends, and only a few, and share a wonderful meal with them all.  with a party of five or more, it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> harder to share the appetizers and sides.  you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> share an intimate culinary adventure with them!\n\n4.5 stars",

            "what normally would have been an impressive steak experience was slighted, just a bit, by the fact that i kept comparing stripsteak with my recent visit to blt http://www.yelp.com/biz/blt-steak-west-hollywood?q=brian+c  \n\nmost notably was how, like blt, stripsteak provides an amuse bouche and bread serving complimentary.  i give the edge to stripsteak on the amuse bouche duck fat fries.  they were so good that we were salivating over the un-touched portion that the table next to us didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> finish.  and, although the bread was good, there something more unique about the popovers at blt.\n\nas for entrees, three of us chose the <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> ($51 each), which had a good flavor due to the fat content, but made me rethink choosing it over the filet ($54), luckily i got a nice sample of the filet since it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> owner couldn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> finish it.  edge to blt.\n\nsides.  edge to stripsteak.  we ordered three to share among the four of use.  mac n cheese ($12), cream corn ($13), and the <mark>Spinach Souffl</mark> ($12).  while we felt each was good, the cream corn was our least favorite with the <mark>Spinach Souffl</mark> being my most favorite.  and, we probably could have been fine with two sides since the portion of the sides were much larger in comparison to blt. \n\nthree of us had drinks.  the service was attentive.  and, like blt, since we declined dessert, we were provided with a complimentary treat, which was two small bags of chocolate caramel corn, which was good, but not was good as the pecan treats blt has.  \n\ni know it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not necessarily fair to compare stripsteak with blt, but  again i thought about the comparison during dinner.  \n\ni think stripsteak could have done a better job of designing the interior to give you the feel that you weren<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> inside a casino, but rather a michael mina level restaurant. \n\ntotal, excluding tip, for the four of us was $304.84.", 
            "this is a great steakhouse located in mandalay bay! we had late reservations, like 9:00pm and were starving and very thirsty at this point. \n\nto our surprise they brought out some complimentary duck fat fries, which were fantastic. my hubby excused himself to the rest room and by the time he returned i managed to polish off the rest of these addictive lil slices of heaven ; ) \n\nto get on with it, we both ordered a couple of glasses of wine and shared the tuna, trio of poppers for an appetizer (which was very good). i believe the hubby ordered a bone-<mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> and i had the salmon because i had steak the previous night...yeah, yeah, i realize its a steakhouse!  my salmon was delish, but the hubbies steak was a lil too done. i told him to send it back, but he opted not too and just ate it instead. we shared the truffled mac & cheese, which was also a delight to eat! i don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> remember if we got a dessert or not, but we definitely had another glass of wine. \n\noverall, we got out of there just under $250 including tip and i think it was well spent! i loved the ambiance and the whole setup of the restaurant. food was great, and i would definitely go back!",

            "michael mina has exploded.  before you know it, he is going to have a restaurant in every major city in the country.  i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> eating at several of his other restaurants so i had a good idea of what to expect.  however, this was the first time i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> visited his steakhouses.  from a culinary aspect, i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> always enjoyed his food.  however, the price you pay for his work tends to eclipse a reasonable number.  i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> always left his place enjoying the food but never wanting to go back because i feel like it cost a little more than its worth.  the amount of add-ons you get exceed reasonable.  with that being said, having an expensive restaurant in vegas is the norm and almost should be expected.  so, with that in mind, my concerns with cost went out the door and that left my taste buds to enjoy every savory bite.  \n\nat a steakhouse, its a standard that i get the bone-<mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark>.  we went to stripsteak on a thursday night and they sat us close to 11pm, which was great (we arrived at 9:45pm).  i ordered the <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> tartare and it was delicious.  very flavorful, not to overwhelming and the steak just melted in your mouth.  an excellent appetizer that was prepared table side.  the steak i ordered was medium-rare and it was spot on.  the thickness of the cut is slightly smaller than say a <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> cut at delmonico<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>.  so the edges of the cut were closer to medium than the center which was closer to medium-rare.  the tenderness of the steak was excellent.  an excellent steak that was grilled perfectly.  \n\na steakhouse should be able to make great steak.  that is the norm.  to make great appetizers at a steakhouse, that isn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> necessarily a given.  i think one of the best steakhouses for appetizers and \"other\" parts of the meal i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> experienced was at david burke<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> primehouse in chicago.  at that steakhouse, it is more than just the steak.  stripsteak is pretty close but still a distant second to david burke<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>.  the thing that separates this steakhouse and makes it a four-star on yelp is the scotch selection.  the selection of scotch is extensive and is well worth the visit for any aficionado.  on this night, i visited with a friend that knew scotch more than me and he was surprised at the selection.  \n\nlastly, this is one of the few steakhouses on the strip that actually serves true japanese a5 wagyu.  they have two choices, filet and <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark>.  both bradley ogden<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> in caesar<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> palace and sw steakhouse in the wynn have a version of the filet and cut in the palazzo actually has two choices as well (filet and <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark>).  so this is one of the few amongst many traditional steakhouses.  it does provide more options.\n\ncons: \nthe wine selection by the glass was okay at the time of this review (9/13/09-ish).  i was really hoping that they had some really good bold cabs by the glass but everything that i wanted was by the bottle and the bottle selection, although expansive, was expensive.  as usual, the markup on some of these bottles are way too much.  \n\ni<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> only been here once so far but i look forward to eating here again.  nice work michael, now maybe you can fix your original namesake in union square---but i digress.", 
            "sorry this review won<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> be too useful because i went there a few years back, but i have to put this one review in, just because how good this place is.  we ordered all steak, including two orders of the kobe beef (so they called it).  i don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> know what they did to the kobe beef, or maybe it is the real kobe beef, because they really had that melt in your mouth beef texture, very good! yum!  stripsteak also have great fries, everyone on my table liked but i don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> really remember how it taste like, it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> just special, one of the specialty you have to have at this restaurant.  this place is definitely more expensive than most of the steak restaurants in lv, they even tell you it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> about $110 per person averagely, but if you are looking to eat at a nice steak restaurant with great steak in las vegas regardless of the price, this place is the place to go!  oh one more thing, don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> get the kobe beef hot pot thingy, it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not worth it, it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> good, but not worth it.", 
            "a great steak! nice ambiance and decor. i came hear to eat at one of my favorites \"3950\" but when mgm bought mandalay they replaced it with stripsteak but while apprehensive i finally tried it. awesome! \ni miss 3950 but i really liked this place. the menu was full of things ill go back for some day but the kobe fillet and duck fries were pretty right on. had the mac n<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> and some sort of bourbon pudding thing for dessert. it was all without complaint. \nthe wait staff was very attractive and very polite. \nwent back to eat there about a year ago and couldn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> get a last minute reservation so tried the striphouse.....",

            "stripsteak, a steakhouse brought forth by the all-powerful michael mina, is rightfully located in the mandalay bay resort & casino as the perfect sin city restaurant. \n\nwhy do you ask? stripsteak is a vegetarian and kosher eater<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> hell, but to a carnivorous foodie, it is simply the garden of eden. it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> a place where giant haunches of beef are hung up to age in a wall-to-floor ceiling glass case, not unlike a display at a natural history museum chronicling the stages of decomposition, or rather, the stages to one delicious steak. \n\nand the food, oh, the food. as i write this, my mind is wandering back to the memories from that deeply satisfying meal. \n\nfirst, i had the trio of duck fat fries--each fry was a dream, with a shatteringly crunchy, smoky shell and a fluffy interior. my friends and i fought over the truffled fries and light garlic aioli especially, but the bbq dusted fries and the original were stellar as well.\n\nand if that wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> enough, we also ordered their <mark>Spinach Souffl</mark>, as an attempt in incorporating some vegetables in our meal. the state-of-the-art souffle was placed on the table by the server with great care as to not deflate the impossibly high, cloud-like confection. then, he took it to a even higher level by pouring a luxurious parmesan cream sauce from a dainty saucer. just as the fairy godmother transformed cinderella into the belle of the ball, mina transformed the dowdy spinach into a classic french beauty.\n\nbut even the beauteous <mark>Spinach Souffl</mark> couldn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> hold a candle next to the rib-eye, for that steak has been through rigorous training. first, it begins its epic journey in the aging room, where<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> kept in a moisture and temperature controlled room to slowly mature for a month. the chef then trims the the sides of beef with an expertise not unlike a plastic surgeon to remove all unsightly dried bits and excess fat before portioning it into perfectly formed steaks. the next step is crucial: the steak is then poached in butter. a big no-no in the kosher community as they forbid the fraternizing of meat and diary, but in my world, a big oh yes. for the finishing touch, the rib-<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> then charred in their 1,000 degree grill for that deep smoky sear. \n\nthe best part was that the steak came to our table au naturale. with steak this juicy and well-seasoned, there<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> no need for a-1.\n\nit<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> impossible to fall into a deep food coma coming out from a meal there, but it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> oh so worth it. a definite must-eat destination for my next vegas trip!",

            "this was our second time eating here and it was just as good as last time.  as mentioned they give you the fries and a type of bread for appetizer, so i really don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> see a point to ordering an appetizer when they give you two.  i had the kansas city steak which was just the best thing i ate all vacation long.  it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> a very reliable steak.  i wanted to try something different but i knew how good it was last time and wanted to make sure that i was going to get something good.  it was cooked absolutely perfect.  my wife had the scallops which were really good as well.  entrees run in the 40 -60 dollar range.  side dishes are 9-12 dollars.  we opted for dessert and went with the root beer float which comes with a couple fresh baked cookies.  its not on the dessert menu.  it was good, but i don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> feel $12 was worth the size.  but overall it was a really nice experience, really delicious dinner.  we used our restaurant.com gift certificate to take $50 off the bill.  if you can get your hands on one of those it really makes it a much much more affordable meal.  over <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> restaurants in mandalay bay are on restaurant.com so take advantage of it.",

            "the highlight of the dinner was the french fry trio that they give you as a starter. i noticed that this was also a fave of many other reviewers. you cannot go wrong with 3 differently seasoned fries and 3 complimentary dips. considering that this starter is compliments of the house, the portion is substantial. \n\nfor dinner, i ordered the <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> burger and has the tomato soup to start. the burger was decent, but i have had better <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> burgers. the burger does have some of spread or aioli on it that after tasting would have rather had on the side. on the bright side, the burger does come with another pile of those fries. the tomato soup is pretty good. it definitely has the heirloom tomato taste so the the soup is a little bitter. the <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> cheese triangles are small, but tasty.\n\nmy date ordered the fried chicken, but was bummed to find out that they only fry it for parties or 2 or more. single fried chicken eaters have to opt for the grilled breasts instead. the truffle mac and cheese was just fair. \n\nthe desserts were pretty good as we shared the creme brulee and root beer float. the root beer float is not on the regular menu, but the waitress brought one to us anyway. i had seen a few of them go by and it sounded tasty. evidently, the float is part of the pre fixe menu that we were not aware of. oh well, we got our float so we were happy.",

(medium-rare plus!) after a vigorous discussion with my tablemates we settled on a description of the rib-cap: the robust flavor of the rib-eye, the tenderness of a filet, and the mouth-melting fat of pork belly. a trifecta worth the $60. the sides were awesome, but i couldn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> stop loving each bite of my steak.\n\nkaty checked in, and i was impressed that the product delivered. she noticed my can of pale ale was out, and suggested i try an ipa. wine just wouldn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> do with this steak, and i got the feeling that katy was a beer kinda girl. i mentioned to the server extraordinaire, that the only problem i had with the rib-cap was after the first bite and subsequent beefy fatness melted and coated your mouth, the excitement of the next bite was slightly diminished. \n\nkaty went back to the kitchen and brought out a small serving of coconut sorbet as a kind of intermezzo, palate cleanser. so my last bite was just like my first.",

            "so i decided to give in and try a fancy schmancy place on the strip over the weekend. usually i try to avoid restaurants on the strip because they<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> overcrowded, overpriced and in general the wait is to long. luckily i had to join my friend as she was meeting a group at stripsteak for happy hour. \n\nwalking up to the restaurant, we were generously greeted by the assistant gm miss ashley and the rest of her hosting staff. our group was easily accommodated since the happy hour was pretty dead. according to miss ashley, that was rare on a saturday night. to me, it was luck because i would then be able to assess a fair review on this place. \n\nthe bar area is fairly small, i would say that the big comfy purple seats do tend to take up a lot of space within that bar area that it really wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> an ideal place for a group of 8 to be sitting. plus we made it a little difficult for the wait staff to maneuver around. their happy hour drink & food menu is reasonably priced. i would highly recommend their specialty, the cucumber martinish drink, it was quite refreshing and a great summertime drink. and this means a lot since i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> more of a beer drinker. the raspberry lemonade & mojitos were just ok, maybe a little to weak, but again that<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> just my opinion. \n\nmy friend and i decided to try dinner so we asked the staff for a table in the dining area and were quickly accommodated. right away we were greeted with complimentary duck fries, which we also had ordered during happy hour. these fries are cooked in duck fat so don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> worry it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not any crazy duck part, which i would have hoped for. there are three different rings of fries - paprika smoked, truffle and garlic parmesan. the sauces were just ok, it was the general concept of ketchup, bbq sauce and truffle aioli but of course more upscale. i preferred to munch on the suckers without any of the sauces. \n\nour waiter, steve, was awesome. he highly recommended the <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> & <mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark>, along with a side of truffle mac & cheese and honestly it was phenomenal. the <mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark> was perfectly cooked (medium rare) and just melted in your mouth. the <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>, which is the end part of the <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark>, was seasoned and cooked perfectly. the truffle mac & cheese was definitely the best truffle mac & cheese i have experienced in a while. most tend to be dry but this one was moist and also had pieces of broccoli that it never lost it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> flavor. we also had a side of asparagus with a horseradish blanc sauce. i couldn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> complain about anything. at first i laughed at the portion size but then as we kept eating i was actually pretty full. also it might have been the alcohol we had prior to dinner! and me not knowing if you are allowed to take a doggy bag from such places, found the inner strength to finish our food, it truly was like a scene out of man vs food. \n\nbut wait, we weren<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> done! wth? steve charmed us into trying dessert, i figured what the heck, let<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> go all out! we ordered the beignets with their chocolate butterscotch pudding. whew! i think i was getting drunk off the pudding, i might have been able to light a fire. however, the beignets were soft and moist and perfectly fried. \n\noverall the ambiance of stripsteak is great, perfect for a date or just to people watch from the bar. it did tend to get busier as the night progressed. yes it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> quite pricey but honesty i have to say it was the best experience i have had in a while at a strip restaurant. michael mina did a phenomenal job with this place and all the employees were great. to see the agm serving drinks, chatting with customers, waiting on guests, cleaning tables and bringing out checks says a lot about the employee morale. she helped making the dining experience that much better.\n\nthe only thing i would say is that yes the meat platters need to have a little more presentation. maybe had a sprig of rosemary or something, just to give it a little more color and pizzazz.. \n\nfood for thought - 1) make sure you have reservations 2) make sure you give yourself enough time to have dinner as our evening lasted over 4 hours 3) if you can<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> stomach rich food, be aware that some of their steaks are cooked with butter. yay for tums! 4) all sides are al a carte so expect to pay over $100 for a 2 person dinner.",

            "while staying at mandalay bay for a convention, we ate at stripsteak, and so glad we did!\n\nno reservations, but no problem ... we were seated immediately.  i ordered the 10 oz filet with asparagus ... omg i thought i had died and gone to filet heaven!!  it was stellar!!  tender and delicious ... it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> everything i could ask for in a filet.  and the fries that are served complimentary ... let<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> put it this way ... i don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> eat fried food, but i found myself devouring these.  they brought 3 different seasoned fries and i couldn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> really tell you what the seasoning was on each, but who cares!!  yum!\n\nwe had no issues with service.  everything was fantastic!", 
            "mandalay bay offers some great restaurant.com deals and this one of the places that we decided use the giftcard and try out!\n\nthe restaurant started the night with some complimentary duck-fat fries that were unique and extremely good! the menu was extensive in its selection of steak. there were a great variety of types of meat from t-bone to kobe cap. we ordered the <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> w/ grapefruit vinaigrette. it had a slight tanginess to the sweet fresh lobster. i ordered the <mark>Diver Scallops</mark> w/ cajun spice--which actually didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> wow me at all. it basically was grilled scallops w/ lemon for $40.  my boyfriend ordred 18 oz. bone-<mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> which was a hearty portion! i actually liked his steak a lot more than my own scallops. we also ordered the mac & cheese in truffle oil and mushrooms. both of which were amazingly good and i would recommend that you order it w/ your meat! the truffle oil gave the mac & cheese a distinct taste that separated it from your typical <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>/cheddar mac & cheese. \n\nhonestly, i felt like the food was good here, but it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> definitely too expensive for the portion that they give you. i have been to other steak houses that offered the same type of food for a little bit cheaper. definitely try it but keep in mind that it might break your bank.", 
            "went on a sunday,  wow the place looked great and was hungry.  placed our order and thought we were all set....10 min later the fries arrived,  awesome especially the truffle dip. \n\nthen the waiting began,  an hour and fifteen minutes passed before our order did arrive,  i had the steak and my wife had the scallops.  well it was not worth the wait.  i thought my steak was dipped in salt,  i could not taste the steak,  the salt was over powering.  i could taste it throughout and it left a very bad taste on my palate.  my wife<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> scallops were over salted too.  then i start hearing from the table next to me,  told you we should of went to jack in the box. they offered free desserts to a lot of tables, including ours which was nice,  i did not have our meal replaced cause i thought it may take too long and was so hungry so i did a little patting with my napkin to reduce the salt and finished with a large glass of water., but i do not think i am coming back. maybe a bad day for them but for what you pay you expect good food.", 
            "the best meal i had since i landed in vegas for work!\n\nthe foi gras slider was delicious. which was recommended by my fellow yelp friend linda l. \n\ni also ordered the foi gras on the side , next to my kobe cap,. mmm it was so good and so worth it. \n\nmy kobe cap wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> that great and the medium rare was too rare and bloody.  they were nice enough to bring it back and cook it some more,. but i got so full from all the appetizers and small plate that i couldn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> finish the steak. the waitress recommended this steak,. but i think i could have done with out it and just ordered a regular filet.  \n\nmy favorite of all time is the <mark>Roasted Bone Marrow</mark>,. not as good as marlowe in sf,. but it def complimented my meal. \n\nif you are staying in mandalay bay like i did for a conference,. i recommend the 2 foi gra dish and <mark>Roasted Bone Marrow</mark>!!",

            "i just paid $14 for peas.  \n\ni guess i was expecting something magical about the english peas but they looked like regular old green giant to me.  i like peas.  so when the gentleman behind the bar desc<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> them as \"phenomenal\", i was all in.  phenomenal was kind of a reach but with the pancetta and fennel mixed in, they were tasty.\n\ni like this place.  i stopped in for dinner at the bar and it was definitely the most enter<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> seat in the house.  i never knew that people slammed martinis like teenagers on spring break but apparently they do.  seems like it would be much more efficient to just buy a handle of skol.  but i digress.\n\ni started out with a rockin<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>, which is a pre mixed house concoction of rye, rum, \"aromatics & herbs\" served with one giant ice cube.  it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> kind of fun that they have it up lit in a glass decanter on the bar.  it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> a pretty good cock<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark>.\n\nfor dinner i ordered the <mark>Loup De Mer</mark>, which is prepared mesquite grilled with a little olive oil...and the peas.  i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> really glad that i didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> order a potato since the chef surprised me with a complimentary round of duck fat fries in three flavors.  wow, those fries are good.  old bay, herb, and truffle seasoned with specialty sauces.  all were delicious.\n\nall in all, the food here is fantastic.  this dinner was great but i still have memories of the amazing kobe burger i had last time.  so good!  i won<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> hesitate to come back for more.", 
            "after waiting for about 1 hour for our entrees to arrive cold, i can<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> recommend stripsteak. it was a hassle to even find our waiter and i had to go ask the hostess for assistance twice, after we were seated. had reservations and still had to wait for table that they were \"cleaning.\" the table was already set up and actually was within the view of the front door where we stood waiting. \n\ni don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> know if the management or the staff is to blame. nothing at mandalay was impressive and this was the worst. even after they apologized for the time, the steak that was sent out cold was just reheated and therefore not the medium rare we requested. what kind of steakhouse sends out a cold porterhouse?! why waste this cut of meat?", 
            "i loved this restaurant. we were lucky enough to find a discount online because the price is definitely high but worth every penny.  we were treated to 2 complimentary appetizers, french fries with special dips and a bread.  the streaks were delicious.  \nthe atmosphere is upscale but very loud. i don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> mind because i like the hustle and bustle but some might find it intrusive. \nour servers were friendly and cute(hey it never hurts!)", 
            "best steakhouse ever. i came here with a few close friends to celebrate my bachelor<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> party in vegas, and this was one of the most memorable dinners ever. the decor is swanky and clean, sitting area is not that big, with a small bar and lounge area. after we sat down, the waiter brought out the complimentary duck fat fries in a trio of flavors - herb, truffle, and old bay, each with a different sauce. very asty. the drinks are a bit pricey like the $14 cucumber martini (alcohol is light, but the cucumber is very cool and refreshing). we started with a dozen oysters (very small, but the taste is very strong, very fresh). our table all ordered the 18oz dry aged bone-<mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark>, medium rare (very well seasoned, juicy, melts in your mouth steak - couldn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> get enough of it and at the end i kind of wished i had ordered the 30oz porterhouse instead). we got the <mark>Roasted Bone Marrow</mark> bones on the side (bones were a bit smaller than what i had elsewhere but still good). for sides, we got the truffled mac and chees (this is a must - the truffle flavor is strong) and also the potato puree trio (lobster, sour cream/onion, horseradish) which went well with the steak but it was just okay. service was helpful, friendly, and attentive.",

(i said that not the waiter lol) he loved it. he was smiling the whole time. he was happy that the waiter recommended the <mark>King Crab Legs</mark> because he loved them too! \n\ni ordered the kobe burger. i ordered it well done. i always order my meat well done. my burger came out kinda charred. not sure if it was the \"well-done\" factoring in. i actually had to cut the top and bottom off the patty so i could taste the flavor of the meat. it wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> a big deal. like i said i am not a big meat person. i didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> mind if my meat patty was 1/2 the size in the end. if i ate here again, i would def not order the burger. i was eying the <mark>Mary<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> Free Range Roasted Chicken</mark>.. maybe i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> get that next time. \n\nthe sides! the mac and cheese is a must order! we also ordered the scalloped potatoes which wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> amazingly good. for 2 people i would say one side order would<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> been adequate. we barely touched the potatoes. probably because i ate all the fries... \n\nmy husband wants to come back every time we are in vegas. yes, it made him that happy. and trust me this guy is hard to please!",

            "greetings from your resident picky eater.  i know you are probably surprised to see me write a review of a steak house considering i don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> like steak and normally these hoyty toyty establishments do not cater to those with a palate of a five year old.  \n\nlet me set the scene.  my husband advised me he is taking me out to dinner yet would not tell me where.  this alarms me because after knowing each other for nine years he still tries to surprise me by taking me to placing such as prime <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> and pf changs.  guess where we are going??  stripsteak.  apparently, you can get a coupon on restaurants.com and so he wanted to give it a try.  panic sets in as i am worried what will i eat.. again i don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> like steak and i especially don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> like a steak i would have to pay $50 dollars for.  my husband michael assures me he has looked over the menu and told me they have chicken dishes and even mac & cheese.\n\nupon arrival we are seating and the atmosphere is quite enjoyable.  michael had advised them we are there to celebrate my birthday.  it was two weeks ago but if i know my husband he was hoping to get a free dessert out of it.  there was a very nice happy birthday card placed at our table which i thought was a very nice touch.  \n\nlooking at the menu.. oh dear oh dear there is one chicken dish.. not chicken dishes (plural) as michael had indicated.  organic chicken it is.  michael opts for the kobe beef burger.  i order a corona and michael orders a pepsi.  (stay tuned as the pepsi will come into play later on in my story)\n\nwe are then provided a sample of the duck fat fries three ways with three different dipping sauces.  they consisted of old bay seasoned fries, rosemary garlic type fries, and plain duck fat fries.  the sauces were some mustard cr\\u00e8me nonsense (which kind of tasted like ranch), ketchup, and truffle aioli.  may i just say that the truffle aioli was amazing.  who would have thought it would win over ketchup in my mind.  while enjoying our delicious fries, michael is especially enter<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> in watching the people constantly stop to take pictures at their famous boob sculpture in the walkway to the conference center. \n\nmeal arrives.  my plate is very fancy with some onion jus drizzled around the plate and a lovely piece of chicken on top of some truffle mac & cheese.  michael wastes no time diving into his kobe burger for which i think he foodgasmed after the first bite.  now my chicken report.  it was delicious!!! so moist and flavorful - it better be for $30 bucks.  it had nice grill char marks on it which added to the flavor profile.  the mac and cheese was good as well but alert.. there were two broccoli thingies mixed in it and a couple of baby carrots!  this was not an invited guest to the party and i did not appreciate them hiding out under the chicken to surprise me.  luckily i was able to remove most of the little tree top specs and continue with my meal without incident.  i decided to share my chicken with michael.... \"this is not a normal chicken!\" he says as i think he was shared a spiritual moment with my chicken.  he then tried one of my baby carrots and asked for another.  against my better judgment i tried the smallest of bites possible of the carrot and holy cow it didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> even taste like a carrot.  it almost melted in my mouth - probably all the butter it was drenched in.  i that that was the first time i eat a carrot since i was forced to stay at the table until i finished them when i was 8.  \n\nthe meal has now ended.  our waiter asks if we would like to order dessert.  although the $700 glass of cognac was tempting we decided to pass.  michael was looking around wondering where is my happy birthday scoop of ice cream?  we then get the bill and i think michael about had a heart attack.  remember the pepsi i mentioned earlier?  well apparently they are $4 - each.   michael had four of them because they are served in those skinny bar glasses that you could finish in one sip!  so he paid $16 bucks for pepsi (not even coke!) that was $9 less then my corona.  i found it quite funny.  we did however receive two small bags of some sort of chocolate drizzled caramel popcorn which i didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> get the connection but thought was nice.  \n\nto summarize, although places like this are not my cup of tea i have to say i was pleasantly surprised.  be forewarned if ordering a soda that it is by the glass.  if i could offer any suggestions it would be to perhaps replace the broccoli bits with bacon in the truffle mac & cheese.  even with our $50 coupon we ended up paying about $50 dollars out of pocket (thanks to michael<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> soda binge) but this is a nice place for special occasion.", 
            "ate here last month with my boyfriend  while on our mini getaway trip. it was my first time,  his second time, so of course he was hype<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> it up- mainly the duck fat fries and the kobe beef tartare. let me inform you all that my bf is kinda closed minded when it comes to food so him eating raw-mooing-cow meat was effin crazy for me to hear! \n\nanyway, this place is good. michael mina, thank you. complimentary duck fat fries were bomb.com they were a bit salty, but so crunchy and cooked perfectly. they came in three different flavors with three different dipping sauces they were all yummy! \n\nkobe beef tartare: surprisingly good. the server brings the tartare and spices on a plate, explains each spice, asks if we are ok with each and then mixes it all in front of us. he then puts it in the bowl over ice, and it is served with grilled pita bread. it was awesome. i was skeptical\nabout eating raw meat, but if it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> kobe, i guess it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> fine?\n\nour main course was our steaks. i had the skirt steak and my bf had the 18oz <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark>. cant say anything bad about em. our sides were the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> and the scalloped potatoes. \n\ndessert: madagascar vanilla bean creme brulee with beignets oh-em-gee! my only complaint is that the serving was too small! i will gladly fly my ass back to vegas just for this.", 
            "by far the best steakhouse i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> ever been to. went there as one of the events for my friend<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> bachelor party/foodie weekend at vegas. the decor is very modern, with a small dining area (has booths as well as tables), a bar and a small lounging area. it was 5 people in our party, and as soon as we sat down, they brought out complimentary duck fat fries cooked 3 different ways: truffle, old bay and regular, and it came with dipping sauces. next 4 out of the 5 of us ordered the 18oz dry aged bone-<mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark>, medium rare (cuts like butter, very juicy). as a appetizer , we ordered the <mark>Roasted Bone Marrow</mark>, which was really good, but smaller than the other places i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> ordered the <mark>Roasted Bone Marrow</mark> at. for sides, we ordered the potato puree trio that comes in 3 different flavors: sour cream/onion, lobster, and horseradish. another side we ordered is a must, which is the truffle mac and cheese! it was so good.\n\noverall, the service was excellent, the food was great, but the place is pricey, but at the same time, you get what you paid for, so it was all worth it. i would highly recommend this place to other people, and i don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> know if i can ever have steak from other places cause this place just set the bar too high haha.",

            "very disappointing.\n\nfirst the ambiance. it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> extremely loud, almost to the point of not being able to hear the person across from you.  tables with no cloths and paper place mats.  that seems to be the thing with a lot of vegas steak houses now, charge premium prices but present a coffee shop atmosphere.  \n\nnone of that is as important as the food, of course.  we both love steak tartare, so we ordered that for the appetizer.  it was loaded with black pepper. so much so, that frankly, that<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> all i could taste.  \n\nthen a 50 minute wait for our main course.  at about 40 minutes i was getting irate and was just about to go complain when the general manager did stop by our table to apologize and say our food would be here shortly.  \n\nwhen the main course did finally arrive, the <mark>8 Oz <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> we both ordered were both cooked perfectly, and were melt-in-your-mouth delicous.  i ordered a <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> with mine, and it was small and chewy.  the sides  we ordered were average, not bad, but nothing great.\n\nthe service was friendly, but very poor. our server seemed a bit...how should i say this...out of it.  whenever she came to our table she had a huge smile on her face, as if she just a heard a hilarious joke.  but if i asked her a question about something, she didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> even respond, as if she didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> hear me.  i know it was loud in there, but you would think she could see me looking at her with my lips moving.  because of the 50 minute wait (during which we never saw her, by the way), we had finished our bottle of wine before the steaks even arrived, so i ordered another glass with our main course.   she finally brought it with desert. along with our coffee. sigh.  speaking of desert, it was fine, once again nothing special, but pretty good.\n\n$460.00 with tip for the two of us. that included a $120 bottle of wine.  it was just not worth it. craftsteak is much better, and delmonico is much much better.  \n\ni<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> baffled at all the rave reviews.  maybe we just hit it on a bad night?  or maybe a lot of people have just never been to a really good steak house?  i mean, yeah we did get the free french fries too, and they were tasty, but really, they<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> just french fries people", 
            "ter<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> service. bathroom experience cause me to gag and vomit slightly (bathrooms are not bussed per use and this is supposed to be classy, ventilation not good enough). i think bathrooms are the easiest way to rate an establishment. \n\nservers are not fair with time. i was made to wait several minutes to order my drinks while a fat, tattooed lazy and unprofessional server yucked it up with an intoxicated patron next to my table. i also saw servers with disgusting hepatitis looking tattoos and piercings and these are revolting to fine diners. \n\nsteaks are excellent (kobe <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>), <mark>Roasted Bone Marrow</mark> was good, beef tartare was very good. beet salad good. joseph phelps cabernet good. duck fat fries decent but cold. i wish they served them hot. \n\ni racked up $800 for 3 people and i felt the food was ok, but the service and the wine service and the bar service was slow, unprofessional and ter<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>. they need to hire a floor manager and a janitor for the bathroom. i firmly believe a night can be worth $300 a person, but the value and service needs to be there.",

            "compared to other steak houses i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> visited in las vegas, stripsteak is middle-of-the-road. if i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> going to spend a lot of money i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> rather dine at carnevino, cut, or delmonico. if i want a decent steak at a more affordable price, i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> go to twin creeks.\n\nmy wife and i arrived early -- about <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> hour before our reservation. the hostess still seated us promptly at a small circular two-top, but in the back of the lounge, in between the bar and the main dining area. it was very comfy -- her on a long bench with big cushions, me in an oversized chair -- but not ideal for eating a meal because of how low the chairs are in relation to the table. add to that the deafening sound of all the lounge chatter and music and it was difficult to have a conversation.\n\nthe food wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> bad at all. as a matter of fact, some of it was great. but, i think there<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> better value to be had elsewhere.\n\nto start you off, they bring out a complimentary trio of fries (old bay flavored, garlic herb, and truffle oil). all were some of the best fries i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> had, with the garlic herb being my favorite. they were perfectly crispy, light, and addictive. we had to force each other to stop eating them and save room for the rest of our food.\n\n//appetizers//\nsweet onion soup ($17) - morels, parmesan crouton. excellent depth in flavors, earthy and delicious mushrooms.\n\nmain <mark><mark>Grilled Maine Lobster</mark> Fritters</mark> ($20) - bacon-wrapped fritters. three per order. the <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> was masked by the oiliness and saltiness of the dish. but the crispness and coolness of the lettuce wrap was a nice compliment. not worth getting again.\n\n//entree and sides//\n10 oz. filet ($56). they were nice enough to split it for us since we wanted to share. ordered it medium rare, but it came out closer to rare. tender and savory, but not nearly as good as the filet at carnevino.\n\ntwo sides of <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> ($24 ea.). each order con<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> two meaty <mark>King Crab Legs</mark> with lemon. served cold, it could have benefitted from some drawn butter.\n\nshallot potato cakes ($9) - scallion creme fraiche. three cakes. perfectly crispy, great flavor... kinda like the greatest hash browns you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> ever have.\n\nenglish peas ($14) - shaved fennel, pancetta. peas are peas, nothing extraordinary, but the pancetta added a good bit of savoriness and salitness.\n\noverall, the food was pretty good, service not very attentive, the sommelier suggested a wine we weren<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> crazy about, seating was comfy but not functional, and it was too loud to carry a conversation. oh, and i forgot pricey. but we did have a $50 restaurant.com gift card that helped mitigate the damage.\n\n3.5 stars", 
            "recently went to strip steak on a quick weekend getaway and already wanting to go back! as some have noted below, we printed the restaurant.com $50 dollar gift certificate and had no problems using it. i had made a reservation a couple weeks before on their online site, but when we arrived at 7:30 on a saturday, they seemed to have plenty of tables available. \n\ngot our complimentary duck fries and they were d-e-e-e-licious. our waiter glen ran through the list of daily specials, but we already knew exactly what we wanted (i always come prepared.. haha). i got the 10oz filet with the mac and cheese and my fianc\\u00e9 got the kansas city strip with the scalloped potatoes. i was surprised by how fast we got our food (although like i said.. the restaurant was maybe 3/4 full). the mac and cheese seemed to be plentiful (although it was so delicious i wanted to eat it all by myself!) but the scalloped potatoes (imo) wouldn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> have been enough for just the two of us to split, so i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> glad we got two sides. my medium rare filet was so good that i was getting depressed eating that last piece. service was excellent, always filling our drinks and coming by to ask if we needed anything else. used our coupon and had no problems with that. didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> have any room for dessert, although i think we would have had we not filled up on fat tuesday drinks beforehand! the place was a little noisy, so if you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> looking for a quiet dinner, this is probably not the place for you. we were looking for delicious food to fill up on and not a conversation. :p overall, a wonderful experience and dinner and i will absolutely make it a stop on my next trip to vegas!",

            "the skinny: a step up on the regular steakhouse, this place delivers some good eats with finesse and occasional missteps - don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> order the duck fat fries because it comes as a sizable amuse bouche (4) service: our waiter/servers were great but there are major issues with the hostess stand (3) value: considering the plethora of deals on restaurant.com, this place can be a good value if you order right (4).\n\nmy hubby was hankering to take me here for a while and we finally got a chance to try the menu at stripsteak.\n\nafter passing by multiple restaurants with hostesses soliciting our business, we were taken aback by the inefficient hostess. by our seating time, there was least 3-4  group of guests gathered around the hostess desk. she basically ignored the diners and the wait staff  who lined to find out how to seat us. \n\nshe also didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> tell us about ongoing promotions at the restaurant: ie, the 3-course prix fixe menu for $55, or that they are currently having a half-priced happy hour lounge menu from 4-7pm. plus, they don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> offer  you their prix fixe menu unless you specifically ask for it... even when you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> seated at the table. for this reason, despite the stellar service at our table, the service gets 3 stars.\n\nmichael mina is known for preparing a dish in three different ways. so obviously our amuse bouche consisted of bay-seasoned, garlic herb, truffled duck fat fries served with accompanying truffle aioli, ketchup and mustard/bay-seasoned sauce. the fries had a lovely crispness that re<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> its texture even when it cooled off. the sauces were lovely especially the truffle aioli. i considered drinking the remaining dregs of it on the bottom but decided i still needed to save my appetite for food we<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> ordered. \n\nthe soups were solid but nothing special. the vidalia onion soup accentuated the sweetness of onion but the croutons really lack that nice crunch. the seafood chowder was  good - the broth was a little on the milder side which allowed for the diner to get the full flavour of the crab when eaten.\n\nthe <mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark> sliders had the right flavour however the bun was definitely overly large considering the serving of foie on the inside. the plating would have been infinitely improved with having the bun on the side.\n\nby far the standout was our bone-in rib-eye. it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> rare to see me shovel down an entire steak the size of a catcher<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> mitt all on my own but there was not a scrap of meat left on that plate. yes, it is that good. the carmelized crust on the meat was so wonderful, the inside so tender and well-seasoned ... it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> hard to find steak that well-prepared. \n\nit was lovely that they provided a small tasting of three sides along with the rib-eye. the peas were okay - a little on the mealier side of things. the truffled mac <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> cheese is always great - perfect consistency, texture and flavour. unfortunately, the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> had a rather bitter unpleasant undertone.\n\nthe hubby<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> grilled chicken (they don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> fry a serving of chicken unless two people order) was a very large portion. <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> grilled chicken - a lovely crispy skin, tender and moist on the inside - on top of their wonderful mac <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> cheese. who wouldn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> like this?\n\nwe topped off our very filling meal with a root beer float and warm chocolate chip cookies. we loved the fact that the ice cream was so cold, it turned our creamy root beer into a nice slush. the chocolate chip cookies were a delight - not too sweet,cool enough to have a mild crust on the outside with melting chocolate on the inside.\n\noverall, we had a wonderful meal for a very reasonable price due to the restaurant.com certificate. we ordered one prix fixe meals ($55 + $10 supplement for the steak) plus two starters (<mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark> $22; onion soup: $17) and one entree (chicken $30). subtract the $50 restaurant.com certificate (we got at bargain basement prices), the meal ended up being $118.97 (including tax and 18% tip) which is reasonable considering the quantity and quality of the cuisine. definitely a solid four star review.",

            "have i been living like a baller the past couple days or what? \n\nfather in law is staying at mandalay bay for a convention this week, so after watching the tigers game at the sports book, we ventured out to find some grub and a few drinks for catching up. after looking at several menus we decided on strip steak. wife<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> pops is probably the biggest fan of steak in the world. yeah, you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> probably met a steak lover before. not like this guy though. \n\nfor starters, the place is right off the restaurant mall-ish area when you are walking from the casino back to wards the shark reef and chapel are. familiar to me since i got married there! it is a little loud and not as intimate as your typical high end steak house, but that is to be expected considering the location and the fact it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> called \"strip\" steak. \n\nvery extensive wine and cock<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> list sure to please anything you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> crave. the dinner menu was impressive as well, featuring a massive selection of steaks from any quality and cut you could imagine. there were also your typical sea food selections and the ala-carte sides you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> grown to love from a nice steak house, <mark>Baked Potato</mark>, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, etc. let us get back to the important part - the steaks. \n\nwe were lucky enough to be sat close enough to see the giant wood fire grill system set up in the kitchen and the meat lockers with giant slabs of meat. now that sounds pretty weird, but it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> cool to see them wheel the grills up and down while your choice cut is being prepared. in theory, they could put a name-tag on your selection and you could watch them cook it. \n\nour table ordered the east coast oysters of which i only had one. it was perfect though. the wedge salad looked impressive, but had a cheap store bought like bleu cheese dressing instead of the crumbled bleu cheese you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> expect on a steak house chop salad. pass. \n\ni selected the bone in rib-eye. it was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing. the steak was well marbled, just the right amount of char, and seasoned the way a steak should be. no fancy sauces tonight. i also had the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> i mentioned above, and it wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> that good. they sprinkled what seemed like bacos (gross) on the top, which were really pointless. also, they spinach was not as creamy as a <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> should be. am i being picky about spinach? i suppose, but for as proud of the menu (think $$$$) as this place was, they better do it all right. \n\noverall it was a great meal. i had a few cock<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> from the bar, and my two counterparts enjoyed some wine. the cock<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> are served with one giant ice cube which is an interesting touch, as it did not water  down my drink as fast as a normal ice having drink would have. \n\ni saved the best for last. when your server hands you your menus, there is a snack of three types of fries served at the table, with three dipping sauces. one set of fries is fried in duck fat. absolutely not gross. paired with the truffle dipping sauce, they were probably the best fries i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> ever had in the history of me eating fries. they were so good i almost ordered a hamburger at a steak house, just so i could have the side of fries it would have come with. \n\n4 stars out of 5 for the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> thingy and the less than impressive wedge salad. \n\nnote: if you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> an out of town-er looking for a pregame meal before your main event of a drink filled excellent adventure on the strip, you could do much worse, and i can<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> imagine you could do a ton better. great service, nice bar, and even with a convention in the same building were able to seat us without a reservation.", 
            "after reading about this place, i knew it would be something good! \n\nstripsteak is located in mandalay bay, where all the restaurants are, before the mandalay bay conference rooms and ballrooms. \n\nwhen you walk up (hopefully with reservations as this place gets busy!) there is a full bar with a seating area. luckily, we were able to get a table without reservations at 7:00pm on a monday night. they sat us at a nice table, right in the middle of the action. it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> a tad loud in there so bring your listening skills. \n\nafter you are seated and given the menu, they bring out three little con<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> with french fries and dipping sauces. now these are not your mcdonald<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> fries. these are the most amazing fries you will ever have. \n\nthe first one had french fries with old bay seasoning and a mustard herb dipping sauce. \n\nthe second one had french fries with oregano and ketchup. \n\nthe third one was knock-your-socks off amazing. french fries in duck fat with truffle dipping sauce. are you fucking kidding me?!?! the minute we all tried these we all looked at each other and said \"these are goddamn delicious!\" \n\nall three had fantastic flavor with good crisp on the outside. \n\nbut yea- duck fat + french fries + truffle = smiling faces. \n\nour table ordered: \nstarters- \noysters (in a <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark>)- east coast style. they ask you if you want them east coast or west coast style. the difference? east coast are \"larger and briny-er\", west coast are \"smaller and sweeter\" according to our server. \nthe oysters were delicious! they had came with cock<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> sauce, lemon, and other toppings. the cock<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> sauce had some nice horseradish in it for the perfect combination. \n\nwedge salad- bleu cheese, bacon & polenta croutons, red chili cucumbers. i was told that it was disappointing as the bleu cheese dressing didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> have any bleu cheese chucks and tasted \"like it came out of the store\" \n\nmain- \n18 oz. dry-aged bone-<mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark>- heard it was delicious. they cook the steaks on this beautiful open flame wood burning grill. you can watch the chefs using the wheel up and down to get the steaks. heard that the marble was good and had great char on the steak. nothing fancy just cooked perfect (medium-rare plus) \n\n16 oz. kansas city strip- great char, great flavor, all round good steak. \n\n<mark>Diver Scallops</mark>- which is what i ordered. four deliciously tender, cooked perfectly, great flavored scallops. seared nicely. \n\nsides- \n<mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> w/ bacon- i love <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> and this was up to par, but nothing crazy. the bacon doesn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> really add anything to the dish. \n\nroasted maitake mushrooms- great roasted mushrooms. not much else to say. they are always a good side to seafood and steaks. \n\nwe had a couple of glasses of wine (a cab-combination) that was really good and i would order all day long! \n\ni cannot wait to go back for more duck fat and truffle and oysters and more food in general!", 
            "before i explain why i am rating this restaurant a two star, i want to express that my food and and beverages were exceptional.  the beverages were superbly prepared and decorated and the appetizers, side items, main courses and desserts were all eclectic, astonishing and delicious.  with that said, the problems with my experience started from the moment i sat down.  as i scanned thru the food menu, drinks menu and prices, our waiter sidled up and announced the specials.  he was not very personable and seemed unconcerned that we had chosen this restaurant to dine in for the evening. understanding that some people can lack in some areas but make it up in others, i left my thoughts aside and decided to enjoy my dining experience.  the second setback arrived when i placed my wine order.  the waiter had no idea which wine i selected, even though i also pointed to it in the wine menu.  eventually he returned with multiple bottles for me to choose from.  this took a lot longer than it should have for me to order a bottle of wine and was very unprofessional, especially considering how high the prices are.  the waiter then left the table and did not open the bottle in front of us.  i ordered a $90 <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> of wine and i could see the waiter 20 feet away from us, with his back to our table, haggling with this bottle of wine.  when he finally returned to the table, i was over it.  the support staff were all amazing, helpful and smiling, however, our waiter never cracked a smile.  he seemed unskilled and miserable.  when we finished our meal we made him aware that we would have dessert but needed some time to relax.  after dessert he eagerly brought us our bill.  i have been made aware of a couple of service features of strip steak since this experience which have maddened me further.  after a meal, there is a complimentary bag of chocolate kettle corn presented to the guests.  we were not made aware of this kind gesture because our waiter was in a hurry to have us leave the restaurant.  also, i am a local now, which i revealed to our waiter, and i am told that strip steak carries a locals menu, although he was not concerned enough to present one to us.  our bill was over $500 for three people and even though gratuity was added, it was not deserved.  i will always tip wait staff in any situation, but when that situation is a negative one i tend to never return to the restaurant again.  if you are like me when it comes to good professional service, i would suggest you skip this restaurant as well.  on a side note, a female member of our party visited the restroom facilities, which are unisex, and she walked in on a gentleman who had not locked the door.  she was very embarrassed by this and mentioned it to our waiter.  he seemed offended that we had an issue with the restroom policy of the restaurant and acted as if it were our problem.  our only suggestion was that they have a dedicated woman<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> restroom and that others could remain unisex.",

it was still a single piece, just sliced in half. this made it too thin, overcooked, and dry. the bread (i tasted it, to be fair) was dry and pretty bland. the garnishes were ok. a single piece of arugula and a bright little cherry gelee of sorts. overall, high hopes dashed.\n\nduck <mark>Crab Spring Rolls</mark> (3.5/5) - generous portion and, i was happily surprised, not too heavy. the wrapper was thin and crispy, although a tad (a smidgeon?) too oily. again, however, it was not heavy. the crisp veggies did well to set off the richness of the duck. the meat was well seasoned and had a great flavor. it was a bit dry in spots. i am going to blame presentation and delivery (heat lamps?) versus cooking as it was mostly at the cut edges of the rolls.\n\nheirloom tomato salad (8/5, yes, seriously) - fresh, fresh tomatoes, creamy, rich burrata cheese that didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> weight it down in any way, and the perfect amount of a tangy, sweet, beautiful 25-year old balsamic vinegar that has had me drooling for the past 12 hours.\n\n<mark>16 Oz Ny Strip</mark> (4/5) - slightly overcooked based on our order. we were a bit surprised as the server said they tend to undercook slightly... still, it was a fantastic cut of meat, very well seasoned, and perfectly tender and flavorful. the sides of sauteed mushrooms (another 8/5) and creamed corn with jalapeno (4/5) were great complements.\n\n<mark>Mary<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> Free Range Roasted Chicken</mark> (4/5) - a tad on the dry side in places, the overall dish was fabulous. i love that they left the skin on; i don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> eat the skin, but it imparted a rich flavor to the meat and left those portions really juicy and tender. the truffled mac n<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> (4/5) was really good. almost too much truffle, not enough cheese, and because it was used as the bed for the chicken, it picked up other flavors (meat, greens, sauces) that detracted from it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> own amazing profile.\n\nvanilla bean creme brulee and biegnets (5/5) - the brulee was creamy, perfectly flavored, and delicious. the biegnets were expertly fried, hot and cripsy and dusted with powered sugar without being overly dressed. another de<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> we thought was fantastic, sis<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> dessert came out presented with the words happy birthday in a sweet, dark chocolate!\n\nwines (5/5, nail on the head every time). we started with a pinot gris and a viogner, then with the help of gabriel, the sommelier, chose a fruity, dry-ish oregon pinot noir to go with the meal. we spoke for a moment on trying something new, price points, and flavor profiles (what we liked and what we ordered). given the whole picture, his recommendation was well received and the perfect wine for everything we ate.\n\nthe service was good, though the server could have visited us a little more often. there were a few large parties so we were happy to wait a little here and there, and as other staff were also happy to smile, ask if you needed anything, and be of service, it was not a dark spot at all. \n\nall in all, a solid, enjoyable meal.\n\nwith the restaurant week menu (50.11 each), the 2 wines by the glass and the bottle, plus the additional <mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark>, our total was $300 and change. bonus tip: they are on restaurant.com so another $50 saved!",

            "with so many options in las vegas, i have to say i was surprisingly underwhelmed with stripsteak. this statement may seem incorrect, but allow me to explain. in las vegas there are so many amazing restaurants that they each need to compete to stay on top, or at the very least - relevant. i didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> feel that stripsteak was even trying. \n\nthe decor made me feel like i was in a cafeteria. the way the tables were placed and the type of chairs they had looked like a food court in a mall or cafeteria. it wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> impressive at all. the menu didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> have anything on it that really stood out to me either. it was a standard steak house menu- which isn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> something to complain about, since i love steak, but the steak i had wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> even that good. - a little background on me- it takes a lot for me to dislike any steak. i love steak. this steak in particular was just boring. it wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> cooked medium rare- it was more on the medium well side- which is fine too, but when you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> paying $50 for a steak it should probably be cooked the way you requested. it also lacked flavor. it was just blah. i never in my life had such an expensive boring meal. \n\nthe upside- the french fries. the different french fries that they bring to each table as opposed to bread are phenomenal- and also the reason for 2 stars as opposed to 1. \n\ni<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> sorry to the stripsteak fans, but for me stripsteak is a massive let down.", 
            "i dined at stripsteak prior to going to a concert and i can honestly say that everything about this place was disappointing. the service was ter<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>! the drinks are way overpriced and they don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> even give you a full martini. we had to ask for bread or something because after 45 minutes we had nothing at our table. it took 50 minutes for carpaccio and a wedge salad. seriously... they didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> have to cook anything. my fillet was good but nothing special. my husband and i were very disappointed since we had both heard good stuff about this place. i would recommend sw steakhouse or boa steakhouse instead.",

            "i had a very good meal here, but nothing blew me away. given the reputation of the chef and the price paid, that is disappointing. my friend and i were seated about 15 minutes after our reservation time. dana white and a group of ufc fighters were dining in the restaurant as well during the time of our visit. in fact i came pretty close to smacking the guy in the crotch when he walked by our table and i was in mid stretch. so yeah, as other have mentioned, the tables are packed pretty close together here. in addition to nearly smacking a guy in the crotch, the closeness of the tables also meant hearing a lot of other people<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> conversations. the nice older woman next to us started to tell some of the most expletive filled stories after a few glasses of wine. i did like that it was a relaxed atmosphere for fine dining. my wrinkle free shirts hadn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> stayed as wrinkle free as i would have liked in my luggage and being sort on time i put on a black t-shirt and tried for the steve jobs look. i thought i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> look out of place, but lots of people were dressed casually. \n\nour server was in a bit of a rush at first. all of his tables were sat at the same time including ours, but later in the night, as things calmed down, he came over and chatted with us for a bit. the guy was right on with all his suggestions. the service was good overall. \n\nfor appetizers we had the <mark><mark>Grilled Maine Lobster</mark> Fritters</mark> and east coast oysters. the fritters were <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> in bacon, fried and served with butter lettuce and creme fraiche. you know anything made with that combination of ingredients is going to be good and it was, but it was just good. i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not usually one to talk about the concept of a dish, but when i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> in a place like stripsteak i am hoping for something unique. this dish didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> strike me as being anything that unique as much as it was a bunch of delicious stuff that got fried. we also received our complimentary fries and while they were all good, the one that really stood out was the truffled one.\n\nmy friend and i both had the bone-<mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> as our entree. hate to say it, but it was slightly overcooked. i kept cutting into it hoping it was just the char from the wood burning grill that made it seem less pink than a medium rare should have been, but my steak was mostly medium until i got very close to the bone. this was a shame since it was a very good cut of meat. my friend had his with <mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark> and it was a great combination. he also had the chipotle scalloped potatoes recommended by our server and they were excellent. i went old school and got a <mark>Baked Potato</mark>. the overcooked steak was probably the biggest disappointment of the night.\n\nwe were both stuffed, but after such a heavy meal i wanted something sweet to end the night. we both went with the beignets. i had the one with chocolate, pudding, and macallan 18. i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> eat anything with macallan 18 in it. it was a decent beignet. a little bit denser than i would have liked, but probably done so because it was intended to be dipped into the pudding. again, a good dessert, but nothing amazing. the best part was probably the macallan. my friend had the same thing but with creme brulee instead of pudding.\n\nso yeah, that was pretty much the story of the night. good food and good service, but nothing we had really wowed me. my friend raves about his steak with <mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark>, but it was his first time having <mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark> so i guess we all remember our first time ;) i think the only item that was really memorable to me was the truffled fries.",

(it did taste great re hashed in my breakfast burrito the next morning however.)\n\nmy only dessert choice was a root beer float. creative, if your 5 years old. slow service and food below par. maybe if i hadn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> been on a pre fix menu it would have been better. with all the choices in vegas, it will be tough to get me back.",

(and they need it)\n\nsteaks do not come with condiments, so for a 50-60 dollar steak, assume another 20-30 bucks in potatoes and/or veggies. i had the scalloped something or other which was all in all - gross.\n\nthe steak (rib) itself was good. was it 60 dollars good? no. but one of the better things to eat at mandalay and that<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not saying much.\n\nthey also keep trying to push their stupid fake kobe beef on you. man - it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not kobe. kobe beef is made under stringent and incredible conditions in japan and <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> won<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> let it in the country, as i hear. this is <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>. so don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> get sucked in. the cow did not drink any beer before getting massaged, and tattooed like they do in tokyo. \n\nthe other thing we noticed is that its the busboys, both here and at china grill, that do the place justice from a service perspective. our busboy (busman really) - victor, was awesome, fun, polite, respectful and free of that ever present vegas-condescending, elitist attitude that is spread around the hotel, and inhaled by most staff members.\n\nif you need to have steak at mandalay, go here if you don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> want to walk for 4 minutes to charlie palmer at the adjoining 4 seasons. otherwise, walk on by",

            "a big group of us went for dinner the other night, and we essentially got a tasting menu of sorts.  there were a few things that were only okay, but on the whole, everything was really really good. and yes, they do a trio of french fries to start.  i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> noticed michael mina loves doing things in threes, and this place is no different.\n\nduck <mark>Crab Spring Rolls</mark> - tasty, but nothing to knock your socks off.\nkobe <mark><mark>8 Oz <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> Tartare</mark> - very tender, very good. some of the best tartare i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> had\n<mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> & Hamachi Poppers</mark> - loved these.  just little circles of crispy rice with a little bit of fish on top with some vinegar/soy sauce concoction \n\ni hope i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> att<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> the reviews to the right meats, but was rather drunk by this point, so here goes:\n<mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark> - very tender and flavorful, but maybe even a little over seasoned. \n<mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> - amazing.  tender, flavorful, and not gussied up by a lot of seasoning.  \nstrip - good, but definitely liked the other two better.  \n\nfor the sides, we had the broccolini, spinach, mac & cheese, and potato puree trio.  all of them were good, but i especially liked the mac & cheese and horseradish potato.  \n\nall in all, it came out to about $150 per person (including tip) with a bunch of wine. so yes, it is pretty expensive, but it definitely is some very good food.",

(i like my fried foods as hot as they can get).\n\nmy fiance ordered the <mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark>, and i ordered the rib-eye.  they butter poach their steaks, which makes them juicy and delicious!  i enjoyed my rib-eye, but the <mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark> was superior by far.  we ordered wine with dinner, but i can<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> remember what we ordered.  \n\nas far as sides, we ordered the creamed bacon spinach and potato puree 3 ways (one was with lobster, one with horseradish, and one was cheesy i think?).  the <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> potatoes were soooo good.  they were amazing.  i liked the bite of the horseradish ones, and the cheesy ones were also very good.  the creamed bacon spinach had a liquid smoke flavor, which i was indifferent about.  it was good, but i think i would try something else next time.  i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> just not a huge fan of artificial smoke flavor.  \n\nfiance ordered a cappuccino for dessert.  it was above average, good for a steak house.  \n\nall in all, i would definitely like to come here again, but i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> be trying out other steak places before my return.  i would definitely get the <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> again, and the <mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark>.",

            "***stripsteak is a typical michael mina restaurant that provides safe and consistently good cuisine, which is a plus in las vegas given the mediocre and overpriced food that you will often find here (even at acclaimed restaurants)***\n\nthere is definitely a comforting consistency with michael mina restaurants regardless of the location. you are likely to have at least a satisfying dinner at a michael mina restaurant because his cuisine focuses on quality ingredients and tried and true flavor combinations. michael mina restaurants though do not veer much from his style so i am rarely surprised by his food.\\u00a0\n\nmichael mina in san francisco is his best restaurant; that restaurant definitely has a few real high points though its food would not compete with san francisco<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> best high-end cuisine. i remember finding michael mina in las vegas being good but nothing memorable. their menu has changed quite a bit over the years and seasonality seems to be playing a larger role so maybe i need to give them another shot.\\u00a0\n\nstripsteak in mandalay bay is a michael mina steakhouse. it has all the trademarks of a michael mina restaurant with asian influences throughout the menu and a variety of high quality beef available to order.\\u00a0like michael mina<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> arcadia in san jose, stripsteak starts you off with a complimentary trio of fries and sauces. fries with different seasonings like truffle oil as well as different sauces like curry ketchup and mustard aioli. the fries were hot, crispy and definitely addictive.\\u00a0\n\ni tried two of their beef cuts. the best was the <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>. this beef was very rich, juicy and tender. it did not match the best <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> had, which was at splendido in toronto. that canadian restaurant not only delivered an exceptionally rich and juicy meat but also an incredible bark that was crispy and smoky. still, this was the kind of beef course many would love because it was as flavorful as it was juicy and tender.\\u00a0\n\nthe other steak was disappointing. it was a prime bone-<mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark>. the steak was too thin so there was not that great contrast between a nice sear and a thick and juicy center. while it was by no means a bad steak, it would definitely not be in the same category of excellent thick <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> you can get at a high-end steakhouse like mastro<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>.\\u00a0the steak was garnished with complimentary <mark>Roasted Bone Marrow</mark>. i also added <mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark>, which was fine but too pricey.\n\nfor sides, i had the pork belly <mark>Spicy Fried Rice</mark> that was mixed with carrots and peas. the <mark>Spicy Fried Rice</mark> was quite spicy, which definitely differentiated it from a lot of <mark>Spicy Fried Rice</mark> dishes i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> had. i enjoyed the heat though i am not sure if this is the best pairing for simply prepared and seasoned steaks. i also tried the asparagus with yuzu butter. the asparagus was thin and tender and not too bitter. the butter sauce was not too heavy and provided a good citrus element to the asparagus.\\u00a0\n\nfor dessert, i had the beignets with three sauces. the beignets were fairly good. they were light and pillowy though not as airy as the best beignets i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> had at restaurants like village pub and spruce in the bay area as well as what i used to enjoy at the now closed hatfield<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> in los angeles.\\u00a0\n\nthe sauces were not sauces as much as they were mini desserts. there was a very good creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e with rich and thick vanilla custard and a crispy caramelized sugar top. there was also a salted caramel pot de creme that was sweet and salty as well as very thick. the last sauce was a butterscotch pudding. the pudding was creamy and the bitter burn was definitely noticeable.\\u00a0\n\nservice was good--friendly and polite. it is a loud and frenetic restaurant so it is no surprise that the service might have been a little less attentive and personable as some other high-end restaurants i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> tried.\\u00a0\n\nprices are high, but it is las vegas. i think stripsteak is within the same price range as other high-end and celebrity chef backed restaurants in las vegas.\\u00a0\n\nas mentioned, stripsteak is a loud restaurant. it is dark, contemporary and definitely energetic. i did like how while the restaurant was very close to the casino, a lot of the seating was very deep into the restaurant so guests are not bothered by the cigarette smoke that engulfs a lot of las vegas. i did find the chairs, which had low backs, to be slightly too uncomfortable for a long dinner.\\u00a0\n\nstripsteak is a perfectly fine las vegas steakhouse. i think stripsteak really separates itself from other steakhouses i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> been to across the country with its sides. the sides here are more interesting and taste fresher than typical steakhouse fare. \\u00a0the <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> was very good while the <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> was disappointing. if you are a big steak fan, i would recommend carnevino, which delivers thicker and more memorable beef, but stripsteak seems to offer excellent choices from starter

(more on that below.)  additionally, sides were served \"family style.\"  broccolini, pureed potatoes of three flavors (sour cream and chive, lobster, and i can<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> remember the other), and truffle mac and cheese.  the truffle mac and cheese was the highlight for many of my guests (the ones that didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> order steak.)\n\nahh yes, the steak.  peruse their menu and you will see that michael mina doesn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> drive to a corner butcher to get his cuts.  with all respect to usda grading of beef, this night required a little international flavor...in the form of...\n\nworld wide wagyu.\n\nanyone who has done steak research knows that japanese beef is luxurious but also a curiosity.  \"kobe sliders\" at your local bar and grill for $12 have more in common with an aging basketball player than they do true kobe beef.  even cows that are designated \"wagyu\" may not be imported from japan.  so, this mini world tour consisted of three cuts of wagyu (beef derived from a line of japanese cows that are bred in other countries.)  these cuts:\n\n<mark><mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> . Australian Wagyu</mark> <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> - <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> is the new trendy top cut of meat.  it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> generally the best couple ounces of your <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark>, made even better when it comes from a well-marbled <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>.  this cut had a perfect sear and set all my umami sensors afire.\n\n<mark><mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> . Australian Wagyu</mark> short rib - tender, fall-apart, as if it were braised.

            "it was good.. but not great. \n\nthey offered two complimentary appetizers to begin with:\n1. 3 small selections of pommes frites: paprika, truffle, and duck fat each accompanied with their own dipping sauce.\nmy favorite has got to be the truffle pommes frites. \n\n2. garlic / cheese / rosemary flatbread.\n\nas expected the price was high. but for what i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> ordered: a 12oz skirt steak, medium-rare. i expected to have better presentation. not just a slab of beef on a white plate with a <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> baby carrot and small roasted onion as the side. i guess i was expecting a little more show for the price i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> paying.\n\nmy steak was cooked perfectly and it was juicy (well it better be for the price i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> paying). but it was nothing special. i don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> know - it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> hard to explain.. i mean i enjoyed my steak, but it was not memorable.\n\ni ordered a side of truffle mac & cheese. i enjoyed it a lot. it definitely has the truffle and cheese - i dont mind eating the whole thing by myself.\n\nmy friend ordered a seared <mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> steak.. which was not good at all. the tuna did not have any fresh tuna taste (not saying it was not fresh.. but a good tuna has a fresh taste).. this one here was kinda bland. like a fake watered down tuna taste (dunno if that even make sense, but that<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> how i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> desc<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> it). i know i know, why would u even order fish at a steakhouse, right? but hey, i still think that if you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> going to charge people that price, at least make it look good, even if it doesn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> taste good. \n\nthe presentation for each dish was kinda boring.", 
            "i liked that they gave us complimentary bread and fries.  i liked that they kept filing my glass with water.  and i like that my food came out quickly.  i had my <mark>Ahi Tuna</mark>, which came out as a filet. nice and plump.  however, everything here was just decent for me.  nothing spectacular.", 
            "we had a great meal here but it definitely wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> the 5-star experience i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> come to expect of michael mina establishments.\n\nmaybe it was because we waited so long with a reservation and after coming back within 20 minutes, as they suggested, we waited about 10 more. or the fact that we were seated right next to the entrance which didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> make for a romantic setting (more like mall dining despite the glass barrier). or that we told a number of people it was our anniversary and no one acknowledged it despite all the other restaurants we visited during the anniversary trip doing so). not sure...but our server was friendly, the recommended wine was tasty and the food was good so 4 stars you get.\n\nduck fat fries trio=awesome.\nwe adored the tuna and <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> & Hamachi Poppers</mark>\nwas shockingly not a fan of the duck <mark>Crab Spring Rolls</mark> which were too gamey\nmac and cheese = most awesome\nscallops were tasty but a little underdone for my tastes.\nhusband like the steak but didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> find it super memorable.\n\nall in all if you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> in vegas and want mm, i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> suggest nob hill tavern instead.", 
            "we decided to go here for my husband<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> birthday (halloween night). also, a few friends highly recommended this place. so we decided to give it a try. we reserved for two. we did not have to wait at all. they seated us at a small cozy table. \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> & Hamachi Poppers</mark> for the appetizer. the husband loved it, but i thought it was okay. \n\nthe husband ordered the kobe steak with <mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark> with a side of scalloped potatoes. the side was fantastic, the <mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark> gave the steak lots of flavor, but not amazing. \n\ni ordered the special that night, which was a <mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark> bone-in with <mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark> with a side of mac & cheese. the mac & cheese was fantastic! both of our steaks were cooked perfectly.\n\nthe service here was great. they were always refilling our drinks. at the end it did take a tab bit longer to get our check, but the service overall was good. plus, the place was super packed.\n\noverall, the sides were more amazing than the entrees. the steaks were good, but not mind blowing. at the end of the night, we were disappointed. most likely we will not be coming back anytime soon or in the future.", 
            "a big group of us went for dinner the other night, and we essentially got a tasting menu of sorts.  there were a few things that were only okay, but on the whole, everything was really really good. and yes, they do a trio of french fries to start.  i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> noticed michael mina loves doing things in threes, and this place is no different.\n\nduck <mark>Crab Spring Rolls</mark> - tasty, but nothing to knock your socks off.\nkobe <mark><mark>8 Oz <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> Tartare</mark> - very tender, very good. some of the best tartare i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> had\n<mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> & Hamachi Poppers</mark> - loved these.  just little circles of crispy rice with a little bit of fish on top with some vinegar/soy sauce concoction \n\ni hope i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> att<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> the reviews to the right meats, but was rather drunk by this point, so here goes:\n<mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark> - very tender and flavorful, but maybe even a little over seasoned. \n<mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> - amazing.  tender, flavorful, and not gussied up by a lot of seasoning.  \nstrip - good, but definitely liked the other two better.  \n\nfor the sides, we had the broccolini, spinach, mac & cheese, and potato puree trio.  all of them were good, but i especially liked the mac & cheese and horseradish potato.  \n\nall in all, it came out to about $150 per person (including tip) with a bunch of wine. so yes, it is pretty expensive, but it definitely is some very good food.", 
            "got the ahi & <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> & Hamachi Poppers</mark>, duck <mark>Crab Spring Rolls</mark>, wedge salad, kansas city strip, and beignets with creme brule.  all of the food was decent but the ambiance just wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> there with too many waiters running around our table.", 
            "omg wow the tuna tartare appetizer is the bomb (ahi and <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> & Hamachi Poppers</mark>). the ponzu sauce is perfect with it, too. i could have eaten 3 dishes.\n\nmashed potato trio: big portions!!! wasabi: not too spicy. lobster: delicate and sweet. sour cream and chive: like a pureed mashed potato\n\nduck fat fries: not bad. all three were different enough, and all three were good. i liked the two white dipping sauces that came with them, too.\n\nnice and thoughtful (and free!) congratulations ice cream for the bride to be in our group, and a couple portions of caramel corn to top it off! this was a seriously great experience.\n\nthere were 11 of us, and the waiter apologized twice for the long wait, but there really wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> a long wait for our food at all. nothing i would have ever complained about. i thought it was odd he was apologizing because i just thought it was a normal wait. they need to turn down the ac though! it was super cold =(", 
            "wanting to surprise my fianc\\u00e9 with a trip to vegas, i planned everything in advance including dinner reservations. we ended up dining at stripsteak and bouchon for our main dinners, and stripsteak took a notable second place for me out of those two experiences. the food is delicious and the service is great -- there<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not a question there. i had the tuna and it was cooked to perfection. my fianc\\u00e9 had the bone-<mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> and seemed to be in heaven. we split the bleu cheese scalloped potatoes as a side and started with the <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> & Hamachi Poppers</mark>, both of which were exceptional. aside from that, we each had a couple of cock<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> and noshed on their complimentary trio of fries (the truffle fries and aioli -- nom!). still, we somehow managed to tally up quite the bill, which is where my uncer<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> lies. around $230 for the two of us. again, no wine. just a couple of cock<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> each (sub-$15). we did have a restaurant.com gift certificate which helped, but we were still both a little surprised by the cost of the meal. it was good, but not so memorable where it was worth that investment (at least not in my book). \n\nthe ambiance wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> totally what i expected either. i was expecting something a bit more bouchon-esque (a little more closed off, dark wood, etc.), but instead the space was pretty modern and open. it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> a place that you could go on a date just as easily as you could make it a guys night out. not overly intimate in its surroundings, though still very nice.\n\nall in all, i thought it was a very good meal. not exceptional, and -- for me -- not worth the cost when there are so many other exceptional restaurants offering something bit more unique and equally delicious for the same price point. still, i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> happy that i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> checked a michael mina restaurant off the list. i just think i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> have been happier giving that money to bobby flay at mesa grill. :)", 
            "yum.\n\ncomlimentary trio of fries: truffle, garlic herb and old bay, with matching sauces. tried to stop eating them but could not.\n\nstarter salad: wedge with blue cheese. i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> had this before. why was this one so good?\n\n<mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> tartare starter on crispy rice: adorable presentation, sizable portion and extremely flavorful.\n\nkansas city strip steak and side of jalape\\u00f1o creamed corn: steak cooked perfectly. corn slightly underdone gave amazing texture with creamy sauce and background of heat. yum. \n\namazing addition: all dishes were split between myself and my husband. no questions asked and no sneers given! each dish was presented on separate plates, neatly split for us. classy.\n\nservice was impeccable yet friendly. sommelier was the most approachable of any i have encountered, yet adequately knowledgeable. atmosphere was lively and pleasant. modern, clean design. \n\ntopper: complimentary dessert to take home. popcorn drizzled with chocolate and other yummy flavors. hints of coffee. addictive.\n\nthis was my first michael mina experience and it was a great one. looking forward to trying more.", 
            "my wife and i ate here before seeing the michael jackson one show. we wanted a nice steak dinner that was located in mandalay bay so we wouldn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> have to worry about rushing to the show. all and all it was an ok dinner.  the service was ok, a bit slow and it seemed like we had to find our server every time we wanted a drink. the complimentary trio fries were delicious, like many have said on here. i ordered the <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark>, cooked medium and it was good.  my wife ordered the halibut and she said it was ok.  we shared the mac and cheese, which we enjoyed very much.  the <mark>Baked Potato</mark> was pretty darn tasty.   the <mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> & Hamachi Poppers</mark> appetizer were yummy. my wife and i both agree that we enjoyed the sides and appetizer more then the main entrees.  for drinks, we were also given a digital drink menu via ipad, which i thought was a great idea since drink menu<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> change so frequently. i ordered a corona and my wife ordered the cucumber martini, which she absolutely loved.  i would rate this place at about 3.5 stars, but round up to 4 stars. for a $250 meal, we expected better service and food. i probably would not dine there again, since there are so many other places to eat that offer superior service and food.", 
            "good ambiance but like most restaurants in las vegas, overpriced.  and underwhelming. don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> mind spending $$$ on good food but this left something to be desired. trying to minimize my red meat intake, i got the seared <mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and market fresh salad. salad was ok but doused in dressing which overwhelmed the plate. greens were fresh. tuna was good but for $41 i was expecting a little more... \n\nmy friend got the wagyu-style beef (8 oz). he was disappointed he spent $81 on an \"ok\" piece of beef. \n\nbest thing was the complimentary duck fat fries in 3 sauces.  \n\noverall i think there are better options for your $$$ in vegas.", 
            "it honestly kills me to give a michael mina restaurant a 3-star review -- i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> been to many of his restaurants around the country, and am nearly always thrilled with the service and quality of the food.  perhaps it was an off-night for the chef, but i left disappointed.\n\nlet me start with the good -- there were 16 of us in our party, and the accommodations were great (it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> generally tough to deal with a party that size), as was the service.  also, the appetizers (tuna and <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> & Hamachi Poppers</mark> and fries) were very good.  as was the wedge salad.  and the side dishes were all great.\n\nthe disappointing part of the evening was the main course -- the steak.  i decided on the filet, which was a generous cut and looked great when presented.  unfortunately, it was overcooked and dry.  the strange part is that -- with all the distraction of the large party -- several my friends and i didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> realize until after the food was delivered that we were never asked how we<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> like the steak prepared (to be fair, it sounds like about three-quarters of the party were asked...just not the several sitting near me).\n\ni<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not overly picking about preparation -- i would have been happy with medium-rare or medium -- but the steak came out on the medium-well side.  worse yet, it was barely warm.  perhaps a side effect of the large group, but i imagine we weren<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> the first time the chef has dealt with large parties.  good rule of thumb -- if the server forgets to ask how someone would like their steak cooked, ere on the medium-rare side, not the medium-well side.  in addition, the steak wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> seasoned much at all (those this could have been a side-effect of it being overcooked).  \n\nin retrospect, i should have returned the meat, but by the time the server returned to check on us, many in the group were already <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> through the meal.  \n\noverall, the experience was great, the service was great and the rest of the meal was great.  but, there<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> no excuse for a bad steak at a place with \"steak\" in the name, and especially not at a michael mina restaurant.  i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> on the fence whether i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> return, though the high ratings in general give me hope that my meal was an exception, not the rule.", 
            "the food is always tasty at strip steak.  however, the portions have gotten smaller and the prices have risen.\n\nthe free appetizers of french fries cooked in duck fat with exotic dipping sauces is a redeeming value.  but for a party of 7 they only brought 2 servings and then wanted to charge us for more.  if we were single diners, we each would have received one?  so why be so cheap?\n\neverything is ala carte - main courses require sides to make them a complete meal.  this really jacks up the price.  \n<mark>Caesar Salad</mark> around $15 was small.  the $65 <mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> was ordered rare with seared outside - it was delivered cooked entirely through.  small in size and cooked incorrectly.\n\nthe spinach side dish is awesome as are the sliced au gratin potatoes.\n\noverall, i was disappointed compared to my visit a few years ago."

            "l-o-v-e-d it. seriously. the real muscle behind this yelp review is my husband who rates steak very seriously. he is so picky with his steak, its annoying for me. i don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> like steak so much. i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> keep this review short and simple. \n\nservice - a+++! our waiter impressed us with his recommendations, his manner, and how attentive he was during dinner. i heart him. \n\nfood - a+! my husband ordered the skirt steak with a add-on of <mark>King Crab Legs</mark>. originally he ordered the <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark>, but our waiter recommended the <mark>King Crab Legs</mark>, since they are a bit bigger, more bang for your buck! (i said that not the waiter lol) he loved it. he was smiling the whole time. he was happy that the waiter recommended the <mark>King Crab Legs</mark> because he loved them too! \n\ni ordered the kobe burger. i ordered it well done. i always order my meat well done. my burger came out kinda charred. not sure if it was the \"well-done\" factoring in. i actually had to cut the top and bottom off the patty so i could taste the flavor of the meat. it wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> a big deal. like i said i am not a big meat person. i didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> mind if my meat patty was 1/2 the size in the end. if i ate here again, i would def not order the burger. i was eying the <mark>Mary<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> Free Range Roasted Chicken</mark>.. maybe i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> get that next time. \n\nthe sides! the mac and cheese is a must order! we also ordered the scalloped potatoes which wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> amazingly good. for 2 people i would say one side order would<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> been adequate. we barely touched the potatoes. probably because i ate all the fries... \n\nmy husband wants to come back every time we are in vegas. yes, it made him that happy. and trust me this guy is hard to please!", 
            "compared to other steak houses i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> visited in las vegas, stripsteak is middle-of-the-road. if i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> going to spend a lot of money i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> rather dine at carnevino, cut, or delmonico. if i want a decent steak at a more affordable price, i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> go to twin creeks.\n\nmy wife and i arrived early -- about <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> hour before our reservation. the hostess still seated us promptly at a small circular two-top, but in the back of the lounge, in between the bar and the main dining area. it was very comfy -- her on a long bench with big cushions, me in an oversized chair -- but not ideal for eating a meal because of how low the chairs are in relation to the table. add to that the deafening sound of all the lounge chatter and music and it was difficult to have a conversation.\n\nthe food wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> bad at all. as a matter of fact, some of it was great. but, i think there<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> better value to be had elsewhere.\n\nto start you off, they bring out a complimentary trio of fries (old bay flavored, garlic herb, and truffle oil). all were some of the best fries i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> had, with the garlic herb being my favorite. they were perfectly crispy, light, and addictive. we had to force each other to stop eating them and save room for the rest of our food.\n\n//appetizers//\nsweet onion soup ($17) - morels, parmesan crouton. excellent depth in flavors, earthy and delicious mushrooms.\n\nmain <mark><mark>Grilled Maine Lobster</mark> Fritters</mark> ($20) - bacon-wrapped fritters. three per order. the <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> was masked by the oiliness and saltiness of the dish. but the crispness and coolness of the lettuce wrap was a nice compliment. not worth getting again.\n\n//entree and sides//\n10 oz. filet ($56). they were nice enough to split it for us since we wanted to share. ordered it medium rare, but it came out closer to rare. tender and savory, but not nearly as good as the filet at carnevino.\n\ntwo sides of <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> ($24 ea.). each order con<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> two meaty <mark>King Crab Legs</mark> with lemon. served cold, it could have benefitted from some drawn butter.\n\nshallot potato cakes ($9) - scallion creme fraiche. three cakes. perfectly crispy, great flavor... kinda like the greatest hash browns you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> ever have.\n\nenglish peas ($14) - shaved fennel, pancetta. peas are peas, nothing extraordinary, but the pancetta added a good bit of savoriness and salitness.\n\noverall, the food was pretty good, service not very attentive, the sommelier suggested a wine we weren<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> crazy about, seating was comfy but not functional, and it was too loud to carry a conversation. oh, and i forgot pricey. but we did have a $50 restaurant.com gift card that helped mitigate the damage.\n\n3.5 stars", 
            "we visited on a busy night, so i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> weight the somewhat inattentive service as less of a factor than i normally would.  our server had a large table and a couple other small ones in addition to us, so taking as long as she did to get our orders is forgiveable.  she was friendly and responsive when we did see her, so i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> sure it was just a tough night.\n\nthe hostesses were less pleasant, mumbling responses and then practically ignoring us.  if we hadn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> had reservations for dinner and tickets to a show right after, i would have gone somewhere else right then.\n\nnow let<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> get to the great part - the food!  we both had steaks, one a filet and the other a <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark>, both of which were expertly cooked to order.  he added shrimp and i <mark>King Crab Legs</mark>, neither of which was as large as i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> used to, being from the coast.  but it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> understandable this far inland, and both were cooked and seasoned well.\n\nwe each ordered a side, mushrooms and broccolini, and let me tell you, each was large enough to serve two people.  i was definitely impressed with those portion sizes.\n\ncock<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> were nothing special, tho the scottish stout beer my other <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> was the best he<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> had.  the dessert menu looked nice, but nothing really jumped out at us.\n\noverall, it was a nice experience.  perhaps i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> too \"small-town\" to enjoy the full vegas strip experience, but this was a good meal and a great precursor to a fabulous cirque show.  i would recommend this restaurant to others heading to vegas.", 
            "as usual, i will go straight to the point: food was excellent, service was great, but prices.. omg ... stratospheric. \n\nlet me elaborate: i long for the days (1980<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> actually)  when you could get amazing food, huge portions, never ending buffets (with steak, lobster, <mark>King Crab Legs</mark>, etc.) for $5.95. yep, those days and deals did exist. even 5 start hotel rooms could be had for $100 a night. the casinos made their money from the gamblers, so they wanted to attract everyone with great prices on room and board. it worked... until vegas became a hip destination for the rich, the famous and politicians. they wanted fancy food, top notch enter<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark>, clubs... so why not charge for that? so you have it.\n\nstrip steak was undoubtedly a great experience, our <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> was excellent, the <mark>Potato Gratin</mark> fantastic (although i still think the version served at fleming<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> in coral gables is better), and the broccolini (it was ok). we had a good red wine (it cost $90 ... crazy for an average red). note that i have an issue with <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>... it costs much more than \"grass fed\" equivalent, but i can<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> really tell the difference. although the price at strip steak was not bad ($65 for a 12oz <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> steak, the one that broke all records was the <mark>8 Oz <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> at nobu in ny for $25 per oz.. that is insane, unless it had a secret side effect like growing hair or curing ed).\n\nbut high end places in vegas are now like strip steak... good to great food and service, but prices that require a credit from the casino cashier manager in order to cover the \"experience\". we were two guys, one <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> each, one side each, one bottle of wine and two deserts... $300 with tip... wow. good thing we were on expense account, and now i have a week to come up with an excuse when the secretary questions the expense... like \"elvis just left the building...\".\n\nin summary: if you landed in your private jet and took the bentley with the scantly dressed victoria secret<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> model as a chauffeur, then i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> sure you will thoroughly enjoy the food and service of strip steak. if you are a commoner (like me) i suggest you put it on your boss<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> card. if both scenarios are not doable, then head to downtown vegas, they also have great places for a fraction of the cost.\n\nbut don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> take me wrong: i loved the food and the service (by the way, our waitress was beautiful, sexy and very efficient.. kudos!), but i had to knock off one star due to the high price... it just doesn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> make sense...sorry.\n\ncheers!"

            "i visited stripsteak only because a friend was in love with their macaroni and cheese and wanted to see if she could get it carryout after we<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> attended a concert at the beach in mandalay bay.  while the hostesses at the podium at first seemed a little uncer<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> about whether we<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> be able to order it, they directed us to the bar where the bartender was more than happy to place the order for us.  \n\nthe bartender was excellent- he was very friendly and asked us where we were from. i thought great, i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> from vegas so he<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> probably ignore us after we tell him.  but no- he was just as friendly, and after my friend left to play in the casino while iwaited for our order, he brought me water with lemon (and refilled the glass) and continued to chat.  \n\ni guess this is just a review of the bar and the bartender, but i must add that the restaurant was beautiful- shiny floors, and some of the tables were glowing from lights underneath them.  i want to come here now and experience the restaurant due to the good first impression i got.", 
            "we happened to stumble across strip steak, and since we were all starving, it was an easy choice. \n\nfood: the irony is most of us didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> order the steak; we ordered the kobe hamburgers, fish, mac and cheese, fries, and tomato salad. all were delicious. however, we were most pleasantly surprised with the mac and cheese - which was quite tasty. \n\nambiance: i really like the furniture - that was our first comment. since we had a party of 6, we sat in one of the booths, which was quite comfortable. the most distracting (and enter<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark>) part of the evening, were women who cam dressed rather scanty.\n\nservice: i did feel a bit uncomfortable with the staff, since we didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> order the high-priced items. but, nevertheless, they were cordial and consistent in refilling and bringing us drinks.\n\ncost: definitely pricey - but worth it every now and again.", 
            "stripsteak sucked. my steak was overcooked, the trio of pureed potatoes or whatever they call it was a joke, and the trio of \"duck fat\" fries must have been fried in 5% duck fat or something, because they tasted like something burger king would serve (except for the white truffle ones, but how can you screw that up, really?).\n\nthe three pureed potatoes dishes were lobster, which, while i love big chunks of lobster, tasted like an experiment on how to get starchy potatoes and a bag of white flour into a pasty goo reminiscent of gruel which clung so steadfastly to the <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> that it didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> offer the opportunity to salvage them from the muck, the sour cream and chive version, almost as gooey and i guess was worth one taste, and the third, horseradish, i guess was supposed to be some kind of traditional take on wasabi mashed potatoes you would have seen on every menu five years ago.\n\nservice wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> anything to brag about either. this is another one of those places where they really need to train their waitstaff a little better. for this kind of money and they large crowd it draws, they should be watching for your fork and knife to come together on the plate in the interest of turning the table over. we waited a long time for our check, and i think they only took notice when i got up to use the restroom.", 
            "wanted to state for the record that i would have not chosen this restaurant of my own volition, we were invited to go by co-workers.  thus, we ended up in strip steak sitting right by all of the action, watching the guys work their magic on the grill.\n\nthe selection of meats is impressive!  i however, was on red-meat overload, so i opted for their \"fried\" chicken.  since it was just me, 1 person ordering, they had to (for some reason) cut the chicken in <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> grill it.  which i was perfectly happy with-- it was delicious!  perfectly seasoned and the skin was crispy.  served over a bed of their now infamous truffled mac-n-cheese.  i seriously could<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> just eaten the mac-n-cheese and been happy.  it was amazing!\n\ni gave ss 4 stars b/c it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> really just a one trick pony with nothing that makes it stand out from other steak joints for me to recommend it as a \"must try\" restaurant.  but, if you find yourself here, you will not be disappointed!",

            "as you will see from my reviews i have eaten at high end steak places in ny, philadelphia and dc.....this is definitely in the top 5 of all of them.   \n\nwe went here with a group and ate on a thursday night, we had no problem getting a table for 4 at 8pm with reservations.   \n\ni had the <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> bacon appetizer which was honestly the lowlight of my meal but still very good.   my wife had a beet salad which looked nice and a friend of mine split onion rings with the table.   the free fries were also amazing and we loved the different sauces.\n\nnext came the main courses.   my wife ordered a filet done perfectly.   my friends gf had the halibut which was also excellent.   i had the regular <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> and the <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> options as did my friend.   let me just say this steak was seasoned and cooked perfectly.   the <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> legs that were the side were amazing.   they were split and all of the good parts were left.   a great addition! \n\nwe got the mashed potato sides  as well as a mushroom that was part of a forrest fire.   \n\ni think that this is a great steakhouse and a great place to eat.   i would highly recommend this place in lv.",

            "i loved this place. this place \"was. an. experience.\" it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> a surprisingly chic place not far from fleur de lys in mandalay bay and right next to a starbucks. it was packed and loud, so i guess that<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> a good sign. \nto be honest, i wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> impressed with our waiter. he seemed like a casual billy corgan type who was interested in talking to you so long as you were increasing your order. no small talk, 0 personality, and the real piss ant is he conveniently didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> add our restaurant.com coupon to our bill. he may have forgotten, but frankly this is the second time this has happened to me in vegas, and seeing how just about every other attraction in vegas is designed to suck the money out of your pocket i can<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> help but wonder if it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not a coincidence. they must slip more than a few bills under the noses of patrons who unknowingly assume they got their discount but fail to check after a bottle of wine, but not me, and i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not too forgiving about this ether, because i think it really is intentional. \nanyway, the food is what saved this place from a more negative review because in the end that is all i really and truly care about anyway. anyone can learn how to carry a plate of food to a table, but it takes a talented individual to craft a work of art in the kitchen. \nwe had salad to start. frankly i wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> impressed with my caesar.  it seemed a bit bland. i was hoping this wouldn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> be precursor to the rest of the meal but in this rare occasion it wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> at all. salad must not be their thing because the rest of the meal was mind blowing. i had a regular filet with a side of peppercorn sauce and another side of the creamed corn. ummmm....the food was utterly fantastic. the filet was of excellent quality. perfect taste and texture throughout, and the accompanying pepper sauce was not a creamy peppercorn sauce like you usually get, but more of a demi glace sauce with peppercorns - truly the sauce i have been after for years.\nthe sides of the mashed potatoes 3 ways was stunning. they serve 3 little bowls of mashed taters. one is sour cream and chives infused, the other is <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark>, and the third is horseradish infused. each was the creamiest, smoothest mashed potato i have ever had, and was accented perfectly with its character ingredient. wow. with the steak it was just superb. the creamed corn with jalapeno was very good, although not the best ever. still very nicely done though and no complaints.\nto top it off, and the reason this place is a solid 5 star experience and worthy of one of the most smitten reviews i have ever posted was the simple divine experience i had with the executive chef, ben (lost his business card but remember his name).\ni was walking out of the restroom, and stopped by to look at their see-through window next to the grill where they cook the steaks and other entrees. i noticed what seemed to be a chef standing nearby, so in a spontaneous moment of gratitude i went up to him and told him how much i enjoyed my food. he was very nice, and after i asked a few more questions about how the steak is prepared, he said \"come on, i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> take you back.\" he actually took me back in the kitchen past all the kitchen staff who were probably thinking \"wtf is this guy doing in here?\", and took me straight up to the grill where a few beautiful steaks were in the home stretch. he explained the process, how the steaks actually soak in clarified butter at a perfectly controlled temperature before they are grilled. this would explain the awesomeness of the steak, actually, but now that i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> tasted it i know that it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> the best. he enthusiastically answered my other questions about the kitchen (\"is it really like hell<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> kitchen??\") and then ushered me out of the kitchen. i don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> know why this is such a big deal to me, but it really just impressed the heck out of me that the executive chef of one of the best restaurants i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> ever been to was so down to earth and gave me an impromptu tour of his kitchen. i remember as a young boy my dad would approach the cockpits of planes even during flights sometimes to talk to the pilots, and they would bring us into the cockpit, explain a few neat things, and then with a wink we<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> be on our way. obviously those days are gone forever, but tonight i had a bit of the same feeling; the man running the ship gave me the tour with no expectation of anything in return. clearly i don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> believe this kind of thing happens that much anymore and that<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> why i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> so ecstatic, but it was a privilege and an honor to meet him and i cannot thank him enough for his exemplary skills as both a chef and a business man. \ni<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> a fan of strip steak for sure. maybe next time if i win big in vegas i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> try the japanese kobe (it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not cheap). until then i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> enjoy a superb domestic cut of beef and be glad i can afford the luxury.", 
            "stripsteak was absolutely amazing.. i am in love with the duck fat french fries.. they bring them out to the table instead of bread, i would ask the server to bring two orders of the duck fat fries instead of the foccaia. i had the <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> soup which was amazing. i am slightly lactose intolerant  which was definitely accommodated. our server had no problem finding out what ingredients were used in my soup to make sure i could eat it. i loved the fact that they left whole peas in the soup with gracious portions of lobster. i also had the fillet mignon which was to die for! all of their steaks are dry aged in house and cooked over a mesquite wood burner. i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> definitely be back to stripsteak soon! another michael minna success!", 
            "big thanks to restaurant.com for finally convincing me to come here.  wife and i had the filet and <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> along w/ scalloped potatoes and the <mark>Spinach Souffl</mark>.  steaks were cooked perfectly...i usually end up taking home about <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> but i literally inhaled this one..so damn good.  the <mark>Spinach Souffl</mark> was really good...never had anything like that before.  i also liked how they serve foccacia and fries as kind of a complimentary starter as opposed to the loaf of bread/rolls most places do.  def gonna do mac n cheese next time.", 
            "my 700th review goes toward a night of decadent eating!\n\nparties of four are really one of the best ways to experience a menu.  with drinks in hand, we took our seats at a table by the floor-to-ceiling glass walls separating us from the outside world.\n\n* trio of duck fat fries with dipping sauces of barbecue, truffle aioli, and ketchup - this complimentary dish was the first to arrive, and yes, they are very delicious and decadent, and oh so good and fatty.  a great way to start any meal!\n\n* potato focaccia - more complimentary stuff to get your palate going, although i found to be just okay, the husband enjoyed it more. \n\n* <mark>Half <mark>Grilled Maine Lobster</mark></mark> \"bacon-wrapped fritters\" ($17) - skewered <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> bacon wrapped around, and then deep-fried.  a refreshing dipping sauce to cut the fat!\n\n* roasted beets \"burrata, walnut oil\" ($15) - the fresh italian cheese, greens, and beets had the three men at my table fighting over the last bits.\n\n* <mark><mark>8 Oz <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> Tartare</mark> \"<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> filet, classic garnish, grilled pocket bread\" ($21) - beautifully presented with the rare beef and a raw quail egg resting on top.  garnishments of mustard, cracked pepper, red onions and the like surrounded it before the waiter artfully mixed it all together and presented it in chilled glass.  so tastefully good, you don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> need or want the bread.  \n\n* shabu shabu \"<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> beef, mushroom consomme\" ($24) - a pot of hot broth took center stage as enoki mushrooms wrapped in beef arrived.  a quick swish and a dip of sauce and into your mouth it goes.\n\n* angus beef cap ($46) - we all ordered this off-menu cut of beef.  i initially wanted it rare, but was dissuaded to have it medium rare instead.  cutting into my beef, it was more medium and i was saddened.  a quick glance around the table, and i realized my piece was definitely more cooked than most.  lucky for me, the husband was willing to switch his piece with mine.  (that act alone makes him a keeper!)  once i cut into my newly acquired beef, i was enjoying my medium rare slice with everyone else.  \n\n* mac & cheese \"truffled\" ($12) - yes, it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> all that and a bag of chips.  so creamy and good, and not just a hint of the truffle, but it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> all over! so yum!  worth ordering on its own.\n\n* scalloped potatoes \"caramelized onion & goat cheese\" ($12) - the onions give this dish a sweetness that complements the goat cheese and potatoes.  \n\n* potato puree trio \"lobster, sour cream & onion, horseradish\" ($14) - my personal fave over the other potato dish.  with so many variations of mashed potatoes, how can one not like them.  very smooth, creamy, and just something you want to eat all to yourself.\n\n* creamed corn \"jalapeno\" - i guess we needed some kind of vegetable to offset our meal.  a slight bit of heat from the pepper and it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> more creamy goodness.\n\n* beignets \"chocolate pot de creme, macallan 18 year butterscotch pudding, madagascar vanilla creme brulee\" - take a spoon to the cr\\u00e8me brulee and forget the beignets, just hog the pot to yourself.  dipping wise, i liked the chocolate over the butterscotch in this case.\n\n* coconut candy bar \"caramel ice cream, toasted almonds\" ($12) - a very fancy candy bar that<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> super sweet, and perfect for sharing.\n\n* cucumber martini - surprisingly better than other cucumber martinis out there, good enough that everyone at my table was having one because they are that good.\n\n* cherry caiprihana - the husband enjoyed this signature drink of theirs as well, and the cherry adds a unique taste to the caiprihana.\n\nthe service at strip steak was probably among the best.  there<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> a team waiting on you, and they work as a team - with not just clearing dishes, but bringing your orders in and chatting it up with you.  one of the more personal and better customer service experiences i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> had in awhile.  michael mina obviously knows what he<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> doing with his food and his staff.  it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> no wonder there<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> a cult following of his restaurants.  they also have restrooms within the restaurant, which is a nice touch. (most restaurants in the casinos don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> have their own restrooms, so you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> forced to walk through the casino to use it.)  but there can be a line, which is the downfall of it.\n\nmy suggestion is to gather a few friends, and only a few, and share a wonderful meal with them all.  with a party of five or more, it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> harder to share the appetizers and sides.  you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> share an intimate culinary adventure with them!\n\n4.5 stars", 
            "this was one of less than a handful of restaurants still open after 10pm when we wanted an after-show bite.  the ambiance seemed sophisticated and inviting, so we gave it a try.  mind you, we were not intending a full meal so we ordered a couple of appetizers.  the first was a steamed and chilled <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> for $24.  when the waiter brought it to our table, it was a major disappointment.  on top of a huge mound of crushed ice was <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> a <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> about 3.5\" long and one claw about the same length.  what happened to the other <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> claw #2?  \n\nif i was a waiter, i would be ashame to deliver such a dish!  worse yet, the taste was very bland and slightly overcooked.  then it was time for appetizer #2 of triangular cut lettuce about 1.5 inches long and covered with a small portion of minced crab and what-not.  this was their lettuce cup dish of crab, but if the size does not disappoint you, the lack of crab taste cerr<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> will.  the free french fries and skillet bread did not justify the $50 check (tip included)!  \n\nthis was my first and last experience with stripsteak.  i accept the fact that prices are higher in las vegas, but the food lacked taste and was definitely short on quantity.\n\nat least throwing $50 into a slot machine provides enter<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark>!",

            "here<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> the short version: worst possible dining experience, no exaggeration. wrong reservation, ter<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> service, bad food, and promises broken for a business dinner with our best client.\n\nhere<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> the long version: came here for a business dinner for our most important client on a recommendation. we made our reservation for their private dining area 2 months in advance to coincide with a trade show. confirmed our reservation a week or two in advance as well. \n\ni checked in with the hostess with about <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> our 20+ party there. they said our table would be ready soon and to let them know when our entire party was there. our entire party arrived about 5 minutes later and i informed them that all were present and she said our table would be ready in a few minutes. after another 5 minutes i check to see if our table was ready. said it would be soon, just a few minutes. after another 5 minutes i asked about our table and again the answer was soon. not a good thing to keep a large group and important clients waiting 15 minutes for a private room that was supposed to be reserved. \n\nfinally we were told our tables were ready but it was just that, normal tables in their regular dining area. we informed them that their must be a mistake since we specifically reserved their private dining room. we were given some attitude and told that we were mistaken but they would look into it. they quickly learned from their group reservation department that their was some sort of lack or mix-up of communication between them and the hostess. the general manager shows up and began to sweat and apologize to us a thousand times. \n\nnothing could be done at the time because they had already given away tables in their private dining area. there was only an approximate estimate of an hour wait to move to that area. we decided to start at the tables we had and move if the private area became available soon. \n\nfortunately they said they would be able to move us to the private area after 20 minutes so we headed over. unfortunately it was not a private room but just a semi-private area partially enclosed by glass walls. and there were still some other diners in the area but we were assured the tables would remain empty once they finished. \n\nafter all of this drama i thought to myself \"hopefully the food is amazing and redeems this entire mess.\" however, i was thoroughly disappointed. the blue crab chowder was too salty, the prime <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> mediocre at best (i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> rather have bellagio buffet prime rib), and the desserts were forgetful. \n\nin addition, the service was pretty poor. a number of us had finished our drinks and had empty glasses on our table. they remained empty on our table for at least 20-30 minutes. when i had my water refilled i asked them to take away my other empty glass. it was taken away but all of the other empty glasses were ignored. it was bizarre to me that this simple task was overlooked, especially after the general manager said that he would make sure that we were taken care of and serviced well. he also mentioned that he would give us additional drinks and food and not charge us. after we received the final bill that didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> seem to be the case and it looked like we were charged the full amount. \n\nwhat added insult to this all was that the other tables in our semi-private dining area didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> remain empty, they continued to fill them with new diners. we spent about $5000 for the worst possible dining experience on clients who do over $50 million in business with us.",

(i said that not the waiter lol) he loved it. he was smiling the whole time. he was happy that the waiter recommended the <mark>King Crab Legs</mark> because he loved them too! \n\ni ordered the kobe burger. i ordered it well done. i always order my meat well done. my burger came out kinda charred. not sure if it was the \"well-done\" factoring in. i actually had to cut the top and bottom off the patty so i could taste the flavor of the meat. it wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> a big deal. like i said i am not a big meat person. i didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> mind if my meat patty was 1/2 the size in the end. if i ate here again, i would def not order the burger. i was eying the <mark>Mary<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> Free Range Roasted Chicken</mark>.. maybe i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> get that next time. \n\nthe sides! the mac and cheese is a must order! we also ordered the scalloped potatoes which wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> amazingly good. for 2 people i would say one side order would<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> been adequate. we barely touched the potatoes. probably because i ate all the fries... \n\nmy husband wants to come back every time we are in vegas. yes, it made him that happy. and trust me this guy is hard to please!", 
            "oh man.... prepare yourself for goodness!!\n\ni got a coupon from restaurant.com which is the only reason we found this gem. we were staying on the complete opposite end of the strip, so we are lucky to have made our way down here!\n\ndespite the $50 gift certificate, we had no illusions of a cheap meal. we had checked out their menu online and were prepared to pay. which is a good thing!\n\nwe had a reservation on friday night, and were promptly seated when we arrived. the wait staff was on it! while we had a main waitress, there were several others around who were quick to fill our wine glasses or remove an empty plate. \n\nit didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> take long for us to order as we both new we were having steak. i ordered the <mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark> (medium rare) and my husband the new york strip (medium) with a <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark>. we also ordered a side of mac <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> cheese and spinach. \n\nbefore our meal, they brought out a sample of their duck fat fries. they were good, and we were presented with three varieties paired with a sauce. i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not sure i would order them again, only because the rest of the food was amazing!\n\nour steaks were cooked to perfection! cut with a fork they were so tender! while the two sides were way too much for two of us, they were a great accompaniment. we savored every bite!\n\nwe also ordered a $90 bottle of wine. that is way more than we usually pay for wine (in fact, this whole meal was more than our biweekly food budget!), but it was awesome. unfortunately we both drank too much of it to remember the name! bottom line- just let them pick the wine. they won<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> disappoint!\n\nwhile it was not needed, we indulged in the marscapone cheesecake. wow. a perfectly light end to a great meal!\n\nour total bill was about $350. typically i would have been struggling to breath at that price, but not this night. maybe it was the wine that had relaxed me, but i woke up the next morning still feeling good about the money spent. \n\nexcellent food, great service, we<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> be back in 5 years when we can afford it again!", 
            "greetings from your resident picky eater.  i know you are probably surprised to see me write a review of a steak house considering i don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> like steak and normally these hoyty toyty establishments do not cater to those with a palate of a five year old.  \n\nlet me set the scene.  my husband advised me he is taking me out to dinner yet would not tell me where.  this alarms me because after knowing each other for nine years he still tries to surprise me by taking me to placing such as prime <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> and pf changs.  guess where we are going??  stripsteak.  apparently, you can get a coupon on restaurants.com and so he wanted to give it a try.  panic sets in as i am worried what will i eat.. again i don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> like steak and i especially don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> like a steak i would have to pay $50 dollars for.  my husband michael assures me he has looked over the menu and told me they have chicken dishes and even mac & cheese.\n\nupon arrival we are seating and the atmosphere is quite enjoyable.  michael had advised them we are there to celebrate my birthday.  it was two weeks ago but if i know my husband he was hoping to get a free dessert out of it.  there was a very nice happy birthday card placed at our table which i thought was a very nice touch.  \n\nlooking at the menu.. oh dear oh dear there is one chicken dish.. not chicken dishes (plural) as michael had indicated.  organic chicken it is.  michael opts for the kobe beef burger.  i order a corona and michael orders a pepsi.  (stay tuned as the pepsi will come into play later on in my story)\n\nwe are then provided a sample of the duck fat fries three ways with three different dipping sauces.  they consisted of old bay seasoned fries, rosemary garlic type fries, and plain duck fat fries.  the sauces were some mustard cr\\u00e8me nonsense (which kind of tasted like ranch), ketchup, and truffle aioli.  may i just say that the truffle aioli was amazing.  who would have thought it would win over ketchup in my mind.  while enjoying our delicious fries, michael is especially enter<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> in watching the people constantly stop to take pictures at their famous boob sculpture in the walkway to the conference center. \n\nmeal arrives.  my plate is very fancy with some onion jus drizzled around the plate and a lovely piece of chicken on top of some truffle mac & cheese.  michael wastes no time diving into his kobe burger for which i think he foodgasmed after the first bite.  now my chicken report.  it was delicious!!! so moist and flavorful - it better be for $30 bucks.  it had nice grill char marks on it which added to the flavor profile.  the mac and cheese was good as well but alert.. there were two broccoli thingies mixed in it and a couple of baby carrots!  this was not an invited guest to the party and i did not appreciate them hiding out under the chicken to surprise me.  luckily i was able to remove most of the little tree top specs and continue with my meal without incident.  i decided to share my chicken with michael.... \"this is not a normal chicken!\" he says as i think he was shared a spiritual moment with my chicken.  he then tried one of my baby carrots and asked for another.  against my better judgment i tried the smallest of bites possible of the carrot and holy cow it didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> even taste like a carrot.  it almost melted in my mouth - probably all the butter it was drenched in.  i that that was the first time i eat a carrot since i was forced to stay at the table until i finished them when i was 8.  \n\nthe meal has now ended.  our waiter asks if we would like to order dessert.  although the $700 glass of cognac was tempting we decided to pass.  michael was looking around wondering where is my happy birthday scoop of ice cream?  we then get the bill and i think michael about had a heart attack.  remember the pepsi i mentioned earlier?  well apparently they are $4 - each.   michael had four of them because they are served in those skinny bar glasses that you could finish in one sip!  so he paid $16 bucks for pepsi (not even coke!) that was $9 less then my corona.  i found it quite funny.  we did however receive two small bags of some sort of chocolate drizzled caramel popcorn which i didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> get the connection but thought was nice.  \n\nto summarize, although places like this are not my cup of tea i have to say i was pleasantly surprised.  be forewarned if ordering a soda that it is by the glass.  if i could offer any suggestions it would be to perhaps replace the broccoli bits with bacon in the truffle mac & cheese.  even with our $50 coupon we ended up paying about $50 dollars out of pocket (thanks to michael<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> soda binge) but this is a nice place for special occasion.", 
            "very disappointing.\n\nfirst the ambiance. it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> extremely loud, almost to the point of not being able to hear the person across from you.  tables with no cloths and paper place mats.  that seems to be the thing with a lot of vegas steak houses now, charge premium prices but present a coffee shop atmosphere.  \n\nnone of that is as important as the food, of course.  we both love steak tartare, so we ordered that for the appetizer.  it was loaded with black pepper. so much so, that frankly, that<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> all i could taste.  \n\nthen a 50 minute wait for our main course.  at about 40 minutes i was getting irate and was just about to go complain when the general manager did stop by our table to apologize and say our food would be here shortly.  \n\nwhen the main course did finally arrive, the <mark>8 Oz <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> we both ordered were both cooked perfectly, and were melt-in-your-mouth delicous.  i ordered a <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> with mine, and it was small and chewy.  the sides  we ordered were average, not bad, but nothing great.\n\nthe service was friendly, but very poor. our server seemed a bit...how should i say this...out of it.  whenever she came to our table she had a huge smile on her face, as if she just a heard a hilarious joke.  but if i asked her a question about something, she didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> even respond, as if she didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> hear me.  i know it was loud in there, but you would think she could see me looking at her with my lips moving.  because of the 50 minute wait (during which we never saw her, by the way), we had finished our bottle of wine before the steaks even arrived, so i ordered another glass with our main course.   she finally brought it with desert. along with our coffee. sigh.  speaking of desert, it was fine, once again nothing special, but pretty good.\n\n$460.00 with tip for the two of us. that included a $120 bottle of wine.  it was just not worth it. craftsteak is much better, and delmonico is much much better.  \n\ni<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> baffled at all the rave reviews.  maybe we just hit it on a bad night?  or maybe a lot of people have just never been to a really good steak house?  i mean, yeah we did get the free french fries too, and they were tasty, but really, they<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> just french fries people", 
            "compared to other steak houses i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> visited in las vegas, stripsteak is middle-of-the-road. if i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> going to spend a lot of money i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> rather dine at carnevino, cut, or delmonico. if i want a decent steak at a more affordable price, i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> go to twin creeks.\n\nmy wife and i arrived early -- about <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> hour before our reservation. the hostess still seated us promptly at a small circular two-top, but in the back of the lounge, in between the bar and the main dining area. it was very comfy -- her on a long bench with big cushions, me in an oversized chair -- but not ideal for eating a meal because of how low the chairs are in relation to the table. add to that the deafening sound of all the lounge chatter and music and it was difficult to have a conversation.\n\nthe food wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> bad at all. as a matter of fact, some of it was great. but, i think there<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> better value to be had elsewhere.\n\nto start you off, they bring out a complimentary trio of fries (old bay flavored, garlic herb, and truffle oil). all were some of the best fries i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> had, with the garlic herb being my favorite. they were perfectly crispy, light, and addictive. we had to force each other to stop eating them and save room for the rest of our food.\n\n//appetizers//\nsweet onion soup ($17) - morels, parmesan crouton. excellent depth in flavors, earthy and delicious mushrooms.\n\nmain <mark><mark>Grilled Maine Lobster</mark> Fritters</mark> ($20) - bacon-wrapped fritters. three per order. the <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> was masked by the oiliness and saltiness of the dish. but the crispness and coolness of the lettuce wrap was a nice compliment. not worth getting again.\n\n//entree and sides//\n10 oz. filet ($56). they were nice enough to split it for us since we wanted to share. ordered it medium rare, but it came out closer to rare. tender and savory, but not nearly as good as the filet at carnevino.\n\ntwo sides of <mark>Alaskan King Crab</mark> ($24 ea.). each order con<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> two meaty <mark>King Crab Legs</mark> with lemon. served cold, it could have benefitted from some drawn butter.\n\nshallot potato cakes ($9) - scallion creme fraiche. three cakes. perfectly crispy, great flavor... kinda like the greatest hash browns you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> ever have.\n\nenglish peas ($14) - shaved fennel, pancetta. peas are peas, nothing extraordinary, but the pancetta added a good bit of savoriness and salitness.\n\noverall, the food was pretty good, service not very attentive, the sommelier suggested a wine we weren<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> crazy about, seating was comfy but not functional, and it was too loud to carry a conversation. oh, and i forgot pricey. but we did have a $50 restaurant.com gift card that helped mitigate the damage.\n\n3.5 stars",

            "the skinny: a step up on the regular steakhouse, this place delivers some good eats with finesse and occasional missteps - don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> order the duck fat fries because it comes as a sizable amuse bouche (4) service: our waiter/servers were great but there are major issues with the hostess stand (3) value: considering the plethora of deals on restaurant.com, this place can be a good value if you order right (4).\n\nmy hubby was hankering to take me here for a while and we finally got a chance to try the menu at stripsteak.\n\nafter passing by multiple restaurants with hostesses soliciting our business, we were taken aback by the inefficient hostess. by our seating time, there was least 3-4  group of guests gathered around the hostess desk. she basically ignored the diners and the wait staff  who lined to find out how to seat us. \n\nshe also didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> tell us about ongoing promotions at the restaurant: ie, the 3-course prix fixe menu for $55, or that they are currently having a half-priced happy hour lounge menu from 4-7pm. plus, they don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> offer  you their prix fixe menu unless you specifically ask for it... even when you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> seated at the table. for this reason, despite the stellar service at our table, the service gets 3 stars.\n\nmichael mina is known for preparing a dish in three different ways. so obviously our amuse bouche consisted of bay-seasoned, garlic herb, truffled duck fat fries served with accompanying truffle aioli, ketchup and mustard/bay-seasoned sauce. the fries had a lovely crispness that re<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> its texture even when it cooled off. the sauces were lovely especially the truffle aioli. i considered drinking the remaining dregs of it on the bottom but decided i still needed to save my appetite for food we<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> ordered. \n\nthe soups were solid but nothing special. the vidalia onion soup accentuated the sweetness of onion but the croutons really lack that nice crunch. the seafood chowder was  good - the broth was a little on the milder side which allowed for the diner to get the full flavour of the crab when eaten.\n\nthe <mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark> sliders had the right flavour however the bun was definitely overly large considering the serving of foie on the inside. the plating would have been infinitely improved with having the bun on the side.\n\nby far the standout was our bone-in rib-eye. it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> rare to see me shovel down an entire steak the size of a catcher<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> mitt all on my own but there was not a scrap of meat left on that plate. yes, it is that good. the carmelized crust on the meat was so wonderful, the inside so tender and well-seasoned ... it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> hard to find steak that well-prepared. \n\nit was lovely that they provided a small tasting of three sides along with the rib-eye. the peas were okay - a little on the mealier side of things. the truffled mac <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> cheese is always great - perfect consistency, texture and flavour. unfortunately, the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> had a rather bitter unpleasant undertone.\n\nthe hubby<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> grilled chicken (they don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> fry a serving of chicken unless two people order) was a very large portion. <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> grilled chicken - a lovely crispy skin, tender and moist on the inside - on top of their wonderful mac <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> cheese. who wouldn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> like this?\n\nwe topped off our very filling meal with a root beer float and warm chocolate chip cookies. we loved the fact that the ice cream was so cold, it turned our creamy root beer into a nice slush. the chocolate chip cookies were a delight - not too sweet,cool enough to have a mild crust on the outside with melting chocolate on the inside.\n\noverall, we had a wonderful meal for a very reasonable price due to the restaurant.com certificate. we ordered one prix fixe meals ($55 + $10 supplement for the steak) plus two starters (<mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark> $22; onion soup: $17) and one entree (chicken $30). subtract the $50 restaurant.com certificate (we got at bargain basement prices), the meal ended up being $118.97 (including tax and 18% tip) which is reasonable considering the quantity and quality of the cuisine. definitely a solid four star review.",

            "i had read some reviews citing poor service at stripsteak due to what reviewers believed was a result of their servers writing them off as \"not going to spend much\"-type customers, even when the bill was in the range of $200 for two. having read this, as well as the $110/person \"average check price\" listed on their website, i was somewhat concerned going in, given i had intended on trying the prix fixe menu at $55/person and arriving a bit earlier in order to get some drinks on their happy hour menu. however, i love steak and we were staying at thehotel, so i really wanted to try an upscale steakhouse nearby, and stripsteak sounded great for the price.\n\nwhen we got there, there was a slight wait even though we had reservations and the place was clearly empty (common restaurant tactic in order to drive patrons to wait/drink at their bar, which we did). it wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> a problem as we were planning on trying some of their specialty cock<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> on their happy hour menu anyway, and i had budgeted plenty of time for dinner before our lion king show later in the night. we got to chat up two of the bartenders over a mojito and stripsteak sour. drinks were okay; nothing out of this world. the bartenders were pretty outgoing, though it was obvious they were tired of hearing about what tourists had planned for their trips, even so, they continue to ask.\n\ni have to say, our waiter (glen h) was awesome the whole night. he was extremely attentive, and we didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> notice any decline in service after we had ordered our meal. he answered questions on the menu items (which i always have at these type of places where they have fancy names for everything), and was around just enough but not too much.\n\nfood is served with a complimentary trio of duck fat fries, which were amazing. i ordered the prix fixe menu as planned and chose the salad wedge, prime rib, and root beer float dessert. my girlfriend ordered the kobe burger with a side of duck fat fries (we didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> know we would be getting complimentary fries before we had ordered, and she really wanted to try them).\n\nthe meal was excellent. the duck fat fries were a perfect start and the prime <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> surprisingly filling (i got triple sides of mac n cheese as well lol). the root beer float was not my thing. to be honest, i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not sure how different you can do a root beer float, so i found it somewhat uncharacteristic of this type of restaurant.\n\nall in all, we kept the bill to $150, and that<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> with four drinks (a head<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> up, the specials go from $6 to $13 after 7pm, which i hadn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> noticed before we had ordered our seconds). we even had leftovers, though i warn that duck fat fries do not taste good at all cold, so kill these at the restaurant (the fat begins to harden).\n\ni think the prix fixe menu served its purpose in wetting our appetite for stripsteak. i would love to come back again soon. nice bar, comfortable seating area. it was a near perfect dinner. 4.5 stars rounded up to 5.",

            "have i been living like a baller the past couple days or what? \n\nfather in law is staying at mandalay bay for a convention this week, so after watching the tigers game at the sports book, we ventured out to find some grub and a few drinks for catching up. after looking at several menus we decided on strip steak. wife<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> pops is probably the biggest fan of steak in the world. yeah, you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> probably met a steak lover before. not like this guy though. \n\nfor starters, the place is right off the restaurant mall-ish area when you are walking from the casino back to wards the shark reef and chapel are. familiar to me since i got married there! it is a little loud and not as intimate as your typical high end steak house, but that is to be expected considering the location and the fact it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> called \"strip\" steak. \n\nvery extensive wine and cock<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> list sure to please anything you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> crave. the dinner menu was impressive as well, featuring a massive selection of steaks from any quality and cut you could imagine. there were also your typical sea food selections and the ala-carte sides you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> grown to love from a nice steak house, <mark>Baked Potato</mark>, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, etc. let us get back to the important part - the steaks. \n\nwe were lucky enough to be sat close enough to see the giant wood fire grill system set up in the kitchen and the meat lockers with giant slabs of meat. now that sounds pretty weird, but it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> cool to see them wheel the grills up and down while your choice cut is being prepared. in theory, they could put a name-tag on your selection and you could watch them cook it. \n\nour table ordered the east coast oysters of which i only had one. it was perfect though. the wedge salad looked impressive, but had a cheap store bought like bleu cheese dressing instead of the crumbled bleu cheese you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> expect on a steak house chop salad. pass. \n\ni selected the bone in rib-eye. it was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing. the steak was well marbled, just the right amount of char, and seasoned the way a steak should be. no fancy sauces tonight. i also had the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> i mentioned above, and it wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> that good. they sprinkled what seemed like bacos (gross) on the top, which were really pointless. also, they spinach was not as creamy as a <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> should be. am i being picky about spinach? i suppose, but for as proud of the menu (think $$$$) as this place was, they better do it all right. \n\noverall it was a great meal. i had a few cock<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> from the bar, and my two counterparts enjoyed some wine. the cock<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> are served with one giant ice cube which is an interesting touch, as it did not water  down my drink as fast as a normal ice having drink would have. \n\ni saved the best for last. when your server hands you your menus, there is a snack of three types of fries served at the table, with three dipping sauces. one set of fries is fried in duck fat. absolutely not gross. paired with the truffle dipping sauce, they were probably the best fries i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> ever had in the history of me eating fries. they were so good i almost ordered a hamburger at a steak house, just so i could have the side of fries it would have come with. \n\n4 stars out of 5 for the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> thingy and the less than impressive wedge salad. \n\nnote: if you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> an out of town-er looking for a pregame meal before your main event of a drink filled excellent adventure on the strip, you could do much worse, and i can<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> imagine you could do a ton better. great service, nice bar, and even with a convention in the same building were able to seat us without a reservation.", 
            "after reading about this place, i knew it would be something good! \n\nstripsteak is located in mandalay bay, where all the restaurants are, before the mandalay bay conference rooms and ballrooms. \n\nwhen you walk up (hopefully with reservations as this place gets busy!) there is a full bar with a seating area. luckily, we were able to get a table without reservations at 7:00pm on a monday night. they sat us at a nice table, right in the middle of the action. it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> a tad loud in there so bring your listening skills. \n\nafter you are seated and given the menu, they bring out three little con<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> with french fries and dipping sauces. now these are not your mcdonald<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> fries. these are the most amazing fries you will ever have. \n\nthe first one had french fries with old bay seasoning and a mustard herb dipping sauce. \n\nthe second one had french fries with oregano and ketchup. \n\nthe third one was knock-your-socks off amazing. french fries in duck fat with truffle dipping sauce. are you fucking kidding me?!?! the minute we all tried these we all looked at each other and said \"these are goddamn delicious!\" \n\nall three had fantastic flavor with good crisp on the outside. \n\nbut yea- duck fat + french fries + truffle = smiling faces. \n\nour table ordered: \nstarters- \noysters (in a <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark>)- east coast style. they ask you if you want them east coast or west coast style. the difference? east coast are \"larger and briny-er\", west coast are \"smaller and sweeter\" according to our server. \nthe oysters were delicious! they had came with cock<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> sauce, lemon, and other toppings. the cock<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> sauce had some nice horseradish in it for the perfect combination. \n\nwedge salad- bleu cheese, bacon & polenta croutons, red chili cucumbers. i was told that it was disappointing as the bleu cheese dressing didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> have any bleu cheese chucks and tasted \"like it came out of the store\" \n\nmain- \n18 oz. dry-aged bone-<mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark>- heard it was delicious. they cook the steaks on this beautiful open flame wood burning grill. you can watch the chefs using the wheel up and down to get the steaks. heard that the marble was good and had great char on the steak. nothing fancy just cooked perfect (medium-rare plus) \n\n16 oz. kansas city strip- great char, great flavor, all round good steak. \n\n<mark>Diver Scallops</mark>- which is what i ordered. four deliciously tender, cooked perfectly, great flavored scallops. seared nicely. \n\nsides- \n<mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> w/ bacon- i love <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> and this was up to par, but nothing crazy. the bacon doesn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> really add anything to the dish. \n\nroasted maitake mushrooms- great roasted mushrooms. not much else to say. they are always a good side to seafood and steaks. \n\nwe had a couple of glasses of wine (a cab-combination) that was really good and i would order all day long! \n\ni cannot wait to go back for more duck fat and truffle and oysters and more food in general!", 
            "before i explain why i am rating this restaurant a two star, i want to express that my food and and beverages were exceptional.  the beverages were superbly prepared and decorated and the appetizers, side items, main courses and desserts were all eclectic, astonishing and delicious.  with that said, the problems with my experience started from the moment i sat down.  as i scanned thru the food menu, drinks menu and prices, our waiter sidled up and announced the specials.  he was not very personable and seemed unconcerned that we had chosen this restaurant to dine in for the evening. understanding that some people can lack in some areas but make it up in others, i left my thoughts aside and decided to enjoy my dining experience.  the second setback arrived when i placed my wine order.  the waiter had no idea which wine i selected, even though i also pointed to it in the wine menu.  eventually he returned with multiple bottles for me to choose from.  this took a lot longer than it should have for me to order a bottle of wine and was very unprofessional, especially considering how high the prices are.  the waiter then left the table and did not open the bottle in front of us.  i ordered a $90 <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> of wine and i could see the waiter 20 feet away from us, with his back to our table, haggling with this bottle of wine.  when he finally returned to the table, i was over it.  the support staff were all amazing, helpful and smiling, however, our waiter never cracked a smile.  he seemed unskilled and miserable.  when we finished our meal we made him aware that we would have dessert but needed some time to relax.  after dessert he eagerly brought us our bill.  i have been made aware of a couple of service features of strip steak since this experience which have maddened me further.  after a meal, there is a complimentary bag of chocolate kettle corn presented to the guests.  we were not made aware of this kind gesture because our waiter was in a hurry to have us leave the restaurant.  also, i am a local now, which i revealed to our waiter, and i am told that strip steak carries a locals menu, although he was not concerned enough to present one to us.  our bill was over $500 for three people and even though gratuity was added, it was not deserved.  i will always tip wait staff in any situation, but when that situation is a negative one i tend to never return to the restaurant again.  if you are like me when it comes to good professional service, i would suggest you skip this restaurant as well.  on a side note, a female member of our party visited the restroom facilities, which are unisex, and she walked in on a gentleman who had not locked the door.  she was very embarrassed by this and mentioned it to our waiter.  he seemed offended that we had an issue with the restroom policy of the restaurant and acted as if it were our problem.  our only suggestion was that they have a dedicated woman<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> restroom and that others could remain unisex.", 
            "first trip to stripsteak.  \n\nwe had - \n1.  complimentary duck fat fries\n2.  complimentary bread\n3.  strip steak ($44) - medium rare\n4.  skirt steak ($36) - medium rare - was more medium so overcooked\n5.  truffle mac <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> cheese ($12) - absolutely heavenly, so decadent\n6.  brusself sprouts ($12) - not a fan of these at all - was more like a brussel slaw with lots of bacon, unfortunately i am not a bacon fan\n7.  gingerale ($4) - really small glass with lots of ice\n8.  coffee ($5)\n9.  complimentary bag of chocolate popcorn to take home - nice touch\n\ntotal bill was $113 before tax and tip for 2 of us.\n\nlesson learned - order steaks medium rare stressing more on the rare side.  wish they had smaller cuts of steak though because i could not possibly finish even <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> my steak!  i hated to throw it away too, such a waste.\n\nwe would go back to try it again but bring reinforcements so we could eat all the food and possibly make it to dessert!", 
            "i arrived before my sis-in-heart to celebrate her birthday. i mentioned the occasion so that we could have a table that wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> stuck in the midst of a bunch of tourists, nor did i want to sit near the bar; we wanted to take our time and enjoy the evening. when the hostess sat us, she found for us a table sort of center-stage... in other words, we could see everything going on and had a fantastic view of the whole place.\n\nas soon as we sat down, we were offered water and a wine list and the restaurant week menu. as that is how my sis chose this place, we were just fine with that idea.\n\nwe also noticed a birthday card from the staff. de<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark>, people, de<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark>!\n\ngetting to the good stuff (well, mostly):\n\nduck-fat fries (3.5/5) - the truffled fries were amazing but their accompanying bleu cheese sauce was bland and boring. the herbed fries were, ironically, refreshing, with a simple ketchup (keep it simple, stripsteak!). the last one, i can<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> remember what it was, was good with the grain mustard sauce (the best sauce offered, just flavorful enough without putting off people [my sis] who don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> like mustard). \n\n<mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark> sliders (1.5/5) - ordered off the main menu as an extra, we originally wanted the <mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark> they list as an extra. we were told it was a single piece, but if we order the sliders there are 2. ok, we thought, we<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> try it. spoiler alert! it was still a single piece, just sliced in half. this made it too thin, overcooked, and dry. the bread (i tasted it, to be fair) was dry and pretty bland. the garnishes were ok. a single piece of arugula and a bright little cherry gelee of sorts. overall, high hopes dashed.\n\nduck <mark>Crab Spring Rolls</mark> (3.5/5) - generous portion and, i was happily surprised, not too heavy. the wrapper was thin and crispy, although a tad (a smidgeon?) too oily. again, however, it was not heavy. the crisp veggies did well to set off the richness of the duck. the meat was well seasoned and had a great flavor. it was a bit dry in spots. i am going to blame presentation and delivery (heat lamps?) versus cooking as it was mostly at the cut edges of the rolls.\n\nheirloom tomato salad (8/5, yes, seriously) - fresh, fresh tomatoes, creamy, rich burrata cheese that didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> weight it down in any way, and the perfect amount of a tangy, sweet, beautiful 25-year old balsamic vinegar that has had me drooling for the past 12 hours.\n\n<mark>16 Oz Ny Strip</mark> (4/5) - slightly overcooked based on our order. we were a bit surprised as the server said they tend to undercook slightly... still, it was a fantastic cut of meat, very well seasoned, and perfectly tender and flavorful. the sides of sauteed mushrooms (another 8/5) and creamed corn with jalapeno (4/5) were great complements.\n\n<mark>Mary<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> Free Range Roasted Chicken</mark> (4/5) - a tad on the dry side in places, the overall dish was fabulous. i love that they left the skin on; i don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> eat the skin, but it imparted a rich flavor to the meat and left those portions really juicy and tender. the truffled mac n<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> (4/5) was really good. almost too much truffle, not enough cheese, and because it was used as the bed for the chicken, it picked up other flavors (meat, greens, sauces) that detracted from it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> own amazing profile.\n\nvanilla bean creme brulee and biegnets (5/5) - the brulee was creamy, perfectly flavored, and delicious. the biegnets were expertly fried, hot and cripsy and dusted with powered sugar without being overly dressed. another de<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> we thought was fantastic, sis<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> dessert came out presented with the words happy birthday in a sweet, dark chocolate!\n\nwines (5/5, nail on the head every time). we started with a pinot gris and a viogner, then with the help of gabriel, the sommelier, chose a fruity, dry-ish oregon pinot noir to go with the meal. we spoke for a moment on trying something new, price points, and flavor profiles (what we liked and what we ordered). given the whole picture, his recommendation was well received and the perfect wine for everything we ate.\n\nthe service was good, though the server could have visited us a little more often. there were a few large parties so we were happy to wait a little here and there, and as other staff were also happy to smile, ask if you needed anything, and be of service, it was not a dark spot at all. \n\nall in all, a solid, enjoyable meal.\n\nwith the restaurant week menu (50.11 each), the 2 wines by the glass and the bottle, plus the additional <mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark>, our total was $300 and change. bonus tip: they are on restaurant.com so another $50 saved!",

            "if i had written this after my first visit i would not have given it five stars. yes, the duck fat fries were freaking amazing and some of the best this fry-junkie had ever tasted. but the steak i got, the porterhouse, was bland and tasteless and not even that tender. for that price and reputation, everything should be supreme. i was sorely disappointed. but my husband convinced me to go back, since we were staying at mandalay bay again, and he found an unbelievable deal on restaurant.com: $50 gift certificate for only $4. so i reluctantly agreed and boy, am i glad i did. \n\nwe sat down at the bar, because we arrived early for our 7pm reservation, and happily discovered happy hour was still in effect. so we got melon mojitos and stripsteak sours for just $6 each. we ordered a <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> oysters and they were so clean tasting and delicious. they include like three different sauces but just a little squeeze of lemon and a dash of tabasco was perfect. the bartender, anthony was funny and attentive.\n\nnow to dinner. don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> love the tables and chairs, which resemble office lunchroom decor. but our server, steven, was one of the best we<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> ever had. he was friendly, attentive, informative and generous. we told him about our last experience and he more than made up for it by comping two amazing $20 glasses of cab. i ordered the kobe rib \"cap\"... 8 oz. for $67!!! i usually get my steaks medium rare, but steven suggested medium plus, due to the marbling in the meat. and good god, it was the best piece of meat i have ever had. perfect flavor and char. i didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> think it was possible to make regular <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> seem average, but that<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> how good it was. every. delectable. savory. bite. foodgasm. multiple. we also ordered the jalapeno creamed corn, and creme brulee with beignets. aaaah, i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> still thinking about it. when can i go back???",

            "i had a very good meal here, but nothing blew me away. given the reputation of the chef and the price paid, that is disappointing. my friend and i were seated about 15 minutes after our reservation time. dana white and a group of ufc fighters were dining in the restaurant as well during the time of our visit. in fact i came pretty close to smacking the guy in the crotch when he walked by our table and i was in mid stretch. so yeah, as other have mentioned, the tables are packed pretty close together here. in addition to nearly smacking a guy in the crotch, the closeness of the tables also meant hearing a lot of other people<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> conversations. the nice older woman next to us started to tell some of the most expletive filled stories after a few glasses of wine. i did like that it was a relaxed atmosphere for fine dining. my wrinkle free shirts hadn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> stayed as wrinkle free as i would have liked in my luggage and being sort on time i put on a black t-shirt and tried for the steve jobs look. i thought i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> look out of place, but lots of people were dressed casually. \n\nour server was in a bit of a rush at first. all of his tables were sat at the same time including ours, but later in the night, as things calmed down, he came over and chatted with us for a bit. the guy was right on with all his suggestions. the service was good overall. \n\nfor appetizers we had the <mark><mark>Grilled Maine Lobster</mark> Fritters</mark> and east coast oysters. the fritters were <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> in bacon, fried and served with butter lettuce and creme fraiche. you know anything made with that combination of ingredients is going to be good and it was, but it was just good. i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not usually one to talk about the concept of a dish, but when i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> in a place like stripsteak i am hoping for something unique. this dish didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> strike me as being anything that unique as much as it was a bunch of delicious stuff that got fried. we also received our complimentary fries and while they were all good, the one that really stood out was the truffled one.\n\nmy friend and i both had the bone-<mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> as our entree. hate to say it, but it was slightly overcooked. i kept cutting into it hoping it was just the char from the wood burning grill that made it seem less pink than a medium rare should have been, but my steak was mostly medium until i got very close to the bone. this was a shame since it was a very good cut of meat. my friend had his with <mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark> and it was a great combination. he also had the chipotle scalloped potatoes recommended by our server and they were excellent. i went old school and got a <mark>Baked Potato</mark>. the overcooked steak was probably the biggest disappointment of the night.\n\nwe were both stuffed, but after such a heavy meal i wanted something sweet to end the night. we both went with the beignets. i had the one with chocolate, pudding, and macallan 18. i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> eat anything with macallan 18 in it. it was a decent beignet. a little bit denser than i would have liked, but probably done so because it was intended to be dipped into the pudding. again, a good dessert, but nothing amazing. the best part was probably the macallan. my friend had the same thing but with creme brulee instead of pudding.\n\nso yeah, that was pretty much the story of the night. good food and good service, but nothing we had really wowed me. my friend raves about his steak with <mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark>, but it was his first time having <mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark> so i guess we all remember our first time ;) i think the only item that was really memorable to me was the truffled fries.", 
            "this might be the first time i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> gone against the majority in a negative way. i had reservations as part of a package that included tickets to \"the lion king\". so i had a pre fix menu to choose from. the decor inside the restaurant was nice, and everyone was friendly when i arrived. \n\nthe server was friendly, but a bit slow. i started my meal with the mushroom soup and also ordered the <mark><mark>Grilled Maine Lobster</mark> Fritters</mark>. the fritters where very tasty. that was by far my favorite pert of the meal. then i tried the mushroom soup. maybe my expectations where to high, but i just didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> enjoy it. it was too creamy and barely served warm. no everything could be a winner tho. \n\nfor my entree i had the skirt steak. here is where they went from 4 stars to 2 stars. normally i order my steak med-rare. my steak came out charred on top, and completely raw in the middle. i ate less then <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> it, and had to give up the rest. i over herd my server talking to another table, saying that the steak is cooked under temperature, so i should have ordered it medium. unfortunately, my server failed to mention this to me and got stuck with a tough, burnt tasting raw piece of meat. not a winning entree. (it did taste great re hashed in my breakfast burrito the next morning however.)\n\nmy only dessert choice was a root beer float. creative, if your 5 years old. slow service and food below par. maybe if i hadn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> been on a pre fix menu it would have been better. with all the choices in vegas, it will be tough to get me back.",

(i promise i don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> eat liver with fava beans and a nice chianti). \n\nnon-beef mains?  who knows.  you don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> go to a steakhouse to eat chicken or fish.\n\ndesert?  no room.\n\nthe wine list is outstanding, with a lot of gems from around the world.  vegas resort pricing except for more expensive bottles where the markup is low.  \n\nvery important:  the typical guest at this hip steakhouse has a lot of, how to put it,  disposable income.  the sommeliers try not to insult guest by asking how much they want to spend but rather make recommendations based on the caliber of the first bottle selected.  save yourself the grief, speak clearly and tell them what you want to spend.  its not fun to be presented with an unexpected four figure wine tab.\n\nservice remains excellent.\n\nhighly recommended", 
            "note:  this review is specifically for their happy hour.\n\nstripsteak is located in the restaurant wing/section of mandalay bay, and offers happy hour daily from 400-600pm.  seating is first come first serve at the bar and lounge area in the front section of the restaurant.  although the food offerings/specials for happy hour are few in number, all doubts will be cast away as soon as you get a whiff and taste of the food.\n\nthe bar and lounge food menu consists of a mere 5 items, and my friend and i decided on 3:\n\n1)  prime <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>, $10; au jus with brioche bun\n2)  meatballs, $8; with heirloom tomato sauce and aged jack cheese\n3)  duck spring roll, $9; hot and sour cherry sauce\n\nwe ordered 1 item that was not listed on the menu, and that was the the trio of duck fat fries with herb, truffle, and bbq dipping sauces..\n\nas far as drinks, select beers are $3, well drinks $6, and an assortment of \"featured cock<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark>\" are $6 as well.\n\naside from the duck fat fries, our other favorite dish of the evening were the meatballs, as we thought the combination of the sauce and aged jack cheese cer<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> made a flavorful combination.  the prime <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> can be slightly on the messy side so make sure to have ample napkins available.  the <mark>Crab Spring Rolls</mark> were delicious, but not as wonderful as the duck fat fries.  truth be told, my friend and i ordered and devoured 2 orders of duck fat fries that night.....that dish is a winner!\n\nservice:  excellent and outstanding.  the 2 female servers were very polite, patient, and always checked on us in a timely manner.\n\nbottom line:  one of the happiest hours i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> been to =)  i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> definitely be back on future trips to vegas.",

(i like my fried foods as hot as they can get).\n\nmy fiance ordered the <mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark>, and i ordered the rib-eye.  they butter poach their steaks, which makes them juicy and delicious!  i enjoyed my rib-eye, but the <mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark> was superior by far.  we ordered wine with dinner, but i can<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> remember what we ordered.  \n\nas far as sides, we ordered the creamed bacon spinach and potato puree 3 ways (one was with lobster, one with horseradish, and one was cheesy i think?).  the <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> potatoes were soooo good.  they were amazing.  i liked the bite of the horseradish ones, and the cheesy ones were also very good.  the creamed bacon spinach had a liquid smoke flavor, which i was indifferent about.  it was good, but i think i would try something else next time.  i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> just not a huge fan of artificial smoke flavor.  \n\nfiance ordered a cappuccino for dessert.  it was above average, good for a steak house.  \n\nall in all, i would definitely like to come here again, but i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> be trying out other steak places before my return.  i would definitely get the <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> again, and the <mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark>.",

            "the best all-around steakhouse i have ever had the pleasure of eating at.  \n\nit is hip and stylish with premium appointments all around you.  fine dining meals and de<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> oriented serving but at the same time very casual.  come as you are to stripsteak.\n\ni have eaten here a dozen or more times over a period of about 5 years.  in my opinion, steak does not get better than this.\n\nthis last visit, i had the pleasure of meeting chef gerald chin.  he talked with me for almost a <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> about the kitchen and showed me a couple cool tricks too.  i was very impressed...he is a super nice guy.\n\nyou can get some really massive <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>, but for me the high end stuff is way out of my price range.  the most expensive steak i have had here is the kobe a5, which i was not impressed with anyway.\n\nthe signature steak is the kobe <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>, now market price because mina probably depleted the whole worlds supply. it was about $80 before, but you can expect to pay between 80 and 100 now.  this is butter poached and then finished on a wood fire.  truly amazing.  they have immersion heaters that keep clarified butter at poaching temperature.  when an order comes up they just take one out of the bath and grill the outside...so the level of doneness is determined by the immersion heater, not the grill.  this guarantees you will always get a steak cooked perfectly to your desired temperature.\n\nmy favorite appetizer was the <mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark> sliders...but sadly they are no more.  there are tons of pics of them to see if you want.  \n\ni got to taste a new dish (it just rolled out the night i went there) which was a trio of <mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark>.  there was a seared piece on top of gingerbread, a financier of foie (small french cake), and a miso-poached torchon.  all were topped with a piece of quince and some sprinkled hazelnuts.  such an amazing dish.\n\nif you are in vegas, i highly recommend you make your dinner reservations here.", 
            "like everyone else says, the duck fat fries were amazing. one of the sauces is ketchup-garlic like, another tastes like zingy sour cream and yummy goodness, and the third tasted like what the inside of a nail salon smells like. not the polish, but everything else, and it was probably my favorite because it was so good!\n\ni started with the prosciutto tart and while it was crumbly, it was light but still wowed me. to be honest, i was full by the end of having <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> the tart. those fries were seriously delicious! why can<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> i buy those sauces anywhere?!\n\ni ordered the <mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark> medium rare and it was easy to cut and easy to love. it had a cheesy taste to it and was delicious.\n\ni tried two sides - the <mark>Spinach Souffl</mark>\\u00e9 and the <mark>Baked Potato</mark>. the <mark>Baked Potato</mark> was like any kind of <mark>Baked Potato</mark> i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> ever had. it was so smooth, but still a potato, with all kinds of flavors. the souffl\\u00e9 had parmesan sauce over it and it was very yummy. i personally liked the <mark>Baked Potato</mark> more than the souffl\\u00e9.\n\nthe only downside was that we also ordered the mac n<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> but never received it. it wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> on the bill either so i guess it was just not so great communication. other than that, our server was nice but looked like a bartender. however, the staff was excellent and my water was never to the bottom of the glass. i guess you can say that they kept me optimistic! i enjoyed the servers helping each other out in what appeared to be a team. i usually see people goofing off and talking too much in restaurants but this was really perfect.\n\nmy tastebuds were in shock by all the flavors. i can<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> wait to come here again in the future. their bathroom sink was cool!",

            "my husband and i have a tradition of ending our vegas trips with a steak dinner and this place was the next on our places to try. we were seated right on time for our reservation at a private table towards the back. they give each table a trio of duck fat fries with three different dipping sauces on the house. it was a nice touch since we didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> order an appetizer. \n\nwe ordered:\n\n30oz porterhouse: it was a good size and since i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not much of a meat person, my husband had to take care of the majority of it. the meat was perfectly cooked albeit a bit under-seasoned. \n\npotato puree trio: such a cute presentation and a perfect side for spud lovers. the potatoes were pureed to creamy perfection but the flavors weren<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> very potent. the <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> as decadent  as mastros, and the sour cream and onion tasted like plain mashed potatoes. the horseradish had a nice kick to it and was my favorite of the bunch.\n\nbrussel sprouts: we read it had bacon lardon mixed in and we were sold. the smoky flavor of the bacon complemented the shredded brussel sprouts nicely. \n\nwe also ordered a bottle of cabernet and it was our first time seeing the sommelier pour a little bit out  to taste for himself before presenting it to us. \n\nthe server was attentive but not intrusive. good ambiance, not crowded, quiet, dim lighting, typical fancy steakhouse vibe. although we did enjoy our experience here, with so many great steakhouses in vegas, it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> hard to say when would come back.", 
            "my husband and i had dinner here with another couple and it was fabulous!  we started with cock<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> at the bar, and were really pleased with the variety and creativity of drinks offered.  definitely a great spot to come back to before a show.\n\nafter being seated by the friendly hostess we were greeted with a complimentary french fry trio (yum!!!!!), and then started off with the oysters.  they were delicious.  just briny enough to please any palate, and the cock<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> sauce had an awesome kick to it.  the sommelier was helpful in choosing a wine, and i definitely recommend asking him for a recommendation based on what you are eating.  following the appetizer we had salads, which were crisp and beautifully presented.  ordering one to split among two people is more than enough, and they are happy to divide the salad between two plates for you (always a nice touch).\n\nfor entrees two people in our party had steaks (filet and <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark>, i believe), and two had seafood entrees.  the meat-eaters said that the steaks were some of the best they had ever had, and the seafood dishes were cooked perfectly and extremely flavorful.  for sides we had one order of truffle mac and cheese to share, and it was plenty for four people.  the entrees also come with a small garnish of potato and carrot, so everyone was definitely full by the end of the meal.  \n\noverall we will definitely be visiting stripsteak again!  the waiter was excellent, and the service was highly attentive - just what you come to expect from a high end steakhouse in vegas.  cheers!", 
            "nothing to say, just great food, the steak was like a piece of butter and the cock<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> are ingenious, original and delicious.  try the fries with the truffle sauce, you cant stop eating them!", 
            "we were pretty disappointed with almost everything at this restaurant. it was pretty noisy and my husband and i were sat at a table where we had to sit across from each other. we could barely hear each other due to the noise. our server was nice, the problem was that the service itself sucked. everything took forever!! i ordered a cock<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> which didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> even arrive until after our appetizer. when my steak came out it wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> just rare... it was raw and i had ordered it medium. my husband had also ordered the same steak prepared the same way and was done eating before my steak came back out. even after being cooked longer it still came out hardly even warm. the best part of the whole meal was the cheesecake. so i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> have to say the only reason i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> giving 2 stars is the cheesecake and the nice server.", 
            "i have been to as many michael mina steak restaurants as possible after falling in love with bourbon steak in dc. i mean they give you french fries instead of bread- what<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not to like? that being said i would say my experience at the vegas restaurant was slightly worse than in dc or sf but i am a niles crane-esque nitpicker so don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> let that deter you. also, stripsteak is in the mandalay bay which makes it a bit easier to get a table/reservation on the weekends as its not nearly as popular a hotel as it once was (something that also lends to the border grill brunch). there are like 3 negative reviews where the people say \" i can make food better than this\"- i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not sure if they all climbed out of the same clown car together but if they can actually make better food they are in the wrong industry. \n\n\nthe steak\n\ni always get a <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> when i first go to a steak place as a basis of comparison with other restaurants. the <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> here is a bit smaller than usual (18 oz vs usual 22 or more) and i actually think the meat was a little tastier. the steak had been trimmed a little more than i would like (fat= flavor) but it didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> seem to have negatively affected the steak. the curst was nice and salty- good. medium rare was a deep red-good. the price (59$) is pretty average for vegas steak joints on the strip. my dining companion got the waygu  vs waygu entree and that was fantastic- probably what i will get the next time i go (although bacon rapped veal is pretty enticing as well) \n\nthe sides\n\nsome people, after eating 2 lbs of french fries, might think \"you know what; i probably don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> need another potato side\". we call those people losers. the reason these underhumans won<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> be dining with me is because stripsteak has a little something called the potato puree trio- much like the fires it delivers 3 different kinds of potato including one that is pureed with lobster. perhaps i am a philistine but the <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> were actually freaking awesome. i know it probably shouldn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> be done, i know it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> probably not the choicest <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> but jesus... it is good. \n\nthe mac and cheese- i also always get this when available my first time at a steak place and this one did not disappoint. it was quite \"crusty\" with lots of bits on top which i like. the mac itself was perhaps a little dry but i would rather that than have it swimming. \n\nbroccolini- had a very nice amount of garlic flavor which made this usually inedible weed actually taste pretty good.",

(they should check out the wedge at mastro<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> to see what an upscale wedge is like.) i think this wedge was around $16--maybe more.  crazy!\n\nanyway, things got much better when our entr\\u00e9es arrived. i ordered the yellow <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> sashimi appetizer, and it was some of the most delicious sashimi i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> ever had. it was super fresh and tender--practically melted in my mouth--and it was prepared just perfectly, with just a touch of sauce and jalape\\u00f1o; it had a perfect balance of flavors.  \n\nmy husband ordered the filet, and it was cooked perfectly--very tender and flavorful. \n\nwe also shared the potatoes gratin. it was like a large brick of thinly sliced, tender potatoes in a cheesy cream sauce (no unwanted ingredients, such as onions). they were delicious. \n\nfinally, we had to have dessert. i thought the beignets with three different sauces sounded delicious, but anthony recommended the apple crumble (served with vanilla bean ice cream), so we ordered that instead. anthony was right--it was great. he also brought out one freshly cooked beignet for us to try (so nice of him!), and it was delicious too. \n\nwe left stripsteak fat and happy. highly recommend!

(more on that below.)  additionally, sides were served \"family style.\"  broccolini, pureed potatoes of three flavors (sour cream and chive, lobster, and i can<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> remember the other), and truffle mac and cheese.  the truffle mac and cheese was the highlight for many of my guests (the ones that didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> order steak.)\n\nahh yes, the steak.  peruse their menu and you will see that michael mina doesn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> drive to a corner butcher to get his cuts.  with all respect to usda grading of beef, this night required a little international flavor...in the form of...\n\nworld wide wagyu.\n\nanyone who has done steak research knows that japanese beef is luxurious but also a curiosity.  \"kobe sliders\" at your local bar and grill for $12 have more in common with an aging basketball player than they do true kobe beef.  even cows that are designated \"wagyu\" may not be imported from japan.  so, this mini world tour consisted of three cuts of wagyu (beef derived from a line of japanese cows that are bred in other countries.)  these cuts:\n\n<mark><mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> . Australian Wagyu</mark> <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> - <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> is the new trendy top cut of meat.  it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> generally the best couple ounces of your <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark>, made even better when it comes from a well-marbled <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>.  this cut had a perfect sear and set all my umami sensors afire.\n\n<mark><mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> .

(i didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> check to see if it was actually braised short <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not.)  \n\nfinally, real japanese \"a5\" grade wagyu <mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark>.  a5 is the highest grading that <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> have in japan, based on beef yield, color, and the all-important marbling score.  i wish i could have seen a photo of it before it was cooked, to visualize all the delicious marbling.  after cooking, it tasted like pure meat butter.  delicious.\n\nafter a meal like this, i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not sure if i can ever go back to eating steaks even at fancy local steakhouses.  of the three, i am declaring the <mark><mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> . Australian Wagyu</mark> <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> the winner in an ever so slight margin over the japanese a5 filet (though, likely, just because it was <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>).  the australian came in third, but was still delicious.  wagyu, you may have ruined me for life!  thank you, stripsteak, for introducing me to it and making me an addict.  \n\nthank you also for an incredible birthday with a ridiculously good meal.",

(for a $185 piece of meat it should be perfect)  the foie was good not great.  the mac & cheese was pretty good.  with all the components being so rich, i didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> have room for dessert.\n\nservice was decent.  i was not offered the potato foccacia bread.  not sure if this was because i was solo but i didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> make a fuss about it because i honestly wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> as hungry as i wanted to be because of brunch earlier in the day.  this was my first time at a michael mina restaurant and i came away unimpressed.  i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> try another one of his restaurants before passing final judgment but this is probably the one and only time i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> eat at stripsteak",

            "i would actually give this place 4 1/2 stars, but it falls just short of being perfect. to start, our server was excellent. she was spot on for all of her recommendations and descriptions. her wine recommendation, which i think was the house cabernet sauvignon, was fantastic. i had the kobe <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>, my other dinner mates had the kobe <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark>, <mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark>, and scallops. my steak was cooked nicely med-rare, and tasted amazing with fantastic marbling. however, it seemed like the other steaks were cooked just a bit less than requested. you can taste the mesquite wood flavor in the meat, although i didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> think it enhanced the flavor too much. the starter duck fat fries are excellent, as is the <mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark> slider appetizer. the truffle mac and cheese is a must try. the mushrooms were a little salty (maybe they<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> supposed to be), but had good mushroom flavor. at the end of the meal, we were too stuffed to try any desserts, but their coffee was a perfect finish to a very nice meal.",

            "the skinny: a step up on the regular steakhouse, this place delivers some good eats with finesse and occasional missteps - don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> order the duck fat fries because it comes as a sizable amuse bouche (4) service: our waiter/servers were great but there are major issues with the hostess stand (3) value: considering the plethora of deals on restaurant.com, this place can be a good value if you order right (4).\n\nmy hubby was hankering to take me here for a while and we finally got a chance to try the menu at stripsteak.\n\nafter passing by multiple restaurants with hostesses soliciting our business, we were taken aback by the inefficient hostess. by our seating time, there was least 3-4  group of guests gathered around the hostess desk. she basically ignored the diners and the wait staff  who lined to find out how to seat us. \n\nshe also didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> tell us about ongoing promotions at the restaurant: ie, the 3-course prix fixe menu for $55, or that they are currently having a half-priced happy hour lounge menu from 4-7pm. plus, they don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> offer  you their prix fixe menu unless you specifically ask for it... even when you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> seated at the table. for this reason, despite the stellar service at our table, the service gets 3 stars.\n\nmichael mina is known for preparing a dish in three different ways. so obviously our amuse bouche consisted of bay-seasoned, garlic herb, truffled duck fat fries served with accompanying truffle aioli, ketchup and mustard/bay-seasoned sauce. the fries had a lovely crispness that re<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> its texture even when it cooled off. the sauces were lovely especially the truffle aioli. i considered drinking the remaining dregs of it on the bottom but decided i still needed to save my appetite for food we<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> ordered. \n\nthe soups were solid but nothing special. the vidalia onion soup accentuated the sweetness of onion but the croutons really lack that nice crunch. the seafood chowder was  good - the broth was a little on the milder side which allowed for the diner to get the full flavour of the crab when eaten.\n\nthe <mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark> sliders had the right flavour however the bun was definitely overly large considering the serving of foie on the inside. the plating would have been infinitely improved with having the bun on the side.\n\nby far the standout was our bone-in rib-eye. it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> rare to see me shovel down an entire steak the size of a catcher<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> mitt all on my own but there was not a scrap of meat left on that plate. yes, it is that good. the carmelized crust on the meat was so wonderful, the inside so tender and well-seasoned ... it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> hard to find steak that well-prepared. \n\nit was lovely that they provided a small tasting of three sides along with the rib-eye. the peas were okay - a little on the mealier side of things. the truffled mac <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> cheese is always great - perfect consistency, texture and flavour. unfortunately, the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> had a rather bitter unpleasant undertone.\n\nthe hubby<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> grilled chicken (they don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> fry a serving of chicken unless two people order) was a very large portion. <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> grilled chicken - a lovely crispy skin, tender and moist on the inside - on top of their wonderful mac <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> cheese. who wouldn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> like this?\n\nwe topped off our very filling meal with a root beer float and warm chocolate chip cookies. we loved the fact that the ice cream was so cold, it turned our creamy root beer into a nice slush. the chocolate chip cookies were a delight - not too sweet,cool enough to have a mild crust on the outside with melting chocolate on the inside.\n\noverall, we had a wonderful meal for a very reasonable price due to the restaurant.com certificate. we ordered one prix fixe meals ($55 + $10 supplement for the steak) plus two starters (<mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark> $22; onion soup: $17) and one entree (chicken $30). subtract the $50 restaurant.com certificate (we got at bargain basement prices), the meal ended up being $118.97 (including tax and 18% tip) which is reasonable considering the quantity and quality of the cuisine. definitely a solid four star review.", 
            "i arrived before my sis-in-heart to celebrate her birthday. i mentioned the occasion so that we could have a table that wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> stuck in the midst of a bunch of tourists, nor did i want to sit near the bar; we wanted to take our time and enjoy the evening. when the hostess sat us, she found for us a table sort of center-stage... in other words, we could see everything going on and had a fantastic view of the whole place.\n\nas soon as we sat down, we were offered water and a wine list and the restaurant week menu. as that is how my sis chose this place, we were just fine with that idea.\n\nwe also noticed a birthday card from the staff. de<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark>, people, de<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark>!\n\ngetting to the good stuff (well, mostly):\n\nduck-fat fries (3.5/5) - the truffled fries were amazing but their accompanying bleu cheese sauce was bland and boring. the herbed fries were, ironically, refreshing, with a simple ketchup (keep it simple, stripsteak!). the last one, i can<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> remember what it was, was good with the grain mustard sauce (the best sauce offered, just flavorful enough without putting off people [my sis] who don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> like mustard). \n\n<mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark> sliders (1.5/5) - ordered off the main menu as an extra, we originally wanted the <mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark> they list as an extra. we were told it was a single piece, but if we order the sliders there are 2. ok, we thought, we<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> try it. spoiler alert! it was still a single piece, just sliced in half. this made it too thin, overcooked, and dry. the bread (i tasted it, to be fair) was dry and pretty bland. the garnishes were ok. a single piece of arugula and a bright little cherry gelee of sorts. overall, high hopes dashed.\n\nduck <mark>Crab Spring Rolls</mark> (3.5/5) - generous portion and, i was happily surprised, not too heavy. the wrapper was thin and crispy, although a tad (a smidgeon?) too oily. again, however, it was not heavy. the crisp veggies did well to set off the richness of the duck. the meat was well seasoned and had a great flavor. it was a bit dry in spots. i am going to blame presentation and delivery (heat lamps?) versus cooking as it was mostly at the cut edges of the rolls.\n\nheirloom tomato salad (8/5, yes, seriously) - fresh, fresh tomatoes, creamy, rich burrata cheese that didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> weight it down in any way, and the perfect amount of a tangy, sweet, beautiful 25-year old balsamic vinegar that has had me drooling for the past 12 hours.\n\n<mark>16 Oz Ny Strip</mark> (4/5) - slightly overcooked based on our order. we were a bit surprised as the server said they tend to undercook slightly... still, it was a fantastic cut of meat, very well seasoned, and perfectly tender and flavorful. the sides of sauteed mushrooms (another 8/5) and creamed corn with jalapeno (4/5) were great complements.\n\n<mark>Mary<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> Free Range Roasted Chicken</mark> (4/5) - a tad on the dry side in places, the overall dish was fabulous. i love that they left the skin on; i don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> eat the skin, but it imparted a rich flavor to the meat and left those portions really juicy and tender. the truffled mac n<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> (4/5) was really good. almost too much truffle, not enough cheese, and because it was used as the bed for the chicken, it picked up other flavors (meat, greens, sauces) that detracted from it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> own amazing profile.\n\nvanilla bean creme brulee and biegnets (5/5) - the brulee was creamy, perfectly flavored, and delicious. the biegnets were expertly fried, hot and cripsy and dusted with powered sugar without being overly dressed. another de<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> we thought was fantastic, sis<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> dessert came out presented with the words happy birthday in a sweet, dark chocolate!\n\nwines (5/5, nail on the head every time). we started with a pinot gris and a viogner, then with the help of gabriel, the sommelier, chose a fruity, dry-ish oregon pinot noir to go with the meal. we spoke for a moment on trying something new, price points, and flavor profiles (what we liked and what we ordered). given the whole picture, his recommendation was well received and the perfect wine for everything we ate.\n\nthe service was good, though the server could have visited us a little more often. there were a few large parties so we were happy to wait a little here and there, and as other staff were also happy to smile, ask if you needed anything, and be of service, it was not a dark spot at all. \n\nall in all, a solid, enjoyable meal.\n\nwith the restaurant week menu (50.11 each), the 2 wines by the glass and the bottle, plus the additional <mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark>, our total was $300 and change. bonus tip: they are on restaurant.com so another $50 saved!", 
            "the five-star rating i give it isn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> because the wait staff is phenomenal, they aren<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>, but because the food absolutely is. you will wait and wait, you will beg and ask the dishwasher to please dear god bring you your beer, but you will not leave disappointed in the food. \n\nmy boyfriend and i went last night (saturday evening) and the wait was non-existent. we were seated in a beautifully designed dining room at a large table. we waited and waited and waited on our first beer, but we were okay with that because we<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> been at the bar drinking before dinner anyway. the waitress was polite enough and seemingly efficient, but then would wander away waiting on the tables around us while we fantasized about another drink. eventually we got one more.  \n\ni don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> want to harp on the waitstaff, but when you present a beautiful place with an outstanding menu (and wow, the prices) then you expect to be waited on accordingly. no, not here. anyway, onto the real star, the meal!\n\nordered some east coast oysters. the waiter said the oysters from the west coast were smaller and we like our oysters to have something to bite into, so...got the oysters and they were tiny. i don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> want to know what the west coast were like. regardless, these were the <mark><mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark><mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> Best Oysters</mark> i do believe i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> ever had the pleasure of eating. there weren<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> enough, and in my estimation, with the way those tasted, never will be enough. i could have eaten them for days. as rowan jacobsen says <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> some level, it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not about taste or smell at all. because an oyster, like a lover, first captures you by bewitching your mind.<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> are those oysters. get them.\n\nwe then ordered the 18 oz. dry aged bone-<mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark>. wow, wow, wow. wow. it came out cooked a little more rare than we asked (medium rare), and while usually that much red in meat makes me shy away, it was hardly relevant with this steak. it melted in my mouth. every taste was better than the one before. i have never, ever eaten a steak that tasted this way. i was considering going full vegetarian, but after this steak there will never be a chance of that. i have eaten at cut, ruth<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> chris, morton<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>, blt, and many, many more. none have ever come close to the steak i had at stripsteak. none. as a bonus, my bf ordered <mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark> to go on top. listen, if you asked me to trade sex for a year for all the <mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark> i could eat from this restaurant, well, let<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> just say i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> miss my bf a lot. it was the best thing that has ever touched my lips and i mean that with everything i have. if you don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> get this you are missing out on the most divine dining experiences you could possibly have. i have to stop talking about it. moving on...\n\ni can<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> skip the sides we had with our fabulous meal. the potato puree trio (lobster, sour cream & onion, horseradish) was, as stated, a puree, and i tend to like my mashed potatoes with a little more body, but these were out of this world. the flavors were subtle and smooth, and really, now i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> never want to eat garlic mashed again. thanks a lot, stripsteak. we also had the truffled mac and cheese. speechless. it was the most divine taste of truffles in any dish i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> ever tried with them. the musky, earthy flavor was just enough. i ate the whole thing (sorry, honey). \n\nokay, the letdown here was the dessert, but you really don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> go for the dessert anyway, right? while i don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> remember what they called it, we had miniature donuts with a couple of dipping sauces. while i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> had this dessert elsewhere and loved it, here it fell flat and really shouldn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> be on a menu as amazing as this. avoid. \n\nmy suggestion is, if you want to round out your experiences with great steak run, don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> walk, here. this place sets the bar for it.",

'</mark> had. i enjoyed the heat though i am not sure if this is the best pairing for simply prepared and seasoned steaks. i also tried the asparagus with yuzu butter. the asparagus was thin and tender and not too bitter. the butter sauce was not too heavy and provided a good citrus element to the asparagus.\\u00a0\n\nfor dessert, i had the beignets with three sauces. the beignets were fairly good. they were light and pillowy though not as airy as the best beignets i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> had at restaurants like village pub and spruce in the bay area as well as what i used to enjoy at the now closed hatfield<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> in los angeles.\\u00a0\n\nthe sauces were not sauces as much as they were mini desserts. there was a very good creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e with rich and thick vanilla custard and a crispy caramelized sugar top. there was also a salted caramel pot de creme that was sweet and salty as well as very thick. the last sauce was a butterscotch pudding. the pudding was creamy and the bitter burn was definitely noticeable.\\u00a0\n\nservice was good--friendly and polite. it is a loud and frenetic restaurant so it is no surprise that the service might have been a little less attentive and personable as some other high-end restaurants i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> tried.\\u00a0\n\nprices are high, but it is las vegas. i think stripsteak is within the same price range as other high-end and celebrity chef backed restaurants in las vegas.\\u00a0\n\nas mentioned, stripsteak is a loud restaurant. it is dark, contemporary and definitely energetic. i did like how while the restaurant was very close to the casino, a lot of the seating was very deep into the restaurant so guests are not bothered by the cigarette smoke that engulfs a lot of las vegas. i did find the chairs, which had low backs, to be slightly too uncomfortable for a long dinner.\\u00a0\n\nstripsteak is a perfectly fine las vegas steakhouse. i think stripsteak really separates itself from other steakhouses i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> been to across the country with its sides. the sides here are more interesting and taste fresher than typical steakhouse fare. \\u00a0the <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> was very good while the <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> was disappointing. if you are a big steak fan, i would recommend carnevino, which delivers thicker and more memorable beef, but stripsteak seems to offer excellent choices from starter to entree to dessert, which is a rarity in las vegas.\n\nlike most casinos on the strip, parking at mandalay bay is free.", 
            "cow done right.\n\nyet another 2.5 years from my previous review.  yet another dozen visits in that time.  stripsteak continues to evolve and prove its dominance as one of vegas<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> steakhouses.\n\nthis is a steakhouse so starting with the steaks.  japanese a5 is back.  although the brand is not specified, one slice into the heavily marbled beef (if ordered simply seared and raw on the inside) showcases its classic, deeply marbled, gentle beefy flavor, and melting sweet fat.  as good as it gets and at $35/oz, well worth it.  tip:  do not order more than 6oz.  the richness will fill you up very fast.\n\nup next, the <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> wagyu.  running a3 - a4 quality, these steaks are tender with a more pronounced beef flavor.  the fat is nowhere near as sweet as the a5 but still plenty good.  opt for the <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> if available.  it has the deepest beef flavor and is by far the most delicious.\n\nan <mark><mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> . Australian Wagyu</mark> offered as a tomahawk is very good.  to be shared (even if the bartender tries to tell you you can eat it by yourself - <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> bigger than stomach - epic fail).  a step down in tenderness but if beefy flavor is what you want, good balance.\n\nfinally the angus beef.  if you love <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> beefy flavors, it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> ahrd to pass on the udsa <mark>10 Oz Prime Flat Iron</mark>.  a true butchers cut.  packs mineral, beefy flavors.  good chew and nicely integrated fat.\n\nall steaks (except the a5) have a very good sear, cooked to temp, with a very even core.\n\nsauces and toppings if you must; <mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark> butter is liquid crack.  talk about richness with the distinct livery flavor of the foie.  pairs beautifully with the bitterness from the wood burning grill.  note:  do not add this to the japanese a5 unless you want a heart attack.\n\nsides are meant to be shared.  do not pass on the truffle mac and cheese, <mark>Baked Potato</mark> with bacon marmalade, or <mark>Roasted Bone Marrow</mark> topped with a matsutake chimichurri (the tiny bits of matsutake add an unmistakable umame finish).\n\nbouncing back to starters, three true standouts, the mina classic foie with roasted pineapple, brioche, coconut milk and macadamia nuts, the braised ox<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> french onion soup, and the steakhouse staple, classic <mark><mark>8 Oz <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> Tartare</mark>.  all taste as good as they read.\n\nservice is practiced and polished.  very knowledgable.  steakhouse friendly.\n\nthe wine program remains strong though somewhat lacking in vintage depth.  many great choices.  vegas resort pricing.\n\nraising the bar once again for the top tier steakhouses in vegas."

            "so either i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> crazy, i had an unusually bad experience, or i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> just eaten at some really good steak houses and this one does not compare to those at all.\n\nhere<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> my story:  made a reservation, got a great seat by the window so we could people watch, table was ready when we got there [good], and then everything went wrong from here.\n\ntook a friend of mine here from san diego, i live close to mandalay bay, & i had a $50 restaurant.com certificate, so it was a logical choice. my only downfall was i took her to panevineo the night before so the dining experiences were extremely different.\n\nthey don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> serve bread to start, but rather french fries. interesting. making <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> fatter, i dig it!  i have never seen this before, i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> rather eat these with my meal then prior, but whatever. fries were great! i mean they weren<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> mcdonald<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> fries but they were dang tasty.\n\nordered 2 cock<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark>, one with a splash of cranberry [that never happened], limes in the cock<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> were actually quite gross. they looked old and discolored they had been cut days prior and when we got brave enough to squeeze them into our drinks like 2 drops of juice came out.\n\nwe ordered a stripsteak, lamb chops, and brussel sprouts [see pix].  lamp chops came out extremely under done since my friend is greek and ordered them well done, her mom likes to over cook lamb and that<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> how she<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> used to eating it.  she put some brussel sprouts on her plate and then we proceeded to hunt for our waitress so we could get the problem rectified.  friend starts  eating the side dish on her plate, flag down a bus boy, who tells another waiter, waiter comes and removes her plate from in front of her--doesn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> even offer to get her a side plate so she can continue to nibble, but says they<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> bring out more sprouts. \n\nnow she has no food, no bread, so she<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> staring at me. naturally, i offer some of my meal to her she starts eating some of my steak [fine].  about 10 mins later lamb comes back ready to be eaten.....no sprouts???? about 10 mins after that round 2 of sprouts appear.  ok so their preparation is interesting on this as well, they shave the sprouts so they remind you of cole slaw????  add bacon and then drowned them in butter. like there is a pool of butter on the bottom of the dish. not my favorite. my strip steak was ok, but it needed chimichurri.  there wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> really a selection <mark>Trio of Sauces</mark> you could put on your steak much like you would see at stk or other fine places in this city.  menu was rather limited and lacked depth to me.\n\nno apologies for food, etc [fine] .  bill finally comes, we<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> been here now for like an hour and a half, give them the restaurant.com certificate, and now the waitress has to find the manager to take it off.  another 10 mins goes by, finally get the bill back, and thankfully we checked b/c they took the certificate off but then added 18% gratuity. ok. our waitress was not worth 18%, i can guarantee you that, but fine.   what i didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> like was that she didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> mention that the tip was on there, which i hate.  she was sat with a 10 to 15 top in the back, and 3 tables of 4.  then another table sat down of 6 men. they got the menu, waited a bit, no-one came to help them, they got up and left--and i don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> blame them.\n\nso that was my story and my morale is: pick another steakhouse :) there<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> some really good ones in town.",

(we had already kobe beef burgers before and we always feel its stupid and waist of good beef as you cant tell the difference....you can use regular beef and add 30% fat and will get the same result and fraction of the price)\n3 beers later and a bill over $100 was somewhat pricey affair\nbut food was good and vibe was right",

            "the skinny: a step up on the regular steakhouse, this place delivers some good eats with finesse and occasional missteps - don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> order the duck fat fries because it comes as a sizable amuse bouche (4) service: our waiter/servers were great but there are major issues with the hostess stand (3) value: considering the plethora of deals on restaurant.com, this place can be a good value if you order right (4).\n\nmy hubby was hankering to take me here for a while and we finally got a chance to try the menu at stripsteak.\n\nafter passing by multiple restaurants with hostesses soliciting our business, we were taken aback by the inefficient hostess. by our seating time, there was least 3-4  group of guests gathered around the hostess desk. she basically ignored the diners and the wait staff  who lined to find out how to seat us. \n\nshe also didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> tell us about ongoing promotions at the restaurant: ie, the 3-course prix fixe menu for $55, or that they are currently having a half-priced happy hour lounge menu from 4-7pm. plus, they don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> offer  you their prix fixe menu unless you specifically ask for it... even when you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> seated at the table. for this reason, despite the stellar service at our table, the service gets 3 stars.\n\nmichael mina is known for preparing a dish in three different ways. so obviously our amuse bouche consisted of bay-seasoned, garlic herb, truffled duck fat fries served with accompanying truffle aioli, ketchup and mustard/bay-seasoned sauce. the fries had a lovely crispness that re<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> its texture even when it cooled off. the sauces were lovely especially the truffle aioli. i considered drinking the remaining dregs of it on the bottom but decided i still needed to save my appetite for food we<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> ordered. \n\nthe soups were solid but nothing special. the vidalia onion soup accentuated the sweetness of onion but the croutons really lack that nice crunch. the seafood chowder was  good - the broth was a little on the milder side which allowed for the diner to get the full flavour of the crab when eaten.\n\nthe <mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark> sliders had the right flavour however the bun was definitely overly large considering the serving of foie on the inside. the plating would have been infinitely improved with having the bun on the side.\n\nby far the standout was our bone-in rib-eye. it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> rare to see me shovel down an entire steak the size of a catcher<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> mitt all on my own but there was not a scrap of meat left on that plate. yes, it is that good. the carmelized crust on the meat was so wonderful, the inside so tender and well-seasoned ... it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> hard to find steak that well-prepared. \n\nit was lovely that they provided a small tasting of three sides along with the rib-eye. the peas were okay - a little on the mealier side of things. the truffled mac <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> cheese is always great - perfect consistency, texture and flavour. unfortunately, the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> had a rather bitter unpleasant undertone.\n\nthe hubby<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> grilled chicken (they don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> fry a serving of chicken unless two people order) was a very large portion. <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> grilled chicken - a lovely crispy skin, tender and moist on the inside - on top of their wonderful mac <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> cheese. who wouldn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> like this?\n\nwe topped off our very filling meal with a root beer float and warm chocolate chip cookies. we loved the fact that the ice cream was so cold, it turned our creamy root beer into a nice slush. the chocolate chip cookies were a delight - not too sweet,cool enough to have a mild crust on the outside with melting chocolate on the inside.\n\noverall, we had a wonderful meal for a very reasonable price due to the restaurant.com certificate. we ordered one prix fixe meals ($55 + $10 supplement for the steak) plus two starters (<mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark> $22; onion soup: $17) and one entree (chicken $30). subtract the $50 restaurant.com certificate (we got at bargain basement prices), the meal ended up being $118.97 (including tax and 18% tip) which is reasonable considering the quantity and quality of the cuisine. definitely a solid four star review.", 
            "have i been living like a baller the past couple days or what? \n\nfather in law is staying at mandalay bay for a convention this week, so after watching the tigers game at the sports book, we ventured out to find some grub and a few drinks for catching up. after looking at several menus we decided on strip steak. wife<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> pops is probably the biggest fan of steak in the world. yeah, you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> probably met a steak lover before. not like this guy though. \n\nfor starters, the place is right off the restaurant mall-ish area when you are walking from the casino back to wards the shark reef and chapel are. familiar to me since i got married there! it is a little loud and not as intimate as your typical high end steak house, but that is to be expected considering the location and the fact it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> called \"strip\" steak. \n\nvery extensive wine and cock<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> list sure to please anything you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> crave. the dinner menu was impressive as well, featuring a massive selection of steaks from any quality and cut you could imagine. there were also your typical sea food selections and the ala-carte sides you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> grown to love from a nice steak house, <mark>Baked Potato</mark>, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, etc. let us get back to the important part - the steaks. \n\nwe were lucky enough to be sat close enough to see the giant wood fire grill system set up in the kitchen and the meat lockers with giant slabs of meat. now that sounds pretty weird, but it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> cool to see them wheel the grills up and down while your choice cut is being prepared. in theory, they could put a name-tag on your selection and you could watch them cook it. \n\nour table ordered the east coast oysters of which i only had one. it was perfect though. the wedge salad looked impressive, but had a cheap store bought like bleu cheese dressing instead of the crumbled bleu cheese you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> expect on a steak house chop salad. pass. \n\ni selected the bone in rib-eye. it was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing. the steak was well marbled, just the right amount of char, and seasoned the way a steak should be. no fancy sauces tonight. i also had the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> i mentioned above, and it wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> that good. they sprinkled what seemed like bacos (gross) on the top, which were really pointless. also, they spinach was not as creamy as a <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> should be. am i being picky about spinach? i suppose, but for as proud of the menu (think $$$$) as this place was, they better do it all right. \n\noverall it was a great meal. i had a few cock<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> from the bar, and my two counterparts enjoyed some wine. the cock<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> are served with one giant ice cube which is an interesting touch, as it did not water  down my drink as fast as a normal ice having drink would have. \n\ni saved the best for last. when your server hands you your menus, there is a snack of three types of fries served at the table, with three dipping sauces. one set of fries is fried in duck fat. absolutely not gross. paired with the truffle dipping sauce, they were probably the best fries i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> ever had in the history of me eating fries. they were so good i almost ordered a hamburger at a steak house, just so i could have the side of fries it would have come with. \n\n4 stars out of 5 for the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> thingy and the less than impressive wedge salad. \n\nnote: if you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> an out of town-er looking for a pregame meal before your main event of a drink filled excellent adventure on the strip, you could do much worse, and i can<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> imagine you could do a ton better. great service, nice bar, and even with a convention in the same building were able to seat us without a reservation.",

(it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> fairly easy to tell the difference between the two types of restaurants, just watch for the rich old guys wheeling their oxygen tanks towards the former.)\n\ni went for the lamb, my colleagues for the strip steaks.  entrees check in around $50-ish.  all were expertly prepared.  for sides, we shared the <mark>Spinach Souffl</mark> (excellent, imaginative), the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> with bacon (good, but a bit ordinary), and a <mark>Baked Potato</mark> (not much you can do to sex that up).\n\nif you want a good, large hunk of cow before you go out to hit the bars, stripsteak will get you in that mood.  if you want a quiet, relaxing dinner, the atmosphere may overwhelm.  but the quality of the food matches the prices.", 
            "have i been living like a baller the past couple days or what? \n\nfather in law is staying at mandalay bay for a convention this week, so after watching the tigers game at the sports book, we ventured out to find some grub and a few drinks for catching up. after looking at several menus we decided on strip steak. wife<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> pops is probably the biggest fan of steak in the world. yeah, you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> probably met a steak lover before. not like this guy though. \n\nfor starters, the place is right off the restaurant mall-ish area when you are walking from the casino back to wards the shark reef and chapel are. familiar to me since i got married there! it is a little loud and not as intimate as your typical high end steak house, but that is to be expected considering the location and the fact it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> called \"strip\" steak. \n\nvery extensive wine and cock<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> list sure to please anything you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> crave. the dinner menu was impressive as well, featuring a massive selection of steaks from any quality and cut you could imagine. there were also your typical sea food selections and the ala-carte sides you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> grown to love from a nice steak house, <mark>Baked Potato</mark>, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, etc. let us get back to the important part - the steaks. \n\nwe were lucky enough to be sat close enough to see the giant wood fire grill system set up in the kitchen and the meat lockers with giant slabs of meat. now that sounds pretty weird, but it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> cool to see them wheel the grills up and down while your choice cut is being prepared. in theory, they could put a name-tag on your selection and you could watch them cook it. \n\nour table ordered the east coast oysters of which i only had one. it was perfect though. the wedge salad looked impressive, but had a cheap store bought like bleu cheese dressing instead of the crumbled bleu cheese you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> expect on a steak house chop salad. pass. \n\ni selected the bone in rib-eye. it was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing. the steak was well marbled, just the right amount of char, and seasoned the way a steak should be. no fancy sauces tonight. i also had the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> i mentioned above, and it wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> that good. they sprinkled what seemed like bacos (gross) on the top, which were really pointless. also, they spinach was not as creamy as a <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> should be. am i being picky about spinach? i suppose, but for as proud of the menu (think $$$$) as this place was, they better do it all right. \n\noverall it was a great meal. i had a few cock<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> from the bar, and my two counterparts enjoyed some wine. the cock<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> are served with one giant ice cube which is an interesting touch, as it did not water  down my drink as fast as a normal ice having drink would have. \n\ni saved the best for last. when your server hands you your menus, there is a snack of three types of fries served at the table, with three dipping sauces. one set of fries is fried in duck fat. absolutely not gross. paired with the truffle dipping sauce, they were probably the best fries i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> ever had in the history of me eating fries. they were so good i almost ordered a hamburger at a steak house, just so i could have the side of fries it would have come with. \n\n4 stars out of 5 for the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> thingy and the less than impressive wedge salad. \n\nnote: if you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> an out of town-er looking for a pregame meal before your main event of a drink filled excellent adventure on the strip, you could do much worse, and i can<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> imagine you could do a ton better. great service, nice bar, and even with a convention in the same building were able to seat us without a reservation.", 
            "the strip steak is an amazing place to eat. i had the kansas city strip steak medium rare with a <mark>Baked Potato</mark>. the service was excellent and i would defiantly go back. wish i would have saved room for dessert but maybe next time.", 
            "i had a very good meal here, but nothing blew me away. given the reputation of the chef and the price paid, that is disappointing. my friend and i were seated about 15 minutes after our reservation time. dana white and a group of ufc fighters were dining in the restaurant as well during the time of our visit. in fact i came pretty close to smacking the guy in the crotch when he walked by our table and i was in mid stretch. so yeah, as other have mentioned, the tables are packed pretty close together here. in addition to nearly smacking a guy in the crotch, the closeness of the tables also meant hearing a lot of other people<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> conversations. the nice older woman next to us started to tell some of the most expletive filled stories after a few glasses of wine. i did like that it was a relaxed atmosphere for fine dining. my wrinkle free shirts hadn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> stayed as wrinkle free as i would have liked in my luggage and being sort on time i put on a black t-shirt and tried for the steve jobs look. i thought i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> look out of place, but lots of people were dressed casually. \n\nour server was in a bit of a rush at first. all of his tables were sat at the same time including ours, but later in the night, as things calmed down, he came over and chatted with us for a bit. the guy was right on with all his suggestions. the service was good overall. \n\nfor appetizers we had the <mark><mark>Grilled Maine Lobster</mark> Fritters</mark> and east coast oysters. the fritters were <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> in bacon, fried and served with butter lettuce and creme fraiche. you know anything made with that combination of ingredients is going to be good and it was, but it was just good. i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not usually one to talk about the concept of a dish, but when i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> in a place like stripsteak i am hoping for something unique. this dish didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> strike me as being anything that unique as much as it was a bunch of delicious stuff that got fried. we also received our complimentary fries and while they were all good, the one that really stood out was the truffled one.\n\nmy friend and i both had the bone-<mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> as our entree. hate to say it, but it was slightly overcooked. i kept cutting into it hoping it was just the char from the wood burning grill that made it seem less pink than a medium rare should have been, but my steak was mostly medium until i got very close to the bone. this was a shame since it was a very good cut of meat. my friend had his with <mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark> and it was a great combination. he also had the chipotle scalloped potatoes recommended by our server and they were excellent. i went old school and got a <mark>Baked Potato</mark>. the overcooked steak was probably the biggest disappointment of the night.\n\nwe were both stuffed, but after such a heavy meal i wanted something sweet to end the night. we both went with the beignets. i had the one with chocolate, pudding, and macallan 18. i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> eat anything with macallan 18 in it. it was a decent beignet. a little bit denser than i would have liked, but probably done so because it was intended to be dipped into the pudding. again, a good dessert, but nothing amazing. the best part was probably the macallan. my friend had the same thing but with creme brulee instead of pudding.\n\nso yeah, that was pretty much the story of the night. good food and good service, but nothing we had really wowed me. my friend raves about his steak with <mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark>, but it was his first time having <mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark> so i guess we all remember our first time ;) i think the only item that was really memorable to me was the truffled fries.", 
            "i was really disappointed with my stripsteak experience. i made the 5:30 pm reservation about 2 weeks in advance. i let them know it was my bday. we get there and had to wait about 15 minutes before we got seated (when we got in, over <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> tables were empty...) whatever - thats fine. i got a little happy bday card from them and the waiter was really cool at first. then i let him know we had a restaurant.com certificate and i don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> know but i feel like maybe it went all downhill from there (not sure why they would be upset with this bc they still make the same tip amount if we didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> have the certificate.)\n\nwe got the duckfat fries. they were mediocre. so many people raved about these fries and i just didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> think they were anything special. they actually came out room temperature and seemed over cooked. i would have rather had some bread.\n\nthen we ordered. my boyfriend ordered the gold label kobe ny and i told the waiter that i wanted the kobe <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> and then the waiter convinced me that i wanted the kobe <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>. i said that i wanted something super tender and buttery and he said definitely <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>. we both ordered our steaks \"medium.\" we also got a <mark>Baked Potato</mark> and the bacon <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>. i asked for a wine that went well with my steak and i said i normally drink white sweet wines but i would do a red wine if he could recommend one. he didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> know anything about wine or he was being sort of condescending towards me bc i said that i never really drink red wine. i dunno. i just got a glass of riesling. \n\nthe food came out rather quickly - maybe thats because they barely cooked our steaks!! what the hell - they both came out rare ( we ordered medium.) and this <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> i got - it was super chunky and chewy and bloody - just not what i wanted at all :(  my boyfriends $85 steak was a bloody massacre. the inside was just pure mush- you couldn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> see any grain in the meat at all. my bacon spinach was almost too bacony- i love bacon but the flavor overpowered the spinach. my boyfriend said his potato was good though and the sour cream that was served with it was delicious. \n\nsince i saw peoples<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> desserts from yelp photos, i was waiting for them to bring me an ice cream or something. they didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>, so i just ordered off the dessert menu - i got the dunking donuts- since our meals sucked, i was relying heavily on these donuts to make up for it!! these donuts literally took about 30 minutes to bring out - this took longer than the steaks lol. they wrote happy bday and i got my candle then we ate the donuts and... they were ok but i would have rather had dunkin donuts or krispy kreme!!! when we ordered the donuts, we asked if they had vanilla (instead of the caramel that went with it) and they did. he asked if we wanted to swap it and i said i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> rather have just one caramel and one vanilla scoop. who knew they would charge $5 for the little tiny scoop that was smaller than a teaspoon and that we demolished in one bite. lol. \n\nso then we get the bill - $286.... yeah. thank goodness for the certificate we had then it came out to $236. we didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> even order appetizers!!! they charged $24 just for water. they charged $12 for the little donut things plus the freakin $5 for like the smallest scoop of vanilla ice cream i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> ever had in my life. this place is a rip off. we have no problem paying $300-$500 for a fabulous dinner experience but this one was far from it. there<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> hundreds of better places to eat in vegas.", 
            "my wife and i ate here before seeing the michael jackson one show. we wanted a nice steak dinner that was located in mandalay bay so we wouldn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> have to worry about rushing to the show. all and all it was an ok dinner.  the service was ok, a bit slow and it seemed like we had to find our server every time we wanted a drink. the complimentary trio fries were delicious, like many have said on here. i ordered the <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark>, cooked medium and it was good.  my wife ordered the halibut and she said it was ok.  we shared the mac and cheese, which we enjoyed very much.  the <mark>Baked Potato</mark> was pretty darn tasty.   the <mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> and <mark><mark>Ahi Tuna</mark> & Hamachi Poppers</mark> appetizer were yummy. my wife and i both agree that we enjoyed the sides and appetizer more then the main entrees.  for drinks, we were also given a digital drink menu via ipad, which i thought was a great idea since drink menu<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> change so frequently. i ordered a corona and my wife ordered the cucumber martini, which she absolutely loved.  i would rate this place at about 3.5 stars, but round up to 4 stars. for a $250 meal, we expected better service and food. i probably would not dine there again, since there are so many other places to eat that offer superior service and food.", 
            "i really wanted to like this place but the service is want made me dislike it.  we came here to celebrate our anniversary.  we were seated quickly.  our waiter looked like he was stressed or too occupied in helping us.  we started off with crab cakes which my husband liked.  there was a flavor in the crab cake i did not like.  i ended up ordering japanese <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> satay as my meal.  my husband ordered a steak.  we also ordered  a <mark>Baked Potato</mark> to accompany our meal.  after close to 45 minutes we wondering where our meals were as it seemed everyone around us were getting theirs.  finally after close to a hour, our food comes out.  i took my first bite and my beef satay was ice cold.  my husband<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> steak was cold but the <mark>Baked Potato</mark> was hot?  odd?  we flagged down another waiter as ours just wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> attentive.  the waiter immediately took our meals back and we waited not even 10 minutes when our order came back out.  my satay was piping hot and delicious.  the black pepper soy glaze was just perfect.  my husband<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> steak came out but the <mark>Baked Potato</mark> didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> come out.  while we<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> almost done with our meal our <mark>Baked Potato</mark> comes out.  seriously???  we ended up returning the <mark>Baked Potato</mark>.  we ended our meal with the beignets which were really good.  we would have enjoyed our experience here if our service was better.", 
            "like everyone else says, the duck fat fries were amazing. one of the sauces is ketchup-garlic like, another tastes like zingy sour cream and yummy goodness, and the third tasted like what the inside of a nail salon smells like. not the polish, but everything else, and it was probably my favorite because it was so good!\n\ni started with the prosciutto tart and while it was crumbly, it was light but still wowed me. to be honest, i was full by the end of having <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> the tart. those fries were seriously delicious! why can<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> i buy those sauces anywhere?!\n\ni ordered the <mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark> medium rare and it was easy to cut and easy to love. it had a cheesy taste to it and was delicious.\n\ni tried two sides - the <mark>Spinach Souffl</mark>\\u00e9 and the <mark>Baked Potato</mark>. the <mark>Baked Potato</mark> was like any kind of <mark>Baked Potato</mark> i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> ever had. it was so smooth, but still a potato, with all kinds of flavors. the souffl\\u00e9 had parmesan sauce over it and it was very yummy. i personally liked the <mark>Baked Potato</mark> more than the souffl\\u00e9.\n\nthe only downside was that we also ordered the mac n<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> but never received it. it wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> on the bill either so i guess it was just not so great communication. other than that, our server was nice but looked like a bartender. however, the staff was excellent and my water was never to the bottom of the glass. i guess you can say that they kept me optimistic! i enjoyed the servers helping each other out in what appeared to be a team. i usually see people goofing off and talking too much in restaurants but this was really perfect.\n\nmy tastebuds were in shock by all the flavors. i can<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> wait to come here again in the future. their bathroom sink was cool!", 
            "we go to a local hotel for christmas every year. the night consists of a dinner and a show in that hotel. this year it was the hotel at mandalay bay. the restaurant unfortunately was stripsteak. the restaurant itself is nice and seated us immediately upon arrival. the server was quick and responsive. the problems began whenwe ordered. there were a number of items including <mark>Baked Potato</mark> that were not available this evening. this had to be a major faux pas on the part of the order department but totally affected our view of the place. they must have used up all their potatoes making french fries because that was what they bring in lieu of bread. their special this evening was prime <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> with a horseradish mix. this my wife ordered the special and it was way below par perhaps being the worst prime <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> has ever had. nothing to do with the mix, the food was bland and hard to eat. the steak i had was good though. we had <mark>Brussels Sprouts</mark>, which were sliced and blended with bacon, which was tasty. the potato scarcity coupled with the tasteless prime <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> that we would not be back to this restaurant. a steakhouse with out <mark>Baked Potato</mark> is just not right. i say dressy in how one should show up but that usually does not happen anymore. some of our fellow diners were dressed up while others were in sandals and shorts. the short of it is this is a restaurant in a resort and really does not have to live up to any expectations. the management definitely is aware of this fact. sad because we had higher expectations going in.",

(it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> fairly easy to tell the difference between the two types of restaurants, just watch for the rich old guys wheeling their oxygen tanks towards the former.)\n\ni went for the lamb, my colleagues for the strip steaks.  entrees check in around $50-ish.  all were expertly prepared.  for sides, we shared the <mark>Spinach Souffl</mark> (excellent, imaginative), the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> with bacon (good, but a bit ordinary), and a <mark>Baked Potato</mark> (not much you can do to sex that up).\n\nif you want a good, large hunk of cow before you go out to hit the bars, stripsteak will get you in that mood.  if you want a quiet, relaxing dinner, the atmosphere may overwhelm.  but the quality of the food matches the prices.",

            "went there twice on my last trip to vegas - i just had to try it one more time! the service here was very friendly and knows their de<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> on everything - but the best part by far was the food! \n\nfirst night i was not very hungry so just had a nice pour of wine and a couple appetizers, which were quite tasty (shabu shabu and hamachi sashimi) but everyone else at the table was raving about their entrees. \n\nso i went back with my team the next day and had the kobe <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> steak, perfectly crispy outside and rare inside and it was bar none the finest, richest little cut of meat i can recall!  top that off with the <mark>Spinach Souffl</mark> (so fresh and what an interesting texture!) and the mashed <mark>Brussels Sprouts</mark> with a nice buttery/peppery twang. they brought out some duck fries just for fun and they were great especially with the truffle dip. \n\nfine dining in a nice, modern and casual atmosphere, we loved it! i have to visit vegas quite often, so i will try to stop here once a trip most likely.", 
            "i came back again recently and had a much better experience this time around. i ordered the 10oz <mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark> ($55) and my lady ordered the 18oz <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> ($58). due to my last experience, we ordered both rare. both cuts were satisfactory - not really overcharred and cooked just right on the inside.\n\nwe also ordered the duck <mark>Crab Spring Rolls</mark> ($19), the <mark>Spinach Souffl</mark> ($12), and the potato puree ($12?). the <mark>Crab Spring Rolls</mark> were ok, but probably not worth it, the souffle wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> great (<mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> is better than this souffle), and the potato puree was surprisingly good. the portion of the puree that was <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> was particularly delicious... i would definitely order this side dish again.",

            "i recently realized that i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> had excellent experiences at every michael mina restaurant i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> been to.  seablue, nobhill, <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> etc.  they<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> all at least 4 stars and sometimes more.  this past trip to stripsteak was 4.5 stars.  \n\ni have been here at least 5 times and i always bring a $50 restaurant.com coupon.  this isn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> a top 3 steakhouse in vegas but $50 off from $100 makes it a terrific value for a really solid steak.  \n\nwe<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> recently been ordering the $72 porterhouse which is a monster cut that can easily be split 2 ways and even 3 if you get an appetizer or an extra side.  they<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> bring it out to you in a pan already carved up if you want a la peter luger style and that<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> what we do.  i also love all the meaty goodness on the bone itself.  to me, kobe beef is basically that really tender, juicy part by the bone all blown up into a regular sized piece of steak.  my wife loves the filet so i eat the majority of the sirloin side which is just fine with me.  we like it rare.\n\nthe sides are $14 each so 2 of those gets me to a $100 exact.  the <mark>Spinach Souffl</mark> is the absolute must freakin have side dish.  i don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> think there<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> any other restaurant doing the souffle quite like this.  the server brings it to the table piping hot, punctures the top of it and pours cream into it.  one of my favorite sides ever.  i am over <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>!  we<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> through!\n\nwe went with the mushrooms cooked in bacon for our second side since we already loaded up on starch from those awesome complimentary fries they bring to the table.  forget bread, forget appetizers, you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> got french fries!  i never make it to dessert anyways.        \n\nbut the kicker this evening was when it came to box the steak.  we had asked the server to box up the 2 leftover pieces along with the bone itself.  the general manager was assisting the servers and busing tables.  she accidentally threw out the leftovers not hearing the server ask her to box it up.  i didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> make that big of a beef (ha) about it but she proposed the chef to cook us another whole porterhouse and box it up for us!  i was stunned.  talk about going above and beyond!  who are we to say no to another $72 steak?  wow.  this was an all around great experience and i look forward to the next time.", 
            "do not want\n\ni can get an idea for what this place emphasizes and it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not service.\n\nlet me list our problems with our visit to this establishment:\n\n1) eternal waiting: our server took his time to make it to our table. the staff took their time delivering bread and drinks to us. \n\nonce we ordered, it was at least 45 minutes, possibly longer, before our entrees were delivered to us. we discovered somehow that the kitchen chose to first serve a large group that arrived later than we did. no apologies, no visits from the manager, no \"make ups.\"\n\n2) dishonesty: while waiting outside we had noticed the prix-fixe menu stated the <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> was a 12-oz, while the <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> a-la carte was 18-oz. that was reasonable for the price (which was roughly comparable); some in our party chose the a-la carte and others chose prix-fixe.\n\nwhen the entrees finally came, to our surprise there were no differences in the size of our steaks. when we inquired of the waiter he stated that the steaks were the same size regardless of prix-fixe or a-la carte. when we then pointed out that if we had known, all of us would have ordered the prix-fixe, he did not respond.\n\n3) food: the best part of the meal, honestly, was the fries. the <mark>Spinach Souffl</mark> is nasty. and having been to mastro<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>, ruths chris, lawry<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>, and flemings, the steak is overpriced for its quality. \n\neasy to say we aren<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> coming back and i hope this review drives foot traffic elsewhere.", 
            "like everyone else says, the duck fat fries were amazing. one of the sauces is ketchup-garlic like, another tastes like zingy sour cream and yummy goodness, and the third tasted like what the inside of a nail salon smells like. not the polish, but everything else, and it was probably my favorite because it was so good!\n\ni started with the prosciutto tart and while it was crumbly, it was light but still wowed me. to be honest, i was full by the end of having <mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> the tart. those fries were seriously delicious! why can<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> i buy those sauces anywhere?!\n\ni ordered the <mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark> medium rare and it was easy to cut and easy to love. it had a cheesy taste to it and was delicious.\n\ni tried two sides - the <mark>Spinach Souffl</mark>\\u00e9 and the <mark>Baked Potato</mark>. the <mark>Baked Potato</mark> was like any kind of <mark>Baked Potato</mark> i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> ever had. it was so smooth, but still a potato, with all kinds of flavors. the souffl\\u00e9 had parmesan sauce over it and it was very yummy. i personally liked the <mark>Baked Potato</mark> more than the souffl\\u00e9.\n\nthe only downside was that we also ordered the mac n<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> but never received it. it wasn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> on the bill either so i guess it was just not so great communication. other than that, our server was nice but looked like a bartender. however, the staff was excellent and my water was never to the bottom of the glass. i guess you can say that they kept me optimistic! i enjoyed the servers helping each other out in what appeared to be a team. i usually see people goofing off and talking too much in restaurants but this was really perfect.\n\nmy tastebuds were in shock by all the flavors. i can<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> wait to come here again in the future. their bathroom sink was cool!",

            "pretty cool place. a bunch of stuff was closed at 430 when we ventured here. they have a happy hour menu, consisting of hummus, sliders, salmon poppers, spinach and artichoke brioche and salt and pepper fries. we got 1 of everything.  hummus was fantastic. very very tasty. i didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> eat the sliders, but my friend enjoyed. salmi poppers were......weird. it was raw-i<mark>Scotti Sh Salmon</mark> on top of <mark>Spicy Fried Rice</mark> cake with roe on top. i didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> really care for them too much. they weren<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> bad but wouldn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> order again. the spinach and artichoke was tasty but very very pricey. the salt and pepper fries were way way too salty. all food items about are $7. they give 2 tiny brioche tarts with the spinach dip. 4 would have been better. or at least 3. so, i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> definitely go back and get 2 hummus'. it was definitely my favorite. they have $6 margaritas and monitors. also, some beer and wine is on the happy hour menu. our bartender chris was great. friendly, quick to get our drinks, made them awesome and everything people ordered, he knew. true professional. really enjoyed myself and will most likely return!!!!!", 
            "***stripsteak is a typical michael mina restaurant that provides safe and consistently good cuisine, which is a plus in las vegas given the mediocre and overpriced food that you will often find here (even at acclaimed restaurants)***\n\nthere is definitely a comforting consistency with michael mina restaurants regardless of the location. you are likely to have at least a satisfying dinner at a michael mina restaurant because his cuisine focuses on quality ingredients and tried and true flavor combinations. michael mina restaurants though do not veer much from his style so i am rarely surprised by his food.\\u00a0\n\nmichael mina in san francisco is his best restaurant; that restaurant definitely has a few real high points though its food would not compete with san francisco<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> best high-end cuisine. i remember finding michael mina in las vegas being good but nothing memorable. their menu has changed quite a bit over the years and seasonality seems to be playing a larger role so maybe i need to give them another shot.\\u00a0\n\nstripsteak in mandalay bay is a michael mina steakhouse. it has all the trademarks of a michael mina restaurant with asian influences throughout the menu and a variety of high quality beef available to order.\\u00a0like michael mina<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> arcadia in san jose, stripsteak starts you off with a complimentary trio of fries and sauces. fries with different seasonings like truffle oil as well as different sauces like curry ketchup and mustard aioli. the fries were hot, crispy and definitely addictive.\\u00a0\n\ni tried two of their beef cuts. the best was the <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>. this beef was very rich, juicy and tender. it did not match the best <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> had, which was at splendido in toronto. that canadian restaurant not only delivered an exceptionally rich and juicy meat but also an incredible bark that was crispy and smoky. still, this was the kind of beef course many would love because it was as flavorful as it was juicy and tender.\\u00a0\n\nthe other steak was disappointing. it was a prime bone-<mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark>. the steak was too thin so there was not that great contrast between a nice sear and a thick and juicy center. while it was by no means a bad steak, it would definitely not be in the same category of excellent thick <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> you can get at a high-end steakhouse like mastro<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>.\\u00a0the steak was garnished with complimentary <mark>Roasted Bone Marrow</mark>. i also added <mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark>, which was fine but too pricey.\n\nfor sides, i had the pork belly <mark>Spicy Fried Rice</mark> that was mixed with carrots and peas. the <mark>Spicy Fried Rice</mark> was quite spicy, which definitely differentiated it from a lot of <mark>Spicy Fried Rice</mark> dishes i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> had. i enjoyed the heat though i am not sure if this is the best pairing for simply prepared and seasoned steaks. i also tried the asparagus with yuzu butter. the asparagus was thin and tender and not too bitter. the butter sauce was not too heavy and provided a good citrus element to the asparagus.\\u00a0\n\nfor dessert, i had the beignets with three sauces. the beignets were fairly good. they were light and pillowy though not as airy as the best beignets i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> had at restaurants like village pub and spruce in the bay area as well as what i used to enjoy at the now closed hatfield<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> in los angeles.\\u00a0\n\nthe sauces were not sauces as much as they were mini desserts. there was a very good creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e with rich and thick vanilla custard and a crispy caramelized sugar top. there was also a salted caramel pot de creme that was sweet and salty as well as very thick. the last sauce was a butterscotch pudding. the pudding was creamy and the bitter burn was definitely noticeable.\\u00a0\n\nservice was good--friendly and polite. it is a loud and frenetic restaurant so it is no surprise that the service might have been a little less attentive and personable as some other high-end restaurants i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> tried.\\u00a0\n\nprices are high, but it is las vegas. i think stripsteak is within the same price range as other high-end and celebrity chef backed restaurants in las vegas.\\u00a0\n\nas mentioned, stripsteak is a loud restaurant. it is dark, contemporary and definitely energetic. i did like how while the restaurant was very close to the casino, a lot of the seating was very deep into the restaurant so guests are not bothered by the cigarette smoke that engulfs a lot of las vegas. i did find the chairs, which had low backs, to be slightly too uncomfortable for a long dinner.\\u00a0\n\nstripsteak is a perfectly fine las vegas steakhouse. i think stripsteak really separates itself from other steakhouses i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> been to across the country with its sides. the sides here are more interesting and taste fresher than typical steakhouse fare. \\u00a0the <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> was very good while the <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> was disappointing. if you are a big steak fan, i would recommend carnevino, which delivers thicker and more memorable beef, but stripsteak seems to offer excellent choices from starter to entree to dessert, which is a rarity in las vegas.\n\nlike most casinos on the strip, parking at mandalay bay is free.", 
            "so good!!!!!! was in vegas for a convention and a buddy of mine wanted to go here. i was a little reluctant because of the price but it was worth it. prime steak, cooked to perfection. the sides were also great. we shared the <mark>Spicy Fried Rice</mark>, brussel sprouts and potatoes. \n\nit<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not the easiest place to find since it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> not in the casino, but once you do it stands out. we made a reservation online but didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> need it. the place was busy but not outrageous. definitely not a place i will go to every time i visit vegas (based only on price), but i will be back for good occasions with the fam and good friends."

            "tried multiple dishes at strip steak. but what can you expect as a pescetarian going into a steak house? i didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> eat the fries because they were fried in duck fat, but you could smell the truffle oil from the truffle fries. \n\ndidn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> eat the <mark>Duck Bolognese</mark> or the \"instant bacon,\" but i could admire them from a culinary standpoint. presentation of everything was wonderful. \n\nthe things i could eat though...\n\nthe beet salad with goat cheese was light and delicious. it needed a little bit more acid, but was still very well seasoned. \n\nthe truffle mac and cheese was absolutely scrumptious. as a side, it could easily feed two people because of how rich it is. \n\nthe trio of potatoe puree is a little odd, but still very flavorful. when given a fork to eat with, it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> a little odd trying to get what are basically thin mashed potatoes into your mouth. \n\n<mark>Glazed Mushrooms</mark> with shishito peppers and mirin reduction provided a nice asian flavor and balance to all the richness of everything else. the peppers are smoky and sweet. \n\ni had the halibut entree which was tender and moist. it was cooked well, but underseasoned. it came with a coconut-red curry and sunchoke puree that didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> do much for the halibut. it needed salt. the curry overpowers the sunchoke so that you don<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> really taste much except a light hint of coconut milk.  \n\nthe aforementioned sides and dessert of bourbon infused custard saved the meal. this dessert looked odd, like a cr\\u00e8me prior to being br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e-d. on top of it was a bourbon gelatin which, although delicious, were jell-o blocks of brown blobs. then there was spun sugar and a whipped cream that i didn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> care for, but the custard tasted so delicious, i finished the whole thing. \n\noverall: nice atmosphere, good food, good service, my boyfriend says it was the best steak of his life, and i had a good time. there was a little wait in between the salad and the main courses, but nothing a good scotch can<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> take up. there<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> only one bathroom for men and ladies though so try not to get caught up in a queue.", 
            "this place is an absolute must!!!!  skip the fries.  yes they are delicious, but the food is so rich that i found it difficult to finish my plate.  i had the waygu <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>. absolutely amazing!!!!  the <mark>Glazed Mushrooms</mark> are a must as is the <mark>Potato Gratin</mark>.  the sommelier offered many great wine choices too.  i went with the renteria as i only wanted a glass and not a bottle, and it paired excellently with my dish.  for the naysayers of this place you obviously think outback is top shelf meat.  steven was our server and was top notch and very educational.  my only critique is the noise level but it seems that<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> the norm at that end of the row of mandalay bay.",

            "stripsteak is michael mina<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> fourth restaurant in las vegas, and his first steak house. main courses are pretty much what you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> expect of a steak house: lots of steak, and some seafood. beef lovers may choose between angus beef, <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> (what most places call kobe) and, if memory serves, true kobe beef. there are some surprises in the side dishes. i failed to write any down except those i ended up ordering: duck fat fries; <mark>Roasted Bone Marrow</mark> bones.\n\nthe feel is modern, with lots of glass and steel. an industrial ceiling is high above, below which is a checkerboard latticework of what looks like s<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> steel. the floor is speckled black, white, and gray granite tile. in the bar area, the bar top is glass with a s<mark>Half Lobster Tai L</mark> steel edge at the back. servers are dressed in black. loud rock music is playing.\n\ni opted for a ridiculously unhealthy meal: angus <mark>10 Oz Filet Mignon</mark>; duck fat fries; <mark>Roasted Bone Marrow</mark> bones. the filet was firm, a little dry, but with a nice charcoal flavor. it was served with two small roasted peppers and a bulb of roasted garlic. the duck fat fries were very interesting: three small cups of french fries, with three flavors (bbq; truffle; unknown) and three sauces (bbq; mayonnaise; catsup). the fries were crisp, almost crunchy, and tasted great. highly recommended. the <mark>Roasted Bone Marrow</mark> bones were very good, with lots of rich marrow; very good with steak. this is something you either love or hate.\n\nthis isn<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> the best steak house in town, but it<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> an interesting addition - more for the side dishes than the steak. prices are high but not outrageous for food that is good but not stellar. i might come back to see what other side dishes look interesting.",

            "so far the best steak house i have been to in lv. went this past weekend and have already made my reservations for my next trip in 2 weeks. \n\nsince everyone in my group was getting steaks, i decided to mooch off of them and indulge my self in other pleasantries. so i got the west coast kushi oysters - similar to kumamotos - my fav. i also got the <mark>Roasted Bone Marrow</mark> - nothing spectacular - a bit plain actually, just the marrow and some toast. i like it when marrow is spruced up a bit with capers and greens. so i wont be ordering this again from here. i also wanted to get the fois grois but the waiter suggested the pate. it was good, but wish i had gone with my previous choice. the pate - since i was eating it by myself - was a bit too heavy for only one to consume, especially when paired with the rich taste of the marrow - my bad overall, i should have considered it. \n\nmy friend<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> filet was amazing the most beautiful piece of meet you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> ever seen. i will probably be getting that on ym next trip. my boyfriend<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> aged <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> - rare - was succulent . my other friend got his <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> med rare and it wa s bit too dry. we enjoyed a nice syrah - $80, the lesser end of the list, but still lovely. \n\nthe scalloped potatoes were awesome, as was the jalapeno cream corn. the sides there are a must - get as many as your stomach can handle! and you may not think you have room for desert but share the coconut passion fruit sorbet plate with your table - you<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> be glad you did. the tangy fruitiness is an excellent way to end the heaviness of the meal - along with a double espresso, of course, to kick you out of the coma.",

            "***stripsteak is a typical michael mina restaurant that provides safe and consistently good cuisine, which is a plus in las vegas given the mediocre and overpriced food that you will often find here (even at acclaimed restaurants)***\n\nthere is definitely a comforting consistency with michael mina restaurants regardless of the location. you are likely to have at least a satisfying dinner at a michael mina restaurant because his cuisine focuses on quality ingredients and tried and true flavor combinations. michael mina restaurants though do not veer much from his style so i am rarely surprised by his food.\\u00a0\n\nmichael mina in san francisco is his best restaurant; that restaurant definitely has a few real high points though its food would not compete with san francisco<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> best high-end cuisine. i remember finding michael mina in las vegas being good but nothing memorable. their menu has changed quite a bit over the years and seasonality seems to be playing a larger role so maybe i need to give them another shot.\\u00a0\n\nstripsteak in mandalay bay is a michael mina steakhouse. it has all the trademarks of a michael mina restaurant with asian influences throughout the menu and a variety of high quality beef available to order.\\u00a0like michael mina<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> arcadia in san jose, stripsteak starts you off with a complimentary trio of fries and sauces. fries with different seasonings like truffle oil as well as different sauces like curry ketchup and mustard aioli. the fries were hot, crispy and definitely addictive.\\u00a0\n\ni tried two of their beef cuts. the best was the <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>. this beef was very rich, juicy and tender. it did not match the best <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> had, which was at splendido in toronto. that canadian restaurant not only delivered an exceptionally rich and juicy meat but also an incredible bark that was crispy and smoky. still, this was the kind of beef course many would love because it was as flavorful as it was juicy and tender.\\u00a0\n\nthe other steak was disappointing. it was a prime bone-<mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark>. the steak was too thin so there was not that great contrast between a nice sear and a thick and juicy center. while it was by no means a bad steak, it would definitely not be in the same category of excellent thick <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> you can get at a high-end steakhouse like mastro<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark>.\\u00a0the steak was garnished with complimentary <mark>Roasted Bone Marrow</mark>. i also added <mark>Grilled Foie Gras</mark>, which was fine but too pricey.\n\nfor sides, i had the pork belly <mark>Spicy Fried Rice</mark> that was mixed with carrots and peas. the <mark>Spicy Fried Rice</mark> was quite spicy, which definitely differentiated it from a lot of <mark>Spicy Fried Rice</mark> dishes i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> had. i enjoyed the heat though i am not sure if this is the best pairing for simply prepared and seasoned steaks. i also tried the asparagus with yuzu butter. the asparagus was thin and tender and not too bitter. the butter sauce was not too heavy and provided a good citrus element to the asparagus.\\u00a0\n\nfor dessert, i had the beignets with three sauces. the beignets were fairly good. they were light and pillowy though not as airy as the best beignets i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> had at restaurants like village pub and spruce in the bay area as well as what i used to enjoy at the now closed hatfield<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> in los angeles.\\u00a0\n\nthe sauces were not sauces as much as they were mini desserts. there was a very good creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e with rich and thick vanilla custard and a crispy caramelized sugar top. there was also a salted caramel pot de creme that was sweet and salty as well as very thick. the last sauce was a butterscotch pudding. the pudding was creamy and the bitter burn was definitely noticeable.\\u00a0\n\nservice was good--friendly and polite. it is a loud and frenetic restaurant so it is no surprise that the service might have been a little less attentive and personable as some other high-end restaurants i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> tried.\\u00a0\n\nprices are high, but it is las vegas. i think stripsteak is within the same price range as other high-end and celebrity chef backed restaurants in las vegas.\\u00a0\n\nas mentioned, stripsteak is a loud restaurant. it is dark, contemporary and definitely energetic. i did like how while the restaurant was very close to the casino, a lot of the seating was very deep into the restaurant so guests are not bothered by the cigarette smoke that engulfs a lot of las vegas. i did find the chairs, which had low backs, to be slightly too uncomfortable for a long dinner.\\u00a0\n\nstripsteak is a perfectly fine las vegas steakhouse. i think stripsteak really separates itself from other steakhouses i<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> been to across the country with its sides. the sides here are more interesting and taste fresher than typical steakhouse fare. \\u00a0the <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> was very good while the <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark> was disappointing. if you are a big steak fan, i would recommend carnevino, which delivers thicker and more memorable beef, but stripsteak seems to offer excellent choices from starter to entree to dessert, which is a rarity in las vegas.\n\nlike most casinos on the strip, parking at mandalay bay is free.", 
            "the food was decent.  the service, however, left a lot to be desired.  \n\ni tried the <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> \"cap\" on the recommendation of the server.  i originally wanted the wagyu <mark>18 Oz Bone in <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark></mark>, but i decided to go with the recommendation instead.  \n\nthe <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> was tender.  i asked to have it prepared rare-plus, but once again, the server recommended that i try the steak medium-rare instead.  i think i would have preferred it rare-plus as the medium-rare was a bit over cooked for my taste.  \n\nthe <mark>Roasted Bone Marrow</mark> was decent.  nothing really to write home about there.  \n\ni came here for a work-related dinner.  i would have probably lowered my rating if i was forced to pay for this meal myself.", 
            "cow done right.\n\nyet another 2.5 years from my previous review.  yet another dozen visits in that time.  stripsteak continues to evolve and prove its dominance as one of vegas<mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> steakhouses.\n\nthis is a steakhouse so starting with the steaks.  japanese a5 is back.  although the brand is not specified, one slice into the heavily marbled beef (if ordered simply seared and raw on the inside) showcases its classic, deeply marbled, gentle beefy flavor, and melting sweet fat.  as good as it gets and at $35/oz, well worth it.  tip:  do not order more than 6oz.  the richness will fill you up very fast.\n\nup next, the <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> wagyu.  running a3 - a4 quality, these steaks are tender with a more pronounced beef flavor.  the fat is nowhere near as sweet as the a5 but still plenty good.  opt for the <mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> if available.  it has the deepest beef flavor and is by far the most delicious.\n\nan <mark><mark>8 Oz Amer Ican Wagyu Rib ' Eye '</mark> .
