            "pros:\na large selection of delicious, authentic vietnamese food. you can order anything from soup, to rice plates, appetizers and their <mark>Vietnamese Iced Coffee (or Hot)</mark> is to die for! i would have to say that this was one of the fanciest pho joints i have ever been to. everyone was in uniform and very nice and helpful. i was in vegas for 4 days and we ate here every morning!\n\ncons:\nwe stayed on the strip so we had to take a cab to get to the place..\n\nfinal answer: go!!!!! pho is the best cure for a vegas hangover!", 
            "phokim long the lines were not. phokim good the food was. phokim amazeballs service. i'm straight talking like a phokim asian yoda, i am.\n\ni had chicken pho and strong <mark>Vietnamese Iced Coffee (or Hot)</mark>. shared <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark> with my girlfriends. everything was fresh, the dining area is huge and comfortable and everyone is super nice. cheap eats since it's a locals place. i would have never ventured into this side of town if it wasn't for the phokim amazing app known as yelp.", 
            "i first heard about this infamous \"pho \" house from my hubby, we laughed about the name, and said only in vegas...\nmy son said, \"this place has a controversial name...\", lol. (we didn't think he'd notice)\n\nnormally, i don't leave the casinos, not even to eat.     = o\n\nbut, we were on our way out, so we stopped here. (we obviously lost and were eating cheap...)   = (\n\ni have to say i didn't know what to expect, vietnamese hooters girls, \"would you like spring roll mister?!?\", while playing sleazy porno music...bada bow bow... (my lame try at cheesy porn music), dimly lit with sticky tables. but i figured, yes, i've gotta see this place for myself. (i'm crajee like that) (korean for crazy)\n\nit is located in an asian strip mall, packed parking lot, so watch out, if you know what i mean...  ; p\n\nthe place is actually pretty decent inside, it has obviously been expanded from it's original layout. looks like your typical chinese family style restaurant. thank goodness there were other kids in the restaurant... there could of been a screeching of disco records as we walked in with our 12 yr old... \n\nas soon as we walked in we were greeted and taken to a table and given menus. i love thai iced tea and thai <mark>Vietnamese Iced Coffee (or Hot)</mark>.... (ask for extra half and half on the side and you can elongate your drink, i always do) the servers are pretty courteous as well as efficient, and the food was decent, the orders did not come out as fast as i would of expected from the given service. this was the only problem. they had  brought my order out wrong and we didn't want to have to wait again for the right dish. so needless to say wasn't too thrilled about that pho kim long wait for the wrong food.  \n\nthat is why they only get 3 stars from me, besides the place better be \"pho king\" amazing to deserve more stars. \nthat's a good name \"pho king\", or \"pho king good\", hmmmn...\n(probably been done....phok)\n\nwe are all so phonny....not. (slapping my own face)\n\nthey are open 24 hrs... duh...vegas.", 
            "pho kim long is in vegas chinatown.  it's open 24hrs!  it's in the strip mall called \"the center at spring mtn\".\n\nlines can be long here.  i went when it wasn't busy on wed 12/28/10.\n\ngot:\n<mark>Vietnamese Iced Coffee (or Hot)</mark> - it's made for u then brought in a styrofoam cup - taste ok.\nseafood rice <mark>Spicy <mark>Special Combination Tender Beef <mark><mark>Rare Steak & Brisket <mark>Rare Steak & Well-Done Flank <mark>Beef Ball <mark>Chicken <mark>Shrimp <mark>Plain <mark>Seafood <mark>Wonton <mark>Beef Stew <mark>Special Combination Rice Noodle or Egg Noodle</mark></mark></mark></mark> Soup</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> - small bowl, some fish cakes, a few fish balls, taste ok\npho - b. thought it was alright.\non choy - chinese greens we liked it.\n\ncredit cards allowed.  separate bathrooms in the back.", 
            "24 hour vietnamese food. oh yea and its in las vegas. the only reason why it's lacking the final star is because its so far away!\nnestled in the heart of vegas' chinatown - pho kim long (i don't know about them - but pun is intended for me!) this place is always busy. luckily its large enough and they cook fast enough that the wait (if you do have to wait) is never that long. they can churn out everything from pho to bun bo hue - to <mark>Mixed Vegetable <mark>Chicken <mark>Beef <mark>B.B.Q Pork <mark>Shrimp <mark>Yang Chow <mark>House Special <mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>, deep fried quail, to vermicelli bowls to <mark>Vietnamese Crepe</mark>! \n\ni have yet to have anything on the menu that i didn't enjoy. and if you need a pick me up - get the <mark>Vietnamese Iced Coffee (or Hot)</mark>. way better than a quad shot at starbucks :)", 
            "just saying the name brings a smile to my face.\n\neating the food makes me just as happy. \n\nso before the fucking long (see what i did there) road trip home, we wanted something different.  so we decided on a meal off the strip.  heading over to the chinatown area of vegas will give you a whole different vegas experience, especially if you go during the day. if you've never ventured off the strip for any reason, pho kim long would be just as good a reason as let's say a strip club.\n\n\nyou'll get just about the same level of satisfaction.\n\n\nyou want authentic vietnamese food and friendly service at a reasonable price.  pho tai, <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark>, <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark>, strong <mark>Vietnamese Iced Coffee (or Hot)</mark> ... they got it all.\n\n\nyou know you wanna come here just so you can say ... \n\npho kim long", 
            "very clean, pretty, good service and food was good.\n\nthe springs rolls were probably the best i've ever had, the vermicelli was delicious, and my pho was yummy. this place has a lot of chinese dishes as well that looked amazing. the prices are affordable.\n\nmy only gripe is i wished the <mark>Vietnamese Iced Coffee (or Hot)</mark> was brewed in front of me like i've had before. this place is open late!!", 
            "we went for lunch one day and we were extremely happy.  first of all it's bigger than i thought it would be, and it was pretty full.  very busy, people were nice.  we ordered some <mark>Vietnamese Iced Coffee (or Hot)</mark> which always makes me happy.  the menu is huge and has a lot of food that is not vietnamese.  the boy ordered a combination bowl that had rice, <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark>, veggies and sauce and was very delicious.  i ordered the duck <mark>Spicy <mark>Special Combination Tender Beef <mark><mark>Rare Steak & Brisket <mark>Rare Steak & Well-Done Flank <mark>Beef Ball <mark>Chicken <mark>Shrimp <mark>Plain <mark>Seafood <mark>Wonton <mark>Beef Stew <mark>Special Combination Rice Noodle or Egg Noodle</mark></mark></mark></mark> Soup</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> which had a flavorful broth and lots of good stuff in it.  the duck was very good and crispy.  we also ordered a long bean dish with ground pork.  this was my favorite thing by far.  so flavorful, perfectly cooked and i would easily eat only this for a meal, it was so interesting!  definitely awesome.  be back soon!", 
            "well, it's open late... that's why everyone comes here.  if kinh do (a block away) didn't close at 10 p.m., i would've been there.  on a saturday night at 11 p.m. we were quoted a 30 minute wait time but ended up only waiting 10 minutes for a table of four.\n\ni live by little saigon in southern california so if comparing to the pho there, pho kim long's pho and bun dishes are normal/about average.  there wasn't anything that stood out good or bad about them.  i had the vermicelli with grilled pork and <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark>.  my friends had the pho.  \n\ndrinks here are a tad expensive.  i think it was $3.50-$3.75 for <mark>Vietnamese Iced Coffee (or Hot)</mark>, <mark>Soda with fresh Lemonade</mark> with soda, and <mark>Soda with Preserved Lemon</mark> with soda.  \n\nthe service here is good.  numerous servers came to check on/take our order.  if i was craving some late night pho after a night out on the town, i'd come here again.", 
            "this place is solid and unforgettable. \n\nmy fave dishes here are the (very unique) vermicili(esp. the one with <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark> and <mark>Deep Fried Tofu</mark> or sprimp)... it's ingredients are multifaceted, and the sweet and sour sauce on top is the only sweet and sour sauce i've ever enjoyed. the pho with brisket is yummy, but i'd like to try the pho at pho so(which somehow looks better) to compare.\n\n<mark>Drunken Noodles</mark> here are great(any or all meats); so are the <mark>Pan Fried Pot Stickers (8)</mark>.\n\ni dislike: the <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark>(they always taste old and bland); the <mark>Thai Tea</mark> here sucks, so get a... <mark>Vietnamese Iced Coffee (or Hot)</mark> instead. or an avocado smoothie!\n\ncall to make a reservation for a group dinner, or your legs will regret it. prices are reasonable--some dishes are maybe $2ish overpriced in comparison to nyc/sf spots... but who cares when you're a block from the strip.", 
            "overall:\nbeen here twice and of the 1001 pho places in vegas, this one inches higher than the rest, but still isn't perfect.\n\nfood: i typically order pho with brisket, flank and tendon. tendon is hit or miss in most vietnamese places. both times i've been here i've had issue with it, the first time i got one small piece and this last time i got several inedible hard chunks. the broth is quite good though. i also get a <mark>Vietnamese Iced Coffee (or Hot)</mark>. i am used to it coming in the drip brewer at the table and pouring it myself, its kinda fun, but here they brew it in the servers station and deliver it in a styrofoam cup. not a deal breaker, but i like doing it myself.\n\nservice: good. there is usually a wait to get in because of the popularity but there is ample serving staff and i never feel like i'm invisible or ignored. english is a second language for most of the staff so communication barriers exist but can be overcome with patience.\n\natmosphere: nice place, nothing major to note.", 
            "went based on reviews here and the reviews def were right.\nthe place is very good. nicer and more formal than most pho places.  the <mark>Vietnamese Iced Coffee (or Hot)</mark> was good but was shocked they go ahead and do it for you and put it in a to go cup.  kind of killed the usual experience.  \n\nthe salt and pepper calamari was great. the meatball pho was excellent and the broth was light and not oily. lots of selection!!  look at the whole menu before you order.  no tripe though ... which i was very shocked by,", 
            "i don't know about you but the last thing i want to do is spend a grip on the strip for some mediocre food. yes, yes, i know it's vegas. i got that part but let me think about this for a sec. if i spend $75.00 on two burgers, two orders of fries, and two sodas at the mirage, i expect my meal to be damn near fantastic. it wasn't though. yet, everything happens for a reason and i think that reason was to find pho kim long.\n\nafter taking a cab ride to a wells fargo location to pull some funds out, the cab driver gave the terrific recommendation of this place and i'm so glad he did. what a way to cure a hangover after a long night of drinking!!! this place is amaze-ballzzzz. just to put things in perspective, i spent $40 for two people (tip included) on:\n\n2 bowls of pho\n2 fresh coconut waters served in the actual coconut\n2 <mark>Vietnamese Iced Coffee (or Hot)</mark>\n1 order of <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark>\n\ni was mad full afterwards and fully rehydrated afterwards.\n\nluckily, i entered the restaurant right before their lunch rush so waiting for a table took all of two minutes before they said they had a table ready. during my almost week long stay in vegas, i think i visited this place about three times and every time it was always full of people. from what i hear, this is the place to be come 4, 5, 6 in the morning but i don't have time for that nonsense. it was perfect at 10:30/11 a.m. for me. honestly, the cab ride to and from and the entire meal each time was well worth the money.", 
            "what time is it???\n\npho kim long time!!!\n_______\n\nso two ladies be like... \n\nl1: \"what you like do?\"\n\nl2: \"we go pho kim long\"\n\nl1: \"then where do you want to eat?\"\n\nl2: \"heyoooo\"\n_______\n\nthe name of the business could be a joke... or there really could be someone named kim long out there that makes pho... either way, the food is pho reals. i wish there was chili oil in addition to the sriracha sauce. the <mark>Vietnamese Iced Coffee (or Hot)</mark> is super strong.\n\nwhether it is great or just okay in your opinion, it will definitely help a hangover from a crazy night on the strip... and isn't that was really matters?", 
            "i tried this restaurant following my gut instinct and ignoring the yelp rating of 3.5 stars; as it turns out, i should have followed the yelp advice instead.\n\nservice was solid. no complaints there.\n\nbut the food was pedestrian. i eat a lot of pho, and vietnamese food in general, and i left this restaurant feeling full, but not overwhelmed by the food quality. \n\nmy appetizer was <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark>--here, the <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark> are the soft rice paper. the shrimp in my spring roll were over cooked and mealy, and the rice in them was also overcooked and had a pasty consistency.\n\nfor my main course, i had pho tom, which is shrimp pho. i ordered a large bowl...and was somewhat surprised at the size of the bowl that was delivered. it was smaller than what i usually get when i get a large bowl at my go-to spot in md. the broth was flavorful, but the shrimp and noodle quantity was so-so. i will say that the shrimp was cooked well and had a nice, firm texture, unlike those in my spring roll.\n\nas an accompaniment, i ordered a <mark>Vietnamese Iced Coffee (or Hot)</mark>. it was overpoweringly sweet with a strange aftertaste. i drank it all; like looking at a car wreck, i couldn't help but do it. but i didn't quite enjoy it.\n\nwith all the choices that exist in chinatown here in vegas, i probably won't go back to pho kim long."

            "i'm giving it 3 stars because i only like 3 items here (not the other items on the menu), but these 3 items are actually really good and on its own deserve 4 stars.  i only like pho at 3 locations here in vegas and this is one of them.  it's good and the place is cleaner than pho so 1.  i also like their che ba mau because it comes with shaved ice, and they serve it in a plastic to go cup (in case i don't finish it).  their <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark> are pretty good too, but i can make those at home.\n\nupdate:  i changed it to 4 stars because i've missed it so much while i was gone that i ate here twice a week while i was back home for break.  :op",

            "the real deal...it's my \"lotus of siam\" of vietnamese food...(at least here in vegas...)\n\nmy husband, the chef, eats here weekly with the boys from the kitchen and a few chef buddies from around town...they always sit in ben's section - he makes great recommendations when chef is feeling like having more than #11 (pho) and some <mark>Orange Chicken</mark> (hey it's usually 2am so he's entitled to be a creature of habit of sorts...).  since i work more normal hours, i rarely meet him -- but when i can, it's always a treat...\n\nlast night, since i had the day off today, we went -- and it was yummy!  \n\nben was there and in addition to my usual can't miss dish (the salt and pepper calamari -- with jalapeno, green onions and crispy garlic), he suggested the vietnamese salad with chicken -- it was brilliant!  crispy cabbage, crunchy crushed peanuts, fried shallot rings, crispy garlic , tender pulled chicken, cilantro and a miso/ginger dressing that was perfect -- i love salads that are balanced in flavor, texture and acidity... he said they make it with duck, beef, shrimp, calamari, just about every protein they have in house...  \n\nthen he suggested we try the lamb -- i know...lamb at pho?  it was phenomenal -- tender lamb chops with chinese spices, grilled to medium rare...over a cold, crispy romaine salad -- again another great dressing -- not sure about ingredients in this one though...\n\nthen he told us they had venison...but by the time he got back <mark>Stir-fried String Beans <mark>Sauteed Calamari with Spicy XO Sauce</mark></mark> it was 86d, so he ordered the beef for us.  out came a large, smoking hot black river rock -- a plate of sliced beef, with chunks of butter and limes.   he melted the butter on the stone, then put the beef on it and we cooked it to our degree of doneness -- squeeze of lime -- a dip in the sauce, and it was tender and delicious and took seconds.   that rock wasn't going to cool down anytime soon...\n\nlast night, the <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark> weren't that great, and the dumplings were tough -- so i'll avoid them next time.  hey, i can't eat everything...so it's fine with me -- but i'm still looking for vegas' best <mark>Pan Fried Pot Stickers (8)</mark>... \n\nbut for a chef to come, and when he's in the mood, for the experience to be totally different -- that many think is just same ol, same ol --  and for us to be treated like royalty (uh, we're not asian...), is a real treat.  \n\ni've been in a few times by myself for a quick lunch -- and they always remember me.  it's nice because i'm not the kind of regular that i'd love to be...",

            "your service sucks. even by vietnamese standards. your host is absent minded. i had to remind me him 3 times about my party and he still did not write my name on the list. then he seated parties that came after my party. not just a few, a bunch. you suck pho long. your service blows.  you need a new host, or a better one or at least train them to not ignore your customera.  i am generally very lienient on servce at pho joints because you get what you pay for but you service was sensationally abysmal. \n\nnot to mention, your pho is subpar, and the <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark> are itty bitty.  ugh. never again.",

            "lmao! ok, ok. got that outta the way. but yes, the name of this place is hilarious, but the food didn't disappoint.\n\na friend recommended this place for lunch and i was thinking, \"you serious? there are more places to go to in vegas then a pho place\" when we arrived and i saw the sign... pho was the perfect choice. how can you not crave pho after the name puts a smile on your face? :) \n\nso now on to the food. i got the <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark>, which tasted fresh and better than average. then got my combination pho with <mark>Seafood <mark>Wonton <mark>Beef Stew <mark>Special Combination Rice Noodle or Egg Noodle</mark></mark></mark></mark>. the broth tasted really good. just added a little bit of the hoisin and sriracha sauce to give more kick. service was also fast. \n\nanother plus. open 24hrs!",

            "nom, nom... \n\nthis place is a favorite to me and many friends, i really haven't been here many times where i haven't run into someone i know!  \n\nthey have a large menu which makes it hard for me to choose, while others may find this attractive.  food is good, my three favorite options are the spicy eggplant without meat & cilantro, the veggie <mark>Mixed Vegetable <mark>Chicken <mark>Beef <mark>B.B.Q Pork <mark>Shrimp <mark>Yang Chow <mark>House Special <mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> w/out eggs, or the tofu <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark>, and a must have is a fresh young coconut !\n\ni like this place also because the hours are convenient, its close to the strip, and there is ample seating.  \n\nnone of the pho is vegan or veggie based so i haven't tried it but all of my friends say wonderful things,  oh yeah and i live their <mark>Braised Scallops in Hot Chili Sauce</mark> its really tasty.  \n\nthe service:  it has heart, but isn't always the best.  \n\nside note: i once ordered the hot & <mark>Hot & <mark>Catfish or Shrimp (with Head) Sour Soup</mark></mark>, i would strongly advise against it, looked like gelatin and smelled like my dogs food, they were so kind when they saw my reaction they just took it back no questions asked.", 
            "if the food does not make you sick, the customer service will!\n\nthis place is really a 1.5 stars for me, but i'm going to round up for these guys.  the hostess in the front desk was pretty cool, but not the rest of the staff.  sadly that is about the only good thing i can say about this place.  now on to the rest of the review.\n\ni visited this place because i was in the mood for some pho and happen noticed this place while driving by.  dropped in and the first thing was the massive waiting line to be seated.  there were lots of people waiting outside too.  waiting outside on a hot summer day is not fun.  after 30 minutes of waiting, we were finally called and seated.  this is where everything started to go down hill from here.\n\nwe were seated and we knew what we wanted because we were looking over the menu while we were waiting, so we ordered a coconut drink, the regular pho bowl and <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark>.  the server wrote that down on his notepad and just disappeared.  we waited for at least 30 minutes and not one single item we ordered arrive on our table.  we then started to notice people that were seated after us got their order and they were chomping away.  after about 40 minutes of wait time i was wondering how long it takes to make just a simple coconut drink.  are they sending a monkey to climb up a coconut tree to retrieve the coconut or something?\n\nwe finally saw our waiter and asked him to check on our order and he returned back to us to let us know they were out of <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark>, therefore they did not make the pho or the coconut drink.  the thing was, the server said it in a way where it was our fault that we ordered something they ran out of and that's why they couldn't complete our order.  i just don't understand how when they ran out of one item that is no way related to the other items on the order could prevent the entire order to be made.  it's not like it was a combo or something.  i understand if i ordered a #1 at mc donalds and they tell me they ran out of fries, then i would order something else, not make me wait 30 minutes and tell me they are out of fries therefore they can't make the burger.  i really wanted to tell the server to gtfo here cause there is no way you run out of <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark> in a vietnamese pho restaurant.  it's the second most popular dish right after pho.  its like a chinese restaurant running out of rice.  this is a mega catastrophic epic fail.  \n\nthe food finally arrived after putting in our order the second time, but the coconut drink did not.  i was about to take off my shoes and go out back to get the coconut down from the tree myself.  the pho dish was ok to average at best!  after waiting 45 minutes of waiting i have the right to have high expectations.  the size of the bowl was really small.  i wonder if they gave us the kids size bowl by mistake.  i can't believe they charge $8 for this kid size bowl of pho.  i can get a bowl of pho that is twice the size for $5-$6 at home!  the coconut drink finally arrived about halfway into finishing our food.  the drink was meh.  \n\nin the end, the food was average, but the customer service just left a really bitter taste in my mind.  people think it is a good thing that they are open 24 hours.  no guys, that is not a good thing, they are there to fail 24 hrs a day.  would you like to go to a place that fails 8-10 hrs a day or 24 hrs?  i personally would rather go to a place that fails less.", 
            "pho kim long is the place to go after an exhausting weekend at vegas.  nothing satisfies that deep beast of a hunger that's been culminating after the extreme dehydration from 5+ hours of dancing and alcohol than this place.  and i never crave pho.  only after vegas.\n\ni keep it simple by ordering the pho w/ rare steak.  my friend always gets the <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark> which comes with a delicious peanut sauce.  the thai iced tea is also bomb.  this place is our tradition before driving home.  always!",

            "pho kim long deserves a four star rating!!!  it really hits the spot and never fails to fill your cravings because it's open 24hrs.  the convenience and price of the food is truly what makes up for my rating!!  i'd give it a 5, only sometimes the food isn't always consistent and service is just alright (although i don't expect much from a place with such inexpensive food).  \n\nanyway, the food i usually eat is pho tai with the steak on the side.  squeeze in some lime and you're good to go.  i also really like the stir fried beef cubes with seasoned rice.  that dish is always on point.  the grilled <mark>Charbroiled <mark>Roasted Mandarin <mark>Honey & Garlic Pork Chop</mark></mark></mark> is something i used to always get, but i've noticed that this dish is sometimes poorly prepared (undercooked) so i rarely ever get this anymore.  <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark> you can't really go wrong with and the <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark> are pretty yum too.  that is the extent of my menu knowledge, but i have also tried the  <mark>Mongolian Beef</mark>, walnut prawns and some of their vermicelli dishes through my friends.  \n\none thing i always get here is the pineapple shake!! yum!  i've tried their other shakes and noticed them to be a tad bit powdery or artificial tasting.  the pineapple and avocado shakes are the only ones made <mark>Three Flavored Bean With Coconut Milk</mark> and fresh fruit, i think, and that's how i like it!!! i'd def recommend you try it.",

            "oh sweet pho kim long, the memories we've shared. i can't even begin to count the many drunk nights and hungover mornings spent sipping the miracle broth of pho tai, or the awkward dates spent loading it with all of the bean sprouts, lemon juice, and hois<mark>Braised Scallops in Hot Chili Sauce</mark> it can hold to sidetrack myself from the shmuck on the other side of the table.\n\ni love this place. i'm a long time pho-lover and have been to dozens of restaurants serving vietnamese and thai food, but pho kim long is my favorite - and not just because of the daring name ;)\n\nfirst, they're open 24 hours. meaning you can stumble in wasted at 3am on a saturday and they won't blink twice - as long as you don't stir trouble, or enjoy a lovely non-traditional thanksgiving day brunch to avoid family members - which i haven't done but have certainly been tempted to. you can also order for pick up. \n\ni enjoy that the atmosphere feels fitting for a plethora of different occasions. the restaurant is always clean and has the kind of feel to it where you can easily come here to enjoy a nice date, or to end a night of partying in casual attire. or call ahead to pick up food and eat it at home in your pajamas - you know, whatever.\n\nin general i've stuck with my time tested favorite, pho tai - thinly sliced rare beef thrown into a tasty broth and loaded with bean sprouts, noodles, lemon, onions, and what else your heart desires as long as the kitchen has stock. expect to pay $7-8 for a generously portioned bowl. however, the many times i've been here with friends everyone has been satisfied with their non-pho choices. if your stomach can hold it, they also have <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark> to die for and delicious boba smoothies. the quality of food has always been consistent.\n\nthey lose one star because, unlike the quality of their food, their service is inconsistent. i've never received truly terrible service there, and it is certainly light years above many other chinatown joints, but you do get the feeling that some of the young waitstaff is only there because they're being forced by parents who likely share ownership.\n\nif you're in the area and enjoy vietnamese/thai cuisine - check it out. you won't regret it.",

            "i was very impressed with my experience here at \"pho kim long\" \nfirst of all, i have never had pho at such a fine dining style restaurant. most other pho restaurants are really junky and have those aluminum fold-able chairs and tables that you get at big lots. \"pho kim long\" is completely different. this  place is very luxurious and features giant neon lighted fish tanks, marble floors, marble tables, and comfortable chairs. even the chopsticks are all high quality. they got those really really long chopsticks that are made of porcelain.\n\nwhat surprised me the most was how good customer service is here. other pho places usually have rude service. as soon as you walk in, they don't say a word to you and can't give you any recommendations because they don't speak a word of english. but, as soon as you walk into the door at  \"pho kim long\", they treat you like you just walked into the ritz. they provide excellent customer service, and they all speak perfect english so they can give you great recommendations. the staff here are all americans(vietnamese-american) and 2nd generation so it's easier to communicate and ask for things.  but, most of the time you don't have to ask for things because the servers have a sharp eye. whenever they see your drinks running low they rush over and refill it. you don't even have to ask. \n\ni came here with my best friend a few days ago, and i loved the taste of the pho and the <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark>. i had the rare steak pho, and it was better than anything i have ever had anywhere else. the steak here is very high quality and they don't even cook it. they put the raw steak in the bowl and then just put the soup over it. it was the best pho i have ever had. unfortunately, my friend is from europe and he didn't enjoy it on account of him being allergic to everything( why are european people always allergic to everything? lol). well, he couldn't eat the <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark> because he is allergic to shrimp, he couldn't eat the sauce because it was peanut based(peanut allergies), and he couldn't eat the beef dish we ordered because he is allergic to chili seeds. so he had a crappy time, but sucks for him because i had a great time. \nbtw, service was so good that i left a monster tip. i definitely will be back.",

            "i actually wanted to give this place two stars because i really don't care for it, but i realize it's a popular place and there must be good reason for that. it may be that i just don't care much for pho in general, so i'm hard to please when it comes to the subject. \n\nbased on the outrageous line that exists nearly every time i've been there, be it 8pm or 4am, this is a definitely a hot spot in town. fortunately, there were only two of us so we were sat quickly. the hostess seemed annoyed at the amount of ppl waiting for tables and was just wanting to get everyone out of the waiting area, so she barely made eye contact, and a smile was entirely out of the question. \n\nthe server possessed the same quality of indifference toward us. i realize this place is probably quantity-driven versus quality-driven, so i tried not to let the poor service bother me too much. he only came by when it was time to order, and we had to flag him down for a refill on soda. honestly, the \"water-refill guy\" was more attentive than our server. \n\nthe food was mediocre, but again, that could be because i don't have much of an affinity for pho. the broth was pretty bland, so i found myself continuously adding to it throughout the meal. even though i ordered my pho with rare steak, i only had about 3 pieces of meat in my entire bowl. incredibly disappointing. i will say the shrimp and pork <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark> we had as an appetizer were delicious, however. better than the soup, in my opinion. \n\nit took awhile for us to get our credit card slips back after giving them to the server to pay. a tad annoying since we were in a hurry. \n\noverall, i don't plan on returning here anytime soon, but if you are a pho lover who doesn't mind bad service and are just there for the food, this might be the place for you! again, i know it's one of the most popular places in the city, and there must be a reason for that, right?",

            "first off, my sister and her husband love this place.  they rave about it and it's authenticity and that it's open 24 hours.  their rating on it is exactly why i took my girlfriend out to it after a night at a ballet.\n\nit was a saturday night, and we were promptly seated.  i was happy about this, but they sat us at a nearly 8 person round.  kind of odd and peculiar, but we were hungry so the size of the table didn't bother us.  we started with <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark>, a favorite appetizer of hers.  they were good.  hard to mess those up, and i can say they didn't do that.\n\nour waiter became the center of attention during our private conversation.  he didn't say much, just got our order and left.  he essentially threw our drinks and pho down when he served it.  i know it was a busy night, but he just seemed completely disinterested in his job.  several times he came to our table to fill supplies at other tables with customers.  he'd grab five or six spoons from our table, and put them on another table.  he took some chopstix and fill the empty holder on another.  eventually we overheard others also noting his absent charm.  where they found him to be a waiter is beyond me.  he should be retrained on how to do his job, or be demoted to customer.\n\nour pho was eventually served to us and we both began eating.  she ordered the chicken and i ordered the brisket.  as far as flavors went, i didn't notice anything out of the norm.  neither did she.  i finished my pho, and she asked for a to go container.  when she asked for it, the busser sarcastically joked and said it would be $5 and just for that i felt compelled to tip beyond the lack of service.\n\nshe got the container and we left.  she noted that the waiter, seemingly looking for a larger tip he didn't earn, when he picked up the bill flipped us off upon our exit.  very classy for an establishment named after a sexual innuendo.\n\nwhen she went to have the remaining pho at our home, she found a water bug floating and flicking its legs across the pho bouncing its body off of the container's inner foam walls.  to the trash her pho went....as well as their reputation in our household.", 
            "this place definitely belongs amongst the best pho restaurants in the valley. this is pretty obvious by the fact that it was full and had a 30 minute wait for lunch time on a saturday. the service was excellent and the atmosphere was what you'd expect out of a busy restaurant in chinatown. the pho was delicious. we also got <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark> and <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark> to share at the table and they were all very good and fresh. looking forward to returning here in the near future.",

            "i think i will attempt another review \"in progress\" had a good session at wynn after waiting 2 hours for a seat. was driving home and realized i had barely eaten all day. decided to give this place a try on the recommendation of a friend. there was a line at 1 am on sunday! (well technically monday) in line people were raving about the food. the smell was making me insane. so good. i loved the sparse simple decor. the line went fast and they have all my fav vietnamese food on the menu. <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark> with amazing peanut sauce, made me really happy. <mark>Deep Fried Tofu</mark> tasted like deep fried butter, which to me is heaven. and the pho... yes the pho! perfect. i will sleep well tonight. then tomorrow i will thank my friend for the suburb recommendation.", 
            "overall it was good. before going inside there was a line out the door, however seating was immediate. they brought over water and took the order. <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark> came first which were delicious. then the calamari (which i did send back because of the amount of grease pouring out of it). then the vegan ph\\u00f3 was served. it was delicious. i've been here before and it's always a hit with me! absolutely fresh and flavorful. not too salty! great amount of veggies, and plenty of smiling faces. good place for large families although expect a longer than usual wait time for a table! they are always busy", 
            "location is open 24hrs great food and always consistent. no over promising, just being what they are suppose to be. i love the fresh coconuts and the vietnamese <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark>. a+ in my book.", 
            "my co-workers had been trying to get me to go to this place for months but i had always opted to go to the korean bbq place that was in the same little strip mall parking lot that they introduced me to.  i wish i had gone to this place much sooner before we moved away from las vegas!!\n\nthe service was pretty good, just the right amount of checking to make sure we had everything we needed, but not so much that we felt rushed.  \n\ni was a little apprehensive at first but since my co-workers swore by it i decided to get whatever they recommended.  the pho i got was amazing.  i loved adding the bean sprouts and other things they brought to the table for us to it, i especially loved adding the different sauces they  had at the table (mostly <mark>Braised Scallops in Hot Chili Sauce</mark> was what i added since i'm sucker for spiciness). it was very filling and very delicious, i couldn't even finish it all and had to take it home!  the only food i didn't like was the <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark> i think is what they were.  my friends had ordered them before i got to the restaurant so i didn't have a say in it, but seafood is not my thing and these had shrimp in them i believe so that pretty much killed it for me on them. plus the dipping sauce was some kind of peanut based sauce......i've had other peanut based sauces at other places which i've liked, but this one was just too thick for my liking.  \n\notherwise i love this place and will definitely have to make it a priority to go here when i visit friends in las vegas.",

            "2-stars is me being generous. \n\nfood: overpriced, mediocre, nothing special, and not to mention my friend received a piece of a plastic bag in his bowl of pho and i crunched into a shell-like component in my spring roll. \n- pho: we all ordered the combination pho (pho \\u0111ac biet) and it was large, tasty, but lacked a key element that we all enjoy in our combination pho - tripe. apparently they do not sell tripe there (said the waitress). but they did make up for it by giving us generous portions of brisket and additionally included meatballs (bo vien) which i typically do not see in combination pho at other restaurants. the broth was flavorful and not too oily so that was also a plus. but i do believe a bowl of pho for about $9 is on the expensive side. all in all i would give their pho 3.5 stars. \n- <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark>: i will post a picture of their <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark>. they were composed of minimal elements for high-dollar. $5.50 for 2 <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark> is super pricey in my book, especially because these <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark> were far from anything special. <mark>Seafood <mark>Wonton <mark>Beef Stew <mark>Special Combination Rice Noodle or Egg Noodle</mark></mark></mark></mark>, shredded lettuce, pork, and shrimp wrapped in rice paper (so basic!). they didn't even bother to add bean sprouts, mint leaves, or green onion to enhance the flavors. also, their dipping sauce was a little too heavy on the peanut-side (some don't mind it but i prefer an equal balance). never ordering <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark> from them again (unless they actually read this post and start making better <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark> and sauce). \n\nservice: they took the pho (with plastic) and an order of <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark> off our bill which was nice - but is expected when serving non-edible components in your food. when we notified our waitress about the plastic in my fiends bowl of pho, she quickly took it away and had another combination pho delivered to us pronto. the service is what saved this place from getting only 1-star. \n\ndecor: pretty modern but tries to keep an authentic asian feel with the bonsai trees and fish tanks. \n\ni suppose this place had a decent rep because it's open 24-hours and the name is catchy. i wanted to like this place but all-in-all, my experience was not one to bring me back. i can get better pho for cheaper at plenty of other places. maybe if i was in desperate need of pho at a weird time of the night, i might settle for pho kim long... until then, yelpers beware.",

            "you would think that a place like this would be the mecca of late night grubbing in chinatown, but sadly this place really isn't that good. the food quality isn't really the best, and the whole experience was just subpar.\n\nthe people working there, from the hostess to the waiter, were surly and gave attitude when seating us and taking our order. it wasn't really that busy inside because i think everything is a little slower in vegas during this time of the year (people going back home from their vacations, the school year starting, etc.). i feel like at any dining establishment, the staff should at least try and be a little friendly... that's not the case here.\n\nanyway, onto the food. my friend and i ordered their <mark>Crab Rangoons (8)</mark>, shrimp udon dish, and their shrimp <mark>Mixed Vegetable <mark>Chicken <mark>Beef <mark>B.B.Q Pork <mark>Shrimp <mark>Yang Chow <mark>House Special <mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>.\n\nwhen the <mark>Crab Rangoons (8)</mark> came to our table, my initial thought was \"what are those?!\" because they didn't look like the conventional flower-shaped rangoons we are all (mostly) familiar with. they looked like they were made in a rush, but at least they retained the cheesy crab flavored filling. fried to a golden-brown, these are a good appetizer to start off with.\n\nthe shrimp udon dish was basically filler (loads of green onions and bean sprouts) and a few sizeable shrimp. the noodles, which should be the main part of the dish, were lacking. the presentation wasn't too appealing, either. it literally looked like it was stirred and thrown onto the plate to go out to our table...\n\nthe shrimp <mark>Mixed Vegetable <mark>Chicken <mark>Beef <mark>B.B.Q Pork <mark>Shrimp <mark>Yang Chow <mark>House Special <mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> was probably the only thing we really enjoyed out of everything we ordered. the shrimp seemed to be smaller in this dish compared to the shrimp in the udon, and even with the smaller sized shrimp, it was still sparing. the sriracha sauce is the perfect thing to drizzle on top of the <mark>Mixed Vegetable <mark>Chicken <mark>Beef <mark>B.B.Q Pork <mark>Shrimp <mark>Yang Chow <mark>House Special <mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>, i can't get enough of the unique spiciness it offers!\n\nanyway, if we're talking about food quality and presentation, then pho kim long is in the same league as any average asian take-out place... which isn't saying much. pho kim long misses the mark on so many things: friendly staff, decent food, presentation of said food, cleanliness, etc. \n\noverall, i did not have an enjoyable experience. i think that maybe it's alright if you're on the hot mess express at 3 am and want something to eat in the late hours of the night/early morning, but even that is a big maybe for me... save your appetite for something better.", 
            "in need of some good pho? look no further. this place is hands down the best i've tired. i've been to pho annie, jenni pho and this place has the best soup and <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark>! \n\nwe walked in and immediately got seated, at first i wasn't expecting much since all the other pho restaurants i've been to has provided mediocre service to say the least but, then not even two seconds later our water was brought to our table (mind you it was very busy, so i was very impressed.) we ordered some appetizers eggs rolls and <mark>Crab Rangoons (8)</mark>, and the <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark> were brought to our table in the matter of minutes!!! the <mark>Crab Rangoons (8)</mark> were so delicious and tasty along with their sweet and sour sauce that we had to order a second round. then our pho came out and my sisters and i all ordered rare <mark>Beef Stew</mark> pho, so yum. if you don't want pho there is a lot\nof other dishes to pick from. \n\nmust try, you won't regret it.",

            "gonna say it, best pho i've ever had...\n\ni don't know if its cause this place is in vegas and its nice to eat some good (relatively) cheap asian food after cramming your trap with casino buffets, or it also could be cause most of the people here are either drunk or hung over.  but i stand by my statement that this is probably the best pho i've had.\n\ni try to come here at least once every other vegas trip, once me and my buddies came here twice in 1 day, before and after clubbing, its just good.\n\none word of advice, the xl bowl is really that, extra large, i normally finish my bowl or my rice dish and the rest of my gf's bowl, but man, i couldn't finish the xl bowl.\n\nthe broken rice dish here is ok, nothing crazy special, same with the <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark>, the wait is pretty long on sundays in the 11-12 time, i guess its a good hang over food before you head back home.  this place is also open 24 hours so you can come here at 4am and get the goods, its also a nice pick me up after losing a bunch of money on the tables.", 
            "i wouldn't say the best pho i've ever had, but it's good.  they gave me a huge bowl of pho (like a large bowl) and plenty of meat.  it's a little more expensive than what i'm used to paying (like around $5 or $6 for pho), but they make up for it in size.\n\nmy wife's vermicelli dish was just ok.  she had <mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark> in there.  the chicken & <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark> were missing flavor a little bit, but still good overall.\n\nthe service was actually decent.  we got seated right away, someone came  by to take our order relatively fast and they did an ok job with filling up our cups.  i would definitely come back.",

            "i forgot why i hadn't visited in such a long time, but now i remember. everything was so unmemorable. we visited one evening with a friend when our first choice in chinatown had an hour wait. i should have trusted the instinct of not going to your last choice.\n\nwe ordered the salt and pepper calamari to start. the batter was strange and oily, but still pretty tasty with the chopped chilies, garlic, and etc. plus, the dipping sauce was good. ruben ordered the bun thit nuong cha gio (<mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> and <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> with rice vermicelli noodles). the pork was flavorful, but the dish as a whole was not very cohesive and bland. i ordered the <mark>Drunken Noodles</mark> with the vegetarian option. i really like the flat, thick <mark>Seafood <mark>Wonton <mark>Beef Stew <mark>Special Combination Rice Noodle or Egg Noodle</mark></mark></mark></mark> and lots of fresh vegetables, so i was immediately drawn to this dish, however, it lacked in flavor and depth. a bit of sriracha sauce saved it toward the end, but any great dish wouldn't have to rely on a table condiment. our friend, juan, ordered the chicken pad thai and it was okay.\n\nneedless to say, i didn't enjoy the meal very much. the highlight was the calamari and still, that was no where close to being the best calamari dish i've eaten. obviously, i didn't try pho and perhaps that may be something they do really well? i wouldn't count on it since everything else was so disappointing. service was okay, no complaints. anyway, there are so many other spots in town serving up better thai food, vietnamese food, and whatever else they're serving here and just steps away.", 
            "i come here often because this place open late. i love the pho here.\ni like their pho, spring roll, and the <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark>. everything else i tried here was just okay for me. service can be really bad for sometimes. sometimes they forget my order and the waiters there don't talk much when i ask something. the other night when i was there, i didn't get my food for 20min. so i asked the waiter if my food is coming. he didn't say anything about it and left my table. he came back with my food 10min. later. hmm.... may be he could've said \"i will check on your food\" or \"it is coming\"?!! every time i go there, service is just meh...... but i will still go there.",

            "i don't know if it was a fluke but my pho tasted like cinnamon soup. i had the pho dat biet and the combination of the meats were way off. they put mostly flank and steak meat, 2 pieces of the meatballs, and none of the other stuff. there is only one sized bowl, so be prepared to pay around $8 for a pho bowl made for a giant.\n\nwhat really stuck out to me were the <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark>. they were really good. \n\nover all, i liked the setting, food, and the service. would come back to try other things on the menu. pho, however, is a no thank you.", 
            "i should know vietnamese food, i cook it all the time.  the food here is great.  it's authentic and absolutely delicious.  my favorite is the bun thit nuong cha gio.  vermicelli with grilled pork and <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> salad.  they make it just like my mom's.  also, i've tried some chinese foods and it's not bad.  the deep fried salt n pepper squid was nice and tender.  almost like fried mozzarella.  my date had the pho and it tastes like my homemade broth.  for the vietnamese restaurant, this one is pretty good.  it's nothing like the places in little saigon but this is vegas and it's great.", 
            "pho kim long deserves a four star rating!!!  it really hits the spot and never fails to fill your cravings because it's open 24hrs.  the convenience and price of the food is truly what makes up for my rating!!  i'd give it a 5, only sometimes the food isn't always consistent and service is just alright (although i don't expect much from a place with such inexpensive food).  \n\nanyway, the food i usually eat is pho tai with the steak on the side.  squeeze in some lime and you're good to go.  i also really like the stir fried beef cubes with seasoned rice.  that dish is always on point.  the grilled <mark>Charbroiled <mark>Roasted Mandarin <mark>Honey & Garlic Pork Chop</mark></mark></mark> is something i used to always get, but i've noticed that this dish is sometimes poorly prepared (undercooked) so i rarely ever get this anymore.  <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark> you can't really go wrong with and the <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark> are pretty yum too.  that is the extent of my menu knowledge, but i have also tried the  <mark>Mongolian Beef</mark>, walnut prawns and some of their vermicelli dishes through my friends.  \n\none thing i always get here is the pineapple shake!! yum!  i've tried their other shakes and noticed them to be a tad bit powdery or artificial tasting.  the pineapple and avocado shakes are the only ones made <mark>Three Flavored Bean With Coconut Milk</mark> and fresh fruit, i think, and that's how i like it!!! i'd def recommend you try it.", 
            "i really wonder if they named this after kim long or they meant to pho kim long time. either way, out of many many pho restaurants i've tried in atlanta, new york, san diego and san francisco, this one is one of my favorites. only pho i've tried in vegas but they know what they're doing. \n\nyou'll be greeted by a huge sea aquarium the type you see in mtv cribs worth thousands of dollars. this place must be doing good business because the decorations inside are pretty hard core. they have another aquarium with a king fish and black and white nemo's. pretty awesome! \n\nthe staff at this place is excellent at serving the customers. i think everyone that was working at pho kim long (i can't stop laughing at this name) came up to our table (except the cooks). we had a busy table so you know how it is when people like to add picky stuff to their pho... garlic, limes, extra mint, chili paste, nguoc mum, sriracha... etc. \n\ni ordered the bun with <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark> (cho gio) and char-grilled bbq pork. the bowl was a bit smaller than usual but it was very well made. this is a simple dish but the key item is the noodles. sometimes they are too soggy or they can also be too dry and sticky. this place had perfect noodles for the bun. \n\nthe servers gave us some pho broth since it was so cold outside. very nice gesture! everyone had a small bowl of broth which was very good in flavor. however, if this is the pho broth they use for every dish then i would avoid the pho since it was a bit heavy in texture. i thought it should be more watered down. we had an additional order of <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark> which was pretty decent, nothing fantastic but still good. \n\nsomething unique about this place is their variety of asian cuisine. they are obviously mainly vietnamese but you can also find chinese dishes and even pad thai. very unusual in my experience. one of my friends ordered combo #108 which was amazing. it was similar to bo luc lac but with bigger meat pieces and with excellent steamed broccoli. i'm getting #108 next time. \n\nfound my hangover spot a couple of miles off the strip! pho kim long soon!", 
            "i've been going to this place for a quite sometime now and every time, it's always packed... it doesn't matter if it's 2am, there is still decent amount of people.\n\nthey have great food. i've tried their appetizers like <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark> or <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark>, <mark>Mixed Vegetable <mark>Chicken <mark>Beef <mark>B.B.Q Pork <mark>Shrimp <mark>Yang Chow <mark>House Special <mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>, chicken dishes, pad thai, and my personal favorite, their pho. none of them disappointed me ever. i could close my eyes and pick something random on the menu and i guarantee, i'll either love it or at least like it. \n\ni do have problem with their service once in awhile. sometimes, the server didn't have a very good attitude and was very slow running the food or bringing the check. but besides that, the food is great, the place is great, and the name of the place is great. so go on and try, i guarantee that you won't be disappointed.", 
            "we came here after a night of clubbing with a pretty big group of people.  (yes, i believe it's 24-hours). love that we didn't have to wait for a table.  the staff was very patient with our group, considering we were so loud and annoying.  food didn't take too long.  i ordered <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark> and a chicken and rice plate that was shown on the menu. it tasted alright, but i felt like it was such a rip because the pieces of chicken were so small! i was still hungry after, even with my <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark>. besides that, the establishment was clean and like i said, we were pretty annoying so luckily they didn't kick us out.",

            "pho kim long is busy during the day, but if you go in the evenings (especially after 10pm), you'll have no problem getting a seat and your food on time. one of the high points about this place is that it's open 24 hours. i have not yet discovered any other vietnamese restaurant that is open for 24 hours, so this is a great place for those who are looking to have a filling, healthy dinner after your long night shift. \n\ni can understand why the quality of the pho might not be comparable to some other places (the broth is a little different here than others), but the reason why i gave this place 4 stars is because i would [highly] recommend anyone to be adventurous with the menu. it's typical to order <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark>, <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark>, and your pho, but really... there's so much more to the menu than you think, don't be afraid, trust me!\n\nwe ordered rice, the <mark>Deep Fried Flounder (Whole Fish)</mark>, walnut shrimp, and <mark>Three Flavored Bean With Coconut Milk</mark> to go with the meal, and it was quite possibly one of the most flavorful seafood meals i've ever had in a vietnamese restaurant. i'm usually hesitant with seafood when it comes to restaurants that are reasonably priced and are local establishments, but i have to say the seafood here was fresh, flavorful, and filling. \n\nthe dining area is spacious, not tightly packed together, and the ambience of the restaurant is nice and cultural. might i add they also have a little selection of liquors from their drink menu too?", 
            "my friend told me about this place cause he and his friends goes to vegas all the time and they always come to this place. we stayed at the rio this time so this place was literally down the street. decided we wanted to try this place out cause we didn't want to pay $20 for buffet at the casino. this place is pretty good. i ordered a bowl of pho dac biet which was like almost $8 and my hubby ordered the vermicelli with <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark> and <mark>Charbroiled Beef</mark> for around $8. our meal combined was less than $20.\n\nlater that night my friend wanted pho so i came back with her and this time i ordered the vermicelli with <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> and <mark>Charbroiled Beef</mark> and she ordered the pho. it was equally yummy. i like how they have so much choices of pho, rice plates, vermicelli, etc.  \n\na lot of people come here so this place does get packed. next time i'm in vegas, i'll most likely come back here cause their food is so yummy. i like how it's open really late so you can go anytime like after clubbing. pho is a good hangover remedy :)",

            "what an awesome name!\n\nokay, first off... as a teenager, i lived in san jose ca - a city which has a ton of vietnamese gangsters... and since i was always looking to get \"hookups\" on car parts, i ended up meeting and befriending alot of the aforementioned vietnamese gangsters. those guys always used to take me to the best pho spots, so i'm no pho newbie.\n\ni decided to try out pho kim long with one of my boys right before he got married in vegas, because it was quick, inexpensive, and let's face it, the name of the restaurant is awesome! funny as hell!\n\nafter taking some quick myspace pics by the sign outside, we ventured in the restaurant and ordered our food. my homie ordered pho dac biet, and i ordered pho tai, which is my favorite because i love the thin, rare, red slices of steak (tai) that they throw on top of your steaming soup with hot <mark>Seafood <mark>Wonton <mark>Beef Stew <mark>Special Combination Rice Noodle or Egg Noodle</mark></mark></mark></mark>. \n\nas we waited for our food, i did my standard vietnamese restaurant ritual of thoroughly wiping down my chopsticks and little condiment dishes with hot tea and napkins. you can never be too careful, especially since pho kim long is located conveniently next to a platform shoes store for strippers.\n\nthe service was pretty good, i appreciated the fact that the waiter made an extra effort to hold our pho bowls on the outside! =) i've been to pho places before where they grab the bowl with their thumb on top, and the other fingers below the bowl... but i hate that, cause the soup splashes around, and the waiter's thumb often times goes into the soup! aw heyllll no!\n\nthe broth at pho kim long was just \"aiight\" but i guess not bad for las vegas... i dont expect vegas to have top quality pho anyways. let's face it, people go to vegas for buffets, gambling, parties, drinking, lap dances, and drive through weddings. not pho. \n\nso i'm rating pkl (fhl hehe) with 4 stars. cause i think it ain't bad for vegas, and at least the guy's thumb didn't go into my soup. good lookin out homie.", 
            "\"crawfish\" is a new addition to pho kim long, and that's what brought me here in the first place.  they only started offering this shellfish in june, weekends only.\n\nmy luck that the sunday i choose to come in, they weren't offering it. we still sat down for dinner and this is what we got: \n\n* hu tieu hoac mi bo kho (<mark>Beef Stew</mark> <mark>Seafood <mark>Wonton <mark>Beef Stew <mark>Special Combination Rice Noodle or Egg Noodle</mark></mark></mark></mark>) - $7.95: the big f enjoyed his <mark>Spicy <mark>Special Combination Tender Beef <mark><mark>Rare Steak & Brisket <mark>Rare Steak & Well-Done Flank <mark>Beef Ball <mark>Chicken <mark>Shrimp <mark>Plain <mark>Seafood <mark>Wonton <mark>Beef Stew <mark>Special Combination Rice Noodle or Egg Noodle</mark></mark></mark></mark> Soup</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>.  i was too busy with my plate to eat much of his.\n\n* dau dua xao <mark>Stir-fried String Beans <mark>Sauteed Calamari with Spicy XO Sauce</mark></mark> (stir fried <mark>Stir-fried String Beans <mark>Sauteed Calamari with Spicy XO Sauce</mark></mark>) - $9.95: tasty string beans, a bit on the pricey side though.  a nice spice kick as well.\n\n* com ga hai nam (hai nam style chicken with seasoned rice) $8.50: i've always liked hainamese chicken since my friend's mom made it for me, along with the seasoned rice.  it's good here, but definitely not as good as my friend's mom's version.\n\npho kim long ii is a huge restaurant with lots of big tables for large parties.  a great place for families to eat and friends to gather after a late night.  their menu is pretty extensive so there's plenty of choices for everyone.  and portions seem pretty decent-sized too.  (i wish they would get a bigger fish tank though because there are way too many fish in that tiny thing up front!)\n\nfrom this experience, i give it a four stars.\n\ni love hot n juicy crawfish up the road, and i definitely believe in some healthy competition.  so, last friday we decided to finally check out their crawfish and see if it's worthy.\n\nwe decided to start off with two pounds and see where we went for there.     we noticed a neighboring table with their order of crawfish and was definitely excited.  it came in a large bowl with red potatoes, corn on the cob and sausage.  they also brought extra bowls for the shells and a plate for us to eat on.  the big f requested limes, salt and pepper to make a dipping concoction.\n\ni dove right in and noticed the big difference...the crawfish was not fresh.  it was old or way overcooked.  the tail meat didn't come off the shell easily and was broken up.  i thought it was just the first one and continued eating.  unfortunately, this wasn't the case.  there was little to no head juice either, which was very disappointing to me.  the big f was easily disgusted with the crawfish and we were glad that we only ordered two pounds to start.

            "if someone says this is the best place for pho, you must be on drugs. first, the employees are douche bags. they didn't understand a word i said and gave me the wrong type of pho. and the thing that pissed me off the most is that the cashier expects you to know how much your meal was. if you go up and tell them you don't know, they stand there and tell you to calculate it. and in the customer point of view, that is the employee's job. then they just throw out a random number if you don't know what it is. \n\nsecond, the soup to noodle ratio is inefficient. they provide more soup and less noodles. i'd rather pay for more noodles, i mean that's what pho is right, a <mark>Spicy <mark>Special Combination Tender Beef <mark><mark>Rare Steak & Brisket <mark>Rare Steak & Well-Done Flank <mark>Beef Ball <mark>Chicken <mark>Shrimp <mark>Plain <mark>Seafood <mark>Wonton <mark>Beef Stew <mark>Special Combination Rice Noodle or Egg Noodle</mark></mark></mark></mark> Soup</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>. i want to get my money's worth. also, they aren't careful with how they handle their bowls. since their is too much soup, it spills over the edge. and they don't even clean it up for you. i also tried my cousin's boba, and it was garbage.\n\noverall. this was enough to influence my decision that i'm never going here again. the employees need to learn how to do their jobs and learn to have better customer service skills. i do not recommend pho kim long for pho lovers.",

            "i really wish i didn't have to write this review. but if i don't share this experience, i'm not being true to my yelp self or my fellow yelpers out there. every restaurant has a bad night and i have been going to pho kim long since before moving to las vegas. the service is efficient and the food always delivers, whether you are there at 7pm or 4 in the morning. but recently i had an experience that has put me off of my beloved go-to spot possibly forever. \n\nit all started on a busy friday night around 3am. i had a craving for some pho after work. we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table because they were jam packed, slammed, crazy busy. no problem. i get it. not the end of the world. \nhowever, once we were finally sat all the way in the back in a corner, nobody came to take our order. there were servers, bussers and runners all scurrying around us too busy to even take a beverage order. the first 10 or so minutes i can forgive but when i actively am trying to flag someone down and literally every employee refuses to make eye contact, even i start to get frustrated. we became the table that time forgot. \n\n15 minutes...20 minutes go by.\n25 minutes in and we still don't even have a glass of water. we have now been at pho kim long for a total of 40 minutes with nothing to show for it. but i refuse to be that person who makes a scene and leaves, so i wait it out. \ni finally flag down the guy bussing the table next to ours and he brings us some waters and promises to send the server over. she comes over looking rather (understandably) bedraggled and we very politely put in our order after explaining our situation. she offers no apology and acts as if it's not a big deal. so i'm a little peeved at the lack of reaction. but my pho is on the way and my stomach is growling. \nmy beautiful bowl of soup is placed before me and i turn my attention away from the negative experience and grab my chopsticks. and then i see it...gently floating amongst my <mark>Seafood <mark>Wonton <mark>Beef Stew <mark>Special Combination Rice Noodle or Egg Noodle</mark></mark></mark></mark>, swimming in my delicious broth without a care in the world is...a...\ncockroach. \n\ni stand up, push my bowl away and just point in astonishment and horror. my confused dinner companion sees what i am pointing at and flags down the nearest employee who proceeds to whisk the dish away before i have a chance to gather my wits and take a picture. so now we are both standing at the table trying to figure out what to do. nobody comes back over to inquire about us or make amends. so we look at each other, nod and start walking towards the front door. on the way i find our server and take her aside to calmly explain the entire situation and inform her that we are leaving. and i again get a complete non reaction. no apology, no manager. just an ok and a bewildered stare.\n\ni'm done.",

            "craving for pho and saw this on yelp so we came here.  we were seated right away upon arrival.  service is friendly.  ordered special pho and rare meat pho.  we also ordered <mark>Chinese Fried Donut</mark> $3.25.  hot coffee with condense milk $3.75.  bought to go stirred fried <mark>Seafood <mark>Wonton <mark>Beef Stew <mark>Special Combination Rice Noodle or Egg Noodle</mark></mark></mark></mark> and beef.  food was average good.  restaurant looks relatively clean and spacious.  plenty of parking in this plaza.  price is average as well."

            "i should know vietnamese food, i cook it all the time.  the food here is great.  it's authentic and absolutely delicious.  my favorite is the bun thit nuong cha gio.  vermicelli with grilled pork and <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> salad.  they make it just like my mom's.  also, i've tried some chinese foods and it's not bad.  the deep fried salt n pepper squid was nice and tender.  almost like fried mozzarella.  my date had the pho and it tastes like my homemade broth.  for the vietnamese restaurant, this one is pretty good.  it's nothing like the places in little saigon but this is vegas and it's great.", 
            "pho kim long deserves a four star rating!!!  it really hits the spot and never fails to fill your cravings because it's open 24hrs.  the convenience and price of the food is truly what makes up for my rating!!  i'd give it a 5, only sometimes the food isn't always consistent and service is just alright (although i don't expect much from a place with such inexpensive food).  \n\nanyway, the food i usually eat is pho tai with the steak on the side.  squeeze in some lime and you're good to go.  i also really like the stir fried beef cubes with seasoned rice.  that dish is always on point.  the grilled <mark>Charbroiled <mark>Roasted Mandarin <mark>Honey & Garlic Pork Chop</mark></mark></mark> is something i used to always get, but i've noticed that this dish is sometimes poorly prepared (undercooked) so i rarely ever get this anymore.  <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark> you can't really go wrong with and the <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark> are pretty yum too.  that is the extent of my menu knowledge, but i have also tried the  <mark>Mongolian Beef</mark>, walnut prawns and some of their vermicelli dishes through my friends.  \n\none thing i always get here is the pineapple shake!! yum!  i've tried their other shakes and noticed them to be a tad bit powdery or artificial tasting.  the pineapple and avocado shakes are the only ones made <mark>Three Flavored Bean With Coconut Milk</mark> and fresh fruit, i think, and that's how i like it!!! i'd def recommend you try it.", 
            "i really wonder if they named this after kim long or they meant to pho kim long time. either way, out of many many pho restaurants i've tried in atlanta, new york, san diego and san francisco, this one is one of my favorites. only pho i've tried in vegas but they know what they're doing. \n\nyou'll be greeted by a huge sea aquarium the type you see in mtv cribs worth thousands of dollars. this place must be doing good business because the decorations inside are pretty hard core. they have another aquarium with a king fish and black and white nemo's. pretty awesome! \n\nthe staff at this place is excellent at serving the customers. i think everyone that was working at pho kim long (i can't stop laughing at this name) came up to our table (except the cooks). we had a busy table so you know how it is when people like to add picky stuff to their pho... garlic, limes, extra mint, chili paste, nguoc mum, sriracha... etc. \n\ni ordered the bun with <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark> (cho gio) and char-grilled bbq pork. the bowl was a bit smaller than usual but it was very well made. this is a simple dish but the key item is the noodles. sometimes they are too soggy or they can also be too dry and sticky. this place had perfect noodles for the bun. \n\nthe servers gave us some pho broth since it was so cold outside. very nice gesture! everyone had a small bowl of broth which was very good in flavor. however, if this is the pho broth they use for every dish then i would avoid the pho since it was a bit heavy in texture. i thought it should be more watered down. we had an additional order of <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark> which was pretty decent, nothing fantastic but still good. \n\nsomething unique about this place is their variety of asian cuisine. they are obviously mainly vietnamese but you can also find chinese dishes and even pad thai. very unusual in my experience. one of my friends ordered combo #108 which was amazing. it was similar to bo luc lac but with bigger meat pieces and with excellent steamed broccoli. i'm getting #108 next time. \n\nfound my hangover spot a couple of miles off the strip! pho kim long soon!", 
            "i've been going to this place for a quite sometime now and every time, it's always packed... it doesn't matter if it's 2am, there is still decent amount of people.\n\nthey have great food. i've tried their appetizers like <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark> or <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark>, <mark>Mixed Vegetable <mark>Chicken <mark>Beef <mark>B.B.Q Pork <mark>Shrimp <mark>Yang Chow <mark>House Special <mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>, chicken dishes, pad thai, and my personal favorite, their pho. none of them disappointed me ever. i could close my eyes and pick something random on the menu and i guarantee, i'll either love it or at least like it. \n\ni do have problem with their service once in awhile. sometimes, the server didn't have a very good attitude and was very slow running the food or bringing the check. but besides that, the food is great, the place is great, and the name of the place is great. so go on and try, i guarantee that you won't be disappointed.", 
            "we came here after a night of clubbing with a pretty big group of people.  (yes, i believe it's 24-hours). love that we didn't have to wait for a table.  the staff was very patient with our group, considering we were so loud and annoying.  food didn't take too long.  i ordered <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark> and a chicken and rice plate that was shown on the menu. it tasted alright, but i felt like it was such a rip because the pieces of chicken were so small! i was still hungry after, even with my <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark>. besides that, the establishment was clean and like i said, we were pretty annoying so luckily they didn't kick us out.",

            "pho kim long is busy during the day, but if you go in the evenings (especially after 10pm), you'll have no problem getting a seat and your food on time. one of the high points about this place is that it's open 24 hours. i have not yet discovered any other vietnamese restaurant that is open for 24 hours, so this is a great place for those who are looking to have a filling, healthy dinner after your long night shift. \n\ni can understand why the quality of the pho might not be comparable to some other places (the broth is a little different here than others), but the reason why i gave this place 4 stars is because i would [highly] recommend anyone to be adventurous with the menu. it's typical to order <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark>, <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark>, and your pho, but really... there's so much more to the menu than you think, don't be afraid, trust me!\n\nwe ordered rice, the <mark>Deep Fried Flounder (Whole Fish)</mark>, walnut shrimp, and <mark>Three Flavored Bean With Coconut Milk</mark> to go with the meal, and it was quite possibly one of the most flavorful seafood meals i've ever had in a vietnamese restaurant. i'm usually hesitant with seafood when it comes to restaurants that are reasonably priced and are local establishments, but i have to say the seafood here was fresh, flavorful, and filling. \n\nthe dining area is spacious, not tightly packed together, and the ambience of the restaurant is nice and cultural. might i add they also have a little selection of liquors from their drink menu too?", 
            "my friend told me about this place cause he and his friends goes to vegas all the time and they always come to this place. we stayed at the rio this time so this place was literally down the street. decided we wanted to try this place out cause we didn't want to pay $20 for buffet at the casino. this place is pretty good. i ordered a bowl of pho dac biet which was like almost $8 and my hubby ordered the vermicelli with <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark> and <mark>Charbroiled Beef</mark> for around $8. our meal combined was less than $20.\n\nlater that night my friend wanted pho so i came back with her and this time i ordered the vermicelli with <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> and <mark>Charbroiled Beef</mark> and she ordered the pho. it was equally yummy. i like how they have so much choices of pho, rice plates, vermicelli, etc.  \n\na lot of people come here so this place does get packed. next time i'm in vegas, i'll most likely come back here cause their food is so yummy. i like how it's open really late so you can go anytime like after clubbing. pho is a good hangover remedy :)",

(hence the name)  gotta love a good name \"pho\" a restaurant!\n\nbrought some out of town friends here on monday (labor day) around 1pm.  people were everywhere inside and outside waiting.  i almost gave up immediately but my inner gut & the \"best of rj's\" on the windows made me stay.  when we finally made our way to the front to put our name in we asked the guy how long the wait was.  his reply, \"really fast\".  i couldn't help but chuckle but who are we to argue. lol\n\nsurprisingly, our wait wasn't too long before our name was called.  with all the people everywhere i was halfway expecting to be waiting a while.  we were seated by a window.  literally every table full.  a guy came to take our drink order.  while we checked out the menu every meal was numbered making it easy to order.  each item had a detailed description underneath for white girls like me or at least i'd like to think. haha  btw the menu is gigantic.  i'm often overwhelmed by such menus but i knew what i was looking for.  my bf and i decided we would share each of our orders so we could try a couple different dishes.  we had settled on two things to share until i heard my friend say...udon noodle!  i just discovered udon noodles when i was in cali. i honestly cannot have enough of it.  to describe it to someone i would say its like a really thick soft spaghetti noodle.  here is what we ordered:\n\n*beef udon noodle - i thought it was fantastic.  the bf thought it was a little peppery (you could actually see the black pepper in it) but it was still our favorite.\n*chicken pho - a little bland broth flavor (i remember it being better), chunks of chicken, thin <mark>Seafood <mark>Wonton <mark>Beef Stew <mark>Special Combination Rice Noodle or Egg Noodle</mark></mark></mark></mark>.  we added a bunch of <mark>Braised Scallops in Hot Chili Sauce</mark> to spice it up and give it a little more flavor. pretty good even though it felt like it was the hottest/humid day of the summer.  we did only eat half the soup.  the bowl was as big as my head.\n*our friends also got the beef udon and love it.  they also got the <mark>Teriyaki Chicken</mark> with rice and it was a huge portion.  she only had half of it.\n\nwe waited a bit for the check.  the servers were running around like crazy but she eventually came.  our bill came to around $70 i believe-our friends had bought.  overall it was good.  just super crazy busy.  this is definitely a popular spot.\n\nthe reviews say that its opened 24 hours.  i cant imagine really wanting a drunken night soup bowl at 3am but it sounds like a lot of people do.  (i secretly opt for a drunken night fat burger at that time-but that's just me) but if its your thang have at it!  its there for your enjoyment!  24 hours.", 
            "the food is basic, pho is salty af, the rice was overcooked and the <mark>Teriyaki Chicken</mark> was rough. the servers literally rush you out the door and the manager is rude as hell! i was with a large group of people for edc week so we asked if we can get separate checks. the server said the manager would do it once we were ready to pay. we stood there waiting at the cash register as he completely ignored us while he was playing around with some receipts. when he finally looks up he rudely tells us he cannot split the check. when i asked why, he said because it was sunday, enunciating every word he spoke as though i was an idiot. i said ok. so we scanned the check to see what each one of us owed as he huffed and puffed. then he grabbed the check and literally guesstimated what each one of us owed. i'm sure he overcharged more than $20 but no problem since we're never returning to this joint."

            "i think this place is great. they have excellent vegan pho, great veggies, and just saw a sign that they offer <mark>Brown rice</mark> now, too. this is one of my favorite spots in vegas!", 
            "almost an addiction after a late night of partying! their assortment of pho will have something for everyone. i usually get the combinatio pho but when i feel like eating something else the teriyaki chicke. and <mark>Brown rice</mark> will hit the spot.", 
            "my fianc\\u00e9e and i visited kim long pho twice during our stay in vegas and we loved our dishes both times. in all we had the vegetable pho, seafood pho, salt & pepper fish with <mark>Brown rice</mark>, and crab ragoon. \nthey were all amazing. great quality ingredients used. \ni highly recommend this restaurant.", 
            "pho kim long is pho kim wrong. \ni didn't come for the pho. we had the <mark>Orange Chicken</mark> and the black bean beef. both orders including the rice disappointed.\n\nthe black bean beef was the better of the two dishes. the meat was chewy which i do not enjoy. there was about 5 tablespoons of oil at the bottom of the plate. too greasy for me. \n\nthe <mark>Orange Chicken</mark> looks delicious until you try to eat it. some of the pieces of chicken had a really consistency. it's hard to describe. i'm scared it wasn't chicken at all. it was like no chicken i've ever had. maybe it was old or frost bitten. the texture was not chicken. i could not get my around eating it at all. \n\nrice. how do you mess up rice?  the white rice was over cooked and somewhat mushy. the <mark>Brown rice</mark> was undercooked and hard. \n\nservice was initially very fast but we had to wait forever for our bill.   i was there on a saturday night around 12a and the wait was short. \n\nwith all the places vegas has to offer. i would never go back to this dump.", 
            "came in sat down promptly and order right away.  10,15,20,25,30min ..where's my food??? saw about 3 different tables fill up..saw that they too ordered right away so 35, 40min..what do i see?? i see those 3 tables getting their food before me..wt.f!!!45,50min i think..i was too mad at this point or maybe an hour went by until i finally received my food..if the food i ate was any good (beef cube with <mark>Brown rice</mark>) i would've given them 2 stars but it was bland and the portion was really small for $14..overall i don't think i'm ever coming back..what a wack ass experience.", 
            "it was pretty packed but our party of 3 none the less was seated within five minutes. the servers definitely pay attention and were at our table to take our order the second the last menu was set on the table. <mark>Brown rice</mark> as an option is great for us semi-conscious eaters lol", 
            "the vegan ph\\u00f5 soup is fantastic. japanese stir fried udon is a must don't miss out on this. top it off with some <mark>Mongolian Beef</mark> with <mark>Brown rice</mark> and you are good to go. bathroom is not a good place to be at. the dude has one glove on and rocks away with the same towel all surfaces. let's hope my immune system can battle whatever bacteria makes it to their kitchen.", 
            "best pho i've had so far, been here twice in one month, and was not ashamed to go alone. lol. i love how you are automatically served water right when you are seated. it's always very busy so i thought that was great. i always order the <mark>Pho Vegan</mark>, and it it excellent! great flavor. the <mark>Tofu Nuggets</mark> are very good as well. they also serve <mark>Brown rice</mark>! which many pho locations don't, (like the one i'm at right now) it's 24 hours which is also a plus, i was on the strip late night and wanted something light and they were my first option! will always come back here!", 
            "just a quick update as i have been there about three times in the past three months!\n\na. parking - no longer easy. the plethora of good / decent places to go like lee's sandwich, fat dumpling, mr. tofu and etc make parking here limited and in high demand. it is nearly difficult to find any parking here, even if you are willing to walk.\n\nb.  reasons - that is because pkl is open 24 hours!  the food is darn decent at times.  \n\nc.  late meals - finished a movie and midnight and came here f<mark>Seafood <mark>Wonton <mark>Beef Stew <mark>Special Combination Rice Noodle or Egg Noodle</mark></mark></mark></mark> on friday night. at 1:00 am, the place was packed.  our team waited only ten minutes for a table in the back room, where it says \" employees only\"  looks to be a room that they will slowly expand into and perhaps was another restaurant before?  \n\nd.  pho - had number 13, which has everything in it and also the bun bo hue with pho noodles instead of <mark>Seafood <mark>Wonton <mark>Beef Stew <mark>Special Combination Rice Noodle or Egg Noodle</mark></mark></mark></mark> (vermicelli).  ok, don't hate that!  i know it is traditional to have bbh with the <mark>Seafood <mark>Wonton <mark>Beef Stew <mark>Special Combination Rice Noodle or Egg Noodle</mark></mark></mark></mark>. it is just that the consistency of the pho noodles is soooooo much better and the texture is amazing. the way the noodles drape over your chopsticks as you shovel a huge portion into your mouth is just what the doctor ordered.  hard to do with the <mark>Seafood <mark>Wonton <mark>Beef Stew <mark>Special Combination Rice Noodle or Egg Noodle</mark></mark></mark></mark> as it is bigger and the consistency is such that you cannot pack a bunch into  your mouth.  hey it is part of the noodle experience if you ask me.  just watch any movie where you watch the japanese salary-men at lunch slurping down a bowl of ramen and i think you will get my drift.  noodles are meant to be hoovered!  \n\ne.  pho part ii - anyway, the bun bo hue at 1:00 am is a very, very good. the broth is just right, they serve the spice separately so you can make the soup as hot as you want.  they serve all the bits of tendon, offal, pork hock and everything you can imagine that was eaten in the city of hue due to well, the poor economy.  i finally learned that offal is the stuff in meats that you cook that most people don't eat.  the offal is awfully good!!! it is what makes the soup.  my son had number 13 which is nearly like bbh without the pork hock and the spice. he slurped that up, but i won because my bbh came first and i had a head start!\n\nf.  the chicken - yep, ordered once again the salted baked chicken with ginger sauce.  why?  because it is so good, nutritious and a very good measure of the chef and the restaurant.  simple to cook, yet easy to over cook, the meat has to be so juicy and tender. it is either that or overcooked as the entire taste is from the chicken itself.  it has to be on the bone, and it has to make you caveman like to use your hands to gnaw at every morsel of meat on the bone!  the ginger onion sauce has to be so good that you are putting it on the chicken like you would butter and you have to ask for more.  this time, the chicken was great.  i went there two weeks ago at 8:00 am and it was absolutely horrible.   so, i think that the chefs know at 1:00 am they will have a ton, so they are making it and storing it just right. at 8:00 am, the last time, i probably had a heated up stored chicken and it was as if \"i made it myself.  just mehhhh\".  fresh and hot is best and it was rocking at 1:00 am.\n\noverall, great menu, many of other choices on there that you would find in a chinese restaurant and a great place to end up!\n\nnow they serve <mark>Brown rice</mark> for 1.50 more.  this chinese people are so good at making money on rice!  here is the dealio though. at 1:00 am most of the people there are drunk or buzzed and needing greasy fatty foods to recover. i don't think they are so worried about <mark>Brown rice</mark>.... \n\n\ngk says, this is the late nite place to be for sure!", 
            "i'm definitely a fan of pho kim long!\n\nthe fact that the restaurant is open 25/7 alone gives it brownie points as you never know what time of the day you'll be craving pho. \n\nit's a pretty popular place on the strip, and there is a wait whether you go for sunday lunch or for late night drunk munchies during the weekend. the good thing is that the waits are never usually that long; service is quick and efficient. \n\nmy go to items: \n- <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark>; comes with a dipping <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sweet & Sour <mark>Kung Pao <mark>Fish Fillet</mark></mark></mark> <mark>Sauteed Oysters <mark>Sauteed Beef <mark>Sauteed Chicken with Black Bean Sauce</mark></mark></mark></mark>, lettuce to wrap the <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> in, and pickled veggies to top it off \n- pho with brisket only; tender and delicious\n\ni've also tried and enjoyed:\n- rice vermicelli with <mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> <mark>Singapore Noodles with Shrimp or Pork</mark> + <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark>; <mark>Seafood <mark>Wonton <mark>Beef Stew <mark>Special Combination Rice Noodle or Egg Noodle</mark></mark></mark></mark> topped with fresh chopped lettuce, fresh veggies, charbroiled meat and sliced <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark>, also comes <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sweet & Sour <mark>Kung Pao <mark>Fish Fillet</mark></mark></mark> <mark>Sauteed Oysters <mark>Sauteed Beef <mark>Sauteed Chicken with Black Bean Sauce</mark></mark></mark></mark> to add in\n- <mark>Crispy Calamari</mark>; salt and pepper, very flavorful, comes with a mozzarella dipping sauce\n- <mark>Mongolian Beef</mark>; add spice to your liking, very tasty and comes with white or <mark>Brown rice</mark>\n \npho kim long is convenient and a restaurant my friends and i go to at least once a month. fast service, good prices, and filling dishes!", 
            "this is a good restaurant to go for a quick meal.   we were here around 11a and was seated in minute.   our server is friendly.   overall the pho is decent somehow i still can't fully feel the taste of the broth. should try the chicken teriyaki with <mark>Brown rice</mark> though.   overall,  i would definitely eat here again when i'm in vegas."

            "what an awesome name!\n\nokay, first off... as a teenager, i lived in san jose ca - a city which has a ton of vietnamese gangsters... and since i was always looking to get \"hookups\" on car parts, i ended up meeting and befriending alot of the aforementioned vietnamese gangsters. those guys always used to take me to the best pho spots, so i'm no pho newbie.\n\ni decided to try out pho kim long with one of my boys right before he got married in vegas, because it was quick, inexpensive, and let's face it, the name of the restaurant is awesome! funny as hell!\n\nafter taking some quick myspace pics by the sign outside, we ventured in the restaurant and ordered our food. my homie ordered pho dac biet, and i ordered pho tai, which is my favorite because i love the thin, rare, red slices of steak (tai) that they throw on top of your steaming soup with hot <mark>Seafood <mark>Wonton <mark>Beef Stew <mark>Special Combination Rice Noodle or Egg Noodle</mark></mark></mark></mark>. \n\nas we waited for our food, i did my standard vietnamese restaurant ritual of thoroughly wiping down my chopsticks and little condiment dishes with hot tea and napkins. you can never be too careful, especially since pho kim long is located conveniently next to a platform shoes store for strippers.\n\nthe service was pretty good, i appreciated the fact that the waiter made an extra effort to hold our pho bowls on the outside! =) i've been to pho places before where they grab the bowl with their thumb on top, and the other fingers below the bowl... but i hate that, cause the soup splashes around, and the waiter's thumb often times goes into the soup! aw heyllll no!\n\nthe broth at pho kim long was just \"aiight\" but i guess not bad for las vegas... i dont expect vegas to have top quality pho anyways. let's face it, people go to vegas for buffets, gambling, parties, drinking, lap dances, and drive through weddings. not pho. \n\nso i'm rating pkl (fhl hehe) with 4 stars. cause i think it ain't bad for vegas, and at least the guy's thumb didn't go into my soup. good lookin out homie.", 
            "\"crawfish\" is a new addition to pho kim long, and that's what brought me here in the first place.  they only started offering this shellfish in june, weekends only.\n\nmy luck that the sunday i choose to come in, they weren't offering it. we still sat down for dinner and this is what we got: \n\n* hu tieu hoac mi bo kho (<mark>Beef Stew</mark> <mark>Seafood <mark>Wonton <mark>Beef Stew <mark>Special Combination Rice Noodle or Egg Noodle</mark></mark></mark></mark>) - $7.95: the big f enjoyed his <mark>Spicy <mark>Special Combination Tender Beef <mark><mark>Rare Steak & Brisket <mark>Rare Steak & Well-Done Flank <mark>Beef Ball <mark>Chicken <mark>Shrimp <mark>Plain <mark>Seafood <mark>Wonton <mark>Beef Stew <mark>Special Combination Rice Noodle or Egg Noodle</mark></mark></mark></mark> Soup</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>.  i was too busy with my plate to eat much of his.\n\n* dau dua xao <mark>Stir-fried String Beans <mark>Sauteed Calamari with Spicy XO Sauce</mark></mark> (stir fried <mark>Stir-fried String Beans <mark>Sauteed Calamari with Spicy XO Sauce</mark></mark>) - $9.95: tasty string beans, a bit on the pricey side though.  a nice spice kick as well.\n\n* com ga hai nam (hai nam style chicken with seasoned rice) $8.50: i've always liked hainamese chicken since my friend's mom made it for me, along with the seasoned rice.  it's good here, but definitely not as good as my friend's mom's version.\n\npho kim long ii is a huge restaurant with lots of big tables for large parties.  a great place for families to eat and friends to gather after a late night.  their menu is pretty extensive so there's plenty of choices for everyone.  and portions seem pretty decent-sized too.  (i wish they would get a bigger fish tank though because there are way too many fish in that tiny thing up front!)\n\nfrom this experience, i give it a four stars.\n\ni love hot n juicy crawfish up the road, and i definitely believe in some healthy competition.  so, last friday we decided to finally check out their crawfish and see if it's worthy.\n\nwe decided to start off with two pounds and see where we went for there.     we noticed a neighboring table with their order of crawfish and was definitely excited.  it came in a large bowl with red potatoes, corn on the cob and sausage.  they also brought extra bowls for the shells and a plate for us to eat on.  the big f requested limes, salt and pepper to make a dipping concoction.\n\ni dove right in and noticed the big difference...the crawfish was not fresh.  it was old or way overcooked.  the tail meat didn't come off the shell easily and was broken up.  i thought it was just the first one and continued eating.  unfortunately, this wasn't the case.  there was little to no head juice either, which was very disappointing to me.  the big f was easily disgusted with the crawfish and we were glad that we only ordered two pounds to start.  (we usually go for two pounds each!)  the corn, potatoes, and sausage were good though, but it didn't make up for the bad crawfish.  since it comes in a bowl, there's no sauce on the bottom for you to dip your crawfish in after you shell it.  no bibs were provided, which explains all the stains on my shirt.\n\nwhen i'm craving crawfish, i'll drive up the road and spring the extra cash over at hot n juicy.\n\nfor this experience, i give it a two stars.\n\noverall, a four stars for their vietnamese food, and a two stars for their bad crawfish.  i'm giving pho kim long ii a three star.\n\n(pics are posted!)",

            "i am a fan. and this is why. the pho may not be the best you've ever tasted, but its pretty damn good. i mean really how many ways is there to make pho? had the beef tendon pho, it hit the spot. aside from the pho, they're ong choy (water spinach) was sauteed well, great sauce. fried calamari, was probably the best i have had, i couldnt stop eating it. and the roast duck had a lot of flavor, and you could tell it was made fresh, not re-heated. i can't seem to get a grasp on what type of sauce it was. the <mark>Salted Fish</mark> <mark>Mixed Vegetable <mark>Chicken <mark>Beef <mark>B.B.Q Pork <mark>Shrimp <mark>Yang Chow <mark>House Special <mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> was also flavor, and you could actually taste the <mark>Salted Fish</mark> unlike other places (sam woo). these items are some of the same dishes i get at several asian restaurants just to compare, and the version here are right up there to one of the best i have had. \n\njust to comment on people talking about service and such, i don't mean to be harsh, or offend the asian culture, because i consider myself asian myself. but the bad service? first these types of places is not a pf changs or a pei wei. they're not here to ask you how your day is going. they're just not, some of them don't even speak english. yes when they bring out the food to you, sometimes they rush, or kind of pack all the dishes on the table, looking like they slam the plates on it., theyre a little rough and maybe your oolong tea spills a little from your cup. you know what thats a sign of? that it's authentic. some of the best places i have eaten at in california were like this. actually my favorite place back home, was like this, won't exactly strike you as fine dining and not the most polite servers but best food hands down. i once went to a place in san francisco, where you had to go down they're basement to go to the bathroom, a little scary, but what shocked me more was how good they're food was",

            "if youre craving for a pho fix out herr in vegas i highly reccomend this place! not only is it cheap but the place is nicely decorated (unlike some other pho places ive been to), has grreatttt customer service,wait time to be seated is less than 5 mins, wide variety of food ( from pho to <mark><mark><mark><mark><mark>House Special Pan Fried Noodles</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> to creamy walnut shrimp to even pad thai-- all cooked to perfection), fully staffed,annnnd cheaper prices compared to other pho places around the area. i wish there was a place like this out in the bay area where im from.but im definitely going to frequent this spot everytime im out here in vegas now:) good job pho kim long! best pho place ive everrrrr been to!!",

            "for all you perverted minded (all of us) let's get it out of our system first and snicker & smirk it off!  whether you pronounce it correctly or not...it all sounds alike. \"pho kim long\" ... yup that's the name of this fine restaurant.  don't let the name fool you though.  the place has since been remodeled a while back with simple yet beautiful decor & backdrops that really make a difference and give you an ethnic feel to your vietnamese dining experience.  whenever one feels the crave for some luscious pho, this place will do justice.  they open early and close late practically open 24 hours...this place is great for lunch with family, a dinner date for two or a cure for your late night hang overs with friends.  in fact pho kim long is great anytime to fill your tummy to satisfaction.  \n\nthis place can get packed, especially on a weekend at peak hours...so be prepared for the crowd.  a downfall to this is their small waiting area up front.  with very little seating and standing area, this can be and is a fire hazard. but when this happens you know they must be doing something right...to have such an audience of hungry on goers wait amongst each other.  \n\nwhen you do get seated, be excited for once you decide what to order, the food is prepared quick and comes right out.  my favorite pho here is the combination.  this comes with chewy yet tender tendon that melts right when you chew, also has your usual thin sliced flank raw meat & other goodness...the broth is very soothing and comes packed with flavor.  their salt & pepper calamari is scrumptious, but eat it fresh and hot as it will get soggy after a while...but still a yummy snack even after.  for those non-pho phonatics...they do have rice and other dishes to get your palates tainted with flavor....from pork, to beef, to fish, to even <mark>Pad Thai Noodles</mark>...they par up pretty well.  my favorite dessert drink here is their avocado shake smoothie with tapioca boba!  they must have atleast 100 pieces of boba....sounds like fillers...but they do give a generous amount of avocado shake in it.  you can also request the shake without boba.\n\nall in all...i may be too generous giving this place a high rating with 5 stars.  others would disagree with me, as i can understand...i should be giving it only 4 stars because of the waiting area (but only an issue when it is packed) and also because prices here tend to be just a tad bit higher than some close rivals that are side by side comparable in quality,  i do give it 5 stars though because for some reason...i still keep coming back here for more ... rather than 2 others who are in my top 3 of pho places in las vegas.\n\ndon't forget, you can also take out! and pho kim long is very generous <mark><mark>Braised Catfish in Clay Pot</mark> <mark>Braised Catfish in Clay Pot</mark></mark>!  you may pay a dollar or 2 more, but the portions are respectable and they wont rip you off like some other places:\n **cough-cough(pho rose)cough-cough**",

            "i really love vietnamese food, after most of my life avoiding this cuisine and preferring other asian foods. as i learn more about the food and pho, i like to try so many places.\n\n1.  parking - easy as it is in a strip mall.\n2.  convenience - this place seems to be 24 hours. that is great for whenever you need to eat great food.\n\n3.  pho - i cannot comment on the pho here since i did not try it here.  the reason is that their menu is quite extensive and pho is only about 15% of what they serve. they have a ton of other chinese and asian food here.  the prices did look good here and i just am used to the p1 to p7 type of ordering and then more of descriptions of each.  perhaps i am still a newbie to pho.\n\n4  bu bun hue - this is the spicy vermicelli noodle and i will come back here to try it as it is the measure which i will rate other restaurants.  it is an authentic and original noodle and if they serve it <mark>Singapore Noodles with Shrimp or Pork</mark> knuckle, i will be in pig heaven.\n\n5.  the other stuff - i was truly amazed at all the other dishes that i ordered the salt bake chicken with the ginger and scallion minced sauce. i ordered also the <mark>Stir-fried Ong Choy with Garlic</mark>. (type of spinach).  to me, a great restaurant will get the salt baked chicken moist and succulent.  it is both easy and hard to do, because you have to have whole chicken to do this and not the frozen breast. also, you have to have enough volume of serving this as to make it takes time and you gotta be ready.  the chicken here was absolutely great, although a bit skinny.... the ong choy is also something that is served at higher volume restaurants that cater to real chinese or asian eaters, so having this was also great. \n\n6.  price - reasonable, however the stuff i ordered for two of us and the fact that we had to pay for white rice (i do not like this at all) came to 26.00 which i find to be a bit on the high side. perhaps i should have stuck to the pho.\n\ni will be back to try more of their stuff to give you all a better idea.....\n\ngk says try it out.",

            "pho kim long is delicious chinese/vietnamese food. i've been wanting to try this place out for a pho kim long time (har har :p), and i finally made it! came here late night after a mingling event that didn't have enough food. so we decided to pig out here.  \n\nsince we came here so late, we opted for dishes that weren't so carb heavy, which meant more of the chinese dishes (ie no pho, rice, or vermicelli). we ordered the chicken lettuce wrap appetizer, crispy <mark>Sweet & Sour Pork</mark> ribs, and ong choy with <mark>Mapo Tofu Szechuan Bean Curd</mark> sauce. i have to admit i was a bit hesitant because with \"pho\" in the title, i'd assume you'd have to get a bowl of noodles or at least something vietnamese to get the best food. and all 3 dishes we ordered were chinese. yet they were all surprisingly good. \n\nthe chicken lettuce wrap - the chicken saute was very well seasoned. it wasn't served the authentic way with little bowls of sauces and green onion. but it was still very tasty. only con is that the portion is much smaller than what you'd usually get at a chinese restaurant.\n\nthe pork dish - i was most surprised with this one. this is a classic cantonese dish, and it's so easy to mess up by using bad meat. but here the meat tasted fresh and was thinly cut (that's a good thing) with very little fat. the flavors were amazing. sweet sauce. crispy pork. i loved it.\n\nthe vegetable dish - ong choy is also known as chinese spinach or chinese watercress. it was prepared the cantonese way, ie with a <mark>Mapo Tofu Szechuan Bean Curd</mark> sauce. nothing out of the world - tasted like what i would expect ong choy to taste like. \n\nthe wait staff are very nice. the food came out suspiciously fast. it was crazy how quickly it came out as soon as we ordered. and yet the dishes were delicious. the venue is busy and happening at all times of the day it seems, and there's ample seating. every time i've passed by here, the restaurant has always had people in it. my only con is that the dishes are somewhat expensive. you can easily get all 3 dishes we ordered here in socal for roughly $20-30, but here it was $40. the food is good though, and they're open late. i'd come here again. but most likely not for another pho kim long time. okay, i know i probably killed it the first time. :p"

            "i really love vietnamese food, after most of my life avoiding this cuisine and preferring other asian foods. as i learn more about the food and pho, i like to try so many places.\n\n1.  parking - easy as it is in a strip mall.\n2.  convenience - this place seems to be 24 hours. that is great for whenever you need to eat great food.\n\n3.  pho - i cannot comment on the pho here since i did not try it here.  the reason is that their menu is quite extensive and pho is only about 15% of what they serve. they have a ton of other chinese and asian food here.  the prices did look good here and i just am used to the p1 to p7 type of ordering and then more of descriptions of each.  perhaps i am still a newbie to pho.\n\n4  bu bun hue - this is the spicy vermicelli noodle and i will come back here to try it as it is the measure which i will rate other restaurants.  it is an authentic and original noodle and if they serve it <mark>Singapore Noodles with Shrimp or Pork</mark> knuckle, i will be in pig heaven.\n\n5.  the other stuff - i was truly amazed at all the other dishes that i ordered the salt bake chicken with the ginger and scallion minced sauce. i ordered also the <mark>Stir-fried Ong Choy with Garlic</mark>. (type of spinach).  to me, a great restaurant will get the salt baked chicken moist and succulent.  it is both easy and hard to do, because you have to have whole chicken to do this and not the frozen breast. also, you have to have enough volume of serving this as to make it takes time and you gotta be ready.  the chicken here was absolutely great, although a bit skinny.... the ong choy is also something that is served at higher volume restaurants that cater to real chinese or asian eaters, so having this was also great. \n\n6.  price - reasonable, however the stuff i ordered for two of us and the fact that we had to pay for white rice (i do not like this at all) came to 26.00 which i find to be a bit on the high side. perhaps i should have stuck to the pho.\n\ni will be back to try more of their stuff to give you all a better idea.....\n\ngk says try it out.", 
            "love this place! they have fantastic noodles (combination beef [#13] is my favorite), <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark>/peanut sauce are addictive and you must have the ong choy sauteed <mark>Stir-fried Ong Choy with Garlic</mark> cloves (#75). sometimes they can go a little heavy on the sauces with their chinese dishes, but just asked for easy sauce. service is friendly, open 24/7 (bonus!!) and their honeydew boba is so good. do yourself a favor and give this place a try. i promise you'll make it a regular stop."

(i wish they would get a bigger fish tank though because there are way too many fish in that tiny thing up front!)\n\nfrom this experience, i give it a four stars.\n\ni love hot n juicy crawfish up the road, and i definitely believe in some healthy competition.  so, last friday we decided to finally check out their crawfish and see if it's worthy.\n\nwe decided to start off with two pounds and see where we went for there.     we noticed a neighboring table with their order of crawfish and was definitely excited.  it came in a large bowl with red potatoes, corn on the cob and sausage.  they also brought extra bowls for the shells and a plate for us to eat on.  the big f requested limes, salt and pepper to make a dipping concoction.\n\ni dove right in and noticed the big difference...the crawfish was not fresh.  it was old or way overcooked.  the tail meat didn't come off the shell easily and was broken up.  i thought it was just the first one and continued eating.  unfortunately, this wasn't the case.  there was little to no head juice either, which was very disappointing to me.  the big f was easily disgusted with the crawfish and we were glad that we only ordered two pounds to start.  (we usually go for two pounds each!)  the corn, potatoes, and sausage were good though, but it didn't make up for the bad crawfish.  since it comes in a bowl, there's no sauce on the bottom for you to dip your crawfish in after you shell it.  no bibs were provided, which explains all the stains on my shirt.\n\nwhen i'm craving crawfish, i'll drive up the road and spring the extra cash over at hot n juicy.\n\nfor this experience, i give it a two stars.\n\noverall, a four stars for their vietnamese food, and a two stars for their bad crawfish.  i'm giving pho kim long ii a three star.\n\n(pics are posted!)", 
            "i've heard so much good stuff about pho kim long, and plenty of jokes about the restaurants name, but the food is definitely no joking manner.  opened 24 hours  and on spring mountain rd, this place is great for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and the late night hang over snack. but be warned, normal wait time can be  anywhere between 30 min to over an  hour as this place is busy as ever.\n\nwe ordered  pho tai (rare beef), bun bo hue (it's like a vermicelli <mark>Spicy <mark>Special Combination Tender Beef <mark><mark>Rare Steak & Brisket <mark>Rare Steak & Well-Done Flank <mark>Beef Ball <mark>Chicken <mark>Shrimp <mark>Plain <mark>Seafood <mark>Wonton <mark>Beef Stew <mark>Special Combination Rice Noodle or Egg Noodle</mark></mark></mark></mark> Soup</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> with different types of beef and you can add this <mark>Sauteed Calamari with Spicy XO Sauce</mark> to it), and the cam bo luc lac (diced tender beef with steamed rice).  the pho soup has amazing flavors and is rich in texture, but their small and large isn't much of  a difference in bowl size so i'd recommend opting for the large. i can't say much about comparing bun bo  hue to other restaurants as it was my first time, but i'm a fan! my only grip is that i wish they had given more meat for the bo  luc lac dish...it seemed on the skimpier side but the flavors were really delicious.\n\nstaff is very attentive for refills, taking empty plates away, and utensil requests. ambience is clean,  surprisingly  spacious, and constantly busy. next time i return to vegas, i can't wait to return to pho kim long!"

(i secretly opt for a drunken night fat burger at that time-but that's just me) but if its your thang have at it!  its there for your enjoyment!  24 hours.",

            "maybe its because i've tried almost every single pho restaurant in oc or because i've tried the pho in vietnam but pho kim long's pho isn't very good. \n\ni'm going to guess that its always crowded here because its located in a busy plaza in chinatown near the strip. i've passed by this place a few times during lunch and there's always a bunch of people hanging outside waiting for a table. parking sucks because the plaza has a lot of shops but not enough parking spots. \n\npho is always good for a hangover because of the beef/chicken broth, but i felt that pho kim long's broth was very watered down. it seemed (imo), that they just tossed a few beef bouillon cubes in their broth and added pho seasoning. i ordered a small bowl and it was a good size, but i felt that there wasn't enough meat.there are chopsticks, spoons, spices, and hois<mark>Braised Scallops in Hot Chili Sauce</mark> on the table. while the food came out quickly, and the veggies were fresh, the pho broth and service weren't good. like most asian run restaurants, the servers weren't friendly and seemed to always be in a rush.",

            "great late night chinese and vietnamese place in vegas.  got into town at close to midnight and my friend suggested this place.  its in the chinatown area off the strip not to far from the rio hotel.  knew it would be good, being one of the few white people in the place and it did not disappoint.\n\nhad their bbq pork appetizer which was great, good quality.  then had a couple of beef dishes, <mark>Mongolian Beef</mark> and the cubed beef.  both great.  place got the food out pretty fast too.  this place makes great chinese food, definitely worth leaving the strip for.\n\nthe pho is supposed to be awesome and i plan on having that next time.", 
            "pho kim long deserves a four star rating!!!  it really hits the spot and never fails to fill your cravings because it's open 24hrs.  the convenience and price of the food is truly what makes up for my rating!!  i'd give it a 5, only sometimes the food isn't always consistent and service is just alright (although i don't expect much from a place with such inexpensive food).  \n\nanyway, the food i usually eat is pho tai with the steak on the side.  squeeze in some lime and you're good to go.  i also really like the stir fried beef cubes with seasoned rice.  that dish is always on point.  the grilled <mark>Charbroiled <mark>Roasted Mandarin <mark>Honey & Garlic Pork Chop</mark></mark></mark> is something i used to always get, but i've noticed that this dish is sometimes poorly prepared (undercooked) so i rarely ever get this anymore.  <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark> you can't really go wrong with and the <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark> are pretty yum too.  that is the extent of my menu knowledge, but i have also tried the  <mark>Mongolian Beef</mark>, walnut prawns and some of their vermicelli dishes through my friends.  \n\none thing i always get here is the pineapple shake!! yum!  i've tried their other shakes and noticed them to be a tad bit powdery or artificial tasting.  the pineapple and avocado shakes are the only ones made <mark>Three Flavored Bean With Coconut Milk</mark> and fresh fruit, i think, and that's how i like it!!! i'd def recommend you try it.", 
            "i didnt realize that this place would have such a huge menu\n\nget the sea bass!!!\nwe also had the noodles which were ok\n<mark>Mongolian Beef</mark> was spiced just enough.\nseafood dish was good.\n\nbest bet is to get the sea bass and another random entree, the menu was so big i couldnt get everything i wanted, but everthing i wanted was good!\n\ndidnt try any of their soup dishes, but i did see alot of people order them. ide use quick tips for that.\ntry this place out, you might love it/you might think its mediocre, from some of the other reviews, this seems like the trend.", 
            "this place gets brownie points in my book for being open during the wee hours of the night. this place would normally be an average 3-4 star rating but it gets 5 stars due to the fact that its open 24 hours, it's located off spring mountain and valley view (relatively close to the strip, making it convenient for late night eats for locals getting off work or after a night of clubbing or gambling). \n\nwhat i also like about this place is that no matter how busy it is, service here is fast! after sitting down and ordering, i'm pretty sure we almost always get our orders (even with parties of 4+) within 15-20min or less!\n\ni always start off with ordering their calamari which i find very tasty. then i enjoy ordering the <mark>Mongolian Beef</mark> or the bun bo hue; a vermicelli <mark>Spicy <mark>Special Combination Tender Beef <mark><mark>Rare Steak & Brisket <mark>Rare Steak & Well-Done Flank <mark>Beef Ball <mark>Chicken <mark>Shrimp <mark>Plain <mark>Seafood <mark>Wonton <mark>Beef Stew <mark>Special Combination Rice Noodle or Egg Noodle</mark></mark></mark></mark> Soup</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> have good pho according to my vietnamese friends who always order that but i usually don't get it because i'm not in the mood f<mark>Seafood Tofu Chowder <mark>Catfish or Shrimp (with Head) Sour Soup</mark></mark> and the bun is basically the same ingredients without the broth.", 
            "i am always weary when it comes to going to vietnamese restaurants. i am also kind of hesitant when it comes to vietnamese restaurants that serve chinese food. with that being my family's background, it is hard to eat at some places and not say that one of my parents could make it better.\n\nit has been forever since i went to a restaurant with the intention of getting pho. i came here with a group of friends to celebrate one of them getting a promotion. none of us ordered from the vietnamese menu. it is probably for the best, because i am unforgiving most of the time. \n\ninstead we got items off of the chinese menu and did it family style. the <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark> and <mark>Crab Rangoons (8)</mark> are nothing special. i would rather skip the appetizers and just order more entree dishes. the pepper beef is generous and comes with a beautiful array of broccoli. <mark>Mongolian Beef</mark> was tender and had a decent flavor to it, but it lacked the kick. <mark>Kung Pao Chicken</mark> had me searching out for the hot peppers to make up for the previous dish. the singapore noodles came in a mountain sized portion and had a subtle curry flavor to it. the stand out dish was the honey garlic <mark>Charbroiled <mark>Roasted Mandarin <mark>Honey & Garlic Pork Chop</mark></mark></mark>. they are phenomenal. large pieces of boneless and bone in meat fried crisp, tossed in a lightly sweet sauce, and topped with fried chopped garlic. i was grabbing piece after piece.\n\nnot only is pho kim long a place to sooth your hangover. it is a place to get it started. with a decent selection of mainly imported asian <mark>Beer 33</mark> and a few common domestics, you can begin the party. add in some cold sake to do sake bombs and you have a party. with 2 apps, five entrees, and three rounds of drinks we paid $120. it is a deal.", 
            "pho kim long has actually grown on me. at first i wasn't very impressed, but after trying a few different things i have kind of come around.\n\nfirst of let me say that i work overnights, so when i get off at 5am my options are extremely limited. pho kim long is probably the healthiest option if i want to eat out. the place is always clean but the service is lacking. usually one person takes your order, another brings you the drink (a lot of the time after receiving food), another brings you the food.\n\nthe food always comes out in random order. sometimes the pho comes out first, sometimes the entrees. sometimes it takes forever and sometimes its quick.\n\nbecause i've been there at least 20 times i've tried a lot on the menu, but not everything (the menu is extensive). \n\nthe combination pho is good, it's not the best i've had but its consistently good. no complaints.\n\nthe <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark> are fresh, but they are small. a lot smaller than any other place i've been.\n\nsome of the entrees i've had we're just mediocre including <mark>Kung Pao Chicken</mark>, <mark>Mongolian Beef</mark>, <mark>Sizzling Curry Chicken</mark>, and walnut shrimp. they weren't bad, just nothing stood out.\n\none dish that did stand out was the honey garlic <mark>Charbroiled <mark>Roasted Mandarin <mark>Honey & Garlic Pork Chop</mark></mark></mark>. i don't know if these are vietnamese or chinese or what, but they are some of the best food i've had at an asian restaurant. so tasty!\n\nall in all, with the exception of slow service i don't have any major complaints for pho kim long. i'll continue to go there, just usually late night because during the day i feel like there are better options.", 
            "this place always seems to hit all the right spots when i want some good vietnamese food. we ordered some pho and <mark>Mongolian Beef</mark> and both were good. i was expecting some bamboo shoots in my <mark>Mongolian Beef</mark>, but it was missing. other than that, the food was good and i had leftovers from the beef dish- it was good enough to feed 2... or maybe even 3.\n\ni'll probably come here the next time i am in town and want some pho.", 
            "the <mark>Mongolian Beef</mark> is amazeballs and the lettuce wrap <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark>! a good place to eat after a long night of partying lol", 
            "we came here at around 3 am...\n\n2 stars for being open late... but everything else was a disappointment.  we got the <mark>Mongolian Beef</mark> (beef was chewy and often times not even able to be swallowed).  won ton egg <mark>Spicy <mark>Special Combination Tender Beef <mark><mark>Rare Steak & Brisket <mark>Rare Steak & Well-Done Flank <mark>Beef Ball <mark>Chicken <mark>Shrimp <mark>Plain <mark>Seafood <mark>Wonton <mark>Beef Stew <mark>Special Combination Rice Noodle or Egg Noodle</mark></mark></mark></mark> Soup</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> (broth was okay, but the wontons seemed undercooked and had an odd flavor, and the noodles were kind of hard and undercooked...) the chicken <mark>Mixed Vegetable <mark>Chicken <mark>Beef <mark>B.B.Q Pork <mark>Shrimp <mark>Yang Chow <mark>House Special <mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> was slightly better... but the egg was an alarming shade of orange and the rice tasted bland and pretty flavorless.. with very small pieces of chicken. \n\nwe were hoping for better, but unfortunately we left disappointed with out eating much of the food we had ordered.", 
            "the vegan ph\\u00f5 soup is fantastic. japanese stir fried udon is a must don't miss out on this. top it off with some <mark>Mongolian Beef</mark> with <mark>Brown rice</mark> and you are good to go. bathroom is not a good place to be at. the dude has one glove on and rocks away with the same towel all surfaces. let's hope my immune system can battle whatever bacteria makes it to their kitchen.", 
            "i'm definitely a fan of pho kim long!\n\nthe fact that the restaurant is open 25/7 alone gives it brownie points as you never know what time of the day you'll be craving pho. \n\nit's a pretty popular place on the strip, and there is a wait whether you go for sunday lunch or for late night drunk munchies during the weekend. the good thing is that the waits are never usually that long; service is quick and efficient. \n\nmy go to items: \n- <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark>; comes with a dipping <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sweet & Sour <mark>Kung Pao <mark>Fish Fillet</mark></mark></mark> <mark>Sauteed Oysters <mark>Sauteed Beef <mark>Sauteed Chicken with Black Bean Sauce</mark></mark></mark></mark>, lettuce to wrap the <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> in, and pickled veggies to top it off \n- pho with brisket only; tender and delicious\n\ni've also tried and enjoyed:\n- rice vermicelli with <mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> <mark>Singapore Noodles with Shrimp or Pork</mark> + <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark>; <mark>Seafood <mark>Wonton <mark>Beef Stew <mark>Special Combination Rice Noodle or Egg Noodle</mark></mark></mark></mark> topped with fresh chopped lettuce, fresh veggies, charbroiled meat and sliced <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark>, also comes <mark>Sauteed <mark>Sweet & Sour <mark>Kung Pao <mark>Fish Fillet</mark></mark></mark> <mark>Sauteed Oysters <mark>Sauteed Beef <mark>Sauteed Chicken with Black Bean Sauce</mark></mark></mark></mark> to add in\n- <mark>Crispy Calamari</mark>; salt and pepper, very flavorful, comes with a mozzarella dipping sauce\n- <mark>Mongolian Beef</mark>; add spice to your liking, very tasty and comes with white or <mark>Brown rice</mark>\n \npho kim long is convenient and a restaurant my friends and i go to at least once a month. fast service, good prices, and filling dishes!", 
            "full disclosure, i am a repeat customer here ... often. there's always a line, no matter what time you come but they move people in quickly. service is always prompt and polite. \n\ni absolutely love their <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark> - the ingredients are always fresh. i'm aware that this place is more fusion - it's not the most authentic vietnamese, but it's a solid chinese / vietnamese fusion restaurant with strong dishes. great <mark>Mongolian Beef</mark>, pho, crispy pork, fresh veggies. \n\nthe price is right and the portion are huge.",

            "some of my brother's vietnamese friends eat pho for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  there are lots of pho places around vegas where he lives, so when he wants  this even at midnight, pho kim long is his go to place. they also make some decent chinese food. some of the tables around us had your usual <mark><mark><mark><mark><mark>House Special Pan Fried Noodles</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>, whole fried fish, and sweet and <mark>Sweet & Sour Pork</mark>.  but most people had pho. \n\nalthough more salty than i personally like, the simple broth and noodles has a light, nice aroma served in a large bowl.  add meat, like rare steak slices, along with some condiments, like basil, bean sprouts, and onions ($7), it was an awesome meal in itself.  i was going to order the same thing, but for the same price, you can get a half rotisserie small chicken with rice.  it was crispy on the outside, and moist and tender on the inside ($7). so simple, yet so good.\n\ncustomers are mostly families during the day till early evening.  after that, they're the winners and mostly losers from the casinos, and sobering drunken clubbers and night shift workers. the inside is comofrtable and nicely appointed with ample booths or tables. during lunch dinner. no matter what day, it is crowded.  finding a parking spot, however, is a war of patience and luck.  fortunately, a guy was pulling out just as we walked inside, so we didn't have to exhibit our type a parking lot ninja tactics. while waiting to be seated, i enjoyed their relaxing goldfish tanks. \n\nthis place is so typical vegas with a vietnamese and chinese twist. i'd go back to try a few more dishes.  service was good, prompt with the soda ($2) refills and special requests, and making sure all was ok.", 
            "pho kim long is delicious chinese/vietnamese food. i've been wanting to try this place out for a pho kim long time (har har :p), and i finally made it! came here late night after a mingling event that didn't have enough food. so we decided to pig out here.  \n\nsince we came here so late, we opted for dishes that weren't so carb heavy, which meant more of the chinese dishes (ie no pho, rice, or vermicelli). we ordered the chicken lettuce wrap appetizer, crispy <mark>Sweet & Sour Pork</mark> ribs, and ong choy with <mark>Mapo Tofu Szechuan Bean Curd</mark> sauce. i have to admit i was a bit hesitant because with \"pho\" in the title, i'd assume you'd have to get a bowl of noodles or at least something vietnamese to get the best food. and all 3 dishes we ordered were chinese. yet they were all surprisingly good. \n\nthe chicken lettuce wrap - the chicken saute was very well seasoned. it wasn't served the authentic way with little bowls of sauces and green onion. but it was still very tasty. only con is that the portion is much smaller than what you'd usually get at a chinese restaurant.\n\nthe pork dish - i was most surprised with this one. this is a classic cantonese dish, and it's so easy to mess up by using bad meat. but here the meat tasted fresh and was thinly cut (that's a good thing) with very little fat. the flavors were amazing. sweet sauce. crispy pork. i loved it.\n\nthe vegetable dish - ong choy is also known as chinese spinach or chinese watercress. it was prepared the cantonese way, ie with a <mark>Mapo Tofu Szechuan Bean Curd</mark> sauce. nothing out of the world - tasted like what i would expect ong choy to taste like. \n\nthe wait staff are very nice. the food came out suspiciously fast. it was crazy how quickly it came out as soon as we ordered. and yet the dishes were delicious. the venue is busy and happening at all times of the day it seems, and there's ample seating. every time i've passed by here, the restaurant has always had people in it. my only con is that the dishes are somewhat expensive. you can easily get all 3 dishes we ordered here in socal for roughly $20-30, but here it was $40. the food is good though, and they're open late. i'd come here again. but most likely not for another pho kim long time. okay, i know i probably killed it the first time. :p"

            "everytime i'm in vegas and i want pho i come here. but it's weird cuz i don't eat the pho. i usually come here when i'm about to leave vegas and don't eat the pho because i don't want to stop on the way home (to oc) so i get non-water based food. \n\nlast time i got the vermicilli with meat & <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark>. it was okay, i had better ones. i didn't like how they put the americanized bag salad as the veggies in the dish. then the last weekend i got the rice & <mark>Charbroiled <mark>Roasted Mandarin <mark>Honey & Garlic Pork Chop</mark></mark></mark>. the <mark>Charbroiled <mark>Roasted Mandarin <mark>Honey & Garlic Pork Chop</mark></mark></mark> tasted weird, it had this nasty taste after only on the sides and the part with the fat. it was not a good pork dish. ugh. they also put that fake american salad on the side and not like a real lettuce & cucumber like the real pho places in california.\n\nanyways, i heard the pho was good, so come here for pho and not the rice dishes or the vermicilli.", 
            "wow, i just read a review that told me to read the name of the restaurant fast. pho-kim-long. hahahaha, never noticed that! \n\nbut hands down, they have the best best best <mark>Charbroiled <mark>Roasted Mandarin <mark>Honey & Garlic Pork Chop</mark></mark></mark> over rice. hands down no kidding.\n\nall my friends and i still talk about that damn <mark>Charbroiled <mark>Roasted Mandarin <mark>Honey & Garlic Pork Chop</mark></mark></mark> over rice now. we go to vegas to party, but that <mark>Charbroiled <mark>Roasted Mandarin <mark>Honey & Garlic Pork Chop</mark></mark></mark>.... i cannot wait to go to vegas again to eat at pho kim long's. \n\np.s. best drunk food, best hungover food, best sober food. \n\np.p.s. if only they delivered to our hotel, i would give them a fatty tip.", 
            "pho kim long deserves a four star rating!!!  it really hits the spot and never fails to fill your cravings because it's open 24hrs.  the convenience and price of the food is truly what makes up for my rating!!  i'd give it a 5, only sometimes the food isn't always consistent and service is just alright (although i don't expect much from a place with such inexpensive food).  \n\nanyway, the food i usually eat is pho tai with the steak on the side.  squeeze in some lime and you're good to go.  i also really like the stir fried beef cubes with seasoned rice.  that dish is always on point.  the grilled <mark>Charbroiled <mark>Roasted Mandarin <mark>Honey & Garlic Pork Chop</mark></mark></mark> is something i used to always get, but i've noticed that this dish is sometimes poorly prepared (undercooked) so i rarely ever get this anymore.  <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark> you can't really go wrong with and the <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark> are pretty yum too.  that is the extent of my menu knowledge, but i have also tried the  <mark>Mongolian Beef</mark>, walnut prawns and some of their vermicelli dishes through my friends.  \n\none thing i always get here is the pineapple shake!! yum!  i've tried their other shakes and noticed them to be a tad bit powdery or artificial tasting.  the pineapple and avocado shakes are the only ones made <mark>Three Flavored Bean With Coconut Milk</mark> and fresh fruit, i think, and that's how i like it!!! i'd def recommend you try it.", 
            "i know there is a lot of mixed reviews of this place on yelp but, i really liked it and i am a big pho fan. i guess i need to keep looking arround to compare. since i my only comparison since moving here is that crap at treasure island.  but, for now you 4 stars. the <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark> and <mark>Thai Tea</mark> were bad though. however the deep fried <mark>Charbroiled <mark>Roasted Mandarin <mark>Honey & Garlic Pork Chop</mark></mark></mark> were pretty decent.",

(i love tripe,espicially with my pho) i also ordered the <mark>Charbroiled <mark>Roasted Mandarin <mark>Honey & Garlic Pork Chop</mark></mark></mark> over rice to go, i asked the waiter if they could add 2 sunnyside up eggs with my order, waiter responded with \"we dont have eggs\". wtf??? no eggs?? all the pho places ive been to have tripe and eggs i dont know why this place doesnt. overall i enjoyed my meal.",

            "my friends and i came to pho kim long to eat dinner around 8pm. upon first impressions, i liked the decor of the restaurant. it was nicely decorated and roomy. we were also seated immediately. we all sat down, thought about what we wanted to order... 10 minutes had gone by after we were seated and no one came up to us to ask us what we wanted to drink. a couple of minutes later, an older gentleman took our orders. my friend and i both ordered pho dat biet (special combination tender <mark>Spicy <mark>Special Combination Tender Beef <mark><mark>Rare Steak & Brisket <mark>Rare Steak & Well-Done Flank <mark>Beef Ball <mark>Chicken <mark>Shrimp <mark>Plain <mark>Seafood <mark>Wonton <mark>Beef Stew <mark>Special Combination Rice Noodle or Egg Noodle</mark></mark></mark></mark> Soup</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>, $8.75), my boyfriend ordered half of the ga chien gion (<mark>Deep Fried Chicken</mark> with fried garlic, $13.95 for half chicken), and my other friend ordered com chien tom (shrimp <mark>Mixed Vegetable <mark>Chicken <mark>Beef <mark>B.B.Q Pork <mark>Shrimp <mark>Yang Chow <mark>House Special <mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>, $11.50). \n\nhere came the most disappointing part. i'm not exaggerating when i say that 30 minutes had literally gone by before the first dish came out, and that was my boyfriend's <mark>Deep Fried Chicken</mark> dish. i thought that this dish was pretty good. it wasn't too salty and i loved the fried garlic. do note that this dish didn't come with rice so you would need to order it on the side. at this point, i'm starting to look around the room hoping to catch the attention of the workers to see if they had brought out our dishes. 5 minutes after the <mark>Deep Fried Chicken</mark> came out, both of the pho dat biet came out. honestly, i didn't think that it was too good. the broth wasn't anything spectacular and for the \"special\" bowl of pho that we ordered, there was barely any beef, tripe, tendon, and all the other components that goes in the special. \n\nat this point, my other friend who had ordered such a simple dish of <mark>Mixed Vegetable <mark>Chicken <mark>Beef <mark>B.B.Q Pork <mark>Shrimp <mark>Yang Chow <mark>House Special <mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> still has not received has order. we started trying to track down the employees and finally managed to spoke to one about how we haven't received the last dish of <mark>Mixed Vegetable <mark>Chicken <mark>Beef <mark>B.B.Q Pork <mark>Shrimp <mark>Yang Chow <mark>House Special <mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>. there was a couple who was sitting nearby us, who were seated way after we were seated and had managed to receive their food order before we even got ours! and how is it that the <mark>Mixed Vegetable <mark>Chicken <mark>Beef <mark>B.B.Q Pork <mark>Shrimp <mark>Yang Chow <mark>House Special <mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> would be the last dish to come out? makes no sense to me.... so about 10 minutes after both of the pho dishes came out, my friend's <mark>Mixed Vegetable <mark>Chicken <mark>Beef <mark>B.B.Q Pork <mark>Shrimp <mark>Yang Chow <mark>House Special <mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> finally came out. it didn't look too appealing either... he also mentioned that some of the parts in his <mark>Mixed Vegetable <mark>Chicken <mark>Beef <mark>B.B.Q Pork <mark>Shrimp <mark>Yang Chow <mark>House Special <mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> were cold and not warm at all...\n\ni don't know what happened with our order honestly. pho kim long is open 24 hours, which is great for people who want to grab a late meal after edc, clubbing, etc ;]. since vegas is the city that never sleeps, i'm sure many people there appreciate how late pho kim long is opened. it's possible that at night, they don't have as many cooks in the kitchen or they simply forgot our order... who knows! i most likely wouldn't visit pho kim long to eat again unless i desperately needed some soup or pho late at night!",

            "i don't like being negative, but i don't mind telling the truth. the most mediocre pho i've ever had. and some of the crappiest service around...unless you're asian. \n\ni absolutely dislike saying this, but it was so clearly apparent. our waiter was a jerk! in the entire restaurant, there was only our table and one other table that wasn't asian. both tables were neglected and weren't even given chopsticks. come on!!! white people can't use chopsticks? \n\nour waiter also forgot my sister in laws noodles and two beverages. how do you just forget an order that you wrote down? \n\nand my beef pho wasn't very flavorful and the beef was nearly inedible. it was so fatty and chewy. but, it was inexpensive. $7-something and came with add-ins. like jalape\\u00f1os, basil and mung beans. there's also house made sauces and spicy <mark>Stir-fried Cube Cut Steak <mark>Sauteed Chicken in Black Pepper Sauce</mark></mark> like sriracha. \n\nand i guess you need to go stupid early, because a) parking is a nightmare and b) there's a 6 p.m. dinner rush which means you will be smushed in the doorway with a bunch of grumpy people for an hour. \n\nit's also open 24 hours and located within las vegas's china town. \n\nall in all...i'm not recommending this place if you want good pho or if you're not asian? i totally don't understand the reviews. because apparently the clueless white folks are getting the crappy scraps or something."

            "the real deal...it's my \"lotus of siam\" of vietnamese food...(at least here in vegas...)\n\nmy husband, the chef, eats here weekly with the boys from the kitchen and a few chef buddies from around town...they always sit in ben's section - he makes great recommendations when chef is feeling like having more than #11 (pho) and some <mark>Orange Chicken</mark> (hey it's usually 2am so he's entitled to be a creature of habit of sorts...).  since i work more normal hours, i rarely meet him -- but when i can, it's always a treat...\n\nlast night, since i had the day off today, we went -- and it was yummy!  \n\nben was there and in addition to my usual can't miss dish (the salt and pepper calamari -- with jalapeno, green onions and crispy garlic), he suggested the vietnamese salad with chicken -- it was brilliant!  crispy cabbage, crunchy crushed peanuts, fried shallot rings, crispy garlic , tender pulled chicken, cilantro and a miso/ginger dressing that was perfect -- i love salads that are balanced in flavor, texture and acidity... he said they make it with duck, beef, shrimp, calamari, just about every protein they have in house...  \n\nthen he suggested we try the lamb -- i know...lamb at pho?  it was phenomenal -- tender lamb chops with chinese spices, grilled to medium rare...over a cold, crispy romaine salad -- again another great dressing -- not sure about ingredients in this one though...\n\nthen he told us they had venison...but by the time he got back <mark>Stir-fried String Beans <mark>Sauteed Calamari with Spicy XO Sauce</mark></mark> it was 86d, so he ordered the beef for us.  out came a large, smoking hot black river rock -- a plate of sliced beef, with chunks of butter and limes.   he melted the butter on the stone, then put the beef on it and we cooked it to our degree of doneness -- squeeze of lime -- a dip in the sauce, and it was tender and delicious and took seconds.   that rock wasn't going to cool down anytime soon...\n\nlast night, the <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark> weren't that great, and the dumplings were tough -- so i'll avoid them next time.  hey, i can't eat everything...so it's fine with me -- but i'm still looking for vegas' best <mark>Pan Fried Pot Stickers (8)</mark>... \n\nbut for a chef to come, and when he's in the mood, for the experience to be totally different -- that many think is just same ol, same ol --  and for us to be treated like royalty (uh, we're not asian...), is a real treat.  \n\ni've been in a few times by myself for a quick lunch -- and they always remember me.  it's nice because i'm not the kind of regular that i'd love to be...", 
            "i've been craving pho, because i've had a killer cold for a week.  my friend suggested vietnamese food, so i thought of pho kim long.  i'm so glad we came here.\n\nmy first time here was w/ susan r. and it was sort of an unsavory experience, not because of the company or the food, but because a certain a-hole that we both had the displeasure of knowing was the main topic of conversation, anyways, that's neither here nor there...\n\nthe pho is great! my friend ordered the <mark>Orange Chicken</mark> and the scallops with black <mark>Stir-fried Ong Choy with Preserved Bean Curd Sauce</mark>.  i love the fresh ingredients in vietnamese cooking, it really adds a distinct taste that sets it apart from chinese food.  if you're gonna do vietnamese, go to pho kim long, i highly recommend it!",

            "best asian restaurant in vegas.  a mix of a lot of different asian cuisines.  everything i have had here is excellent.  it's my wife's favorite spot for pho.  you can't go wrong with anything on the menu. \n\nthe pho has such a great flavorful broth.  the <mark>Crispy Calamari</mark> was fresh and delicious, just a little greasy.  the <mark>Chicken Lettuce Wraps</mark> were spot on.   the <mark>Beijing Beef</mark> is awesome and the <mark>Orange Chicken</mark> is the best i've ever had.   my sister ordered the half <mark>Deep Fried Chicken</mark>, delicious.  \n\nthe servers are always fast and on time.  food is always served very quick, you really never have to wait for anything. \n\nwill always return.", 
            "love pho! especially after drinking lol \n\ni came here completely sober though and the food didn't wow me.. the one thing that was impressive was their speed!  i swear food came out within 5 mins after we ordered! sometimes i wonder what they do in the back... best not to know, right? lol \n\nwe ordered <mark>Mixed Vegetable <mark>Chicken <mark>Beef <mark>B.B.Q Pork <mark>Shrimp <mark>Yang Chow <mark>House Special <mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>, some <mark>Orange Chicken</mark> and pho-- funny thing, the pho came out last.  you think they would bring that out first since it requires barely any work to prepare.\n\nanyway, the pho was decent-- it hit the spot alright.  but portion wise is a little small... i mean for $7 bucks, you can't expect too much-- it was enough food for little o me, i don't know about anybody else though.\n\ni have my doubts about how authentic this place is.. seems like it's more of a chinese restaurant than a pho joint-- anywho, as long as i got my pho sometime after drinking, i'm happy :)", 
            "pho kim long is pho kim wrong. \ni didn't come for the pho. we had the <mark>Orange Chicken</mark> and the black bean beef. both orders including the rice disappointed.\n\nthe black bean beef was the better of the two dishes. the meat was chewy which i do not enjoy. there was about 5 tablespoons of oil at the bottom of the plate. too greasy for me. \n\nthe <mark>Orange Chicken</mark> looks delicious until you try to eat it. some of the pieces of chicken had a really consistency. it's hard to describe. i'm scared it wasn't chicken at all. it was like no chicken i've ever had. maybe it was old or frost bitten. the texture was not chicken. i could not get my around eating it at all. \n\nrice. how do you mess up rice?  the white rice was over cooked and somewhat mushy. the <mark>Brown rice</mark> was undercooked and hard. \n\nservice was initially very fast but we had to wait forever for our bill.   i was there on a saturday night around 12a and the wait was short. \n\nwith all the places vegas has to offer. i would never go back to this dump.", 
            "ugghhh. oh my! this place was alright the first two times and especially because of the take-out order i made the other day, i decided to come back. it was pretty busy, like how it usually is, so i waited. the host barely even noticed me. he didn't notice me until i asked him for an order to-go... anyhow, i barely even got to look at the menu he handed me and he already asked me what i wanted, so i just basically ordered what i ordered last time which was chicken chow fun for me and <mark>Orange Chicken</mark> with a side of rice for my boyfriend... it took a while, but it was fine, whatever, because it's busy. i went back to the front to wait for my food and like 10 minutes later, the same host who helped me asked me if i had been helped... -_- anyways, i paid right when the host gave me the receipt, but when my food came out, he brought me back to the cash register and tried to have me pay again. luckily one of the workers there saw that i paid and said that it was okay.\ni finally took the food home and what do you know?! there is hair in the <mark>Orange Chicken</mark>... long black hair. not just one, but two strands... and maybe more. but i just threw the food away... blahhh, i'm so disappointed. this is not ok. i tipped too (because i usually always tip) but this is unacceptable!", 
            "best late night asian dining in vegas, for sure. the pho and other traditional vietnamese food is great, but surprisingly their <mark>Orange Chicken</mark> is also fantastic. i know, i know. you're going to chastise me for ordering american chinese food at a vietnamese restaurant, but it's something you have to taste to believe. add a little hois<mark>Braised Scallops in Hot Chili Sauce</mark> and you're off to flavor country.", 
            "this place is always crowded and the parking sucks. there is even traffic in the parking lot so good luck. i went here one time when i first arrived in vegas and haven't been again which now i have been here a year and a half. the food is average. nothing special that i haven't had elsewhere. i have lived various places and the pho doesn't taste unique or anything. good but taste the same as others. my kids had the <mark>Orange Chicken</mark> which they didn't really like. it was probably good but they are kids. the <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark> and crab ragoons are great. it is nice that it is open 24 hours. i have a pho place near me so i doubt i would drive all the way cross town for something i can get near me that taste the same. all in all a great pho place especially since it is 2\n4 hours so it's perfect for late night cravings. it is a little fancier than your average pho place and bigger, too. so maybe if you have guest from out of town, it maybe worth it. they have a good selection of foods. can't complain too much there.", 
            "came here for the 1st time a few weeks ago and have been back many times since then. the <mark>Orange Chicken</mark>, <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark>, crab wontons, and <mark>Mongolian Beef</mark> are some of my favorite dishes. food comes out hot, fresh and quick. the fact that it's open 24/7 is amazing and convient. i always order my food to go so i have not had the chance to review the dining service. food is a+, as a local that works at a casino i would 100 % suggest this place to my guests.", 
            "i always get the <mark>Crab Rangoons (8)</mark>, amazing!! they are open 24 hours which makes this the best spot to go when you are tipsy and looking to binge on some yummy food. i have never waited longer than 5-10 minutes to be seated even if i have a large group. it is always busy, but still the service stays consistent and fast. sure, the guy may be a tad short when they take your order but he is busting his ass! i love the atmosphere, it is very clean as well. i usually try to do something different every time. i tried the drunken noodle last night, not my usual taste but none the less delicious! and made perfectly. the combination <mark>Mixed Vegetable <mark>Chicken <mark>Beef <mark>B.B.Q Pork <mark>Shrimp <mark>Yang Chow <mark>House Special <mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> is deadly, you will want to eat a whole family size portion if you try!! my boyfriend usually gets the <mark>Orange Chicken</mark> which is super good too. i've been here at least ten times and it never disappoints me. so many choices on the menu, and they're all good. :)"

            "for all you perverted minded (all of us) let's get it out of our system first and snicker & smirk it off!  whether you pronounce it correctly or not...it all sounds alike. \"pho kim long\" ... yup that's the name of this fine restaurant.  don't let the name fool you though.  the place has since been remodeled a while back with simple yet beautiful decor & backdrops that really make a difference and give you an ethnic feel to your vietnamese dining experience.  whenever one feels the crave for some luscious pho, this place will do justice.  they open early and close late practically open 24 hours...this place is great for lunch with family, a dinner date for two or a cure for your late night hang overs with friends.  in fact pho kim long is great anytime to fill your tummy to satisfaction.  \n\nthis place can get packed, especially on a weekend at peak hours...so be prepared for the crowd.  a downfall to this is their small waiting area up front.  with very little seating and standing area, this can be and is a fire hazard. but when this happens you know they must be doing something right...to have such an audience of hungry on goers wait amongst each other.  \n\nwhen you do get seated, be excited for once you decide what to order, the food is prepared quick and comes right out.  my favorite pho here is the combination.  this comes with chewy yet tender tendon that melts right when you chew, also has your usual thin sliced flank raw meat & other goodness...the broth is very soothing and comes packed with flavor.  their salt & pepper calamari is scrumptious, but eat it fresh and hot as it will get soggy after a while...but still a yummy snack even after.  for those non-pho phonatics...they do have rice and other dishes to get your palates tainted with flavor....from pork, to beef, to fish, to even <mark>Pad Thai Noodles</mark>...they par up pretty well.  my favorite dessert drink here is their avocado shake smoothie with tapioca boba!  they must have atleast 100 pieces of boba....sounds like fillers...but they do give a generous amount of avocado shake in it.  you can also request the shake without boba.\n\nall in all...i may be too generous giving this place a high rating with 5 stars.  others would disagree with me, as i can understand...i should be giving it only 4 stars because of the waiting area (but only an issue when it is packed) and also because prices here tend to be just a tad bit higher than some close rivals that are side by side comparable in quality,  i do give it 5 stars though because for some reason...i still keep coming back here for more ... rather than 2 others who are in my top 3 of pho places in las vegas.\n\ndon't forget, you can also take out! and pho kim long is very generous <mark><mark>Braised Catfish in Clay Pot</mark> <mark>Braised Catfish in Clay Pot</mark></mark>!  you may pay a dollar or 2 more, but the portions are respectable and they wont rip you off like some other places:\n **cough-cough(pho rose)cough-cough**",

            "most well known pho place i know of. all of my friends have at least been here once, i've been here multiple times late at night, and even for lunch. i've experienced pho at many other restuarants and can say pho kim long is just about average.  \n\nmy most recent visit was yesterday. as it was hot, i didn't feel like ordering something too hot like a soup or rather pho. i wasn't too hungry either, so i ordered pan friend udon, yes i know, a pho place wouldn't specialize in it, but another place i've been to had superb udon.\n\nit was around 3pm when i arrived and there was a good amount of people. glad to see they're still getting service. i walked in and it took me 10 minutes just to get seated. like i said there was a good amount of people, it wasn't packed or very busy. once i got a table i browsed the menu, already knowing what i wanted, udon. i eye'd the waiter down or rather signaled him to come over and he looked away, but he did eventually come around after 15 minutes of waiting. i ordered my chicken pan fried udon and he went on his merry way. \n\nthe order came faster than i expected took about 3 to 5 minutes aha. not bad. i tasted my first mouthfull. not bad, but not good either. it was very tasteless. i put some sauce on there, it made it better but i could still taste that blandness in the noodles. nearing the end of the dish, i noticed a lot of bean sprouts leftover. i like beansprouts and i tend to eat those first but there was still a lot and it watered down the sauce so much that it just tasted like water after eating most of the udon.\n\nagain, i suppose having udon at a pho place isn't ideal, but i wasn't feeling up to having a <mark>Hot & <mark>Catfish or Shrimp (with Head) Sour Soup</mark></mark> on a hot noon day. perhaps at dinner? \n\nthis was an average day, i was full after eating, but wasn't satisfied with how it tasted. eat anything but the udon!",

            "i am a fan. and this is why. the pho may not be the best you've ever tasted, but its pretty damn good. i mean really how many ways is there to make pho? had the beef tendon pho, it hit the spot. aside from the pho, they're ong choy (water spinach) was sauteed well, great sauce. fried calamari, was probably the best i have had, i couldnt stop eating it. and the roast duck had a lot of flavor, and you could tell it was made fresh, not re-heated. i can't seem to get a grasp on what type of sauce it was. the <mark>Salted Fish</mark> <mark>Mixed Vegetable <mark>Chicken <mark>Beef <mark>B.B.Q Pork <mark>Shrimp <mark>Yang Chow <mark>House Special <mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> was also flavor, and you could actually taste the <mark>Salted Fish</mark> unlike other places (sam woo). these items are some of the same dishes i get at several asian restaurants just to compare, and the version here are right up there to one of the best i have had. \n\njust to comment on people talking about service and such, i don't mean to be harsh, or offend the asian culture, because i consider myself asian myself. but the bad service? first these types of places is not a pf changs or a pei wei. they're not here to ask you how your day is going. they're just not, some of them don't even speak english. yes when they bring out the food to you, sometimes they rush, or kind of pack all the dishes on the table, looking like they slam the plates on it., theyre a little rough and maybe your oolong tea spills a little from your cup. you know what thats a sign of? that it's authentic. some of the best places i have eaten at in california were like this. actually my favorite place back home, was like this, won't exactly strike you as fine dining and not the most polite servers but best food hands down. i once went to a place in san francisco, where you had to go down they're basement to go to the bathroom, a little scary, but what shocked me more was how good they're food was", 
            "this place is always packed! i guess that's a good sign that the food is good, but not so good when you are hungry!!!! quic tip: if it's packed, and you don't want to wait for a table, you can order your food to go, it's faster! also you can even call ahead and they can have your order ready for you by the time you get there. oh and if you are planning to go there on sunday for dinner, be prepared to wait!  i always recommend this place to out of town friends who are looking for after hours grub, especially after drinking... and they never fail to impress. i think that they are a little bit pricey for a vietnamese restaurant, and the customer service could be a bit better on some days, especially when packed... but overall, i still like going here. my fave dishes are the grilled <mark>Charbroiled <mark>Roasted Mandarin <mark>Honey & Garlic Pork Chop</mark></mark></mark>, <mark>Salted Fish</mark> <mark>Mixed Vegetable <mark>Chicken <mark>Beef <mark>B.B.Q Pork <mark>Shrimp <mark>Yang Chow <mark>House Special <mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>, calamari and wonton <mark>Spicy <mark>Special Combination Tender Beef <mark><mark>Rare Steak & Brisket <mark>Rare Steak & Well-Done Flank <mark>Beef Ball <mark>Chicken <mark>Shrimp <mark>Plain <mark>Seafood <mark>Wonton <mark>Beef Stew <mark>Special Combination Rice Noodle or Egg Noodle</mark></mark></mark></mark> Soup</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>."

            "what an awesome name!\n\nokay, first off... as a teenager, i lived in san jose ca - a city which has a ton of vietnamese gangsters... and since i was always looking to get \"hookups\" on car parts, i ended up meeting and befriending alot of the aforementioned vietnamese gangsters. those guys always used to take me to the best pho spots, so i'm no pho newbie.\n\ni decided to try out pho kim long with one of my boys right before he got married in vegas, because it was quick, inexpensive, and let's face it, the name of the restaurant is awesome! funny as hell!\n\nafter taking some quick myspace pics by the sign outside, we ventured in the restaurant and ordered our food. my homie ordered pho dac biet, and i ordered pho tai, which is my favorite because i love the thin, rare, red slices of steak (tai) that they throw on top of your steaming soup with hot <mark>Seafood <mark>Wonton <mark>Beef Stew <mark>Special Combination Rice Noodle or Egg Noodle</mark></mark></mark></mark>. \n\nas we waited for our food, i did my standard vietnamese restaurant ritual of thoroughly wiping down my chopsticks and little condiment dishes with hot tea and napkins. you can never be too careful, especially since pho kim long is located conveniently next to a platform shoes store for strippers.\n\nthe service was pretty good, i appreciated the fact that the waiter made an extra effort to hold our pho bowls on the outside! =) i've been to pho places before where they grab the bowl with their thumb on top, and the other fingers below the bowl... but i hate that, cause the soup splashes around, and the waiter's thumb often times goes into the soup! aw heyllll no!\n\nthe broth at pho kim long was just \"aiight\" but i guess not bad for las vegas... i dont expect vegas to have top quality pho anyways. let's face it, people go to vegas for buffets, gambling, parties, drinking, lap dances, and drive through weddings. not pho. \n\nso i'm rating pkl (fhl hehe) with 4 stars. cause i think it ain't bad for vegas, and at least the guy's thumb didn't go into my soup. good lookin out homie.", 
            "\"crawfish\" is a new addition to pho kim long, and that's what brought me here in the first place.  they only started offering this shellfish in june, weekends only.\n\nmy luck that the sunday i choose to come in, they weren't offering it. we still sat down for dinner and this is what we got: \n\n* hu tieu hoac mi bo kho (<mark>Beef Stew</mark> <mark>Seafood <mark>Wonton <mark>Beef Stew <mark>Special Combination Rice Noodle or Egg Noodle</mark></mark></mark></mark>) - $7.95: the big f enjoyed his <mark>Spicy <mark>Special Combination Tender Beef <mark><mark>Rare Steak & Brisket <mark>Rare Steak & Well-Done Flank <mark>Beef Ball <mark>Chicken <mark>Shrimp <mark>Plain <mark>Seafood <mark>Wonton <mark>Beef Stew <mark>Special Combination Rice Noodle or Egg Noodle</mark></mark></mark></mark> Soup</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>.  i was too busy with my plate to eat much of his.\n\n* dau dua xao <mark>Stir-fried String Beans <mark>Sauteed Calamari with Spicy XO Sauce</mark></mark> (stir fried <mark>Stir-fried String Beans <mark>Sauteed Calamari with Spicy XO Sauce</mark></mark>) - $9.95: tasty string beans, a bit on the pricey side though.  a nice spice kick as well.\n\n* com ga hai nam (hai nam style chicken with seasoned rice) $8.50: i've always liked hainamese chicken since my friend's mom made it for me, along with the seasoned rice.  it's good here, but definitely not as good as my friend's mom's version.\n\npho kim long ii is a huge restaurant with lots of big tables for large parties.  a great place for families to eat and friends to gather after a late night.  their menu is pretty extensive so there's plenty of choices for everyone.  and portions seem pretty decent-sized too.  (i wish they would get a bigger fish tank though because there are way too many fish in that tiny thing up front!)\n\nfrom this experience, i give it a four stars.\n\ni love hot n juicy crawfish up the road, and i definitely believe in some healthy competition.  so, last friday we decided to finally check out their crawfish and see if it's worthy.\n\nwe decided to start off with two pounds and see where we went for there.     we noticed a neighboring table with their order of crawfish and was definitely excited.  it came in a large bowl with red potatoes, corn on the cob and sausage.  they also brought extra bowls for the shells and a plate for us to eat on.  the big f requested limes, salt and pepper to make a dipping concoction.\n\ni dove right in and noticed the big difference...the crawfish was not fresh.  it was old or way overcooked.  the tail meat didn't come off the shell easily and was broken up.  i thought it was just the first one and continued eating.  unfortunately, this wasn't the case.  there was little to no head juice either, which was very disappointing to me.  the big f was easily disgusted with the crawfish and we were glad that we only ordered two pounds to start.  (we usually go for two pounds each!)  the corn, potatoes, and sausage were good though, but it didn't make up for the bad crawfish.  since it comes in a bowl, there's no sauce on the bottom for you to dip your crawfish in after you shell it.  no bibs were provided, which explains all the stains on my shirt.\n\nwhen i'm craving crawfish, i'll drive up the road and spring the extra cash over at hot n juicy.\n\nfor this experience, i give it a two stars.\n\noverall, a four stars for their vietnamese food, and a two stars for their bad crawfish.  i'm giving pho kim long ii a three star.\n\n(pics are posted!)",

            "after the inaugural podcast with local artists, the 80's kids, we decided to check out our favorite pho place in the valley!  pkl is a place i've been frequenting since moving to las vegas 6 years ago.  this 24 hour joint offers some of the best pho i've tasted.  on my drive over, my mouth salivated with anticipation for what was about to happen!\n\nit's located on spring mountain and valley view in a super long chinese themed strip mall.  to me, this building signifies the beginning of chinatown.  it says, i have arrived in las vegas' asian scene and makes me feel right at home!  when you get into the restaurant, there's a pretty tight seating area.  the idea, though, is to have a lot for tables for dining.  the place is decked out with different tones of brown, vietnamese and other asian inspired design and art.  statues of elephants and asian soldiers gives an extra accent to the place.  our service was a little sub par.  the server wasn't the most personable.  didn't greet us.  just came over and asked if we were ready to order.  at the end of the night, we literally had to walk up to him to get our check.  thank goodness the food was good...\n\nfor my meal, i always, get number 15:  beef pho <mark>Spicy <mark>Special Combination Tender Beef <mark><mark>Rare Steak & Brisket <mark>Rare Steak & Well-Done Flank <mark>Beef Ball <mark>Chicken <mark>Shrimp <mark>Plain <mark>Seafood <mark>Wonton <mark>Beef Stew <mark>Special Combination Rice Noodle or Egg Noodle</mark></mark></mark></mark> Soup</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> with rare steak and brisket for around $8.  this soup is on point!  the soup is packed with thin strips of brisket and rare steak.  the rareness continued to cook in the warm broth.  the noodles were thin but plentiful.  there was also green onions in the dish, served with bean sprouts, sliced jalapenos and basil stems on the side.  all components offer a different but pleasant texture and flavor.  all seemed to mesh very well together.  but let's talk about the star of the show: the broth.  the broth is what sealed the deal for the dish and real brought a flavorful effect.  it wasn't too salty or overpowering.  it's was just right.  warm and packed with beef flavor.  so good!!!\n\nlisten, if you haven't tried pho kim long yet, you are definitely missing out!  like mentioned before, this joint stays open all night.  great for monsoon season, winter season and after a night at the clubs.  look for the chinese strip mall and stop by!",

            "my friends and i came to pho kim long to eat dinner around 8pm. upon first impressions, i liked the decor of the restaurant. it was nicely decorated and roomy. we were also seated immediately. we all sat down, thought about what we wanted to order... 10 minutes had gone by after we were seated and no one came up to us to ask us what we wanted to drink. a couple of minutes later, an older gentleman took our orders. my friend and i both ordered pho dat biet (special combination tender <mark>Spicy <mark>Special Combination Tender Beef <mark><mark>Rare Steak & Brisket <mark>Rare Steak & Well-Done Flank <mark>Beef Ball <mark>Chicken <mark>Shrimp <mark>Plain <mark>Seafood <mark>Wonton <mark>Beef Stew <mark>Special Combination Rice Noodle or Egg Noodle</mark></mark></mark></mark> Soup</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>, $8.75), my boyfriend ordered half of the ga chien gion (<mark>Deep Fried Chicken</mark> with fried garlic, $13.95 for half chicken), and my other friend ordered com chien tom (shrimp <mark>Mixed Vegetable <mark>Chicken <mark>Beef <mark>B.B.Q Pork <mark>Shrimp <mark>Yang Chow <mark>House Special <mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>, $11.50). \n\nhere came the most disappointing part. i'm not exaggerating when i say that 30 minutes had literally gone by before the first dish came out, and that was my boyfriend's <mark>Deep Fried Chicken</mark> dish. i thought that this dish was pretty good. it wasn't too salty and i loved the fried garlic. do note that this dish didn't come with rice so you would need to order it on the side. at this point, i'm starting to look around the room hoping to catch the attention of the workers to see if they had brought out our dishes. 5 minutes after the <mark>Deep Fried Chicken</mark> came out, both of the pho dat biet came out. honestly, i didn't think that it was too good. the broth wasn't anything spectacular and for the \"special\" bowl of pho that we ordered, there was barely any beef, tripe, tendon, and all the other components that goes in the special. \n\nat this point, my other friend who had ordered such a simple dish of <mark>Mixed Vegetable <mark>Chicken <mark>Beef <mark>B.B.Q Pork <mark>Shrimp <mark>Yang Chow <mark>House Special <mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> still has not received has order. we started trying to track down the employees and finally managed to spoke to one about how we haven't received the last dish of <mark>Mixed Vegetable <mark>Chicken <mark>Beef <mark>B.B.Q Pork <mark>Shrimp <mark>Yang Chow <mark>House Special <mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>. there was a couple who was sitting nearby us, who were seated way after we were seated and had managed to receive their food order before we even got ours! and how is it that the <mark>Mixed Vegetable <mark>Chicken <mark>Beef <mark>B.B.Q Pork <mark>Shrimp <mark>Yang Chow <mark>House Special <mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> would be the last dish to come out? makes no sense to me.... so about 10 minutes after both of the pho dishes came out, my friend's <mark>Mixed Vegetable <mark>Chicken <mark>Beef <mark>B.B.Q Pork <mark>Shrimp <mark>Yang Chow <mark>House Special <mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> finally came out. it didn't look too appealing either... he also mentioned that some of the parts in his <mark>Mixed Vegetable <mark>Chicken <mark>Beef <mark>B.B.Q Pork <mark>Shrimp <mark>Yang Chow <mark>House Special <mark>Fried Rice</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark> were cold and not warm at all...\n\ni don't know what happened with our order honestly. pho kim long is open 24 hours, which is great for people who want to grab a late meal after edc, clubbing, etc ;]. since vegas is the city that never sleeps, i'm sure many people there appreciate how late pho kim long is opened. it's possible that at night, they don't have as many cooks in the kitchen or they simply forgot our order... who knows! i most likely wouldn't visit pho kim long to eat again unless i desperately needed some soup or pho late at night!", 
            "i really wish i didn't have to write this review. but if i don't share this experience, i'm not being true to my yelp self or my fellow yelpers out there. every restaurant has a bad night and i have been going to pho kim long since before moving to las vegas. the service is efficient and the food always delivers, whether you are there at 7pm or 4 in the morning. but recently i had an experience that has put me off of my beloved go-to spot possibly forever. \n\nit all started on a busy friday night around 3am. i had a craving for some pho after work. we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table because they were jam packed, slammed, crazy busy. no problem. i get it. not the end of the world. \nhowever, once we were finally sat all the way in the back in a corner, nobody came to take our order. there were servers, bussers and runners all scurrying around us too busy to even take a beverage order. the first 10 or so minutes i can forgive but when i actively am trying to flag someone down and literally every employee refuses to make eye contact, even i start to get frustrated. we became the table that time forgot. \n\n15 minutes...20 minutes go by.\n25 minutes in and we still don't even have a glass of water. we have now been at pho kim long for a total of 40 minutes with nothing to show for it. but i refuse to be that person who makes a scene and leaves, so i wait it out. \ni finally flag down the guy bussing the table next to ours and he brings us some waters and promises to send the server over. she comes over looking rather (understandably) bedraggled and we very politely put in our order after explaining our situation. she offers no apology and acts as if it's not a big deal. so i'm a little peeved at the lack of reaction. but my pho is on the way and my stomach is growling. \nmy beautiful bowl of soup is placed before me and i turn my attention away from the negative experience and grab my chopsticks. and then i see it...gently floating amongst my <mark>Seafood <mark>Wonton <mark>Beef Stew <mark>Special Combination Rice Noodle or Egg Noodle</mark></mark></mark></mark>, swimming in my delicious broth without a care in the world is...a...\ncockroach. \n\ni stand up, push my bowl away and just point in astonishment and horror. my confused dinner companion sees what i am pointing at and flags down the nearest employee who proceeds to whisk the dish away before i have a chance to gather my wits and take a picture. so now we are both standing at the table trying to figure out what to do. nobody comes back over to inquire about us or make amends. so we look at each other, nod and start walking towards the front door. on the way i find our server and take her aside to calmly explain the entire situation and inform her that we are leaving. and i again get a complete non reaction. no apology, no manager. just an ok and a bewildered stare.\n\ni'm done.", 
            "this is one of my most favorite places here in las vegas. at any given time, this place is always packed - we even had a 20-min wait one time at close to 11pm!  but we endure the wait, which turned out to be not as long as we anticipated. \nmy favorite is their rare steak and <mark>Rare Steak & Brisket <mark>Rare Steak & Well-Done Flank <mark>Beef Ball <mark>Chicken <mark>Shrimp <mark>Plain <mark>Seafood <mark>Wonton <mark>Beef Stew <mark>Special Combination Rice Noodle or Egg Noodle</mark></mark></mark></mark> Soup</mark></mark></mark></mark></mark></mark>. the broth is full of flavor. i've tried a lot of different places around las vegas but no one has broth like they serve here. \ni also like ordering their <mark>Fresh Spring Rolls</mark>. it comes with sides of bean sprouts, mint leaves and lime and you wrap it with lettuce leaves. yummy! \non our latest visit, we ordered the japanese noodles. we keep forgetting to order it every-time we come here and finally this time we remembered it before we were already full. it was really scrumptious. no wonder why almost every table we saw had ordered this as well. \nthe fish stew was also delightful. the fish was tender and not overcooked. it was saut\\u00e9ed with ginger, which gave it a clean flavor. it was so good, i was conflicted whether i wanted to make more room for that or the rare steak pho that i usually order. i ended up eating the former and took the rest of the latter home. \nas for my 4 star rating, as good as their food is, i take away a star bec of their service. the staff isn't very friendly and most of the time, their service is lousy. lousy service won't keep me from coming back to this place though - i would just ignore it and look at my bowl of soup and it completely makes up for it.",

            "just a quick update as i have been there about three times in the past three months!\n\na. parking - no longer easy. the plethora of good / decent places to go like lee's sandwich, fat dumpling, mr. tofu and etc make parking here limited and in high demand. it is nearly difficult to find any parking here, even if you are willing to walk.\n\nb.  reasons - that is because pkl is open 24 hours!  the food is darn decent at times.  \n\nc.  late meals - finished a movie and midnight and came here f<mark>Seafood <mark>Wonton <mark>Beef Stew <mark>Special Combination Rice Noodle or Egg Noodle</mark></mark></mark></mark> on friday night. at 1:00 am, the place was packed.  our team waited only ten minutes for a table in the back room, where it says \" employees only\"  looks to be a room that they will slowly expand into and perhaps was another restaurant before?  \n\nd.  pho - had number 13, which has everything in it and also the bun bo hue with pho noodles instead of <mark>Seafood <mark>Wonton <mark>Beef Stew <mark>Special Combination Rice Noodle or Egg Noodle</mark></mark></mark></mark> (vermicelli).  ok, don't hate that!  i know it is traditional to have bbh with the <mark>Seafood <mark>Wonton <mark>Beef Stew <mark>Special Combination Rice Noodle or Egg Noodle</mark></mark></mark></mark>. it is just that the consistency of the pho noodles is soooooo much better and the texture is amazing. the way the noodles drape over your chopsticks as you shovel a huge portion into your mouth is just what the doctor ordered.  hard to do with the <mark>Seafood <mark>Wonton <mark>Beef Stew <mark>Special Combination Rice Noodle or Egg Noodle</mark></mark></mark></mark> as it is bigger and the consistency is such that you cannot pack a bunch into  your mouth.  hey it is part of the noodle experience if you ask me.  just watch any movie where you watch the japanese salary-men at lunch slurping down a bowl of ramen and i think you will get my drift.  noodles are meant to be hoovered!  \n\ne.  pho part ii - anyway, the bun bo hue at 1:00 am is a very, very good. the broth is just right, they serve the spice separately so you can make the soup as hot as you want.  they serve all the bits of tendon, offal, pork hock and everything you can imagine that was eaten in the city of hue due to well, the poor economy.  i finally learned that offal is the stuff in meats that you cook that most people don't eat.  the offal is awfully good!!! it is what makes the soup.  my son had number 13 which is nearly like bbh without the pork hock and the spice. he slurped that up, but i won because my bbh came first and i had a head start!\n\nf.  the chicken - yep, ordered once again the salted baked chicken with ginger sauce.  why?  because it is so good, nutritious and a very good measure of the chef and the restaurant.  simple to cook, yet easy to over cook, the meat has to be so juicy and tender. it is either that or overcooked as the entire taste is from the chicken itself.  it has to be on the bone, and it has to make you caveman like to use your hands to gnaw at every morsel of meat on the bone!  the ginger onion sauce has to be so good that you are putting it on the chicken like you would butter and you have to ask for more.  this time, the chicken was great.  i went there two weeks ago at 8:00 am and it was absolutely horrible.   so, i think that the chefs know at 1:00 am they will have a ton, so they are making it and storing it just right. at 8:00 am, the last time, i probably had a heated up stored chicken and it was as if \"i made it myself.  just mehhhh\".  fresh and hot is best and it was rocking at 1:00 am.\n\noverall, great menu, many of other choices on there that you would find in a chinese restaurant and a great place to end up!\n\nnow they serve <mark>Brown rice</mark> for 1.50 more.  this chinese people are so good at making money on rice!  here is the dealio though. at 1:00 am most of the people there are drunk or buzzed and needing greasy fatty foods to recover. i don't think they are so worried about <mark>Brown rice</mark>.... \n\n\ngk says, this is the late nite place to be for sure!",

            "came in late last night for dinner and saw a short line of people. fortunately, service was swift enough and both me and my bf got seated almost immediately. \n\nthis place is busy! noticed that <mark>Patron (Shot)</mark> tend to be either party-goers or families. food is ok, not fantastic. i got the <mark>Seafood <mark>Wonton <mark>Beef Stew <mark>Special Combination Rice Noodle or Egg Noodle</mark></mark></mark></mark> with <mark>Barbecued Pork</mark> and <mark>Kim Long Fried <mark><mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Pork</mark> & <mark><mark>Charbroiled Chicken</mark> & <mark>Charbroiled Shrimp & Egg Roll</mark></mark></mark> (4)</mark> while my bf got his usual chicken pho. didn't think too highly of the food, but when you are starving, it actually left me pretty satisfied. i can see myself coming here before going out for a party or after a clubbing night. \n\none of those places to go to if you are looking for comfort food.", 
            "this place has changed a lot over the last few years. probably because of the popularity. open 24 hours and has quite a mix of <mark>Patron (Shot)</mark> coming through which is cool but the staff is becoming lackadaisical and i notice ego and that's not a good sign. i hope they fix a few staff problems because this used to be one of my favorite places to eat pho. now? not so much. almost too popular which is why they seem to be losing their professionalism. maybe just a bad night but very different from when i remember in the past. was 2am and the server couldn't careless about everyone else except the table full of girls sitting across. forgot several items and was still charged for them. no point in complaining because my meal was already ruined.", 
            "i am not picky, i'm a fair person. manager was straight disrespectful. whoever the current manager is during tuesdays at 9 ish pm does not even comprehend english first off to be capable of handling customer service type issues....then decides to argue that my complaint is not valid.... i made a mistake on an order, took one for the team, tried it but still did not like it. ..so i wanted to change to something else. ..not take it off my tab.... argues that it's been ordered all day, no one had complaints. argues that it costs alot to order the ingredients and ect....argues also about salary and things irrelevant to my issue.. sorry not sorry, not my business what other people think or like....love asian food but i really dislike this places' service. ..our server was also careless. .. i'm local and come frequent but be sure to brace yourself, order precisely, and basically don't leave room for error...fyi, my first yelp review, i don't complain much. ...wanted to voice the lack of care for their <mark>Patron (Shot)</mark>. ...even if it's just one person, every single person matters to the integrity and success of your business. ..."
