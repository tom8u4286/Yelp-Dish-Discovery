            "we have been here several times, always for lunch.  we often go here before we have to take that long flight back to the east coast.  this restaurant is also very convenient as we often stay at mgm, so it makes for a quick and easy bite to eat on our way out. \n\nanyways, i have tried the <mark>Home Style Chicken Noodle Soup</mark> (classic <mark>Home Style Chicken Noodle Soup</mark> with big chunks of chicken) and the spicy <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare</mark>.  i have also had the <mark>French Style Omelet</mark> with <mark>Crisp Tuscan Potatoes</mark>.  this meal makes for a great hangover meal when you are too late to catch breakfast.  but the real reason we keep coming back here is for the pizza!  wolfgang knows his pizza and he certainly does it right!  we have tried probably every pizza he offers on his menu (i think about 5) and they are all stupendous!  i really enjoyed the <mark>Mushroom</mark>, leeks, and goat cheese and the hubby prefers the classic pepperoni!\n\nthe dinner menu is like an extension of the lunch menu, so i'm sure it makes for a fabulous dinner as well!  \n\nlove your pizzas puck!", 
            "expensive! ok honestly i am not a huge fan of wolfgang pucks cuisine but since this place seems to be the only option open after 11pm in the mgm grand i was forced to eat there twice. \ni had their <mark>Home Style Chicken Noodle Soup</mark> and greek salad the first time. both were very small and mediocre in flavor. for $10, a cup of soup should have been the size of my head. its just <mark>Home Style Chicken Noodle Soup</mark>. \nthe second time, we had the chinouis salad which is wolfgangs famous chinese <mark>Chinois Chicken Salad</mark> and it was delicous. his pizza was eh. \n\nthe service was good the first time and terrible the second time. please dont make a special trip just to eat here but be prepared for some serious prices if you are hungry after 11pm and dont want to leave the mgm.", 
            "i came here with my boyfriend for a quick lunch before heading to wet republic. we decided to share the <mark>Home Style Chicken Noodle Soup</mark> and pulled pork sandwich. both dishes were flavorful and salted just right. i really enjoy the ambiance of this place -- even though it's located right in the middle of the casino and there are no actual walls, there's an aura of casual elegance about it. recommended!\n\n-l.", 
            "<mark>Jidori Half Chicken</mark> was good and the mash potatoes were delish!\n\n<mark>Home Style Chicken Noodle Soup</mark> was good too.\n\nexcellent customer service.\n\npricey.", 
            "i like this place..the wolgang puck bar and grill is in the mgm.  its rather funk and modern with a pretty wide array of cuisine, very likeable....i always am a bit concerned with these multiple celebrity chef restaurants.  \n\nafter all , wolfgang puck cant be everywhere\n\nbut he must have a good chef at the namesake bar and grill.  i had the <mark>Home Style Chicken Noodle Soup</mark>, not as good as grandmas, but darn close.  since i was not starving, i also had the salad.  it was very likeable with many colors, textures and a very tasty dressing\n\nmy friend loved his steak, but then again baste anything in butter and it wil be enjoyable.  i never met mr puck, but he must have great standards, partners and processes....because i never have had a bad meal", 
            "we ate at wolfgang puck for lunch. i had wild mushroom ravioli, <mark>Home Style Chicken Noodle Soup</mark>.  mara g. had the beet salad and the cream of celery soup. the restaurant is wheelchair accessible. how do we know? we saw a man in the motorized scooter drive up into the restaurant, park, get off, and walk to his table. \n\nother than that, the table where we were seated was in full view of the flat screen tv which was showing the nude version of \"the bride of frankenstein\". it was a pretty old movie and the station that aired it had no problem blurring out the boobs etc. \n\noh, back to my food. the <mark>Home Style Chicken Noodle Soup</mark> was superb. chock full of chicken, carrots, celery, and potato, the broth was so clear and fresh tasting.  i could have and should have made a lunch out of the soup and roll. the wild mushroom ravioli in parm cream sauce was delicious. and filling. and <mark>Mushroom</mark>. omg there was an over-abundance of a plethora of 'shrooms. enoki, portobella, oyster, button, you name it and it was both in the sauce whole and minced inside the ravioli. i could not eat all of those <mark>Mushroom</mark>. i had to leave half of them on my plate. i washed it all down with a really great glass of pinot grigio. fantastic lunch. \n\nthe space is open and airy. in spite of the fact that slots and blackjack tables are on two sides of the restaurant, its not smoky at all. the decor is all white \"laquer\" with blond wood and red accents. \n\nthe restaurant is visually appealing and the food is delicious. i'd go back. i'm a fan!", 
            "soup and salad $25... worth every penny. i would do it again in a heartbeat. reason... the flavors were spot on. i enjoyed both dishes more and more with each bite. <mark>Home Style Chicken Noodle Soup</mark> and butter lettuce caesar's salad simple but i liked the attention to detail. lettuce was very fresh (i grow my own, so i appreciate this). very simple but the flavors were very well balanced. <mark>Home Style Chicken Noodle Soup</mark>, again very simple but very well balanced. chicken, had very nice flavor - brined?\n\nwife had fish and chips. she loved it.fries were crispy, just the way she liked it. fish was fresh, batter very light and crispy. funny, fish reminded me of deep fried dish in some fish tacos i had down at a shack down in baja. both are are excellent, except the one in baja were $1 a piece. you don't have to pay top dollar to get good food.\n\nservice, excellent. they were all attentive and friendly.\n\noverall a great time. we will be back.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nwe were back for a second meal... this one dropped on all counts. pear and apple salad was too vinegary and overdressed. why do people like so much dressing on their salad? my mistake to not ask for the dressing on the side - thought they would respect the freshness of the produce and dress it properly.\n\npizza was good, but was only okay for $15. reminded me of cpk.\n\nservice was good but not very friendly.\n\n5 stars for the first visit, 3 for the second. 4 stars overall", 
            "we were going to diego in the mgm grand, too bad it didn't open for lunch, looked like wolfgang puck bar and grill was the only restaurant open there, out of choice. we'v seen this restaurant so many times, never wanted to try it cause it is located in the middle of the casino. glad we tried this restaurant by wolfgang puck. \n\ndecor: 3.5\nfood: 4\nservice: 5\nlocation: 3\natmosphere: 4\n\ntotal lunch bill for 2, 2 fat tire: $96 \n\ngarlic -chilli glazed wings with blue cheese dressing: so delicious, meaty, flavored, a bit sweet, but just right! it was messy eating those, i had all of them! \n<mark>Home Style Chicken Noodle Soup</mark> with veggies and italian parsley: so good, very flavored \nlinguini, malina clams, garlic, pancetta, chilli, wild oregano : loved the clams, hubby loved the pork in there, the linguini was ok. \n<mark>French Style Omelet</mark> , field <mark>Mushroom</mark> with french fries : so delicious!  :) \n\nportions were huge, we couldn't finish everything. took fries to go, it was my snack on the way back to la. :) \n\nloved our food, service was great, our waitress was very nice, brought me wet napkin to clean my hands after eating wings, it's dry napkin dipped in a cup of warm water, with a piece of lemon on the side to help remove the oil on my hands, how nice .:) \n\nminus the location, cause i didn't like restaurant in the middle of a casino in the open, everything else was great. loved the atmosphere, very chill and relaxing, perfect for a hang over lunch. will try the other location in la live sometime!", 
            "i've been here many times and food is always great and consistent. some menu items change often so there is always something seasonal to try. it is also open very late which makes it the best choice in the hotel for dining after 10pm.\n\napps:\nyou have to have the <mark>Home Style Chicken Noodle Soup</mark> - so fresh and tasty. i always start a meal with a bowl of the soup\nchinese <mark>Chinois Chicken Salad</mark> is good too - large portion\n\nlunch:\nthe lamb sandwich is amazing, don't pass it up\npizzas are also good and pretty large\nburger is good\n\ndinner:\nthe last 2 visits i had the kobe beef special. it's a great deal, about $47 and steak is very tender. it also comes with (literally) a pound of potatoes and cauliflower on the side. very large portion and <mark>Vegetable</mark> are perfectly cooked. probably the best kobe beef deal in town.\ni had the salmon once and it is good\nthe <mark>Mesquite Grilled Prime Flat Iron Steak</mark> is pretty good\nthe thin breaded chicken breast is nothing special, i would pass\nspaghettini with tomato sauce is a great light dish, very fresh and flavorful and vegetarian.\n\ndessert:\ni believe i had the cobbler or fruit pie and it is very good and big enough for 2. they have good loose leaf tea selection. for lunch the fresh cookies are good too.\n\ncomplaints:\nonly real complaint is the service is hit or miss. if you eat at the bar, the bar tenders are nothing special but i once had a very good female bar tender that checked often on me and my meal.", 
            "really disappointed!!!  when we walked in we started on a great note.  the hostesses were friendly and a few of the servers smiled warmly and greeted us as we ere escorted to our table.  our server came over right away bout didn't offer any suggestions or any of his favorites or anything.  i have to assume that he wrote us off right away because we are in out 20's and he assumed we wouldn't tip him well.  there were 3 other tables seated after we were in the same servers section.  all had their drinks and bread on the table and had ordered their dinner before we were even asked for drink orders.  we sat with menus to the side ready to order for 15 minutes while our server stood across the restaurant from us and talked with another server. my husband started with <mark>Home Style Chicken Noodle Soup</mark>. the veggies in it were crips and fresh but the soup was rather bland.  i ordered the salmon with fingerling potatoes and spring peas and a stone ground mustard sauce.  the salmon was to be cooked to medium.  the salmon arrived and was served on a plate full of frozen peas and carrots and there were 3 halves of fingerling potatoes on the plate.  i have seen ahi tuna filets cooked more than my salmon was.  only the outer 1/8th inch of the flash was cooked, the rest was luke warm at best and totally raw.  there was a wait assistant near our table filling water for us and others and he checked with us right after our food was dropped and asked if we needed anything else he was polite and friendly.  our waiter stopped by about 5 minutes later and didn't actually ask how things were just said \" things are good here, ya?\" and walked away.  over all i was totally disappointed with the experience.  i have had better food and service at applebees (which is total garbage)", 
            "this place is located in mgm hotel and is open much later than everything else.  it is also more reasonably priced.  i ordered cheese pizza and <mark>Home Style Chicken Noodle Soup</mark>.  pizza was great, not oily and had bits of fresh oregano.  <mark>Home Style Chicken Noodle Soup</mark> was definitely made from scratch.  i enjoyed that as well.  service was good, although late at night they do get busy.  this is a great place to stop by and eat, especially if you are not looking to spend tons of money, but don't want fast food.  decor is nice and resteraunt is clean:)", 
            "don't waist your time!!!!!the only restaurant still open at the mgm after 10:00 pm. my sister and i ordered a salad and it was over whelmed with raw onion.  so all i could taste was onion.  so i told the waitress that the salad was over whelmed with onion and i couldn't eat it.  she had a attitude so i just decided not to reorder anything.  then the manager came and try to fix the situation and offered me something else.  so i decided to get <mark>Home Style Chicken Noodle Soup</mark>.  that's pretty basic it hard to mess up soup so i thought.  it was flavor less and there was veins threw out the chicken.   i was done at that point and grossed out.  you would think that a restaurant of that stature would make sure there food was delicious.  the whole time we were eating the waitress was giving us attitude.  big mistake,  i would have left you a great tip after all your not the cook idiot!", 
            "filthy dirty.... does mr. puck ever look at the places that use his name?  all i wanted was a simple bowl of <mark>Home Style Chicken Noodle Soup</mark> (and the description on the menu sounded perfect).  it was a salty water \"soup\" with uncooked onions (lots of them) there were no parsnips in the soup at all (which was listed as an ingredient on the menu).  \n\ni wasn't served by my waitress, and when she finally did come to check on me, i asked if the soup ($13 bowl of soup) comes with bread or crackers... she said, \"we don't usually offer bread to our lunch customers, but i guess i could give you some if you want\".\n\nalso, i was seated next to some wood bark object, that they have separating the restaurant from the casino, and when i got a good look at it, it was dusty and filthy. so gross... had i noticed prior to ordering my soup i would have never eaten there. \n\nreally?", 
            "the food and service were both wonderful here! i've been to vegas twice and eaten at this restaurant three times. the pizza was probably my least favorite but the blt, <mark>Chinois Chicken Salad</mark> sandwich, and <mark>Home Style Chicken Noodle Soup</mark> were all top notch. i would recommend this restaurant at the mgm!", 
            "i was hesitant to eat here, as the menu just didn't sound that appealing, but the husband was adamant about coming here, so we did. i am glad we ended up here! the service was outstanding! very attentive, friendly, and filled with great recommendations. i had their pineapple mojito at the recommendation of our server and it was the perfect amount of herb and sweet.... very good. it was 12$, but hey, this is vegas.... that was kind of a steal. for lunch, i had their soup of the day... a thai coconut <mark>Home Style Chicken Noodle Soup</mark>.... it was sooo good. the best part was the tender <mark>Mushroom</mark>, and i don't even like <mark>Mushroom</mark>! the husband had a club sandwich, and he enjoyed it thoroughly. it came with a nice salad that was lightly dressed. lunch was a bit pricey at about 50$, but considering i got a drink, this wasn't too bad. i would come back!", 
            "i tried this restaurant when i went to visit my family in town for nfr. it was so good we went for lunch and dinner. we just walked right in - there wasn't a wait, and there were plenty of tables. the drinks were expertly crafted. they have the best hurricane i've ever tasted. so smooth, so good. my aunt got the raspberry lemon drop... three raspberry lemon drops, actually. the staff was beyond wonderful and even went out of their way to chat about the nfr showing on the tvs. the <mark>Home Style Chicken Noodle Soup</mark> was the closest i've found to my mother's homemade, and the salmon i had for dinner was divine. it's a huge slab, so it was good for two meals. my aunt had a fantastic spicy shrimp dish and my uncle got a tender, juicy steak. for dessert, the creme brulee was heavenly. there wasn't a bad thing i tasted and the service was impeccable. i have absolutely nothing negative about it.", 
            "really excellent food. tartar is one of the best i ever had, worth 21$. great pizzas and sandwiches of course. excellent fresh <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>. <mark>Chopped Vegetable Salad</mark> ok. very good homemade <mark>Home Style Chicken Noodle Soup</mark>. ate here for a few days and it was consistently on point. solid service. open 24 hrs too! side note, those <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> everyone writes about are not that great, though unique, they are very heavy handed, blue-cheese completely overpowers truffle flavor, they are just sauced chips in the end. french-fries are also not spectacular, but side salads are perfect.", 
            "we were a party of 14 that arrived without a reservation on a monday night. they put us in a private room in the back which was absolutely perfect.  right off the top, the kids menu was outstanding. it was reasonably priced ($6/entree) and all of the children were excited about the offerings (pizza, pasta, chicken etc).  every single adult loved their meal.  i had a huge salad with fresh roasted chicken and a bowl of <mark>Home Style Chicken Noodle Soup</mark>.  it was absolutely yummy!! the pasta dishes around me were equally as good (piggie me sampled most of them). and most importantly, the service was great. let's face it, we weren't an easy group and they handled us wonderfully.  this is a solid choice for families or adults smack dab in the middle of the mgm casino  \nyou did good, wolfgang--our most memorable night out of a 7-night stay. thank you!", 
            "i came across this place and walked right in on a monday afternoon. lots of business looking people and im pretty sure we were the only mexicans there. our server who i forgot his name (a nice, 20something asian guy) was very sweet and checked in on us often.  my mom ordered the veggie pizza and <mark>Home Style Chicken Noodle Soup</mark> as an app. since i ordered the chicken, our server warned us it would take about 20 minutes since they need to make sure its fully cooked. my mom asked i wanted <mark>Home Style Chicken Noodle Soup</mark> and i said no because its boring and im over it. when it came, i saw her soup looked pretty good so i tried  it and it was the most delicou un-boring soup with plenty of flavor. her veggie pizza was okkkk but my chicken with <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> was amazing and worth the wait!!!!! i only wished they served bread sticks or something with your meals.", 
            "was not expecting super amazing food even though it was a wolfgang puck restaurant. we did get awesome food though and their <mark>Home Style Chicken Noodle Soup</mark> is superb, tastes really homemade. a personal thing i dislike about these types of restaurants though is that they have the water glasses out forever until someone sits at the table, that makes the glasses smell bad once you put water in them. i think it's just me though, but i had to stop breathing when i drank water so i wouldn't have to smell the wet dirty glass smell. like i said though, this is a personal thing, and maybe other people can't distinguish the \"smell\" like i can.\n\ni had the salmon and my boyfriend had the cod, the salmon was extremely good and so was the cod, the salmon took the cake though. we had a side of <mark>Sauteed Brussels Sprouts</mark> (i love them) and the <mark>'BLT' Sriracha Glazed Pork Belly</mark> bacon they used was very awesome as well, i could have just ordered two sides by themselves and made it a meal!\n\noverall, i loved it and will go back when we go back to vegas. we were staying at the mgm so the walk from our room to the restaurant was negligible which was also a huge plus!"

            "i haven't been to vegas since march, so it's been a while since eating here, but for some reason - i have no idea why - i was just thinking about the calzone that i get at wolfgang puck's every time i go there.  it's probably the best calzone that i've ever had and i've eaten my fair share of calzones.  perfect crust - not too flaky, not too thick.  lots of delicious cheese  and plenty of chicken and whatnot.  \n\nthe first time we ate here we were both hot and tired and cranky and hungry and had wandered around new york new york and the mgm grand and no food option sounded good.  finally we decided to try wolfgang pucks and we were pleasantly surprised by the outstanding calzone and, of course, the maytag bleu cheese <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark>.  it instantly made us feel better and we were able to continue on. \n\ni'm a little bummed, i'm hungry for a calzone.  but i won't be back in vegas for quite some time and it doesn't look like any of the affordable puck locations in los angeles serve them.  hmmm....must think of an excuse.", 
            "just because this is a cafe by one of the us's favorite chefs, and just because they spend time in the kitchen prepping the food and making it look fantastically gorgweah, doesn't mean it tastes good.  and it did not taste good. the chicken drumettes had almost no meat. blech. the <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> was nice enough but lacked zing.  yawn.  the truffle and bleu cheese <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> tasted good but they also tasted confused.  choose one intense flavor to focus on, but not both.\n\ni am giving them 3 stars because we got great service and our bartender was both a gentleman and patient with our drunken hazing.  i will got there again because it is convenient, but not because i like the food.", 
            "we sat at the bar and the bartender was very nice, good with suggestions of beer, mixed drinks and appetizers. \n\ni ordered some <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> covered with cheese, an order of fried chicken and i got an oatmeal stout and a few doppel bachs. the chips were really good and matched well with both choices of brews that were suggested. the fried chicken was very tasty with the right amount of crunch and yet still keeping plenty of juicyness in the chicken.\n\nthe 2nd visit we got the chips again, plus <mark><mark>Mesquite Grilled Prime Flat Iron Steak</mark> Skewers</mark> and had the doppel bachs. the meat on the skewers were very tender and tasted pretty good but not anything mind blowing like the chips. \n\nwe actually went back 3x for the chips other than what i've mentioned above.", 
            "after checking into the mgm, four of my friends and i decided to have a casual lunch at the hotel at the wolfgang puck bar and grill. it's an open restaurant on the casino floor and is easy to find. service was quick and attentive which is always good, especially when four of your dining companions had been awake since 3 am est and were dying for food.\n\nwe shared the <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> with maytag blue cheese as an appetizer which were heavenly. for lunch, i had the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> which was really good, especially because it came with a piece of bruschetta. the pizzas are big enough to share between two people, which is what two of my friends did. they actually got a half tomato, basil, and mozzarella and half pepperoni - needless to say every bite was eaten. the other big hit at the table were the <mark>House Made Ricotta Gnocchi</mark> which everyone who tasted them enjoyed.\n\nprices are very reasonable; food was good; and overall it has a good atmosphere for a nice, casual lunch if you are at or near the mgm grand.", 
            "i was waiting for the car to the airport and stopped in for a drink and a snack.  sat at the bar and got a glass of sauvignon blanc and ordered the truffle <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark>.  truffle anything is good right?  i wish i had known that the chips were going to come drowned in a dip that was well on it's way to gelatenous.   i would have ordered the dip on the side because i hate soggy chips.  the chips were amazing though.  the bartender was great and the perfect balance of chatty but not too much.", 
            "many vegas restaurants compete for glitz and glamour, so it's a real treat to be able to dine at a restaurant simply for it's homestyle comfort foods, and that's what wolfgang puck bar and grill brings to the table time and time again!\n\nsimple classics such as freshly made <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> are dressed with truffle oil and a blue cheese dressing. veal ravioli is gently tossed with <mark>Mushroom</mark>, brown butter and crisp sage.  a crispy chicken milanese is set apart with an arugula salad and cherry tomatoes.  and dessert is simply divine: a banoffee (banana and toffee) cream pie with a sugar dough shell, and bruleed bananas; a sorbet trio served in a brandy snap cup and topped with fresh berries.\n\nservice needed slight improvement, granted the floor (both restaurant and casino) were busy, but the food should definitely be on everyone's checklist of things to see and do while on the strip.",

            "very surprised by how much i enjoyed this place for my last lunch in vegas on my most recent trip.   the pizza was decent, the french dip sandwich was good, but the homemade <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> with truffled blue cheese sauce was amazing!   i would go back just for that dish.   the restaurant is also reasonably priced, especially for vegas.", 
            "meh.\n\ni tried their pulled pork cuban sandwich for lunch.  although it was full of flavor and tasty, it wasn't anything special.  i guess i was expecting more from the storied wolfgang puck name.  the cuban sandwich also came with <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> (that i guess were home-made), very crunchy and quite tasty.\n\ni would probably not come back again as i would think there are other more interesting lunch spots to check out.", 
            "this was our second visit to wolfgang puck's restaurant in the mgm.  the restaurant itself has a great upbeat modern decor, but being in the mgm with no walls or deliniation to speak of, there can be a bit of noise & commotion from the gaming floor from time to time.  \n\nafter getting of the plane, losing a piece of luggage, etc -- it was great to sit down with a bottle of wine & the maytag blue cheese truffle oil <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> to relax.  they are such comfort food!\n\nwe also shared a mushroom & leek pizza, with a great olive oil crust, with just enough garlic too.  it's a thin crust, that does have some give and toothiness to make it yummy.\n\nwp's did have a winter tasting menu (their prix fixe option) -- and there were several nice choices, we just didn't want that much food.  but, for dinner, it may be a nice option for you.\n\nwait staff was fine -- waiter was pleasant to talk with, yet not too chatty.  wine selection was nice -- went with an irony pinot noir on the lower price end -- but it was fine after our day.\n\ntotal bill was $66 pre-tip.  if you're staying at the mgm, its a great place for a delicious meal.  note -- they are also having a late menu - 11 pm to 5 am - so, gives you a much better option than mgm's studio cafe.", 
            "my first experience was horrible but i ended up leaving with a smile. my entree came first and the appetizers took foreeeeever and it was nowhere to be seen after the entree was long done. it was to the point that the manager came to apologize and offer a complimentary chocolate souffle cake (or was it choco mouse?) and asked whether i still want the appetizers as they were done and ready. i was pissed but a little forgivng for expressing his apology so i kept them. when came the bill, he did not charge us for the late appetizers. yay. as you can see, i was willing to give them a second chance and become a loyal customer. i love to eat here whenever i am in vegas.\n\nthis is an open restaurant where you can eat and people watching at the same time if you don't mind the noise from the casino. the food and service are great, and ambience is lively, modern, and welcoming. i ordered mostly appetizers and nothing that i didn't like. to die for is the truffle <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> with blue cheese, all i can say is wow. i also like spaghettini; it's not your traditional spaghetti bursting with tomatoe sauce and grounded meat but it's a light vegetarian dish flavor right with a few key ingredients.", 
            "started preparing my drunken day by filling my tummy here at the restaurant because it was conveniently located inside mgm.\n\ni can't remember what we all got, but it was along the lines of pizzas. all of them were good, not great, but still delicious. they can't be that outstanding if i don't care to recall exactly what they were.\n\ni dooooooo remember our appetizer though. we saw a tables nearby with all the same thing!! so we wanted it too. turns out their truffle chips with blue cheese was one of the most popular items on the menu. after biting into one, i could see why. explosion of flavor with every bite. it became too much when you kept eating it without alternating flavors. \n\nif you are to eat here, i recommend the truffle <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark>!!", 
            "now, i guess you can say that my judgement here was a little skewed because i ate here at 2:30 in the morning after coming back from haze, the new nightclub in aria (xs is better) and i was lightweight faded, but man was the food good.\n\nwe started out with the <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> with maytag blue cheese and man, this sh*t was bomb!  i normally don't like blue cheese at all, but it must have been a really good grade because it tasted great and didn't smell at all.  \n\nafter we shared the spicy soprasata, salami toscana and pepperoni with green chilies pizza and this even topped the chips!  if you've ever read my reviews or been to gaspare's and ordered the bruce's special, you're gonna love this pizza.  not as good, but great in its own way because it's different.  \n\ndidn't have any trouble with slow service like other reviewers stated, but we did sit at the bar and took it back to the room.  bartender was very friendly and made sure we always had water, lol.\n\ni am definitely looking forward to coming here again and sampling items apart from the late night menu.\n\ni know wolfgang has a few restaurants in vega$ so hit me up if you know of one i should try!", 
            "boring restaurants yield boring reviews. here goes... \n\ni've read a few of the reviews on this bar & grill and i agree with two prevalent ideas. the <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> were delicious, and i'm not sure if wolfgang puck should put his name on this establishment. i should note that my buddy and i only had the <mark>Grilled Prime Burger</mark> with vermont cheddar and smoked onion marmalade along with the chips so we had limited exposure to the menu. but hey, a great restaurant is supposed to make something simple into spectacular, and from its name the burger sure \"sounded\" delecious. while the name of the burger lights up your eyes, you palette is left bored and dismayed. though it was cooked perfectly to my request of rare, there was no flavor that sprung out of the tender meat. even the fancy smanshy cheese and onion stuff was bland and undeserving of the written text in the menu. grab a beer and the chips here, but look elsewhere for simple, good eats. yes, i do realize that's difficult in vegas.", 
            "wolfgang puck in mgm is big and busy.  i like the all white and that it overlooks the casino floor.  on a friday night we were able to walk up without reservations and be seated in less than 5 minutes.  if you love blue cheese you must try the tuffled <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> with maytag blue cheese.  we also shared a pizza, which was a little on the salty side, but ok.  the service was pretty good, they get you in and out like a machine, so it's a fast dining experience if you are in a hurry.",

            "***not as expensive or overpriced as the many celebrity chef restaurants in las vegas (though still pricey), wolfgang puck bar & grill is a decent spot that serves satisfying (though not great) food***\n\ndespite the many well-known restaurants (especially those backed by celebrity chefs) in las vegas, there are not many that are open for lunch.  that is what makes wolfgang puck bar & grill, which is located on the casino floor of the mgm hotel, so convenient.  i believe it is open all day and wolfgang puck utilizes better ingredients than a lot of its daytime sit-down competition.\n\ndespite its convenience, wolfgang puck bar & grill is just an okay restaurant (not a great one).  most of the dishes are fine and taste good, but i have yet to have something here (in my 3 visits) that felt noticeably better than the food other good vegas restaurants put out.\n\nwolfgang puck bar & grill sits smack down in the middle of the casino.  it is pretty open to the casino with no big walls.  maybe it was where we sat or that the casino was not that busy, but the smoke-filled casino did not feel that obtrusive here.  the decor has the look of a bright cafe with light yellow and golden brown colors and nice but casual tables and chairs.\n\nwe started with the truffled (strong truffle flavor) <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark>, which were topped with a chunky and rich maytag blue cheese sauce.  the housemade chips were flavorful and seasoned right but unevenly crisp--some were crisp and some were soft (some chips were made even softer / soggier due to the heavy coating of blue cheese).  overall, it was an okay starter though you may want to steer clear if you are not a fan of blue cheese.\n\nwe also shared the <mark>Chinois Chicken Salad</mark>, which was tossed with candied peanuts, crisp wontons and a chinese mustard vinaigrette.  overall, it was a flavorful and fresh salad with a good balance of ingredients, but it was not as good as the original <mark>Chinois Chicken Salad</mark> from chinois on main in santa monica.  the reason was that the salad was over dressed.  it kind of lost its crispness and it was overdressed in the vinaigrette (too soggy).\n\nfor my entree, i had the blt, which included maple <mark>'BLT' Sriracha Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, arugula, vine ripe tomatoes, and avocado on buttered sourdough toast.  the <mark>'BLT' Sriracha Glazed Pork Belly</mark> was sweet and flavorful.  i thought it was going to be braised and soft (and then crispy on the outside); however, the <mark>'BLT' Sriracha Glazed Pork Belly</mark> here lacked that tender texture.  instead, the <mark>'BLT' Sriracha Glazed Pork Belly</mark>'s texture was more dense like thick bacon or lean spare ribs.  it was still good, but i would have preferred a thicker piece of braised (tender) <mark>'BLT' Sriracha Glazed Pork Belly</mark> over the spare rib-like texture here.\n\nthe lettuce, tomato and avocado were all fine.  like the <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark>, the sandwich was heavily dressed.  i was not a big fan of the sourdough.  the bread was okay, but it was over-buttered and slightly greasy.  the blt came with a side of cold vegetable pasta salad, which was a standard cold pasta salad.\n\ni tried my friend's kabocha pumpkin tortellini with sage brown butter, toasted hazelnuts and parmesan.  i had a very similar pumpkin tortellini dish at drago ristorante in santa monica.  the pasta dish at wolfgang puck was flavorful and pretty good (probably the best thing we had here).  that being said, i liked drago's version better because it was lighter, had a more subtle flavor and was less complicated.\n\nservice was very good.  the waiter jeremy was a very nice guy.  he was pleasant and friendly as well as enthusiastic and passionate about the food.  food came out at a good pace and the staff was attentive.\n\nprices for lunch were okay.  there were several options here that were around $20 or less.  you would pay about the same at some of the las vegas cafes, but i imagine you are more likely to walk away satisfied if you spent your money here.\n\nwolfgang puck bar & grill has convenient hours and puts out tasty (though not remarkable) food.  i've been here a few times and the restaurant has shown a lot of consistency in delivering (at the very least) decent food.  that is what makes wolfgang puck bar & grill a decent and safe option for lunch in las vegas.  \n\nthe mgm grand hotel provides complimentary parking (both valet and self-parking via a parking structure).", 
            "my sister and i went here for lunch. we shared an order of the homemade <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> that were slathered in sauce and cheese. they were amazing. i guess we should have considered having pizza, but we went for the pulled pork sandwiches instead, which were also excellent. i did feel a bit conspicuous as the restaurant is totally open to the casino around it, and the air quality wasn't fabulous as a result. but the waitstaff was great, and overall it was a really tasty meal.",

            "use ur m life points here!\n\nwe stumbled here the first day for lunch because were gambling and needed a break from all the losses. after finding out we could use our m life rewards here, we came back again the next day!  this originally wasn't on my list of places to eat, but being near the casino floor we decided to stop in for what we thought would be a mediocre but quick lunch. the waiter came by and gave us the normal spiel of what were the specials for the day, which i honestly never pay attention to. however, my boyfriend does, and he noticed that their special, not on their menu, was a salmon burger with corn based slaw onions etc. \n\nfood we ordered from both visits:\nsalmon burger - omg. amazing. this is off the menu so if you're coming here and you love salmon as much as i do and love corn as much as i do, make sure you ask for this. i've had salmon burgers elsewhere that i thought were great, but this is amazing!! i'm so glad that our waiter came by and mentioned that it was off the menu. if i weren't coming back to try the other recommended items from yelpers the second day, i would've ordered it again. \n\n<mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> with maytag blue cheese - ordered this per yelper's recommendations. so yums!!! the <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> were not thin but not super thick, made just the right width with the right crunchiness. i love truffle oil and i love it when its used right. you could definitely taste the truffle oil on the chips. it's not overpowering. i'm also generally not a big fan of blue cheese on anything else but my salads, but there wasn't enough. plus you can always brush it off when you're eating the potato chip, it doesn't leave a residue taste on the chip either.\n\n<mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cakes</mark> - ordered this per yelpers recommendations as well. they come out in 4 or 5 what looks like tiny <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cakes</mark>, but they are made exquisitely and i have to say even being located in desert nevada, these <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cakes</mark> were fresh and delicious! i hate it when people put in so many crumbs it takes away from the crab stuffing or the crab flavour. that wasn't the case at all. it wasn't an overpowering crab taste either. i highly recommend ordering these! \n\nreuben sandwich - my boyfriend ordered this. i'm not a huge fan of reuben's but he said it was ok. he asked for no cheese on his reuben, but it came out with cheese anyway. the one good thing about this was he asked for a substitute of a salad for his french fries, and the salad that came out was fresh and delicious!\n\nspicy <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> - this was a good order. i tried a few other <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare</mark>'s that week in vegas and this was definitely the best one that i tried. i liked the wonton's that came with it too. the chip was thick and crunchy. \n\nbbq pork spare ribs - ordered this bc we had m life points to spend (wut wut in the mgm). they were made well, but being from the south i've definitely tasted better ribs. but since these were comped ribs, i have no complaints. hahaha.\n\nspicy sopressata pizza - my boyfriend ordered this as well. i'm not a fan of spicy things on my pizza but he was a big fan of this pizza. he highly highly recommends it. \n\ndidn't have room during either visit for dessert but nothing on the menu super caught my eye. \n\natmosphere/decor: i loved the decor! it was spacious and light, with enough ambiance to create a non-casino feel. it had an open view of the casino games around us, but also enough baracades (these round wooden bigger than life wreath type things) to close you in on your eating and dining experience. it does get a lil loud but not loud enough for you to yell to your eating mates. \n\nservice - service was great. the waiters were always attentive but not hovering, and they always made sure that we had water in our cups (which we needed since we came in the middle of scorching hot 120 degree july). i also liked that they sent things out as they were ready, not \"when they're supposed to come out.\" really liked that about the place. \n\ni love this place. it's incredibly reasonably priced, even if you don't use your comp points here. i loved the casualness yet classy feel of the place. definitely highly recommended if you're in the area, or if you just wanna stop by for a quick lunch. its a good break from all the smoking as well. huge props to wolfgang and chef scott irestone for the amazing work they did here!", 
            "nice restaurant. ordered the truffle <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> with maytag blue cheese dipping sauce. i wished the sauce was served on the side but good none the less.\n we ordered two pizzas with the intention of sharing.(they are very big for one serving i thought). my wife had a roasted chicken, house bbq sauce, corn, pasilla peppers, red onions, cilantro and i had the prosciutto, kalamata olives, oven dried tomatoes, basil pesto, goat cheese. both were good but i preferred mine. before the appetizer was brought out, we were given some very tasty bread. two pieces had caramelized onions on it...mmmmmm!\ndue to the size of the pizzas, much was wasted and there was no room for dessert. the service was exceptional. definitely worth the money", 
            "great food and decent prices!  go for the <mark>'BLT' Sriracha Glazed Pork Belly</mark> blt-it rocks!  also, tried the homemade <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> with gorg cheese this time and it was awesome.  although i love gorg cheese and there is a lot. big portion too!  my boyfriend couldn't stop raving about the <mark>'BLT' Sriracha Glazed Pork Belly</mark>.  bartender was pretty friendly once we got him talking, didn't seem too into his job though.", 
            "ended up here while looking for a diner type place at the mgm casino. liked the \"bar food\" variety on their menu so decided to give it a shot even though most entrees were priced at around $25, pizzas around $15 so not too bad. it's fenced off but open to the casino, which is nice. it was an upscale-casual vibe (if that's possible). the service was impeccable! truly. meatball pizza as an app was delicious and i've had some serious pizza in chi-town and nyc. it took about 15 minutes to get the pizza, which we expected, but as soon as it came out the manager came right up to us, apologized for the delay on our pizza, and immediately told us that they would be buying us dessert (we were a group of 4). not one of us knew what delay he spoke of, we just sort of froze at the mention of free dessert, which i'm not a big sweets person, but free is free. i had the <mark><mark>Mesquite Grilled Prime Flat Iron Steak</mark> Skewers</mark>...uh-amazing taste and texture. the garlic chili wings were good, but they seemed more teriyaki glazed to me. the truffle <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> were great for blue cheese lovers. the short rib was fantastic as was the <mark>Mesquite Grilled Prime Flat Iron Steak</mark> with fries. oh, the fries were incredible. hot and crispy, and stayed like that for a while. we decided to share two desserts in case they were too big. we were super stuffed because we had already ordered all of our food before we knew we would be getting the free dessert. we chose the banana banouffee(?) and the pineapple upsidedown dessert, both were topped wtih homemade ice creams and syrups. believe me when i say that these desserts were the most amazing creations to ever hit my tounge. they were just beyond description! yes, both of them! i've had so-called good desserts before at places like ferrara's and serendipity in nyc before, but those places were just generic, processed, super market ice cream compared to wolfgang's creations. they really were unbelieveable. i cannot wait to go back to this place, and the great thing is that it stays open til about 6am i think! we paid about $200 for 4 people.", 
            "so what's the first thing you do when you land in vegas at 2:00 am? gamble? strip club? no! you go eat because vegas has become a haven for foodies within the last ten years (and because you're a bit of a chunky monkey who thinks about food first). anyway, fast forward to us driving around with both our phones tuned to the yelp! app to find a good place to eat. thankfully we skipped the likes of ihop and denny's near the airport to find a wolfgang puck's restaurant open 24/7 in the mgm. yeah that's right, forget the little sandwich delis that used to be the only place a gambler could get a late-night bite in a casino, it's now all celebrity chefs and gourmet food.\n\nthe restaurant is terraced slightly higher than the gambling floor, but has a completely open view so you can munch away and do some people watching at the same time. the menu had several good options, but we decided on the truffle <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> and wood oven mushroom pizza. the truffle <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> are crazy good; fresh fried <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> that are still warm drizzled with a super rich blue cheese sauce and topped with with bits of truffle. how can you read that description and not start to salivate? the pizza was also solid.\n\nbottom line, whether you're commiserating after having just lost a fortune or are a gourmand on a late-night munchie quest, my buddy wolfgang won't disappoint you.", 
            "so delicious!\n\nafter being told there was an hour wait, we were pleasantly surprised to be seated after only 15 minutes. the staff is very friendly, and the restaurant is beautiful. cocktails are overpriced, but what do you expect in vegas?\n\nwe had the truffle <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> with blue cheese sauce. it was very rich, unusual, and delicious. if you like blue cheese, i highly recommend trying these.\n\nmy husband had the <mark><mark>Mesquite Grilled Prime Flat Iron Steak</mark> Skewers</mark> as an entree, while i had the organic chicken. the steak was tender, flavored well, and the coleslaw was fresh and tasty. the organic chicken was beautiful, not just in presentation but also in terms of taste. the mashed potatoes and <mark>Vegetable</mark> were the perfect match but the crispy, light chicken.\n\noverall, we had a great experience and i would definitely go back.", 
            "the food is good. c'mon, it's wolfgang puck! i honestly haven't ever had a bad meal at any of his restaurants (i've been to many). and, it's absolutely true here.\n\nwe started with the truffle <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> with maytag blue cheese sauce. these were a little light on the truffle oil but they made up for it in blue cheese. there was plenty of chips on the plate for the two of us to share.\n\nmy wife thoroughly enjoyed her grilled salmon which was moist and flaky. i had the <mark>Mesquite Grilled Prime Flat Iron Steak</mark> which was very tender and cooked perfectly. i savored each bite with a little of the maytag blue cheese sauce left over from the <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark>. delish!\n\nthe staff is friendly and very efficient. our server was smiling all the time. unfortunately, she also didn't check back on us after we started our meal (she showed up immediately after we were served to make sure it \"looked\" okay).\n\nmaybe i hold puck to higher standards but this restaurant and meal wasn't particularly memorable. i was expecting outstanding and got good. most of the time that's good enough for four stars. but not a pricey high-profile celeb chef restaurant in vegas. it's a very solid three.", 
            "elevating a simple (and slightly old school) dish to something special definitely wins brownie points in my books, and that's what this place does well.\n\ni had the <mark>Chinois Chicken Salad</mark> with candied cashews, shredded chicken, cabbage, ginger and soy dressing (and normally wontons, but not for me), and while i was hoping (and expecting) it to be decent, it much surpassed my expectations. the presentation was stunning and the flavours all worked together beautifully. in addition, one of my fellow diners shared her <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> which was one of the most decadent and addictive things i've ever tried. unreal. finally, we shared the chocolate souffle for dessert, which was light and airy but also more than satisfied my sweet tooth. everyone else was very happy with their dishes, especially the pizzas.\n\nthe service was impeccable and the atmosphere was sophisticated without being stuffy or pretentious. you are in the middle of the mgm casino but somehow the dividers and the atmosphere of the restaurant itself doesn't make you feel like you're among rows of slot machines and blackjack tables. for the quality of the food and the service, the price point is very reasonable. definitely worth checking out on a future visit.", 
            "just before heading to cirque du soleil ka.\n\nwe were excited to finally taste his food. the famous wolgang puck! the guy's name alone is awesome. imo, it was the best meal of our trip so far. here is what we ordered:\n\n1. spicy <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare</mark>, avocado, pickled ginger, cucumber, crisp sesame wontons\n\n2. <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark>, maytag blue cheese sauce\n\n3. agnolotti with asparagus, smoked ham, fresh ricotta and parmesan\n\n4. fish of the day (halibut) with sweet corn puree, blue crab and lobster cause americaine.\n\neverything was amazing and the service was super good.  the only shortfall is that it's a bit loud because it's located on the casino floor. but the food was so food you really don't notice it too much.",

            "we ate here for dinner this past monday night while i was in vegas for a conference.  this is a cool, contemporary restaurant located inside mgm grand.  i've eaten here several time before, but this is my first official review of this place.  every other time i've been here, i've really enjoyed it, and this time was no exception.  we had a free appetizer for their blue cheese truffle <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark>.  yum!  i would highly recommend these if you eat here.  they give you bread as well, so i was a little full when our meals came.  i ordered the gnocchi pasta with a sausage/marinara sauce.  it was outstanding.  my wife even admitted that she liked it better than her dish.  she ordered a ravioli dish that she wasn't particularly fond of, as she thought the pasta was a bit underdone.  not inedible, just not exactly what she was hoping for.   they had some great looking desserts available (red velvet cake), but we were so full that we couldn't partake.  our server was very good throughout the meal, and the other helpers were quick to help with refills.  this place was 5 star for me, but fell short of that for my wife, so we'll go with 4 stars.  we were able to get out of here for about $70, including the tip, which isn't bad when you consider the fact that it's a wolgang puck restaurant.  i'll definitely come back here if i'm in the area.",

            "walked in on a late 1am friday morning.  basically hungry from our flight and just wanted to that white castle craving to go away.  \n\nluckily, there were plenty of tables open, so we were seated right away without reservation.  the dining area was set up nicely and clean.  appearance was colorful,  modern, and quite unique.  we were served by albert, and he was attentive from beginning to end.  only that's about it.\n\nso, we started with the <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> ($11) with a blue cheese sauce.  these were superb, but not anything to rave about.  i mean, i love truffle and i love blue cheese, but it couldn't keep my mind off those belly bombers.  i guess the chips and sauce really brought out the saltiness.  meh, i knew i wanted the <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> instead, oh well.  \n\nnow the ceasar salad ($13) was a winner, well kind of.  fresh baby romaine leaves with the ceasar salad dressing.  though it tasted great, only i personally thought it was small for the price.  the croutons were big and tasteless as well.  \n\nthen there was the <mark>Jidori Half Chicken</mark> ($28) with vegtables, a <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>, topped with rosemary au jus, and a side of kale salad.  now, for $28 this better be the best chicken ever.  it was excellent, but not the best ever!  full of flavor, but you had to mix it all together to drown the over-saltiness.  \n\nbecause of these dishes, we ordered their cheapest bottle of white wine, the nuschese pinot grigio ($32).  a suitable choice especially for the chicken and salad.  a surprisingly enjoyable wine.  thanks again to albert's recommendation, it made for a good compliment;  and we just killed that bottle!\n\nso, overall, i've gone to several wolfgang puck locations and this just confirms i'm not a fan of his style.  after spending a total of $103 for two people, i simply feel this place is overrated and overpriced.  this place already put me in the hole!", 
            "each person has a new & unique experience.  and that is why i decided to write a review.  working in the restaurant business, i tend to be a bit snobby and prissy when it comes to service at other restaurants and usually, i'm disappointed.  this was not one of those experiences.  \n\ni was staying at the mgm and attending a conference and didn't want to venture far for lunch.  after a horrible lunch experience at emeril's on my first day of the conference, i decided to give wolfgang's a try on day two.  and it was such a pleasant experience, i came back on day 3 as well. \n\nfirst visit:\n- we were greeted pleasantly by the hostess\n\n- sat a nice table near the glass\n\n- promptly greeted by our server (jeremy) who thoroughly explained the specials and also recommended a cocktail.  the pearfict martini thing was great!\n\n- we were in a bit of a rush, so we ordered quickly.  two of us had pizzas and one had a shrimp scampi thing.  everything was pretty awesome.  \n\n- all food came out in a very timely manner and waters/drinks were refilled even through the entire restaurant was completely full for lunch.  \n\n- the support staff (bussers/runners) were great and jeremy was very attentive and on-point as well.  \n\n- we were in and out of the restaurant in 40 minutes and still had time to get some starbucks before we headed back to the conference.  \n\n\nsecond visit:\n- jeremy was actually near the entrance to greet us and recognized us and sat us in his section.  restaurant was almost empty.  \n\n- quickly ordered some food.  had the cheesy <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> thing.  they were pretty darn good, but also very rich.  too much for two people.  i had a pepperoni pizza and she had a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>.  salad was average.  not amazing, just good.  pizza was good, just like the day before. \n\n- service was, once again, great.  \n\n\noverall, the staff seems very professional, detailed and well-put-together.  i was impressed to find such good service in a \"casual\" las vegas eatery.  \n\nthanks for the awesome service and great food.",

            "loved this restaurant. this is probably my favourite place in the mgm.. to eat. walking in, i was greeted 5-7 times by every staff that i passed.. what?! exceptional service. they even pulled our chairs out- something that doesn't happen everyday. \n\nlet me start by saying that the truffle <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> were the best thing i've ever eaten in my life and i would travel back to vegas just for them. anything made with truffle oil literally makes my tummy rumble with hunger when i think of it, and this topped everything. so much flavour and deliciousness in one dish. it was like kettle chips on steroids. sooooo good. i also had the salad (which i can't remember the name of) but it was the 'asian' one? with wonton crisps and candied cashews. i remember this salad used cabbage.. which i hate.. so when it came, i was like 'shit.' but then it tasted so good. wow, i am seriously mindblown. what kind of chef runs this place? excuse me for drooling all over your restaurant. boyfriend ordered the prosciutto pizza and it made his stomach happy. i personally didn't try any since i've had pizza 2 days in a row and got sick of it already.. oops. also, there was a guy who always made sure our water was full. dehydration is common out in vegas but definitely not in this place, where they make sure after every few sips, you need more water.\n\nthe service was phenomenal and y'know.. us canadians.. we're used to tipping 10% where we're from (because min wage is higher), so the usual norm of tipping 20%+ was strange and uncomfortable to us since we've entered the us. however, this place definitely earned their tip and we were happy to leave a great tip for amazing servers.", 
            "really excellent food. tartar is one of the best i ever had, worth 21$. great pizzas and sandwiches of course. excellent fresh <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>. <mark>Chopped Vegetable Salad</mark> ok. very good homemade <mark>Home Style Chicken Noodle Soup</mark>. ate here for a few days and it was consistently on point. solid service. open 24 hrs too! side note, those <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> everyone writes about are not that great, though unique, they are very heavy handed, blue-cheese completely overpowers truffle flavor, they are just sauced chips in the end. french-fries are also not spectacular, but side salads are perfect.", 
            "my family and i came here for dinner before we went to see a show and it was amazing! the food was great and our server was really friendly. the food didn't take long to come out either. \n\nwe weren't too hungry so we ordered a few things to share. pretty much every review i saw they got the <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> so i had to try them and they were delicious! crispy chips with an amazing truffle cheese sauce and the blue cheese just added that extra salty tangy flavor to it. \n\nwe ordered the prosciutto pizza and it was really good. my favorite part of it was actually the arugula on top since it cut the richness of all the cheese and added a freshness to the pizza. we also got two of the pastas to share; the rigatoni and spaghetti & meatballs. both were excellent and very flavorful, i liked the spaghetti more. \n\nto end our meal we shared the chocolate souffl\\u00e9. i was hesitant on if i should get it or not at first since i was extremely full but i'm so glad i chose to. it was one of the most delicious desserts i've ever had. it had a nice crunchy top with a nice fluffy and rich inside. it also came with a caramel ice cream which went really well with the souffl\\u00e9. eating them together is the way to go not separately. \n\noverall an amazing experience and i'll definitely be back if i'm at the mgm grand.", 
            "every time i'm in vegas i must come here for the blue cheese <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark>, to die for!! today is our second visit in 3 days. they pair well with chef puck's chardonnay.", 
            "came here with my friend for a late lunch, and we had a wonderful time! we shared two dishes, as we were planning to eat later on with our other two friends. in short, the two dishes we ordered are a must!!\n\ntruffle <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> with blue cheese sauce - both of us were not a fan of blue cheese (but a huge fan of truffle!!!), so we asked to have the sauce on the side. when it arrived, there is a huge bowl of truffle cheese sauce goodness, and a small side of crumbled blue cheese, which we just ignored and was respectively offered to taken away by the sweet waiters. what a delicious appetizer it was! that sauce is absolutely divine - you can really taste the truffle and it being paired up with cheesy scrumptiousness is like pairing peanut butter and jelly; it just goes perfectly well. (if there was blue cheese in that cheese sauce, we didn't taste it!) if you don't care for the crumbled blue cheese, we really do recommend asking for the sauce on the side! having to dip each house made crispy chip into the sauce made it a little fun, and we didn't have to deal with any soggy chips or sauce being unevenly dispersed. \n\nsalmon with herb marinated couscous, lemon creme fraiche, and parsley pesto - we saw the table next to us order this, and it looked delicious! when asking which dish on the menu was it, she told us it was the salmon and that it really is delicious as it looks. per recommendation, we ordered it! the waitress asked how we would like the salmon cooked, and medium rare is what we picked. the salmon came out cooked to perfection; pink in the inside, flakey, moist, and bursting with flavor with the help of parsley pesto on the top. this paired with the tasty couscous with a light creamy lemon flavor of the lemon creme fraiche was a wonderful combination. the couscous also had bits of pine nuts and golden raisins, which gave great texture and little sweetness to the dish. the dish was garnished with basil, which is always a plus because basil + pesto + salmon is like the tasty trio! \n\nwe finished everything and left completely full! service was nothing short of amazing and accommodating - with smiles, plate changes, water cup constantly filled, etc. i only wished our other two friends were with us so they could experience a yummy meal....... also so we could have ordered more and tried out other dishes heh heh.", 
            "this place is so amazing!\nlet's start off the least liked item we ordered... the truffle chips with blue cheese sauce. they were mediocre. they didn't have an over powering blue cheese taste, however had a strong smell of the truffle oil. also they are <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> not fries. \n\nsecond item we ordered was the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>. and wow it was delicious. it isn't a classic <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> because the dressing they use is a garlic dressing. but wow it is really really good. (mouth is watering as i am typing the review). the romaine leaves were not chopped up, but more of a rustic approach. with tomatoes on top. and a few croutons on top.\n\nthird item we ordered was the spaghetti and meatballs!! holy moly!!! this was one of the best spaghetti and meatballs i have ever had. the meat balls are homemade. we had them split it for two and man it is a lot of food! we couldn't even finish it. \n\nthey also give complementary bread, however we opted out. didn't get to try the dessert but i am sure it's great since everything else was fantastic. the staff here is very friendly. would def. come\nback! great vibe and beyond delicious late night dinner.", 
            "we would come just for the <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> and we did just that the second time we were here! we have been twice over two  trips to vegas recently. this place is really amazing. the service is a 5/5++. everyone and i mean everyone is kind and attentive, welcoming you as you come in and saying thank you as you leave. it really made us feel good about the place. the food was also outstanding. the <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> are one of the best things my wife and i have ever eaten. i also had the steak both times which was perfectly cooked. my wife had a pasta dish once and the chicken and she said she loved both. we had a side of corn which was great and also mac and cheese was amazing. their bread is amazing.. we eat probably way too much bread but it was so good! :) the butter is soft when it arrives, not ice cold and hard which is a little thing but much appreciated if you like bread and butter like we both do. we had no room for dessert, but the offerings looked amazing. this is our favorite place in vegas currently. it is easy to get to, little to no wait as they have a big space, amazing food and amazing service. the value for your money is also great considering the quality and that it is vegas.\n\nwe can't wait to go back!",

(i love to hear my salads crunch for some reason) for my main course i had the meatballs & spaghetti with extra cheese on the side & it was to die for! i felt like & kid again without sucking up the noodles of course.  (i only do that at home) \ncheck this place out but be sure to make reservation\n\nsunny", 
            "my boyfriend and i were staying at the mgm  and decided to come here for lunch. the food was amazing!! we got the <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark>, <mark>Crispy Fried Calamari</mark>, and shared a pizza. however, it was some of the worst service i've ever had. our waitress was too busy talking to her coworkers to take our order... if it was busy i would understand but it was 3pm on a sunday and not busy at all. there was a lot of people walking around not really doing anything. we waited about 10 minutes and were about to walk out when she finally came over to our table. after finishing our appetizers and waiting for our pizza she never came over to refill our drinks or check on us. she was however about 10 feet away from us chatting and laughing with the hostess. we had to ask a busboy to refill our drinks. and my boyfriend had to ask twice for his water refill. service was overall disappointing but if you want a good meal you won't be disappointed with the food.", 
            "slacking on these reviews,, but trying to get back into it :d. \n\ndecided to come here because we were staying at mgm and didn't want to go through the hassle of going to another hotel and rushing back to get ready to go out. i made the reservation day of at around 3 pm for 14 people and told them that we were celebrating my boyfriend's birthday and they were able to accommodate.\n\nwhen we got to the restaurant, we were led to this little room near the wine rack. it was nice because there was a sliding door that separated us from everybody else, so we kind of got a private room. when we sat down and looked at the menu, it had \"happy birthday eric!\" on the top. i was so surprised! 5 stars for printing out new menus just for us :) service was amazing. always checked up on us and everybody who served us was very professional and friendly. \n\nthe menu is not too extensive, but there was a good variety of food. i ordered the ribeye and the <mark>Crispy Fried Calamari</mark>. the <mark>Crispy Fried Calamari</mark> was light and delicious, but i've never had bad <mark>Crispy Fried Calamari</mark>. the ribeye was very good. cooked perfectly medium rare. came with potatoes and some veggies. the glaze was a little on the sweet side, but not too overbearing. i was also able to try the chicken breast and let me tell you, it was the juiciest chicken i have ever had. probably would get this the next time we come here. the food did take a little while to come out, but i think it was cause they wanted to serve us all at the same time. \n\nall in all, food was good, service was amazing, and boy did they make us feel special. last but not least, we had a party of 14 and they didn't even charge the 18% gratuity!! our waiter told us that he was leaving it up to us, but of course we gave the 18% for the wonderful service we received. \n\ntakeaways: \n+ service!!!", 
            "\"wolfgang puck\" equals top-notch cooking with the sensible, clean tastes of california cuisine. but then there's \"bar and grill\" which equals accessible, unpretentious food. and this combination is exactly what this restaurant provides.\nthe menu was mostly pizzas and pastas in the $15 to $25 range plus the usual range of entrees ranging from $25 to the more than $50 steaks.\n\njeannene and i went with the the crispy-<mark>Crispy Fried Calamari</mark> appetizer. the batter and tenderness is what you would expect from any restaurant, let alone wolfgang puck's, but the star of this plate was the lemon aioli which was the perfect thick (but not goopy) creamy consistency and had the necessary acid. for the main course, i had the rigatoni with sweet fennel sausage bolognese. it was a creamy bolognese, which i've never had, and the rigatoni were half the size than the pasta i'm used to. both were improvements as the pasta was not clunky and the sauce had the cheese factor you often expect in an italian dish.\njeannene had a corn tortellini that she had no compaints about.\n\nto drink, i had the trampled rose, which featured rye whisky with five-spice syrup and cranberry liquor. the sweetness countered the blunt rye, which in turn kept the sweetness from being cloying. it tasted like thanksgiving. normally i get two different drinks but this time i demanded an encore,\n\nas far as ambiance, it is an open-walled dining room in the mgm grand's casino so it is either irritatingly noisy or full of energy depending on your mindset going in. as for me, the simple, perfect foods lowered the level of pretenciousness so i'm going with \"calm amid the casino storm.\""

            "thinking of the <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> is making me moist. the menu here, especially the appetizers, is brilliant. this is one of my favorite lunch time restaurants in vegas. \n\nthe atmosphere of wolfgang's is incredibly trendy. the restaurant is almost all white and features lots of curves. the tables were nice and chairs were pretty comfortable. the menu's were also presented very uniquely as they were posted on a wooden board and held on by a rubber band. \n\nthe service was exceptional. our waiter originally thought they were out of the <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> (i was completely distraught and screamed like a little girl) but then checked and reported to us that they just got a new shipment. appetizers were served promptly with the entrees coming just as we finished up. my soda glass was always atleast half full. \n\ni definitely recommend the appetizers. i've already mentioned the <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> which is one of the best dishes i've ever had in my life. it's a spicy tuna topped with avocado and served with lightly fried tortillas and a little bit of the most amazing chile sauce i've ever had. seriously, the thought of the <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> brings my buddy to tears. it's that good. \n\nwe also enjoyed the crab cake appetizer which was also quite exceptional.\n\nfor my entree i've had the mussels and the fish and chips. the mussels were served in a lemon garlic sauce with foccacia bread. the portions were extremely generous and it was a meal that i enjoyed very much. the fish and chips were disappointing because this restaurant does not have malt vinegar! luckily the fries were the bomb. you also get one of those mini catsup bottles to impress the ladies. \n\noverall this is a breathtaking lunch and is highly recommended. poker comps work here! get the <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> please.",

(thinking back through a hazy fog of blurred-together vegas memories)... the bread basket they brought: okay but cold. the boyfriend liked the olive foccacia, i would have liked it if it weren't the temperature of an ice cube. the caesar: meh. the low point of the meal. i liked how the romaine leaves were left whole for me to cut up, but i didn't care for the dressing. little too lemony. my own homemade caesar dressing is better. plus i kinda like croutons, the bruschetta was pretty good, but the croustini could have been a little less thin and wafer-y. (yes, i know, i'm being ultra-picky.) the <mark><mark>Mesquite Grilled Prime Flat Iron Steak</mark> Skewers</mark>: yum. cooked perfectly. nice presentation. tasty house-made steak sauce. someone else said the slaw it came with was underdressed, and they were completely right. actually it wasn't really dressed at all. but i could excuse that, cuz the steaks were so yummy. here's the pathetic part: i was feeling so shitty that i couldn't even finish the entire tiny little appetizer. there's five skewers, with about three or four bites of steak on each. i ended up taking two back to my room. yeah. beyond sad. but man they tasted good cold at three in the morning... \n\nthe bf's burger: can't really offer any useful commentary as i was not even remotely interested in taking a bite... under normal circumstances i would have been all over it. his fries were awesome though. i wish all bars had fries like this... and menus like this... \n\nwe had to box up our food and scramble the eff outta there cuz for some fool reason we wanted to rush up the strip to see the last free pirate show thingy at ti.... which they cancelled anyway when we got there at the last second. c'est la vegas, i guess. but yes, wolfgang puck is pretty good grubbin' for the money, and a great option if you don't happen to be clad in business casual at the moment and/or don't feel like spending $100+ on dinner.", 
            "this will sound strange but since my poor experience with a certain famous chef's restaurant in nola (i won't say who just that he says \"bam\" a lot) i have been dying to find another chef that has the same status or popularity and prove that not all celeb chef's build a restaurant and then just leave it to others to run (sorry mr. bam but i was deeply upset by the food). so mr. wolfgang puck was put to the test and he passed with flying colors!! \n\nthe puck man owners just a few (i believe he has 6) restaurants in vegas, we decided on puck's bar & grill located at the mgm grand. i'm going to start off by saying how hot the staff is!! they were really sweet too, extremely helpful and had the timing of the food/drinks down to a science. the d\\u00e9cor has an elegant yet modern-bold style to it, a lot of white and glass, plus it is open so you can watch everyone walk by from the casino. \n\nthe menu has this rustic (hence grill in the bar & grill vibe) beach front bistro feel to it. beautifully cooked and nothing short of fresh ingredients, each bite was just what was needed to satisfy the taste buds. calamari was excellent, spicy <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> was mind blowing, best tomato salad i've ever had, and a tomato pizza (which i have to say at first i was like pizza really) but it ended up absolutely an excellent way to combine all the ingredients of the night. \n\nso what really separated the two chefs are two very important things to a diner. flavor and price, puck hit the flavor perfectly and what he didn't do is sacrifice your wallet to get those flavors unlike mr. bam. the portion sizes were just right too, unlike mr. bam. i can't say that i have given up on the bam but he needs to take a few notes from wolfgang.",

            "these are my top 5 favorite things about this restaurant:\n\n1.  they are open from 11:30 a.m. until late into the night (i think they close at 6 a.m. in fact), so if you're looking for a classic lunch, a great dinner, a post-midnight snack or a very early breakfast, this is your place (they actually serve breakfast items from 11 p.m. onward).\n\n2.  location, location, location.  they're right in the center of the mgm next to the ka (cirque du soleil) theater and easily accessible from everywhere.\n\n3.  on their lunch menu they have an amazing blt which i often get without the \"b \"(thereby making it vegetarian-friendly).  it's awesome with or without the meat (maple <mark>'BLT' Sriracha Glazed Pork Belly</mark>) thanks to the wonderful combo of guacamole, arugula, and tomato on grilled sourdough.  i would also suggest getting their delicious onion rings on the side instead of the pasta salad. \n\n4.  the <mark>Chinois Chicken Salad</mark> - with or without chicken - is a wolfgang classic and a consistently great dish.  i believe it's available on every menu (lunch, dinner and late night).\n\n5.  the service is always friendly and prompt.\n\nsome other items that deserve a mention: <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare</mark>, corn chowder (when available), and pretzel bread.\n\nmy only criticism is that the desserts always seem off - we've tried the pies on multiple occasions and they consistently have that \"refrigerator\" flavor.  but overall, i love this place and highly recommend it.", 
            "pleasantly surprised by this gem amidst the mgm casino. dined here twice for dinner during my last weekend in vegas. pretty content with everything i ordered, and service was fast. \n\nthings i recommend - for appetizers, the <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare</mark>. for entrees, the turkey meatloaf and calves liver (yes i'm a carnivore if you couldn't already tell, but both were really good). the calves liver sounds kinda gross, but it was actually a very tender cut, with fried onions and pancetta. \n\ni would definitely recommend this restaurant as an alternative to the restaurants at the mgm walkway (which are slightly pricier). more casual ambiance, but a great place for a quick bite and no wait for tables.", 
            "we stopped in here for a snack and were pleasantly surprised. \n\nthe whole menu is a bit pricey, so i'm taking a star away. \n\nthe <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> appetizer is a deconstructed spicy tuna roll sans rice with some seasame chips. it was excellent and quite a large portion. we also had the calamari which was lightly breaded in panko and was cooked perfectly. the aioli that is served with it is excellent. i highly recommend both. \n\nservice was excellent. i recommend, just be ready to fork over a benjamin.",

            "i didn't know that they open till 6 am even on a sunday night! didn't know where to eat after our zumanity show at new york new york, we walked to mgm to find places to eat, i was glad a decent restaurant like wolfgang puck still served full menu! \n\nstarted with spicy <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare</mark>, the chips were so thin and crispy, fresh tuna with avocado on top, light with enough flavors. \n\nsteamed black mussels, with french fries: the mussels were so tender, great with the creamy cheese sauce, the sausages in it looked so yummy, but i couldn't taste it. \n\nhubby had clam linguini, same as i ordered last time: very delicious, the texture of the linguini was perfect, the smoked crispy <mark>'BLT' Sriracha Glazed Pork Belly</mark> bites were so flavorful. \n\ni had a bloody mary first, it was a weak drink, i ordered a corona too. our food was very good, not too heavy for late night, but still satisfying. the service was good like always. tab was $94, it's always around $95 for us when we eat here. \n\nlove this casual restaurant and bar open all night long!", 
            "i never thought twice about eating here until friends came to town and someone in the group suggested dining here. since i'm in a money-saving mode right now dining at this mid-level spot sounded like a good idea for eating on the strip. the atmosphere is lacking as the restaurant is completely open to the mgm grand casino making it impossible to ignore the ringing and buzzing from slot machines or the buzzed clientele of the hotel, clubs, and dayclubs. fortunately, the food made up for all of that.\n\ncorn chowder soup ($12) - lots of corn kernels and bits of bacon in a velvety smooth soup. great flavor.\n\nbutter lettuce <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> ($13) - portions are big so you may want to share. like a true caesar they put anchovies on it.\n\nspicy <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> ($21) - not bad. a little on the sweet side with its use of soy sauce for its asian influence. the flavors were ok and i liked the sesame crackers.\n\nlasagna ($21) - who knew you could find good lasagna in a restaurant owned by an austrian that serves a fusion of multiple cuisines? it was a perfect combination of savoriness with the sausage bolognese and sweetness from the cheese and bechamel.\n\ncheese and basil pesto ravioli ($21) - i didn't try it but the person who ordered it had to send it back because it wasn't cooked all the way.\n\n<mark>House Made Ricotta Gnocchi</mark> ($23) - dense but still tasty.\n\nsteamed black mussels ($25) - another dish that was huge. good enough for two to share. plenty of plump, juicy mussels in a savory sauce.\n\nchicken fingers ($6.95) - always a crowd pleaser for kids. the portion size was large enough for 3 kids to share but we only have one. there were plenty of leftovers for the next two nights.\n\nthe food here is simple, as they cater to price conscious tourists who aren't adventurous eaters, but it's executed well. the menu is all over the place with asian, italian, and american dishes so chances are you and everyone in your party will find something to eat. it's not a destination restaurant, but certainly a good option for those staying nearby or those looking for a reasonably priced meal on the strip.\n\n3.5 stars", 
            "great service. as with any of wolfgang's places great pizza. had the spicy <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> and it was very flavorful, the beignet dessert is really good.\n\nour server was very attentive and friendly. he also had great recommendations and knowledge of the menu.\n\na big fan of wp restaurants; this one is up to par as the rest.", 
            "we always have dinner here before any event at the mgm, reason is its convenient the service is quick especially if you short of time. we got right in without a reservation and we were a party of 8.\n\nwe ordered the <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> , loved it presentation and taste was yummy.  the <mark><mark>Mesquite Grilled Prime Flat Iron Steak</mark> Skewers</mark> were my favorite, was not over cooked  so we got 2 orders\nthe chonise <mark>Chinois Chicken Salad</mark> a must\nour drinks berry mojito just perfect.\nit was noisy but that was because it's super bowl weekend and  pink in concert. \nour waiter was very attentive",

            "every time we come to vegas, we never fail to stop by this joint. it's awesome for efficient service and is open till the wee hours of the night :) \n\nthis time we had the... \n1. <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> - which was raw tuna mixed with spicy mayo, a little bit of teriyaki sauce (as far as my tastebuds could tell) and topped with avocado. almost like a sushi without the rice! it was delicious! the crispy golden wanton chips were the perfect companion for this dish. too bad we only had 4 chips!!! unlike at pacific catch where they give you more than you can count! \n\n2. <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cakes</mark> - the waiter was very accommodating. even though <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cakes</mark> was not on the menu for the evening he put in a special request for us. they were delicious! \n\n\n3. lastly, dessert - chocolate beignets -  my favorite!!! except this time, they didn't have chocolate, instead they had regular beignets stuff with light citrus tasting custard. it was even better than the chocolate beignets! chocolate beignets with chocolate dip can get a little excessive and i could never eat more than 3. however, regular beignet felt much lighter in comparison and i could easily waffle down 4 with  a nice not-too-sweet caramel toffee dip.", 
            "natalie and her partner \"the 70's porn star\" were awesome last night behind the bar!  the food and drinks were perfect!  natalie gave her recommendations and she was right!  the <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> was fresh and tasty, the spaghetti w/meatballs was freaking awesome, and my wife had the veggie pizza that was very fresh and was cooked perfectly!!!  the customer service was perfect!  both bartenders really seemed to enjoy talking to is and it made the experience perfect!  thank you", 
            "i thought this restaurant was amazing. before i get to the food, the service was really considerate and attentive even though i was with a rather large party. a few of us were cashing in their myvegas rewards and it went through without any hassle. the staff and their friendly attitude already set us in a good mood.\n\nwithout further ado, the food was a+. for the appetizers, i was able to try a bit of the <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> and that was delicious. the flavors blended together so nicely that i wished i had my own order. \n\nas for the entrees, i had the grilled salmon and frankly, it was one of the best salmon dishes i've ever had. it was seared beautifully; the outside was crisp while the inside was slightly undercooked. i also got to try my friend's ribeye (great) and the linguini with grilled shrimp (as a pasta lover, this was very good). moreover, i tried brussel sprouts for the first time here and i couldn't stop eating it!\n\noverall, i felt that this restaurant was worth the hype. everything, from the food to the service, was on point. i would definitely dine here again if i'm back in sin city.", 
            "to reduce the price of dinner we decided to eat at wolfgang puck. \nwe ordered a pineapple mojito (12 dollar), a hurricane (16 dollar) and a coke (4,50 dollar). \nwe shared the starter (<mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> 21 dollar) which was very good. our son wanted a lasagne (21 dollar). remark : very strange taste. the shrimp pasta (26 dollar) was too expensive. the fish of the day was very casual (33 euro) so also too expensive.\nwe ended with a pear cheesecake (12 dollar) which was better the day before somewhere else.... the cafe latte was ok (4,50 dollar).\nthe waiter was too pushy for his tip, in spite of a bill from 162,42 dollar.....\nthe prices are raised and we don't see a reason why... no extra service or something special to order.\nfor being 'a brasserie' it's not worth at all.\nwe will not return, because for this price, we can eat better somewhere else.",

            "for value at mgm this may the place. service rivals the best places. location is in the action of the casino. nice broad spanning menu. get the <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> and shrimp appetizer. great wine selection. nice specialty beers on tap. for something simple get burger. up there with the best. wife ordered mushroom ravioli. all pastas made in house. her ravioli was impeccable. order of again.", 
            "walked in on a late 1am friday morning.  basically hungry from our flight and just wanted to that white castle craving to go away.  \n\nluckily, there were plenty of tables open, so we were seated right away without reservation.  the dining area was set up nicely and clean.  appearance was colorful,  modern, and quite unique.  we were served by albert, and he was attentive from beginning to end.  only that's about it.\n\nso, we started with the <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> ($11) with a blue cheese sauce.  these were superb, but not anything to rave about.  i mean, i love truffle and i love blue cheese, but it couldn't keep my mind off those belly bombers.  i guess the chips and sauce really brought out the saltiness.  meh, i knew i wanted the <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> instead, oh well.  \n\nnow the ceasar salad ($13) was a winner, well kind of.  fresh baby romaine leaves with the ceasar salad dressing.  though it tasted great, only i personally thought it was small for the price.  the croutons were big and tasteless as well.  \n\nthen there was the <mark>Jidori Half Chicken</mark> ($28) with vegtables, a <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>, topped with rosemary au jus, and a side of kale salad.  now, for $28 this better be the best chicken ever.  it was excellent, but not the best ever!  full of flavor, but you had to mix it all together to drown the over-saltiness.  \n\nbecause of these dishes, we ordered their cheapest bottle of white wine, the nuschese pinot grigio ($32).  a suitable choice especially for the chicken and salad.  a surprisingly enjoyable wine.  thanks again to albert's recommendation, it made for a good compliment;  and we just killed that bottle!\n\nso, overall, i've gone to several wolfgang puck locations and this just confirms i'm not a fan of his style.  after spending a total of $103 for two people, i simply feel this place is overrated and overpriced.  this place already put me in the hole!", 
            "by far, my favorite restaurant in vegas! from the service to the decor and finally the food, everything is exquisite. best dishes: <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare</mark>, mushroom ravioli and chocolate souffl\\u00e9. you won't be disappointed.",

            "bartender service was good but the <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> wasn't anything special. it was fishy and lacked texture. disappointed i then ordered calamari which was super salty as well. at least the beer was good? $56 later...i was a sad solo eater.", 
            "fish was over cooked both times. service was slow. food was truly mehhhhhh. <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> was great!!! but that was the only saving grace. waiter with mustaches are the worst.(side note) go to the steakhouse instead.", 
            "had lunch here midweek. had the <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> as an appetizer, just melted in our mouths and only wish there was a little more spicy mayo sauce. i could not decide on the pasta so the waitress offered to bring a bit of each, i have never had a waiter do that before. i had rigatoni, gnocchi, and a meatball. each one was perfect and next time i am going to get the spaghetti and meatballs. wife had the tuna <mark>Chicken Salad Sandwich</mark> which was very good. a little expensive but worth it, we have never had a bad meal at any puck restaurant.", 
            "i didn't expect the restaurant to be smack dab in the mgm casino floor, but it was. you'd assume that the smell of smoke would overpower any glorious smell that came out of the wolfgang kitchen, but to my surprise, i didn't smell any cigarette smoke at all.\n\ncame here with a myvegas voucher, which was super easy to use (basically call the myvegas number and they input it in the system, no need to tell your server about it). \n\nahi <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> was really good. the black sea same wonton skins gave the dish a nice crunch and complimented the tartare. i'd order this again.\n\nthe <mark>House Made Ricotta Gnocchi</mark> was decent, as well as the linguine with clams. i did get a couple minor sandy clams which was a bit bummer. some clams were also cooked perfectly, whereas others were pretty chewy. these dishes weren't bad, but i'd explore the menu a bit next time.\n\nthe chocolate souffl\\u00e9 was to die for. seriously heavenly and i'm not a huge chocolate fan. the lady at the table next to us was just staring at it and then finally asked if it was good. duh! definite recommendation.\n\nour server was nice and staff were attentive. great experience."

            "a great way to start this past vegas weekend!\n\nat 8pm, the wait was only 15 minutes.  the three of us started out with pomegranate mojitos, <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cakes</mark> and <mark>Crisp Chicken Wings</mark>.  everything was delicious!  the butter that came out with the rolls was whipped and creamy and before you know it, we were gobbling up the bread and butter that came to the table.  what a mistake!  of course we ate too much so that by the time our entrees came out (<mark>Mesquite Grilled Prime Flat Iron Steak</mark> with fries, rib eye with carmelized cauliflower), we were so full!  still, that didn't stop us from thoroughly enjoying every last morsel.  oh, the food was so good....\n\nour waitress was friendly and quick and my only regret was that i didn't order more mojitos.", 
            "honestly, this place was pretty awful. we stopped there for a late 2pm lunch (pretty normal by vegas standards). we were hungry, a little hungover, and wanted something close (we stayed at mgm) and good... and we figured it said 'wolfgang puck' on the outside so we should be in good hands.\n\nwe ordered what was supposed to be fried <mark>Crisp Chicken Wings</mark> for an appetizer... instead we got these really strange fried bone things. they seriously looked like a fried wontonwith a huge rat bone sticking out of them. and to our surprise, there was supposedly chicken in there mixed in with some strange tasting batter and some sort of vegetable...we couldn't tell. the strangest thing was that on the menu it literally said fried <mark>Crisp Chicken Wings</mark>, not 'weird mystery meat and vegetable drumstick thing'. \n\neverything else we ordered was either greasy, oversalted, or just overpriced. puck needs to either take his name off this place or revamp it. skip it and eat somewhere else.", 
            "okay... we're in the mgm, i'm not really hungry but after a seemingly endless day of walking, drinking and gambling i really should feed myself, and emeril's is closed. plus my boyfriend is wearing sandals and i'll be damned if i'm going to hike all the way back to the riviera (!) to change. ugh... oh? what's this? a bar and grill in the middle of the casino? hmmm... oh, it's wolfgang puck? ok, hell, why not. i'm a sucker for celebrity chefs. \n\nwe walk in at about 10:10 pm and are seated promptly, our waiter almost immediately coming by to ask for drink orders. all i had was water and the bf had a beer. menu was interesting... like a bar and grill menu done right. good old <mark>Crisp Chicken Wings</mark> and pizzas, as well as things like <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> and <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cakes</mark>. i ended up getting the <mark><mark>Mesquite Grilled Prime Flat Iron Steak</mark> Skewers</mark> and a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>. the bf got the burger.\n\nlet's see here.... (thinking back through a hazy fog of blurred-together vegas memories)... the bread basket they brought: okay but cold. the boyfriend liked the olive foccacia, i would have liked it if it weren't the temperature of an ice cube. the caesar: meh. the low point of the meal. i liked how the romaine leaves were left whole for me to cut up, but i didn't care for the dressing. little too lemony. my own homemade caesar dressing is better. plus i kinda like croutons, the bruschetta was pretty good, but the croustini could have been a little less thin and wafer-y. (yes, i know, i'm being ultra-picky.) the <mark><mark>Mesquite Grilled Prime Flat Iron Steak</mark> Skewers</mark>: yum. cooked perfectly. nice presentation. tasty house-made steak sauce. someone else said the slaw it came with was underdressed, and they were completely right. actually it wasn't really dressed at all. but i could excuse that, cuz the steaks were so yummy. here's the pathetic part: i was feeling so shitty that i couldn't even finish the entire tiny little appetizer. there's five skewers, with about three or four bites of steak on each. i ended up taking two back to my room. yeah. beyond sad. but man they tasted good cold at three in the morning... \n\nthe bf's burger: can't really offer any useful commentary as i was not even remotely interested in taking a bite... under normal circumstances i would have been all over it. his fries were awesome though. i wish all bars had fries like this... and menus like this... \n\nwe had to box up our food and scramble the eff outta there cuz for some fool reason we wanted to rush up the strip to see the last free pirate show thingy at ti.... which they cancelled anyway when we got there at the last second. c'est la vegas, i guess. but yes, wolfgang puck is pretty good grubbin' for the money, and a great option if you don't happen to be clad in business casual at the moment and/or don't feel like spending $100+ on dinner.",

            "didn't realize wolfgang puck had a place at the mgm until i walked right in front of it and decided we had to have a late lunch here: opted to share appetizers, a pizza, and a dessert. pricing wasn't bad at all, casual style and cuisine.\n\ncrab cake appetizer: four small cakes, didn't hold up too well, plated with a tasty creole mustard remoulade. \n\nchili-glazed <mark>Crisp Chicken Wings</mark>: awkward pile of a portion, stacked like firewood on the plate. the wing i got looked like it came out of a lab and seemed to be a rib instead of a wing? flavor of the glaze was light and wasn't spicy. \n\npizza: prosciutto, kalamata olives, tomatoes, basil pesto, goat cheese\ncrust was amazing, prosciutto was high quality, cheese and pesto were delicious. felt like the kalamata olives didn't work with the other ingredients, made the overall flavor profile too salty for my liking. \n\nbeignets: large order of seven pieces, stuffed with a light lemon filling and served with a toffee-like dipping sauce. flavors didn't work well together but pastry was light and well-constructed.\n\nservice and setting were alright- tables are quite small and even with just three of us, drinks, and a limited number of orders, things were crammed onto the table with barely enough room.  plates weren't cleared when they were empty but instead had to be picked up when the next dishes were brought out, either poor timing or a lack of attention.",

            "the selection here is pretty limited for food options. lots of meat selections, some vegetarian but i don't think there were any vegan options. we ordered the <mark>Crisp Chicken Wings</mark> appetizer and mushroom pizza. both were tasty but i would much prefer to try the other restaurants in the casino or on the strip before coming back here.", 
            "the food was awesome. from the appetizer to the main course, my husband loved his spaghetti and meatballs. i loved my shrimp scampi. the <mark>Crisp Chicken Wings</mark> were great too. would definitely visit this place again.",

(thinking back through a hazy fog of blurred-together vegas memories)... the bread basket they brought: okay but cold. the boyfriend liked the olive foccacia, i would have liked it if it weren't the temperature of an ice cube. the caesar: meh. the low point of the meal. i liked how the romaine leaves were left whole for me to cut up, but i didn't care for the dressing. little too lemony. my own homemade caesar dressing is better. plus i kinda like croutons, the bruschetta was pretty good, but the croustini could have been a little less thin and wafer-y. (yes, i know, i'm being ultra-picky.) the <mark><mark>Mesquite Grilled Prime Flat Iron Steak</mark> Skewers</mark>: yum. cooked perfectly. nice presentation. tasty house-made steak sauce. someone else said the slaw it came with was underdressed, and they were completely right. actually it wasn't really dressed at all. but i could excuse that, cuz the steaks were so yummy. here's the pathetic part: i was feeling so shitty that i couldn't even finish the entire tiny little appetizer. there's five skewers, with about three or four bites of steak on each. i ended up taking two back to my room. yeah. beyond sad. but man they tasted good cold at three in the morning... \n\nthe bf's burger: can't really offer any useful commentary as i was not even remotely interested in taking a bite... under normal circumstances i would have been all over it. his fries were awesome though. i wish all bars had fries like this... and menus like this... \n\nwe had to box up our food and scramble the eff outta there cuz for some fool reason we wanted to rush up the strip to see the last free pirate show thingy at ti.... which they cancelled anyway when we got there at the last second. c'est la vegas, i guess. but yes, wolfgang puck is pretty good grubbin' for the money, and a great option if you don't happen to be clad in business casual at the moment and/or don't feel like spending $100+ on dinner.",

            "i have come to realize that wolfgang puck's name is all over las vegas.  he seems to have a restaurant in every casino on the las vegas strip (am exaggerating but you get the idea).  my boyfriend ate something with pancetta in it last year and it changed his life.  he kept talking about it all year long so we decided to reawaken his taste buds by returning to wolfgang puck bar and grill.\n\nthere seems to always be a wait but never a long one.  the restaurant is practically smack dab in the middle of the casino making it easy to find.  unfortunately i was sitting right next to this giant light in the ground that blinded me every time i shifted in my seat.  i was tempted to ask to be seated elsewhere but i was too hungry to move so i just sucked it up.  but the next time you're about to get seated next to this giant twine sculpture with the light in the ground, i advise you to ask to be seated elsewhere before you plant your bottom.\n\nwe were disappointed to see that the menu has changed since the last time we were there and my boyfriend could not find his heavenly pancetta risotto dish and settled for a pancetta wrapped meatloaf instead.  i quickly snuck a peek at yelp to see whats good and decided on a wild mushroom ravioli.  the waiter sadly informed me that the dish was no longer available and recommended the gnocchi with a bolognese sauce.  although i was a bit disappointed, i went with his suggestion.  we also decided to start with the <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cakes</mark> as we were both ravishingly hungry by this time.\n\nthe <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cakes</mark> came out in four tiny little cakes.  albeit rather small, they were packed with flavor.  i would return just to get three orders of the <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cakes</mark> for myself.  the pancetta wrapped meatloaf was nothing like your mother used to make.  the pancetta was baked to a nice crisp while the meatloaf was soft and juicy.  my gnocchi was good but i probably wouldn't get it again.  it was not very memorable and it was just so-so to me.  i think i was just bummed that i didn't get to try the ravioli that my fellow yelpers raved about.", 
            "we ended up having a light dinner & cocktails here last minute before seeing ka. glad we did because it was delicious! we ordered some appetizers and shared them. this was enough for the 5 of us (also ended up with 2 enormous baskets of assorted bread because we had about 4 different people waiting on us for some reason) - \n\n-heirloom tomato caprese, fresh mozzarella, basil aioli, aged balsamic\n-<mark>Crispy Fried Calamari</mark>, cucumber slaw, lemon, gremolata aioli\n-saut\\u00e9ed maine <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cakes</mark>, tomato relish, basil aioli\n-<mark><mark>Mesquite Grilled Prime Flat Iron Steak</mark> Skewers</mark>, creamy celery salad, house steak sauce\n-<mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark>, maytag blue cheese sauce\n\ncocktails- prosecco, cucumber martini (favorite drink of the trip), orange blossom, pineapple mojito\n\nthe <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> were outstanding!!! i seriously could've eaten the whole plate myself. very rich flavor and the bleu cheese was the best i've ever had. <mark><mark>Mesquite Grilled Prime Flat Iron Steak</mark> Skewers</mark> were my second favorite, really tender & the sauce was terrific. calamari was good but didn't stand a chance against federal hill's.  heirloom caprese salad was refreshing and the <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cakes</mark> were good but tiny. they did offer to give us an extra because only 4 came in an order.  wish we had time for dessert because the chocolate beignets looked out of this world. next time i'm in vegas i'll def come back.", 
            "use ur m life points here!\n\nwe stumbled here the first day for lunch because were gambling and needed a break from all the losses. after finding out we could use our m life rewards here, we came back again the next day!  this originally wasn't on my list of places to eat, but being near the casino floor we decided to stop in for what we thought would be a mediocre but quick lunch. the waiter came by and gave us the normal spiel of what were the specials for the day, which i honestly never pay attention to. however, my boyfriend does, and he noticed that their special, not on their menu, was a salmon burger with corn based slaw onions etc. \n\nfood we ordered from both visits:\nsalmon burger - omg. amazing. this is off the menu so if you're coming here and you love salmon as much as i do and love corn as much as i do, make sure you ask for this. i've had salmon burgers elsewhere that i thought were great, but this is amazing!! i'm so glad that our waiter came by and mentioned that it was off the menu. if i weren't coming back to try the other recommended items from yelpers the second day, i would've ordered it again. \n\n<mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> with maytag blue cheese - ordered this per yelper's recommendations. so yums!!! the <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> were not thin but not super thick, made just the right width with the right crunchiness. i love truffle oil and i love it when its used right. you could definitely taste the truffle oil on the chips. it's not overpowering. i'm also generally not a big fan of blue cheese on anything else but my salads, but there wasn't enough. plus you can always brush it off when you're eating the potato chip, it doesn't leave a residue taste on the chip either.\n\n<mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cakes</mark> - ordered this per yelpers recommendations as well. they come out in 4 or 5 what looks like tiny <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cakes</mark>, but they are made exquisitely and i have to say even being located in desert nevada, these <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cakes</mark> were fresh and delicious! i hate it when people put in so many crumbs it takes away from the crab stuffing or the crab flavour. that wasn't the case at all. it wasn't an overpowering crab taste either. i highly recommend ordering these! \n\nreuben sandwich - my boyfriend ordered this. i'm not a huge fan of reuben's but he said it was ok. he asked for no cheese on his reuben, but it came out with cheese anyway. the one good thing about this was he asked for a substitute of a salad for his french fries, and the salad that came out was fresh and delicious!\n\nspicy <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> - this was a good order. i tried a few other <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare</mark>'s that week in vegas and this was definitely the best one that i tried. i liked the wonton's that came with it too. the chip was thick and crunchy. \n\nbbq pork spare ribs - ordered this bc we had m life points to spend (wut wut in the mgm). they were made well, but being from the south i've definitely tasted better ribs. but since these were comped ribs, i have no complaints. hahaha.\n\nspicy sopressata pizza - my boyfriend ordered this as well. i'm not a fan of spicy things on my pizza but he was a big fan of this pizza. he highly highly recommends it. \n\ndidn't have room during either visit for dessert but nothing on the menu super caught my eye. \n\natmosphere/decor: i loved the decor! it was spacious and light, with enough ambiance to create a non-casino feel. it had an open view of the casino games around us, but also enough baracades (these round wooden bigger than life wreath type things) to close you in on your eating and dining experience. it does get a lil loud but not loud enough for you to yell to your eating mates. \n\nservice - service was great. the waiters were always attentive but not hovering, and they always made sure that we had water in our cups (which we needed since we came in the middle of scorching hot 120 degree july). i also liked that they sent things out as they were ready, not \"when they're supposed to come out.\" really liked that about the place. \n\ni love this place. it's incredibly reasonably priced, even if you don't use your comp points here. i loved the casualness yet classy feel of the place. definitely highly recommended if you're in the area, or if you just wanna stop by for a quick lunch. its a good break from all the smoking as well. huge props to wolfgang and chef scott irestone for the amazing work they did here!", 
            "as mgm's option for a cafe, wolfgang's teeters on a casual and upscale dining experience. the completely open restaurant has few obstructions on the inside or from the outside. too bad the people that wander by do not make for good people watching. \n\nthe food is delicious, but what made it better was the overall service. at points they were inattentive, but the complete experience was not bad. the fact that we shared everything and did not have to ask for anything to be split or an extra plate was amazing. they served our <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cakes</mark>, burger, and kabocha pumpkin agnolotti pasta as separate items for us. that simple gesture was impressive to me. \n\nthe crab cake came in an order of four. the light mixture of tomatoes and basil enhanced the sweetness of the crab well. the burger was salty. it is not a knock your socks off type of ordeal. the pasta was my favorite. the kabocha resembles a butternut squash and takes on the flavor of the brown butter sage sauce. the toast hazelnuts adds a much needed textural variation. \n\nwe ended our meal with the chocolate beignets. not a beignet! it is more of a chocolate lava cake doughnut hole. they are good if you look at them like that, but as a beignet they failed.",

            "ate at wolfgang puck twice during my stay, and both times it was great.\nthe first night, we had all arrived later in the evening and wanted a late night, light dinner. the staff was still very friendly, and service was quick. i ordered the prosciutto/olive/and goat cheese pizza, the crust was crunchy not soggy and the flavors blended well. others with me had the minestrone soup, loved it and two had the <mark>Chinois Chicken Salad</mark>, they raved about it. we all ordered a glass of wine here, the wine was much better and less expensive than rouge. two thumbs up!!\n\nday two. on a quick break from the conference i was attending, two of us in the goup decided to go back for lunch. again, service was very friendly and service quick. this time i ordered the minestrone soup and i have to say it really was delicious. the beans cooked perfectly and the veggies were done with a bit of crunch. i would have licked the bowl if i could have, it really was so good.",

            "***not as expensive or overpriced as the many celebrity chef restaurants in las vegas (though still pricey), wolfgang puck bar & grill is a decent spot that serves satisfying (though not great) food***\n\ndespite the many well-known restaurants (especially those backed by celebrity chefs) in las vegas, there are not many that are open for lunch.  that is what makes wolfgang puck bar & grill, which is located on the casino floor of the mgm hotel, so convenient.  i believe it is open all day and wolfgang puck utilizes better ingredients than a lot of its daytime sit-down competition.\n\ndespite its convenience, wolfgang puck bar & grill is just an okay restaurant (not a great one).  most of the dishes are fine and taste good, but i have yet to have something here (in my 3 visits) that felt noticeably better than the food other good vegas restaurants put out.\n\nwolfgang puck bar & grill sits smack down in the middle of the casino.  it is pretty open to the casino with no big walls.  maybe it was where we sat or that the casino was not that busy, but the smoke-filled casino did not feel that obtrusive here.  the decor has the look of a bright cafe with light yellow and golden brown colors and nice but casual tables and chairs.\n\nwe started with the truffled (strong truffle flavor) <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark>, which were topped with a chunky and rich maytag blue cheese sauce.  the housemade chips were flavorful and seasoned right but unevenly crisp--some were crisp and some were soft (some chips were made even softer / soggier due to the heavy coating of blue cheese).  overall, it was an okay starter though you may want to steer clear if you are not a fan of blue cheese.\n\nwe also shared the <mark>Chinois Chicken Salad</mark>, which was tossed with candied peanuts, crisp wontons and a chinese mustard vinaigrette.  overall, it was a flavorful and fresh salad with a good balance of ingredients, but it was not as good as the original <mark>Chinois Chicken Salad</mark> from chinois on main in santa monica.  the reason was that the salad was over dressed.  it kind of lost its crispness and it was overdressed in the vinaigrette (too soggy).\n\nfor my entree, i had the blt, which included maple <mark>'BLT' Sriracha Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, arugula, vine ripe tomatoes, and avocado on buttered sourdough toast.  the <mark>'BLT' Sriracha Glazed Pork Belly</mark> was sweet and flavorful.  i thought it was going to be braised and soft (and then crispy on the outside); however, the <mark>'BLT' Sriracha Glazed Pork Belly</mark> here lacked that tender texture.  instead, the <mark>'BLT' Sriracha Glazed Pork Belly</mark>'s texture was more dense like thick bacon or lean spare ribs.  it was still good, but i would have preferred a thicker piece of braised (tender) <mark>'BLT' Sriracha Glazed Pork Belly</mark> over the spare rib-like texture here.\n\nthe lettuce, tomato and avocado were all fine.  like the <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark>, the sandwich was heavily dressed.  i was not a big fan of the sourdough.  the bread was okay, but it was over-buttered and slightly greasy.  the blt came with a side of cold vegetable pasta salad, which was a standard cold pasta salad.\n\ni tried my friend's kabocha pumpkin tortellini with sage brown butter, toasted hazelnuts and parmesan.  i had a very similar pumpkin tortellini dish at drago ristorante in santa monica.  the pasta dish at wolfgang puck was flavorful and pretty good (probably the best thing we had here).  that being said, i liked drago's version better because it was lighter, had a more subtle flavor and was less complicated.\n\nservice was very good.  the waiter jeremy was a very nice guy.  he was pleasant and friendly as well as enthusiastic and passionate about the food.  food came out at a good pace and the staff was attentive.\n\nprices for lunch were okay.  there were several options here that were around $20 or less.  you would pay about the same at some of the las vegas cafes, but i imagine you are more likely to walk away satisfied if you spent your money here.\n\nwolfgang puck bar & grill has convenient hours and puts out tasty (though not remarkable) food.  i've been here a few times and the restaurant has shown a lot of consistency in delivering (at the very least) decent food.  that is what makes wolfgang puck bar & grill a decent and safe option for lunch in las vegas.  \n\nthe mgm grand hotel provides complimentary parking (both valet and self-parking via a parking structure).",

            "dined for lunch yesterday with my husband and mother in law.  \n\nwe shared the chinoise chinese <mark>Chinois Chicken Salad</mark> to start while she had the caeser.  our salad was really tasty. roasted peanuts and shredded chicken all chopped into fork size combinable bites.  it needed salt, but otherwise, quite good.  the caeser is legit.  it comes with anchovies thick , rich, creamy dressing, and parmesan.  the bread basket is very nice too, three choices, foccacia, french and a raisin served with softened whipped butter.  thank you wp, i absolutely hat e it when my butter is cold and rips my bread.\n\nnext we shared thje <mark>'BLT' Sriracha Glazed Pork Belly</mark> blt and the sweet corn ravioli.  the blt was good but didn't knock my socks off.  the portion was large; the sandwick was served with a big bowl of flavorful pasta slad.  the <mark>'BLT' Sriracha Glazed Pork Belly</mark> was delicious, of course.  i was dissapointed in the caliber of tomato on the sandwich.  it was a cheap snotty slice expected form a fast food burger.  the ravioli was pure bliss.  sweet corn puree delicately placed in between fresh pasta, and topped with shaved truffles, shaved parmesan and bitty buttery <mark>Mushroom</mark>.  whoa! so good.  mil had a salmon burger on special and it quickly dissapeared, must have been good.\n\nwe finished with a latte and the choclate beigneits with caramel sauce and vanilla ice cream.  they were essentialy molten doughnut holes with an enjoyable bittersweet flavor.  my latte was perfection.  \n\ni was surprised when our bill was only $90.  seemed reasonable to me for three people with three courses in the mgm for lunch.  i even had food to take home.  this is proabaly my 5th time dining here at wp and they really do a nice job.  \n\nservice was good, we ended up getting everything we needed.  a bit slow, especially for the level of business, but we weren't in a a hurry.",

            "these are my top 5 favorite things about this restaurant:\n\n1.  they are open from 11:30 a.m. until late into the night (i think they close at 6 a.m. in fact), so if you're looking for a classic lunch, a great dinner, a post-midnight snack or a very early breakfast, this is your place (they actually serve breakfast items from 11 p.m. onward).\n\n2.  location, location, location.  they're right in the center of the mgm next to the ka (cirque du soleil) theater and easily accessible from everywhere.\n\n3.  on their lunch menu they have an amazing blt which i often get without the \"b \"(thereby making it vegetarian-friendly).  it's awesome with or without the meat (maple <mark>'BLT' Sriracha Glazed Pork Belly</mark>) thanks to the wonderful combo of guacamole, arugula, and tomato on grilled sourdough.  i would also suggest getting their delicious onion rings on the side instead of the pasta salad. \n\n4.  the <mark>Chinois Chicken Salad</mark> - with or without chicken - is a wolfgang classic and a consistently great dish.  i believe it's available on every menu (lunch, dinner and late night).\n\n5.  the service is always friendly and prompt.\n\nsome other items that deserve a mention: <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare</mark>, corn chowder (when available), and pretzel bread.\n\nmy only criticism is that the desserts always seem off - we've tried the pies on multiple occasions and they consistently have that \"refrigerator\" flavor.  but overall, i love this place and highly recommend it.", 
            "we liked this place. but didn't love. maybe because we were recovering from our afternoon drinking/blackjack binge, but everything was just good. good mac and chz, good salmon, good truffle chips, good <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cakes</mark>. recommended as a solid meal with impeccable service, but it probably won't make your top 10 meals of all time list. get the ginger line iced tea, it was excellent, as was the service - from the host to the busboys, everyone was awesome.\nok...part 2.  because everything at mgm closes at 10pm (except this place), we ate here again the very next night.  we had the chinese <mark>Chinois Chicken Salad</mark>, brussel sprouts, <mark>Crisp Chicken Wings</mark> and the chopped veg salad.  everything was great.  food that is.  service was uneven.  \nwe may end up back here again, actually.  i can't believe everything else closes so early.",

            "i have been staying at mgm grand since sunday and i have to say if you are in vegas and want to ensure you get a quality meal for the price then come here!  i have had quite a few items on the menu after experiencing terrible food elsewhere and everything was perfect! dashi soup awesome! chicken noodle? incredible! i ate the <mark>Chinois Chicken Salad</mark> twice it was so goo! burger? yummy! and an incredible seasonal fish dish and creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e! best part? amazing service all around!", 
            "lots of delicious options with a great space!\n\ni really like this restaurant for many reasons & it's a casual location with really great food. its open to the casino floor & it has great energy. i've never ordered something i didn't enjoy & as for the decor goes it's surrounded by roses...i love it!\n\nsome of the dishes i recommend are the <mark>Jidori Half Chicken</mark>, <mark>Chinois Chicken Salad</mark> & all the pasta dishes! i'm a big fan! \n\nthe service is always great!", 
            "their <mark>Chinois Chicken Salad</mark> sandwich on cranberry pecan bread is to die for! i was in heaven the whole time eating it and got sad as it came to an end. the flavors of the <mark>Chinois Chicken Salad</mark> and the bread were a perfect combo. both savory with a tint of sweet. it also came with a light salad which i loved as well. for $15, i'd say it's a steal for vegas and very generous portions! i'm totally going back for more next time!", 
            "i just got back and it was great! after spending the day in a training class and walking for two and a half hours, i was exhausted and hungry. i had the <mark>Chinois Chicken Salad</mark>: the portion was huge and the flavor divine. the service at the counter is very friendly, attentive and quick.  this restaurant is a very well oiled machine, with very efficient employees.",

            "my friends i headed here immediately after exiting the ka by cirque du soleil show just across the way. it was around 8:30 p.m. on a tuesday night and our wait for a table was about 5 mins. \n\ni ordered the calamari & mushroom and truffle pizza as our appetizers. both were really good. the mushroom with truffle pizza was the best pizza i've ever had. i also had a couple of pineapple mojito's and it was excellent. \n\nmy entree was wolfgang's <mark>Chinois Chicken Salad</mark>. absolutely yummy however for $16, i expected it to be off the hook. given the upscale feel of the restaurant and its ambiance, i guess paying $16 is a little justified.\n\nthis restaurant is a must try if you're ever visiting or staying in the mgm grand hotel.", 
            "had lunch at wolfgang puck today, mostly because it was the first appealing option we came across while at the mgm at 2pm. here are my thoughts:\n\nambiance: just okay. there isn't anything special about the decor or ambiance.\n\nservice: our server was nice and friendly. food came out quickly.\n\nfood: nothing special....this is where wolfgang (consistently) falls short.\n\n-- <mark>Chopped Vegetable Salad</mark> - just okay and a bit on the salty side. for $16 they could have at least thrown some avocado in it!\n-- linguini with shrimp - good flavor, especially the cherry tomatoes, but the shrimp was rubbery. \n-- chinese <mark>Chinois Chicken Salad</mark> - my cousin seemed to enjoy this, i didn't taste it.\n\noverall: i find wolfgang puck restaurants to be average in general and this particular one is no exception. we won't be returning.", 
            "love the truffle chips, creamy and tasty. <mark>Chinois Chicken Salad</mark> refreshes your mouths especially against the extra creamy feel from the chips, nice touch with a little bit sour taste. cajun shrimps are the champ, tender and tasty.",

(other restaurants have no problem cooking well done in a timely manner.) my bf loved his ribeye and all the accoutrements that came with it. he would give it an 8.5 - 9 out of 10 (just an fyi, he loves all food). <mark>Mesquite Grilled Prime Flat Iron Steak</mark> was rare and flavorful but a bit tough with grit, that happens with these steaks sometimes. i didn't finish the skinny fries as they weren't 'amazing' but they were fresh, crispy and 'fun' for a minute. i would have preferred mashed or baked. fries seem to make the plate weak especially at $37.00. a 7 out of 10. \n\ndessert: the desert was 10 out of 10- a \"warm chocolate melting brownie with vanilla bean ice cream\". they dont 'do' bday's there meaning they dont sing and embarrass you but they did make a beautiful plate with kind wishes. the dessert was comped which was very nice, especially at $12.00. \n\noverall if in vegas again i would go back but for the salad mostly.",

            "at best average and nothing special\n\nwas staying at the mgm and thought dining at the wolfgang puck's bar & grill would be a good experience. overall i would say it was average at best and there are many more places with similiar price tags that has better food.\n\nthe ambience is what i best remember of the restaurant. it was very hip and very well done.  the problem with the restaurant is the noise level. it is located right in the center of the casino, so the place can get very noisey. if you're looking for a quite dinning experience this not it. \n\nthe food here is ok. the planting and presentation is excellent but the food is just ok. appetizers start at $10 up to $20. had the grilled <mark>Chopped Vegetable Salad</mark> and this was the best part of the whole dinning experience. my girlfriend had the pizza and it was ok. nothing special and had better pizza at my local pizza stop. i had the <mark>Mesquite Grilled Prime Flat Iron Steak</mark> and that was ok. it wasn't anything special either and just as good as my local stop. the portion size was good to poor. the <mark>Chopped Vegetable Salad</mark> was enough for two, the pizza was about a 12 inch pizza. the steak was a small amount steak and you had more fries than steaks.  the prices here are about double than most places. \n\noverall it might be nice for a lunch or to say you've been there but overall nothing special.", 
            "the <mark>Chopped Vegetable Salad</mark> was really nice, but the pizza we had with <mark>Mushroom</mark> and leeks was really bland. the dough needed salt or something, and the toppings were so-so too. we waited forever for our waters - the beer we ordered came sooner than the water - and i only got a refill when i was already finished eating. good thing bf had beer, i could drink his water. oh, that beer btw was $9. it was hoegarden on tap, but still. and i don't mind paying the price, but the service was just sucky. i ended up with two lattes on the bill, and when i brought it up, the waiter was a bit pissy about it. i ended up getting a double latte in exchange. my suggestion, btw: give me another latte -didn't ask for double- that you already charged me for, so you don't have fuss with running the card again. they don't seem to have to-go containers for liquids, i had to carry my latte in a lidless soda cup. fun.",

            "great service.  pretty contemporary casual setting. solid food.\n\ni couldn't decide between salad or pizza and settled on ordering both and requesting a box right away to take the left overs.  the waiter informed me that i could get a half salad, which i did and it was the perfect amount.  i had the <mark>Chopped Vegetable Salad</mark> with olive bread and creamy greek dressing.  i expected the bread to be soft, but it was fried croutons.  pretty tasty, but more tangy/vinegary than i expected out of a \"creamy\" dressing.   the pizza was huge.  i had the mushroom, leek, and goat cheese.   shared with friend and still took half home.  friend had the cuban sandwich, her plate looked a little sad with just the grilled sandwich and a handful of chips and vast empty plate area crying out for a pickle or green garnish of some sort.  it was pretty tasty, but not really what i expect from a cuban.  the roasted pork had a citrusy marinade and was juicy, but i don't think it went well with the cheese and pickle (sweet).   \n\noverall great value.  cuban sandwich, mushroom pizza, salad, and two non-alcoholic drinks, tax + 20% tip = $47",

            "because it's a franchise i thought it would be conventional.  the food was delicious, the service great and responsive...we were by the kitchen door and it was interesting rather than an annoyance.  i would definitely eat there again and next time i'll try the linguine with clams...my companion was moaning while she ate it...my <mark>Chopped Vegetable Salad</mark> was delish and interesting.",

            "personally while i favor spago because i always stay at caesars, and love sitting at the bar, the menu at his outpost at mgm is his biggest and his best.  my experience with celebrity chefs is that their restaurants either suck or are over rated.  not puck. he keeps it simple using highest quality ingredients.  there isnt a better salad maker on the strip that puck.  the <mark>Chopped Vegetable Salad</mark> here with the shaved feta is amazing and his <mark>Chinois Chicken Salad</mark> with the cashews and kick of ginger may be the best salad anywhere.  while ive never been a fan of the wood or brick oven style pie, puck makes a very mean pizza.  im a pizzeria owner in chicago, and my standards are ultra high.  puck's pizzas meet that standard.  order them well done, ez cheese, and you will taste the quality of the ingredients.  his burger is as good as any at the burger bar and his sandwiches for lunch are true gems.  i wish this place was closer to where we stayed as we'd hit up harcore especially given its casino floor location and late hours.  as for price, i disagree with people who say its high.  you're eating wolfgang puck cuisine on the floor of the mgm grand.  2 people can have a great dinner her with 2 drinks and tip for $100.  that is value if you know any better. we received great service from tom k on our last trip.", 
            "can't say enough good things about this dining experience, beginning with the staff that made sure we were comfortable and they exceeded our expectations. melissa was our server and was fantastic! she knew the menu well and helped us with our choices. we were very crabby upon arrival as we had just flown in from other parts of the country and had problems connecting at the airport; tired and just anxious to get checked into the hotel, settled and have something good to eat. the minute we entered this restaurant, everything changed for the better! the staff could not do enough to please. i had the <mark>Chopped Vegetable Salad</mark> that was to die for. it was as if they had just gone out into the garden and picked the fresh butter lettuce and other mix. the presentation was lovely. the dressing was spectacular and the portion was oversized! others in our party had the wedge salad and were equally pleased with freshness, portions and flavors. we shared a gourmet pizza that was the perfect size, picture perfect and the flavors were amazing! the crust was delicious! if you like espresso, you must try theirs! i have never had an espresso experience like this. we all walked out of that restaurant refreshed, full and very, very happy! great food, great service. great for people watching. highly recommend this restaurant and i can't wait to visit again!", 
            "awesome place to get some nice food before going on somewhere else. everything on the menu is the kind of food you can eat and then go on to do more drinking. the pizzas are awesome - great crust, fresh flavors, and a good size. the salads are good too, except the <mark>Chopped Vegetable Salad</mark> which had flavors (primarily the overwhelming pickled something gross) that did not work for me at all. the menu description made it sounds like a cheese/cream salad, and instead it was very dry with a strange combination of <mark>Vegetable</mark> - asparagus, pickled onions, pickled something green that was so salty it hurt. i don't recall tasting feta or creamy garlic at all. the other salads at my table (green, chinese chicken) looked amazing though. can't go wrong with the pizza margerita. the cocktails are very good here too, with fresh fruit ingredients and a strong pour. i really liked the banana cheesecake.", 
            "the <mark>Chinois Chicken Salad</mark>, <mark>Chopped Vegetable Salad</mark> & soppresseta pizza were out of this world. that good.\n\nnick at the bar was a bit dry and his cocktails were uninspiring.\n\notherwise, love this place and this menu.", 
            "my husband and i heard mixed reviews of this place but decided to take a chance. we requested a table away from the casino and were given a private table which did not smell like smoke at all! dinner was delicious. my husband had the rib eye and said it was out of this world. i customized my own meal by having the <mark>Chopped Vegetable Salad</mark> with grilled chicken and a side of steamed brussel sprouts. it was perfect! this place will accommodate any and every request. oh and we got free dessert for our anniversary as well! our waiter carlo was fantastic. if you are thinking of trying this place but are unsure, go go go!!!!", 
            "really excellent food. tartar is one of the best i ever had, worth 21$. great pizzas and sandwiches of course. excellent fresh <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>. <mark>Chopped Vegetable Salad</mark> ok. very good homemade <mark>Home Style Chicken Noodle Soup</mark>. ate here for a few days and it was consistently on point. solid service. open 24 hrs too! side note, those <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> everyone writes about are not that great, though unique, they are very heavy handed, blue-cheese completely overpowers truffle flavor, they are just sauced chips in the end. french-fries are also not spectacular, but side salads are perfect.", 
            "had lunch at wolfgang puck today, mostly because it was the first appealing option we came across while at the mgm at 2pm. here are my thoughts:\n\nambiance: just okay. there isn't anything special about the decor or ambiance.\n\nservice: our server was nice and friendly. food came out quickly.\n\nfood: nothing special....this is where wolfgang (consistently) falls short.\n\n-- <mark>Chopped Vegetable Salad</mark> - just okay and a bit on the salty side. for $16 they could have at least thrown some avocado in it!\n-- linguini with shrimp - good flavor, especially the cherry tomatoes, but the shrimp was rubbery. \n-- chinese <mark>Chinois Chicken Salad</mark> - my cousin seemed to enjoy this, i didn't taste it.\n\noverall: i find wolfgang puck restaurants to be average in general and this particular one is no exception. we won't be returning.", 
            "as another reviewer mentioned, the <mark>Chopped Vegetable Salad</mark> is really extraordinary.  it is just a salad, but it's one of the best salads i've ever had.  \n\nservice was good, and the food was very good.  i'd rate it higher were it not for the price; but i'm not complaining.", 
            "this was my 3rd visit to wolfgang's.  i tried the <mark>Chopped Vegetable Salad</mark> this time and loved it.  it is a large enough portion for a meal at a very reasonable price.  i especially love that they don't skimp on the olives.", 
            "had a myvegas coupon for bogo entree and decided to try this. the restaurant is pretty big with lots of seating.  it was a little noisy. \n\nwe got \"blt\" sandwich with <mark>'BLT' Sriracha Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, butter lettuce, tomato, chile's and an aoili. it came with homemade bbq chips.  \nthe meat was nice and fatty and juicy.  the bbq chips were crunchy and fresh.  not oily at all.  wish it came with more! \n\nordered a pizza with <mark>Italian Sausage</mark>, baby spinach, onions, chiles, mozzarella cheese.  it was really good and cheesy.  the pizzas are made in the front, and i could see the chef put it into the fire burning oven.  it came with 6 slices, super yummy. \n\nour server was very friendly and accommodating, the only thing is it took a long time for food to arrive.  took about 40 minutes to arrive, as i watched the chef make dozens of pizzas.  he was the only one making the pizzas. was starving by the time the food arrived. \n\noverall nice experience and made it even better with a bogo coupon! next time i want to try this chinese salad that everybody around us got.. it was a huge mountain of mixed/<mark>Chopped Vegetable Salad</mark>.  looked really good!!"

            "the <mark>Chopped Vegetable Salad</mark> was really nice, but the pizza we had with <mark>Mushroom</mark> and leeks was really bland. the dough needed salt or something, and the toppings were so-so too. we waited forever for our waters - the beer we ordered came sooner than the water - and i only got a refill when i was already finished eating. good thing bf had beer, i could drink his water. oh, that beer btw was $9. it was hoegarden on tap, but still. and i don't mind paying the price, but the service was just sucky. i ended up with two lattes on the bill, and when i brought it up, the waiter was a bit pissy about it. i ended up getting a double latte in exchange. my suggestion, btw: give me another latte -didn't ask for double- that you already charged me for, so you don't have fuss with running the card again. they don't seem to have to-go containers for liquids, i had to carry my latte in a lidless soda cup. fun.",

(well, my friends didn't want it, but i have no will power).  we ordered the valrona chocolate torte, and ice cream with berries in a crispy shell.  it took all of my strength to leave a bit of that chocolate cake on the plate and waddle out of the restaurant.\n\nthe highlight was when my friend surprised us and paid the bill with her points.  that was an even better dessert!!!",

            "excellent service and a fair menu selection. overall, we found the food to be quite bland.  \n\nwe ordered:\n- <mark>Chopped Vegetable Salad</mark>, feta cheese, garlic croutons, creamy greek dressing, \n- butter lettuce \"<mark>Caesar Salad</mark>\", humboldt fog cheese, garlic croutons, white anchovies, and \n- wood oven roasted <mark>Mushroom</mark>, broccolini, leeks, thyme, taleggio\n\nthe pizza was cooked just perfectly; not too limp, not too crunchy.  the crust was a bland white dough, void of any flavor.\n\nthe salads were the same.  you would expect at least the \"<mark>Caesar Salad</mark>\" to be vibrant with flavor, but it was not.  \n\nto reiterate, everything was good, but not great.  we expected more of wolfgang puck.  what made this restaurant a standout was the great service of the staff.  they were all excellent.", 
            "wow....that was good food.\n\nseriously. i have rarely been to any \"celebrity name\" restaurants before, but it was late and we'd been tearing down a booth after a tradeshow, so the boss thought we could use some food.\n\ni was pretty tired, so i tried one of the non-alcoholic drinks.i can't remember the name of it, but it was very tasty. (i think it was a tropical tea/pommegranite thing.)\n\ni had the chili <mark>Crisp Chicken Wings</mark> and a side order of the wild <mark>Mushroom</mark>. holy fungi, batman! that was awesome. \n\nthey have late night food to die for!

            "i stayed at the mgm so we had dinner at one of the hotels restaurant, we decided on wolfgang puck...it was about 3/4 full on a saturday night, we got to walk in w/o reservations...that was very helpful since we had a party of 10...\n\nthe bread basket was one of the best parts of my meal...they give u 3-4 differ types of bread...i got to try the pizza which was ok but def didnt make my list of favorites...the clam linguine had some thick pieces of thick bacon...i think there was too much bacon which made the pasta dish too salty but thats a personal preference...i'm sure some people would enjoy it more than me....i got the mushroom aglotoni pasta...nice consistency, mild in flavor and decent amount of wild <mark>Mushroom</mark> so this was one of the best picks on the evening...\n\nservice was a bit slow...we had to constantly flag down our server to request for refills, other condiments, etc... the server seemed like she was being busy running around to other tables so she wasnt being lazy...but the fact that we had to be the ones flagging her down multiple times rather than she just coming to check in on us once in a while made the dinner experience less appetizing...\n\nprices are not bad for being inside a major casino....i wouldnt mind coming back again..overall well rounded restaurant....i do like the mgm hotel so i will see you again soon mr.wolfgang",

            "we went here really late at night/early in the morning. we were fortunate enough to get awesome food at 3am. thank goodness there wasnt a long wait and they were still open!!\n\ni got the spicy tuna tartar-too much mayo in my opinion & is not spicy \nsalmon entr\\u00e9e was good and the portions were good amount\nwild <mark>Mushroom</mark> were so good that we got a regular plate of just that...then got another plate!! 2 big plate of wild <mark>Mushroom</mark>. ftw!!\nthe broccolini sides were really good (it was a full plate size, too that we ordered!)\n\n1. great after clubbing meal\n2. awesome food for the late night meal\n3. great sides\n4. ambiance was really cute\n5. great service & given that its 3am, everyone was so nice & attentive", 
            "sooo good!! beautiful decor, despite being located inside a casino and without any walls. however, they definitely had a less than desirable bathroom...\n\ndecor:\nclassic with a modern twist. their bar was beautiful, and i adored their tableware setup. although you are quite exposed to casino-goers, you don't notice it as the ambience is very good. \n\nfood:\ni love bread...especially free bread. thy give you tons of it! and they're different types (baguette, whole wheat, and even focaccia!), arrive warm, and with tons of butter.  i ordered handmade linguine with <mark>Mushroom</mark>, which was cooked perfectly. it was a huge portion and very filling. i love handmade pasta, so this was a huge plus. it's also nice to say that i've finally had the chance to try a restaurant by wolfgang puck!\n\nservice:\ngreat!!! never once was my water glass empty, and our waiter checked on us several times throughout the meal. drink orders were also timely. \n\ni'd definitely go again for the pasta. i'm not sure if the pizza was any good, as no one in my group ordered it, but i'd definitely go back for the bread too!! :3", 
            "i was hesitant to eat here, as the menu just didn't sound that appealing, but the husband was adamant about coming here, so we did. i am glad we ended up here! the service was outstanding! very attentive, friendly, and filled with great recommendations. i had their pineapple mojito at the recommendation of our server and it was the perfect amount of herb and sweet.... very good. it was 12$, but hey, this is vegas.... that was kind of a steal. for lunch, i had their soup of the day... a thai coconut <mark>Home Style Chicken Noodle Soup</mark>.... it was sooo good. the best part was the tender <mark>Mushroom</mark>, and i don't even like <mark>Mushroom</mark>! the husband had a club sandwich, and he enjoyed it thoroughly. it came with a nice salad that was lightly dressed. lunch was a bit pricey at about 50$, but considering i got a drink, this wasn't too bad. i would come back!",

            "i had the wood oven pizza with <mark>Mushroom</mark>, thyme, leeks, and taleggio. i thought that when i got my pizza, it would be small with 5 small <mark>Mushroom</mark>, but i was wrong! they pizza was delicious with lots of toppings. i thought the pizza was a decent size and i shared it because i had a hard time finishing it. the crust was delicious. i will say, the price is up there though. i think it was 17 bucks for the pizza.\n\nthe dessert that i ordered was pretty good! i ordered a chocolate souffl\\u00e9 that came with caramel ice cream. it takes about 12 minutes or so to make, so if you are in a rush, i don't recommend this. it was warm, creamy and delicious. :)", 
            "loved this restaurant! \n\nthere was no wait time at all and the food was absolutely delicious. \n\ni ordered the ribeye steak with mash potatoes and asked the to hold the <mark>Mushroom</mark>. the portion size was very big and the steak was tasty.", 
            "i have bee here twice so far.  both times did not disappoint.  this review will be for the most recent time dining here.  we were seated by the hostess, and shortly greeted by our server.  he was super nice and helpful as well.  he genuinely seemed to enjoy his job.  \n\nafter much time pondering the menu, the gf decided on the breakfast tartine, and i ordered the mushroom pizza.  we also ordered a side of the market corn.  the breakfast tartine was interestingly presented.  imagine a scrambled egg omelette served on top of a thick slice of bread.  it was good, and the crispy potatoes served with it were excellent.  the pizza was fantastic.  i have never had taleggio cheese, and it tasted great with the <mark>Mushroom</mark> and truffle.  the corn was a great side.  it was like fresh corn mixed together with <mark>Vegetable</mark> to form a salsa like dish.  don't tell anyone, but i even put some on top of the pizza and it made the two dishes even better!  \n\ngreat service and good food.  what more can you ask for?"

            "at best average and nothing special\n\nwas staying at the mgm and thought dining at the wolfgang puck's bar & grill would be a good experience. overall i would say it was average at best and there are many more places with similiar price tags that has better food.\n\nthe ambience is what i best remember of the restaurant. it was very hip and very well done.  the problem with the restaurant is the noise level. it is located right in the center of the casino, so the place can get very noisey. if you're looking for a quite dinning experience this not it. \n\nthe food here is ok. the planting and presentation is excellent but the food is just ok. appetizers start at $10 up to $20. had the grilled <mark>Chopped Vegetable Salad</mark> and this was the best part of the whole dinning experience. my girlfriend had the pizza and it was ok. nothing special and had better pizza at my local pizza stop. i had the <mark>Mesquite Grilled Prime Flat Iron Steak</mark> and that was ok. it wasn't anything special either and just as good as my local stop. the portion size was good to poor. the <mark>Chopped Vegetable Salad</mark> was enough for two, the pizza was about a 12 inch pizza. the steak was a small amount steak and you had more fries than steaks.  the prices here are about double than most places. \n\noverall it might be nice for a lunch or to say you've been there but overall nothing special.", 
            "i actually ate at the wolfgang puck bistro located in the venetian hotel and this location as well both times were great which is why it deserves 4 stars.\n\nat the bar and grill i had the salmon which is uniquely served with <mark>Vegetable</mark> under and some green sauce which was great as well.\n\nat the bistro i had the lobster and bacon club sandwich which was also great served with garlic shoestring fries.\n\nand for desert get the raspberry ice cream with chocolate cake can't remember the exact name for it right about now !\n\nas for appetizers, make sure you try the pizza and popcorn shrimp because those deserve 4 1/2 stars !",

            "my boyfriend and i went to dinner here last night and we weren't disappointed. we ordered the <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> and <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cakes</mark> as appetizers. the tuna was very fresh and delicious. the portion was a good size for us to share. the <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cakes</mark> were good as well, but not the best i've had. i would still recommend them if you're a crab fan though!\n\ni ordered the beef short rib ravioli and really enjoyed it! it was served with a delicious sauce and was topped with some delicious <mark>Vegetable</mark>. i love my veggies! i had a delicious passion fruit iced tea and my glass was never empty. our servers were very attentive.\n\nmy boyfriend ordered the beef short rib entree and it was tender and flavorful. the portion was a very good size, so we were both quite full after our entrees. despite this, we decided to give their desserts a try. we ordered the pineapple upside down cake, but it was way too sweet for my taste. the sorbet it was served with did help tone it down a bit, but it was still too sweet for me. this is a place i may have to visit again.", 
            "so delicious!\n\nafter being told there was an hour wait, we were pleasantly surprised to be seated after only 15 minutes. the staff is very friendly, and the restaurant is beautiful. cocktails are overpriced, but what do you expect in vegas?\n\nwe had the truffle <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> with blue cheese sauce. it was very rich, unusual, and delicious. if you like blue cheese, i highly recommend trying these.\n\nmy husband had the <mark><mark>Mesquite Grilled Prime Flat Iron Steak</mark> Skewers</mark> as an entree, while i had the organic chicken. the steak was tender, flavored well, and the coleslaw was fresh and tasty. the organic chicken was beautiful, not just in presentation but also in terms of taste. the mashed potatoes and <mark>Vegetable</mark> were the perfect match but the crispy, light chicken.\n\noverall, we had a great experience and i would definitely go back.", 
            "blood orange mojito, blue cheese truffle <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark>, <mark>Chopped Vegetable Salad</mark> and the pizza was excellent!! but....by any means necessary get the chocolate beignets for desert....omg! awesome!!!!!", 
            "wolfgang puck bar & grill (mgm)\nlas vegas strip, nv\n10pm tuesday 6th august 2013\nfour stars\n\n\ni was very impressed by the food and service.  we were given water and bread upon sitting down.  there were three types of bread (olive, rustic, and cheese).  the 2012 elk cove pino grigio from willamette valley had a definite crispness and acidity with a touch of sweetness.  the <mark>Chopped Vegetable Salad</mark>  had feta cheese, garlic croutons, tomatoes, black olives, pickled okra, and creamy greek dressing.  it was light and refreshing and was not overpowered by the olives. the spaghettini was simple but well executed.  the house-made al dente noodles acted a perfect vehicle for the plum tomato, basil, and garlic marinara sauce.  the grilled shrimp capellini with jumbo shrimp was similarly delicious.  the shrimps were a little over but the pasta and spicy sauce hit the spot.", 
            "personally while i favor spago because i always stay at caesars, and love sitting at the bar, the menu at his outpost at mgm is his biggest and his best.  my experience with celebrity chefs is that their restaurants either suck or are over rated.  not puck. he keeps it simple using highest quality ingredients.  there isnt a better salad maker on the strip that puck.  the <mark>Chopped Vegetable Salad</mark> here with the shaved feta is amazing and his <mark>Chinois Chicken Salad</mark> with the cashews and kick of ginger may be the best salad anywhere.  while ive never been a fan of the wood or brick oven style pie, puck makes a very mean pizza.  im a pizzeria owner in chicago, and my standards are ultra high.  puck's pizzas meet that standard.  order them well done, ez cheese, and you will taste the quality of the ingredients.  his burger is as good as any at the burger bar and his sandwiches for lunch are true gems.  i wish this place was closer to where we stayed as we'd hit up harcore especially given its casino floor location and late hours.  as for price, i disagree with people who say its high.  you're eating wolfgang puck cuisine on the floor of the mgm grand.  2 people can have a great dinner her with 2 drinks and tip for $100.  that is value if you know any better. we received great service from tom k on our last trip.", 
            "can't say enough good things about this dining experience, beginning with the staff that made sure we were comfortable and they exceeded our expectations. melissa was our server and was fantastic! she knew the menu well and helped us with our choices. we were very crabby upon arrival as we had just flown in from other parts of the country and had problems connecting at the airport; tired and just anxious to get checked into the hotel, settled and have something good to eat. the minute we entered this restaurant, everything changed for the better! the staff could not do enough to please. i had the <mark>Chopped Vegetable Salad</mark> that was to die for. it was as if they had just gone out into the garden and picked the fresh butter lettuce and other mix. the presentation was lovely. the dressing was spectacular and the portion was oversized! others in our party had the wedge salad and were equally pleased with freshness, portions and flavors. we shared a gourmet pizza that was the perfect size, picture perfect and the flavors were amazing! the crust was delicious! if you like espresso, you must try theirs! i have never had an espresso experience like this. we all walked out of that restaurant refreshed, full and very, very happy! great food, great service. great for people watching. highly recommend this restaurant and i can't wait to visit again!", 
            "awesome place to get some nice food before going on somewhere else. everything on the menu is the kind of food you can eat and then go on to do more drinking. the pizzas are awesome - great crust, fresh flavors, and a good size. the salads are good too, except the <mark>Chopped Vegetable Salad</mark> which had flavors (primarily the overwhelming pickled something gross) that did not work for me at all. the menu description made it sounds like a cheese/cream salad, and instead it was very dry with a strange combination of <mark>Vegetable</mark> - asparagus, pickled onions, pickled something green that was so salty it hurt. i don't recall tasting feta or creamy garlic at all. the other salads at my table (green, chinese chicken) looked amazing though. can't go wrong with the pizza margerita. the cocktails are very good here too, with fresh fruit ingredients and a strong pour. i really liked the banana cheesecake.", 
            "the food was absolutely wonderful. i ordered a cup of their soup of the day ($6), which happened to be a beef and barley soup. this soup totally blew me away. the broth was so herby and flavorful, i couldn't bare to let a single drop remain in the bowl when i was done. there was tons of barley, good sized chunks of beef (but still bite sized), and some other <mark>Vegetable</mark> in the mix. i kept eating it slowly because i wanted to make sure i savored each bite. i cannot compliment this soup enough.\nmy main course was the salmon served with potatoes, arugula and asparagus ($32). i ordered the salmon medium well, and it came out perfect. a light crunch to the outside, and tender, juicy meat on the inside, and it was seasoned perfectly. the <mark>Vegetable</mark> were delicious and cooked perfectly. they had the right balance of tenderness with crunch. i paired the meal with a glass of riesling ($11), which could have been sweeter, in my opinion (i love the really sweet wines), but it was still a nice wine.\nthe atmosphere is pleasant, especially with the decor of the panes of leaves and flowers throughout the restaurant. the hostesses were pleasant and even pulled out a chair for me when we got to the table. our server was also nice and helpful, and didn't forget anything, although he did give us the wrong check the first time (it was the check from the table directly next to us), he amended it quickly and with a sincere apology. it's a restaurant i would come back to because the food was just amazing. i could eat that soup every day for a week and i wish every piece of salmon i ever order would taste like that salmon. it was perfection.", 
            "the <mark>Chinois Chicken Salad</mark>, <mark>Chopped Vegetable Salad</mark> & soppresseta pizza were out of this world. that good.\n\nnick at the bar was a bit dry and his cocktails were uninspiring.\n\notherwise, love this place and this menu.", 
            "i ordered a salmon dish with asparagus and other <mark>Vegetable</mark>. there was nothing wrong with the quality of the food, but it literally took me 30 seconds to eat because the portion size was so small. i really do not like spending $26 on a dish that doesn't come close to filling me up. we had to go eat somewhere else afterwards since we were still hungry.", 
            "4 out of 5 stars mainly for the service. everyone was very attentive, asking how we were doing, refilling our water, giving us more bread (sourdough and some sort of onion bread).\n\ntips:\n- we ordered the ribeye and told them we would be sharing. they will split everything (<mark>Vegetable</mark>, steak, etc.) for you without an additional cost. nicer restaurants typically do this for their customers, but some will charge a fee. \n- my dad asked for tabasco sauce with his pasta (i know, kinda weird), and they gave us a handful of cute travel-size tabasco bottles to use and take home with us. now, my dad can conveniently have hot sauce with him at all times.", 
            "my friends and i came here our first night in vegas and had a nice dinner as a group. the service was excellent and the food was great. i got the chicken and roasted <mark>Vegetable</mark> and the chicken was cooked perfectly. my husband got the flat bread and he thought it was tasty. our friends got various dishes and they were pleased. i would definitely go back.", 
            "my husband and i heard mixed reviews of this place but decided to take a chance. we requested a table away from the casino and were given a private table which did not smell like smoke at all! dinner was delicious. my husband had the rib eye and said it was out of this world. i customized my own meal by having the <mark>Chopped Vegetable Salad</mark> with grilled chicken and a side of steamed brussel sprouts. it was perfect! this place will accommodate any and every request. oh and we got free dessert for our anniversary as well! our waiter carlo was fantastic. if you are thinking of trying this place but are unsure, go go go!!!!", 
            "really excellent food. tartar is one of the best i ever had, worth 21$. great pizzas and sandwiches of course. excellent fresh <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>. <mark>Chopped Vegetable Salad</mark> ok. very good homemade <mark>Home Style Chicken Noodle Soup</mark>. ate here for a few days and it was consistently on point. solid service. open 24 hrs too! side note, those <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> everyone writes about are not that great, though unique, they are very heavy handed, blue-cheese completely overpowers truffle flavor, they are just sauced chips in the end. french-fries are also not spectacular, but side salads are perfect.", 
            "had lunch at wolfgang puck today, mostly because it was the first appealing option we came across while at the mgm at 2pm. here are my thoughts:\n\nambiance: just okay. there isn't anything special about the decor or ambiance.\n\nservice: our server was nice and friendly. food came out quickly.\n\nfood: nothing special....this is where wolfgang (consistently) falls short.\n\n-- <mark>Chopped Vegetable Salad</mark> - just okay and a bit on the salty side. for $16 they could have at least thrown some avocado in it!\n-- linguini with shrimp - good flavor, especially the cherry tomatoes, but the shrimp was rubbery. \n-- chinese <mark>Chinois Chicken Salad</mark> - my cousin seemed to enjoy this, i didn't taste it.\n\noverall: i find wolfgang puck restaurants to be average in general and this particular one is no exception. we won't be returning.", 
            "as another reviewer mentioned, the <mark>Chopped Vegetable Salad</mark> is really extraordinary.  it is just a salad, but it's one of the best salads i've ever had.  \n\nservice was good, and the food was very good.  i'd rate it higher were it not for the price; but i'm not complaining.", 
            "i have bee here twice so far.  both times did not disappoint.  this review will be for the most recent time dining here.  we were seated by the hostess, and shortly greeted by our server.  he was super nice and helpful as well.  he genuinely seemed to enjoy his job.  \n\nafter much time pondering the menu, the gf decided on the breakfast tartine, and i ordered the mushroom pizza.  we also ordered a side of the market corn.  the breakfast tartine was interestingly presented.  imagine a scrambled egg omelette served on top of a thick slice of bread.  it was good, and the crispy potatoes served with it were excellent.  the pizza was fantastic.  i have never had taleggio cheese, and it tasted great with the <mark>Mushroom</mark> and truffle.  the corn was a great side.  it was like fresh corn mixed together with <mark>Vegetable</mark> to form a salsa like dish.  don't tell anyone, but i even put some on top of the pizza and it made the two dishes even better!  \n\ngreat service and good food.  what more can you ask for?", 
            "this was my 3rd visit to wolfgang's.  i tried the <mark>Chopped Vegetable Salad</mark> this time and loved it.  it is a large enough portion for a meal at a very reasonable price.  i especially love that they don't skimp on the olives.", 
            "had a myvegas coupon for bogo entree and decided to try this. the restaurant is pretty big with lots of seating.  it was a little noisy. \n\nwe got \"blt\" sandwich with <mark>'BLT' Sriracha Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, butter lettuce, tomato, chile's and an aoili. it came with homemade bbq chips.  \nthe meat was nice and fatty and juicy.  the bbq chips were crunchy and fresh.  not oily at all.  wish it came with more! \n\nordered a pizza with <mark>Italian Sausage</mark>, baby spinach, onions, chiles, mozzarella cheese.  it was really good and cheesy.  the pizzas are made in the front, and i could see the chef put it into the fire burning oven.  it came with 6 slices, super yummy. \n\nour server was very friendly and accommodating, the only thing is it took a long time for food to arrive.  took about 40 minutes to arrive, as i watched the chef make dozens of pizzas.  he was the only one making the pizzas. was starving by the time the food arrived. \n\noverall nice experience and made it even better with a bogo coupon! next time i want to try this chinese salad that everybody around us got.. it was a huge mountain of mixed/<mark>Chopped Vegetable Salad</mark>.  looked really good!!"

            "finally, a nice place in vegas that you can get an affordable meal without compromising the environment!!! i love food, but i don't have the budget to splurge on every meal while i'm on vegas. but at the same time, i don't want to eat denny's the whole time either. i stumbled upon this place and couldn't be happier. the environment and decor of this place makes you feel like you are in vegas, not at some cheapo place. \n\nthe entrees range from about $12-25, but the \"cheap\" part of it is the pizzas. a pizza is large enough for 2 people to share and they are only $12-15 each! but if you have a big appetite, you can get your own pizza and it's still a pretty good deal. i got the chicken, eggplant, cilantro, and pepper pizza. my boyfriend got the <mark>Italian Sausage</mark>, pepperoni, and tomato pizza. both were very fresh and served hot. \n\nwe also ordered dessert--chocolate souffle with vanilla ice cream. it was light in texture but rich in flavor! my boyfriend ordered a dos equis on draft and it was $9. \n\nthe decor is pretty trendy and the restaurant is right in the middle of the casino. the only downside of this is you get a lot of second hand smoke from the casino. our waiter was very quick and attentive. overall, i'd recommend this place if you are looking for an affordable but nice meal.", 
            "i was bit reluctant on eating here, just because i've never had a really good meal in any of wolfgang's restaurants. with nothing else open at 4am in the mgm, i had no choice. so glad i did! \n\na few girls and i nibbled on...\n\ngarlic-chili glazed <mark>Crisp Chicken Wings</mark> with scallions \nchicken, eggplant, roasted peppers and cilantro wood oven pizza\nkobe cheese <mark>New York Steak Sandwich</mark> with onion rings\n<mark>Italian Sausage</mark>, <mark>Mushroom</mark>, onions and arsley wood oven pizza\nfettucini alfredo with mixed <mark>Mushroom</mark> and parmesan\n\neverything was delicious, full of flavor, great portions! the <mark>Crisp Chicken Wings</mark> & fettucini were my favorite! \n\ni had such a good experience that i came back the next night before going to see ka.",

(the weird thing is, the waitress snickered again later, a propos of nothing. so i think the snickering is some nervous tic, an unfortunate one when you're dealing with the public, but nothing personal.)\n\nwe ordered the <mark>Italian Sausage</mark> pizza. how to put this? it was awful: a drooping, oily, tasteless mess. it was not possible, physically or psychologically, to eat it.\n\nwe got the hell out of wpb&g as eagerly as we had gotten into it. one star for nice design, half a star just for being open, minus three stars for crimes against pizza.",

(and i have never buy a salad because i think its not worth the price, i can get something else for that price which is like around $5.) it has chopped <mark>Vegetable</mark>/ salad, feta cheese, garlic croutons, creamy greek dressing. my bf got the pizza with <mark>Italian Sausage</mark>, roasted peppers, <mark>Mushroom</mark>, smoked ricotta, onions, parsley.\n\nwe waited about 5 - 10 minutes and then my salad came out and few minutes later the pizza came. \n\nthe salad is like the best salad i have ever had! love the tangy, sour and flavors of the <mark>Vegetable</mark>. the pizza was absolutely bomb! it was flat and was packed with flavor. it was not greasy and i totally love the food here.\n\nthe second experience was great also... however, the salad did not bring back the same memories of when i first had it... i ate the whole salad the first time and the this time i just ate half of it. the bf had the mussels with sausage in a tomato sauce. the mussels were really good. they give you a good portion. the price is a bit pricey but totally worth it.\n\nif im ever in vegas... i will definitely come and eat here again and again.",

            "3.5 stars for the food. 4 stars for the service.\n\nwolfgang puck bar and grill is located inside mgm grand. the food was pretty good (not great), but service was awesome. all the servers were very attentive and friendly.\n\nwe ordered:\n\nmixed green salad - a basic salad with mixed greens, tomatoes, and balsamic vinaigrette\n\nwhite pizza - pizza with roasted chicken, spinach, garlic, red onions, and feta cheese. this pizza was good but very creamy and heavy.\n\n<mark>Italian Sausage</mark> pizza - pizza with <mark>Italian Sausage</mark>, roasted peppers, <mark>Mushroom</mark>, smoked ricotta, onions, and parsley. i enjoyed this pizza more than the white pizza  because i prefer red sauce over white sauce.\n\nhand cut fettuccini - fettuccini with <mark>Mushroom</mark>, parmesan reggiano, and parsley. the pasta noodles were good.\n\n\noverall, i enjoyed all the dishes. although nothing was amazing, everything was good and decently priced for a vegas restaurant.", 
            "i stay at the mgm all the time and find myself coming back to wolfgang because even if the food isn't amazing for the price, it's still good and nearby.\n\nthe tuna tartar appetizer is really fresh and delicious. i also got the <mark>Italian Sausage</mark> pizza, which is a bit salty and heavy but still good. couldn't eat more than 2 slices. the fettuccine pasta, surprisingly, isn't a cream sauce, but it's still yummy and the pasta is extremely chewy. it wasn't heavy at all and it had a nice veggie ratio.the burger. so delicious and the cole slaw was extremely generous. the fries weren't amazing but they did the job of making me pick at them over and over. the chicken entr\\u00e9e wasn't too great either-i've had better mashed potatoes, but the chicken was so soft and tender that it tasted almost like salmon and it was cooked masterfully.\n\nbest of all? the service. we had to change some things around on our bill since we were separating between rooms but the server was extremely nice about it, even when he had to get the manager involved. the waiters made sure my water was always filled to the brim and they got us new bread quickly every time we asked for it.\n\nwill be back, as always.", 
            "had a myvegas coupon for bogo entree and decided to try this. the restaurant is pretty big with lots of seating.  it was a little noisy. \n\nwe got \"blt\" sandwich with <mark>'BLT' Sriracha Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, butter lettuce, tomato, chile's and an aoili. it came with homemade bbq chips.  \nthe meat was nice and fatty and juicy.  the bbq chips were crunchy and fresh.  not oily at all.  wish it came with more! \n\nordered a pizza with <mark>Italian Sausage</mark>, baby spinach, onions, chiles, mozzarella cheese.  it was really good and cheesy.  the pizzas are made in the front, and i could see the chef put it into the fire burning oven.  it came with 6 slices, super yummy. \n\nour server was very friendly and accommodating, the only thing is it took a long time for food to arrive.  took about 40 minutes to arrive, as i watched the chef make dozens of pizzas.  he was the only one making the pizzas. was starving by the time the food arrived. \n\noverall nice experience and made it even better with a bogo coupon! next time i want to try this chinese salad that everybody around us got.. it was a huge mountain of mixed/<mark>Chopped Vegetable Salad</mark>.  looked really good!!"

            "***not as expensive or overpriced as the many celebrity chef restaurants in las vegas (though still pricey), wolfgang puck bar & grill is a decent spot that serves satisfying (though not great) food***\n\ndespite the many well-known restaurants (especially those backed by celebrity chefs) in las vegas, there are not many that are open for lunch.  that is what makes wolfgang puck bar & grill, which is located on the casino floor of the mgm hotel, so convenient.  i believe it is open all day and wolfgang puck utilizes better ingredients than a lot of its daytime sit-down competition.\n\ndespite its convenience, wolfgang puck bar & grill is just an okay restaurant (not a great one).  most of the dishes are fine and taste good, but i have yet to have something here (in my 3 visits) that felt noticeably better than the food other good vegas restaurants put out.\n\nwolfgang puck bar & grill sits smack down in the middle of the casino.  it is pretty open to the casino with no big walls.  maybe it was where we sat or that the casino was not that busy, but the smoke-filled casino did not feel that obtrusive here.  the decor has the look of a bright cafe with light yellow and golden brown colors and nice but casual tables and chairs.\n\nwe started with the truffled (strong truffle flavor) <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark>, which were topped with a chunky and rich maytag blue cheese sauce.  the housemade chips were flavorful and seasoned right but unevenly crisp--some were crisp and some were soft (some chips were made even softer / soggier due to the heavy coating of blue cheese).  overall, it was an okay starter though you may want to steer clear if you are not a fan of blue cheese.\n\nwe also shared the <mark>Chinois Chicken Salad</mark>, which was tossed with candied peanuts, crisp wontons and a chinese mustard vinaigrette.  overall, it was a flavorful and fresh salad with a good balance of ingredients, but it was not as good as the original <mark>Chinois Chicken Salad</mark> from chinois on main in santa monica.  the reason was that the salad was over dressed.  it kind of lost its crispness and it was overdressed in the vinaigrette (too soggy).\n\nfor my entree, i had the blt, which included maple <mark>'BLT' Sriracha Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, arugula, vine ripe tomatoes, and avocado on buttered sourdough toast.  the <mark>'BLT' Sriracha Glazed Pork Belly</mark> was sweet and flavorful.  i thought it was going to be braised and soft (and then crispy on the outside); however, the <mark>'BLT' Sriracha Glazed Pork Belly</mark> here lacked that tender texture.  instead, the <mark>'BLT' Sriracha Glazed Pork Belly</mark>'s texture was more dense like thick bacon or lean spare ribs.  it was still good, but i would have preferred a thicker piece of braised (tender) <mark>'BLT' Sriracha Glazed Pork Belly</mark> over the spare rib-like texture here.\n\nthe lettuce, tomato and avocado were all fine.  like the <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark>, the sandwich was heavily dressed.  i was not a big fan of the sourdough.  the bread was okay, but it was over-buttered and slightly greasy.  the blt came with a side of cold vegetable pasta salad, which was a standard cold pasta salad.\n\ni tried my friend's kabocha pumpkin tortellini with sage brown butter, toasted hazelnuts and parmesan.  i had a very similar pumpkin tortellini dish at drago ristorante in santa monica.  the pasta dish at wolfgang puck was flavorful and pretty good (probably the best thing we had here).  that being said, i liked drago's version better because it was lighter, had a more subtle flavor and was less complicated.\n\nservice was very good.  the waiter jeremy was a very nice guy.  he was pleasant and friendly as well as enthusiastic and passionate about the food.  food came out at a good pace and the staff was attentive.\n\nprices for lunch were okay.  there were several options here that were around $20 or less.  you would pay about the same at some of the las vegas cafes, but i imagine you are more likely to walk away satisfied if you spent your money here.\n\nwolfgang puck bar & grill has convenient hours and puts out tasty (though not remarkable) food.  i've been here a few times and the restaurant has shown a lot of consistency in delivering (at the very least) decent food.  that is what makes wolfgang puck bar & grill a decent and safe option for lunch in las vegas.  \n\nthe mgm grand hotel provides complimentary parking (both valet and self-parking via a parking structure).",

            "i didn't know that they open till 6 am even on a sunday night! didn't know where to eat after our zumanity show at new york new york, we walked to mgm to find places to eat, i was glad a decent restaurant like wolfgang puck still served full menu! \n\nstarted with spicy <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare</mark>, the chips were so thin and crispy, fresh tuna with avocado on top, light with enough flavors. \n\nsteamed black mussels, with french fries: the mussels were so tender, great with the creamy cheese sauce, the sausages in it looked so yummy, but i couldn't taste it. \n\nhubby had clam linguini, same as i ordered last time: very delicious, the texture of the linguini was perfect, the smoked crispy <mark>'BLT' Sriracha Glazed Pork Belly</mark> bites were so flavorful. \n\ni had a bloody mary first, it was a weak drink, i ordered a corona too. our food was very good, not too heavy for late night, but still satisfying. the service was good like always. tab was $94, it's always around $95 for us when we eat here. \n\nlove this casual restaurant and bar open all night long!", 
            "i've always thought this place was going to be average like a p.f. changs or yan can cook. what a surprise that it wasn't! my girls and i were starving after hakkasan. luckily enough we made some friends who fed us :) this place is open practically all day long so it was perfect to dine here right after we partied the night away.\n\nthe menu had really good options. i would've expected the prices to be much more extreme but it wasn't! my gf and i shared the <mark>'BLT' Sriracha Glazed Pork Belly</mark> blt. honestly best blt of my life. forget the bacon because <mark>'BLT' Sriracha Glazed Pork Belly</mark> is a much better substitute. and the <mark>'BLT' Sriracha Glazed Pork Belly</mark> was a pretty thick slice in my sandwich! i love <mark>'BLT' Sriracha Glazed Pork Belly</mark> and get so annoyed when the slice is so thin where i can't even taste anything. so for the price point and the amount of meat i got... yes to this place! \n\nthe fries were addicting too! my other gf got the burger and the meat patty was super juicy! i liked how i could really taste the sharp cheese melted all over the burger. yum! i'd come here again !", 
            "i know that wolfgang's restaurants are very hit-or-miss, but i do find that the ones in las vegas are all quite reputable. this one located in the mgm just across from the ka ticket office is excellent.\n\ndelicious and hearty american fare at reasonable prices (for the generous portions). we got the burger, <mark>'BLT' Sriracha Glazed Pork Belly</mark> sandwich, and a side of mac and cheese - for two people, we were stuffed and ended up bringing half of our dinner home for late night! the sandwiches were $17 each (but both had huge sides of fries or greek macaroni salad) and the mac n cheese was $12. \n\nservice was top notch and continuously attentive. the ambiance is casual but still contemporary inside with an open-faced layout facing the casino outward. great for dates, small groups, large groups, or just to get a bite to eat any time of the day. they are open daily until 5am!", 
            "i came here as i was stuck at mgm until my flight. it's strategically located across from the ka theater. it must be really busy around show time.\n\ni came around 3pm and the restaurant was busier than most. i was surprised!\n\ni ordered the blt, which was delicious. i'm a really big fan of maple glazed bacon, so i had to try the maple <mark>'BLT' Sriracha Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, and i am so glad that i did. the maple <mark>'BLT' Sriracha Glazed Pork Belly</mark> was amazing in terms of flavor. the <mark>'BLT' Sriracha Glazed Pork Belly</mark> itself wasn't melt-in-your-mouth orgasmic tasting but it definitely met expectations. i also like how they mashed up the avocados so it was more like an avocado spread rather than slices. it helps spread the avocados into each bite!\n\ni'd come back for the blt.", 
            "i did have the salmon on the menu.  but wait!  it came with small pieces of <mark>'BLT' Sriracha Glazed Pork Belly</mark> and it was delish!  the bread that they serve had grilled onions on it.\n\nservice was kinda slow but over all ok.", 
            "was not expecting super amazing food even though it was a wolfgang puck restaurant. we did get awesome food though and their <mark>Home Style Chicken Noodle Soup</mark> is superb, tastes really homemade. a personal thing i dislike about these types of restaurants though is that they have the water glasses out forever until someone sits at the table, that makes the glasses smell bad once you put water in them. i think it's just me though, but i had to stop breathing when i drank water so i wouldn't have to smell the wet dirty glass smell. like i said though, this is a personal thing, and maybe other people can't distinguish the \"smell\" like i can.\n\ni had the salmon and my boyfriend had the cod, the salmon was extremely good and so was the cod, the salmon took the cake though. we had a side of <mark>Sauteed Brussels Sprouts</mark> (i love them) and the <mark>'BLT' Sriracha Glazed Pork Belly</mark> bacon they used was very awesome as well, i could have just ordered two sides by themselves and made it a meal!\n\noverall, i loved it and will go back when we go back to vegas. we were staying at the mgm so the walk from our room to the restaurant was negligible which was also a huge plus!", 
            "had a myvegas coupon for bogo entree and decided to try this. the restaurant is pretty big with lots of seating.  it was a little noisy. \n\nwe got \"blt\" sandwich with <mark>'BLT' Sriracha Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, butter lettuce, tomato, chile's and an aoili. it came with homemade bbq chips.  \nthe meat was nice and fatty and juicy.  the bbq chips were crunchy and fresh.  not oily at all.  wish it came with more! \n\nordered a pizza with <mark>Italian Sausage</mark>, baby spinach, onions, chiles, mozzarella cheese.  it was really good and cheesy.  the pizzas are made in the front, and i could see the chef put it into the fire burning oven.  it came with 6 slices, super yummy. \n\nour server was very friendly and accommodating, the only thing is it took a long time for food to arrive.  took about 40 minutes to arrive, as i watched the chef make dozens of pizzas.  he was the only one making the pizzas. was starving by the time the food arrived. \n\noverall nice experience and made it even better with a bogo coupon! next time i want to try this chinese salad that everybody around us got.. it was a huge mountain of mixed/<mark>Chopped Vegetable Salad</mark>.  looked really good!!", 
            "my husband and i stayed at the mgm during thanksgiving weekend, and stopped by here for lunch the day we arrived. i was tempted to order the thanksgiving dinner, but it was too much food for me.\n\nwe tried the <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cakes</mark>, pumpkin tortellini, and sauteed <mark>Herb Crusted Scottish Salmon</mark>. the <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cakes</mark> were nicely browned on the outside and light and fluffy on the inside. the dish was served with a tasty basil pesto aioli. i loved the flavors of the pumpkin tortellini, which was made with brown butter and sage--everything blended so well together. the tortellini was fresh, although the folds of dough were a bit too thick for me. the salmon was nicely cooked, and the mushroom ragout and <mark>'BLT' Sriracha Glazed Pork Belly</mark> were nice additions to the dish. our friend had the <mark>Roasted Turkey</mark> sandwich (the cheapest, but the most filling) which he said was really good.\n\nservice was good. it wasn't crowded when we went, so the food came out quickly. the waiter was friendly and checked on us pretty often.\n\nthis is a convenient spot to grab some gourmet food on a budget."

            "we were going to diego in the mgm grand, too bad it didn't open for lunch, looked like wolfgang puck bar and grill was the only restaurant open there, out of choice. we'v seen this restaurant so many times, never wanted to try it cause it is located in the middle of the casino. glad we tried this restaurant by wolfgang puck. \n\ndecor: 3.5\nfood: 4\nservice: 5\nlocation: 3\natmosphere: 4\n\ntotal lunch bill for 2, 2 fat tire: $96 \n\ngarlic -chilli glazed wings with blue cheese dressing: so delicious, meaty, flavored, a bit sweet, but just right! it was messy eating those, i had all of them! \n<mark>Home Style Chicken Noodle Soup</mark> with veggies and italian parsley: so good, very flavored \nlinguini, malina clams, garlic, pancetta, chilli, wild oregano : loved the clams, hubby loved the pork in there, the linguini was ok. \n<mark>French Style Omelet</mark> , field <mark>Mushroom</mark> with french fries : so delicious!  :) \n\nportions were huge, we couldn't finish everything. took fries to go, it was my snack on the way back to la. :) \n\nloved our food, service was great, our waitress was very nice, brought me wet napkin to clean my hands after eating wings, it's dry napkin dipped in a cup of warm water, with a piece of lemon on the side to help remove the oil on my hands, how nice .:) \n\nminus the location, cause i didn't like restaurant in the middle of a casino in the open, everything else was great. loved the atmosphere, very chill and relaxing, perfect for a hang over lunch. will try the other location in la live sometime!", 
            "not a better late night or early morning 4 am place to eat! they win! the <mark>French Style Omelet</mark> was out of this world!", 
            "it seems like every time we come to vegas we always end up here for brunch. of course food here is delicious, i haven't bad anything that i didn't enjoy from here. however, the wait time for the food to get to your table could get a little long depending on the time of the day. \n\n<mark><mark>Mesquite Grilled Prime Flat Iron Steak</mark> Skewers</mark> and the <mark>French Style Omelet</mark> are my very favorite. cannot wait to come back next time and try their pizza!"

            "the <mark>Grilled Prime Burger</mark>, albeit overpriced was excellent.  our service was very good too.", 
            "boring restaurants yield boring reviews. here goes... \n\ni've read a few of the reviews on this bar & grill and i agree with two prevalent ideas. the <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> were delicious, and i'm not sure if wolfgang puck should put his name on this establishment. i should note that my buddy and i only had the <mark>Grilled Prime Burger</mark> with vermont cheddar and smoked onion marmalade along with the chips so we had limited exposure to the menu. but hey, a great restaurant is supposed to make something simple into spectacular, and from its name the burger sure \"sounded\" delecious. while the name of the burger lights up your eyes, you palette is left bored and dismayed. though it was cooked perfectly to my request of rare, there was no flavor that sprung out of the tender meat. even the fancy smanshy cheese and onion stuff was bland and undeserving of the written text in the menu. grab a beer and the chips here, but look elsewhere for simple, good eats. yes, i do realize that's difficult in vegas.", 
            "if you're staying at the mgm grand, i recommend trying wolfgang puck bar & grill. i ate there for lunch and dinner and shared a total of 6 dishes. i suggest the corned beef reuben with sauerkraut and swiss on rye with potato salad for $15 if you want a good deli style sandwich. the fish of the day (halibut) with wild <mark>Mushroom</mark> and pearl onions, creamy corn puree and tomato fondue for $31 was also very good. for salads, i thought the <mark>Chopped Vegetable Salad</mark> with feta cheese, garlic croutons and creamy greek dressing was very good and can easily be shared with people as an appetizer.\n\nthe portions vary between the dishes. i thought the <mark>House Made Ricotta Gnocchi</mark> with sweet fennel-sausage bolognese for $23 was a little on the small side compared to the sweet pea and goat cheese filled tortellini with wild <mark>Mushroom</mark> and parmesan reggiano for $25. you also can't go wrong with the <mark>Grilled Prime Burger</mark> with vermont cheddar and smoked onion marmalade for $18. \n\nthe <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cakes</mark> were delicious, $17 for 4 <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cakes</mark>. when comparing wolfgang puck's prices to other mgm restaurants, this place is very reasonable and the servers provided excellent service both times i dined. nice atmosphere too. i would go eat here again.", 
            "oh man this place is good. i tried the <mark>Grilled Prime Burger</mark> with a onion marmalade. off the hook. i also tasted the meatloaf and yukon gold mashed potatoes. hella good. also the gnocchi was unbelievable.", 
            "we ate here before a 9:30 showing of ka. i called at about 6:30 pm to make a reservation and the hostess was superb. they accomodated our party, inquired about food allergies, time constraints, and whether or not we were celebrating a special occasion. we arrived earlier than expected for our reservation and were seated immediately. the service was superb and we never had to request a refill on our drinks. we ordered the <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark>, maytag blue cheese sauce as an appetizer and they were superb (if you are on a diet, this is not the dish for you). for entrees, we ordered the <mark>Grilled Prime Burger</mark>, vermont cheddar cheese, smoked onion marmalade* (no onions), which was amazing. the waitress warned us that it would be a 25 minute wait for the burger because they are prepared to order and it was totally worth it. the meat was cooked perfectly, the bread had a sweet taste, and the fries were perfectly crispy. we also ordered the prosciutto, kalamata olives, oven dried tomatoes, basil pesto, goat cheese pizza. delicious is an understatement! this pizza is definitely big enough to share either as an appetizer or entree.", 
            "we were seated right away and our server was attentive and friendly. i was going to order the ginger lime iced tea but i forgot. but i did remember to order the <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> with maytag blue cheese sauce. :) it was good, but i wouldn't say delicious. the chips were freshly made, but a little to hard for my taste and the sauce was creamy but didn't have enough of a blue cheese kick. i also wish the sauce wasn't drizzled on but as a dip because if you didn't eat it fast enough it becomes sloggy chips.  our friends had the cheese pizza which they said was delicious. we had also ordered the <mark>House Made Ricotta Gnocchi</mark>, sweet fennel sausage bolognese. it was good especially the sausage bolognese, i just wished there was more of it on the plate. the gnocchi was good but after having a couple it became too heavy for me. then we also had the <mark>Grilled Prime Burger</mark>, vermont cheddar, smoked onion marmalade, which was a good hamburger, but nothing special. the decor of this place is pretty cool and you do feel like you are in the middle of the gambling action even though you are eating. \ni would love to go back and try their desserts and some other dishes.", 
            "delicious, fresh tasting food and attentive service. i've tried the <mark>Grilled Prime Burger</mark>, the spaghettini, and the caramelized brussel sprouts. some of the best tasting food i've ever had.", 
            "the most friendly & attentive staff i have ever experienced in any restaurant.\n\nme & my boyriend had ....\n\n<mark>Grilled Prime Burger</mark> & fries...\npizza with <mark>Italian Sausage</mark>...\n<mark>House Made Ricotta Gnocchi</mark>...\n\nall the best......... must try!!", 
            "while almost all of my reviews are planned ahead of time through my always growing to-do list, every once in a while i end up at a random restaurant with clients and the chance to try a random burger. such is the case with wolfgang puck bar & grill, which is where i ended up at recently. historically this scenario ends in disaster; i hate succumbing to peer pressure and ordering the default burger on some menu because i'm the 'burger guy' and everyone wants to watch me eat one, but in this case it actually turned out fairly well.\n\nlocated in the back corner of the casino near the cirque theater and robuchon, puck is a large space that's very open to the loud surrounding casino. a minimal railing and some decorative elements define the perimeter of the restaurant, but it's mostly open to the slots and bright lights of everything around it. picture your typical casino caf\\u00e9 setting filled with tourists and conventioneers. there are both lunch and dinner menus available depending on the time of day, and it seems like they are almost identical with maybe a few less items on the dinner menu. they both feature soups, salads, apps, pizzas and many main courses. both also offer the <mark>Grilled Prime Burger</mark> with vermont cheddar, smoked onion marmalade and fries, and that's exactly what i was pressured into ordering.\n\nthe bun was a bit too thick and dry, but acceptable with prominent poppy seed and onion flavors. it kind of reminded me of the bun i had at burgr recently, but not as well proportioned; the bun to meat ratio was off as i had a good crescent shape of bun left over at the end. the meat was cooked a little more than medium rare, but seasoned well and had a good fresh beefy flavor. there was a bit too small of a topping of an almost cole slaw with shredded lettuce and onions on top, and two small tomatoes. the cheddar was melted well, but didn't stand out too much. the star and prominent flavor was the onion marmalade, both during and after my meal; it was sweet and had a good strong onion flavor. this was a very messy burger between the marmalade, mayo below and slaw juices, but overall way better than i anticipated.\n\nthe fries were also decent; your typical skinny variety cooked well with some skins and no oily flavor. this is both surprising and sad, as some strict burger joints i go to can't even get fries right these days. all of my pleasant surprises aside, i do have a major problem with the $17 price tag for this burger. given the fact that most of the main courses on the lunch menu range from $20-39 a $17 burger seems ok, but i would counter with the argument that all of these prices are far too high and this is once again a case of a strip restaurant taking advantage of the convention/tourist crowd while utilizing the name of a famous chef. so while this was admittedly a good burger, i wouldn't send you specifically to the mgm grand to try it unless you already happened to be there and don't mind overpaying for it. plus, with mina's new 1842 about to open including hopefully a far superior burger, there will be better alternates on site.", 
            "the <mark>Grilled Prime Burger</mark> was soooo good! beautiful restaurant and surprisingly good prices ! they have a kids menu which was great since we had our six year old. daughter with us ! excellent staff  and drinks !", 
            "can i say loooooooooooooooouuuuud? \n\nholy guacamole, it was loud. definitely not a good place for a first date or a meeting or catch-up-talk-story kind of place because it is open to the public but my boyfriend & i enjoyed ourselves, nonetheless. we were shouting at each other rather than talking cause it was so loud but we were laughing the whole time. it was fun. \n\nnow that you've been warned about the noise, onto the food. it's delicious. seriously. the complementary bread and butter was yummy and they didn't hesitate to give us seconds once we were done with our first basket. oh, and the servers were great! very friendly and attentive. refilled our drinks almost instantaneously. okay, back to the food. my boyfriend got the <mark>Grilled Prime Burger</mark>. it was huge, tasty, juicy and flavorful. he devoured it. \n\ni ordered the <mark>Jidori Half Chicken</mark> and <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> with veggies. i practically slurped that rosemary jus because it was just yummy. the chicken is pan seared and baked. honestly, the juiciest chicken i have ever had in my life. not dry or over-salted at all.. it was seasoned perfectly and i was sad after my last bite.\n\nsince we were locals, we ended with a complementary dessert to share. (they won't ask if you're local. just tell them you are & they will be more than happy to hand you the dessert menu). we got the beignets with citrus custard inside and caramel dipping sauce. i wasn't a big fan of the citrus custard and would have loved for it be simply a vanilla custard but i liked it for the most part. \n\nthe price is cheaper than most restaurants on the strip. i was looking for something that wasn't solely burgers but i didn't want to splurge too much so this place was a great choice. will definitely be back someday!", 
            "4 stars because i think the price was a bit high. \n\nwe went for lunch on a sunday. i think we ordered off of the lunch menu. or maybe they have one menu. either way. \ni got the <mark>Grilled Prime Burger</mark> with onion marmalade and vermont cheese. huge burger, great sauce, cooked to perfection. \nthe burger came with a mountain of fries, i mean a mountain. fries were just regular skinny cut fries. nothing special. i finished my burger because it was so good. \n\nmy girlfriend got the linguini with garlic sauce, pancetta, and steamed clams. she said the sauce was pretty flavorless but still enjoyed it. would probably not order it again. \nwe sat at the bar and the waitress was really nice. gave us recommendations on food and was able to keep up some small talk. \n\nwe paid $65 for two meals and a tiny sangria. i know we went to a more upscale restaurant but this was lunch. we paid less for dinner at burgr. i would come back for dinner.", 
            "unfortunately the qualities gone down through the years. this used to be my go to place every time i visited vegas, but not anymore. i used to get their <mark>Grilled Prime Burger</mark> when they had it, but i don't think they have it anymore. so on this current visit, i ordered their regular burger, medium rare and it came out well done. this used to never happen, but on the last few trips, it's become a frequent occurrence. my friend ordered fettuccine shrimp scampi, and the fettuccine was undercooked. still a decent restaurant, but now, the prices don't justify the quality imo.", 
            "pretty good food and wine for a reasonable price on the strip! we ordered the <mark>Herb Crusted Scottish Salmon</mark>, house made wild mushroom ravioli, <mark>Grilled Prime Burger</mark> and <mark>Jidori Half Chicken</mark> and everyone enjoyed their personal dishes. i had the salmon and it was cooked and seasoned well. the bread basket was also good. the service was a little slow at first but ultimately we were well taken care of. i had a glass of the beringer cabernet which was also good. they also have a larger bar with tvs and full service for those people who want to dine a little more casual. i would suggest they update their online menu as the dessert menu is completely different from what i had seen and wanted to order.", 
            "another decent choice when you don't feel like driving out to the neighborhoods for a bite.  get your comps ready!\n\ni ordered the <mark>Grilled Prime Burger</mark> and it's a decent deal at $18 which includes fries!  temperature is a perfect medium, good quality and juicy beef (from what i heard, it's from a prime rib).  nothing to complain about here.", 
            "my husband and i decided to come here for my pre birthday lunch.  there was no wait and the hostess seated us right away.  our waiter was prompt and always checked on us.  we ordered the chili glazed <mark>Crisp Chicken Wings</mark> as a starter and it was delicious.  i had the <mark>Grilled Prime Burger</mark> and my husband had the breakfast sandwich. both were very satisfying and tasty.  we ended our meal with the vanilla bean cream br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e topped with fresh fruit.  i would definitely come back again.", 
            "this place was awesome. the food blew me away honestly. \nit's inside of the mgm grand so you have to walk a ways to get there, but the atmosphere is nice. \nthe service is stellar. super attentive. my water was constantly being refilled and whenever we asked for anything it was there within seconds. \n\ni ordered the <mark>Grilled Prime Burger</mark> and it was amazing. the meat was primo and cooked perfectly. \n\nthe only reason i'm giving this place 4 stars was because the host podium was poorly organized and became over-crowded. \n\nbut definitely would come here again and would absolutely recommend !"

            "delicious food, but i must've been missing something about this place. it was okay, and i didn't mind the noise coming from being in the middle of the casino. we were seated promptly despite not having a reservation during the lunch hour. the menu is small (one page worth of food) but varied. i ended up getting the <mark>Mesquite Grilled Prime Flat Iron Steak</mark> panini and potato salad. great mix of flavors with the panini and barbeque sauce dip (with a hint of horseradish). the potato salad was probably one of the best i've had...it wasn't too sour and had just enough mayonnaise to keep it rich. \n\nunfortunately what brought this rating down for me was the service. slow service. it took a while to get our check, and even longer to get back my credit card. i think i only saw the server once after my food came.", 
            "stopped here for a few munchies after watching ka and before hitting the clubs. \n\nwe sat at the edge of the bar & not shockingly got a lot of attention from those stopping by just for a drink. after much debate, we asked the bartender for recs. we got the pepperoni olive pizza & <mark><mark>Mesquite Grilled Prime Flat Iron Steak</mark> Skewers</mark>. \n\nthe pepperoni was housemade, but it may as well not have been because i couldn't taste the difference. it was overally a bit too salty (maybe they should've taken into account the saltiness of the toppings before seasoning). \n\nthe <mark><mark>Mesquite Grilled Prime Flat Iron Steak</mark> Skewers</mark> were tender, but the slaw wasn't dressed enough. the presentation was nice though.\n\nservice was prompt & the bartender was friendly.\n\ni would only go back for the people watching & random funny attention.",

            "we sat at the bar and the bartender was very nice, good with suggestions of beer, mixed drinks and appetizers. \n\ni ordered some <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> covered with cheese, an order of fried chicken and i got an oatmeal stout and a few doppel bachs. the chips were really good and matched well with both choices of brews that were suggested. the fried chicken was very tasty with the right amount of crunch and yet still keeping plenty of juicyness in the chicken.\n\nthe 2nd visit we got the chips again, plus <mark><mark>Mesquite Grilled Prime Flat Iron Steak</mark> Skewers</mark> and had the doppel bachs. the meat on the skewers were very tender and tasted pretty good but not anything mind blowing like the chips. \n\nwe actually went back 3x for the chips other than what i've mentioned above.", 
            "okay... we're in the mgm, i'm not really hungry but after a seemingly endless day of walking, drinking and gambling i really should feed myself, and emeril's is closed. plus my boyfriend is wearing sandals and i'll be damned if i'm going to hike all the way back to the riviera (!) to change. ugh... oh? what's this? a bar and grill in the middle of the casino? hmmm... oh, it's wolfgang puck? ok, hell, why not. i'm a sucker for celebrity chefs. \n\nwe walk in at about 10:10 pm and are seated promptly, our waiter almost immediately coming by to ask for drink orders. all i had was water and the bf had a beer. menu was interesting... like a bar and grill menu done right. good old <mark>Crisp Chicken Wings</mark> and pizzas, as well as things like <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> and <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cakes</mark>. i ended up getting the <mark><mark>Mesquite Grilled Prime Flat Iron Steak</mark> Skewers</mark> and a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>. the bf got the burger.\n\nlet's see here.... (thinking back through a hazy fog of blurred-together vegas memories)... the bread basket they brought: okay but cold. the boyfriend liked the olive foccacia, i would have liked it if it weren't the temperature of an ice cube. the caesar: meh. the low point of the meal. i liked how the romaine leaves were left whole for me to cut up, but i didn't care for the dressing. little too lemony. my own homemade caesar dressing is better. plus i kinda like croutons, the bruschetta was pretty good, but the croustini could have been a little less thin and wafer-y. (yes, i know, i'm being ultra-picky.) the <mark><mark>Mesquite Grilled Prime Flat Iron Steak</mark> Skewers</mark>: yum. cooked perfectly. nice presentation. tasty house-made steak sauce. someone else said the slaw it came with was underdressed, and they were completely right. actually it wasn't really dressed at all. but i could excuse that, cuz the steaks were so yummy. here's the pathetic part: i was feeling so shitty that i couldn't even finish the entire tiny little appetizer. there's five skewers, with about three or four bites of steak on each. i ended up taking two back to my room. yeah. beyond sad. but man they tasted good cold at three in the morning... \n\nthe bf's burger: can't really offer any useful commentary as i was not even remotely interested in taking a bite... under normal circumstances i would have been all over it. his fries were awesome though. i wish all bars had fries like this... and menus like this... \n\nwe had to box up our food and scramble the eff outta there cuz for some fool reason we wanted to rush up the strip to see the last free pirate show thingy at ti.... which they cancelled anyway when we got there at the last second. c'est la vegas, i guess. but yes, wolfgang puck is pretty good grubbin' for the money, and a great option if you don't happen to be clad in business casual at the moment and/or don't feel like spending $100+ on dinner.", 
            "this is my favorite casino restaurant in las vegas. i've tried a lot of things on the menu here and have never been disappointed.\nalthough they have good pizzas, the rest of the menu steals the show. my favorite is the chicken milanese. close runners up are; the cheeseburger, <mark>Mesquite Grilled Prime Flat Iron Steak</mark>, and the unforgettable <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cakes</mark>. they offer some great complimentary fresh bread for a start as well.\nsometimes i find myself eating here more than once when i visit vegas. it is also right next to ka, which is one of my favorite vegas shows, and has a pit of cheap black jack tables right out front as well. sometimes there is a short wait during rush hour.",

(other restaurants have no problem cooking well done in a timely manner.) my bf loved his ribeye and all the accoutrements that came with it. he would give it an 8.5 - 9 out of 10 (just an fyi, he loves all food). <mark>Mesquite Grilled Prime Flat Iron Steak</mark> was rare and flavorful but a bit tough with grit, that happens with these steaks sometimes. i didn't finish the skinny fries as they weren't 'amazing' but they were fresh, crispy and 'fun' for a minute. i would have preferred mashed or baked. fries seem to make the plate weak especially at $37.00. a 7 out of 10. \n\ndessert: the desert was 10 out of 10- a \"warm chocolate melting brownie with vanilla bean ice cream\". they dont 'do' bday's there meaning they dont sing and embarrass you but they did make a beautiful plate with kind wishes. the dessert was comped which was very nice, especially at $12.00. \n\noverall if in vegas again i would go back but for the salad mostly.",

            "having experienced terrible service and food at a fairly expensive restaurant during a previous visit, my group decided to find something well-recommended and decently priced. also, celebrity chef restaurants were brought up, and because wolfgang puck's bar and grill was right by ka, it won!\n\nwe were seated in a fairly short amount of time [it was a bit after 9pm on sunday, but still busy]. the decor was interesting [plaid ceilings and floral glass \"walls\"]. the restaurant is on a platform overlooking the waiting area for ka and was right near the mgm casino. my friend noticed after dinner that there were a ton of servers, but only one female server which was quite the opposite of... everywhere! \n\nthe waiter seemed very jazzed about dinner and explaining everything, and we were worried when he didn't write anything down, but he was awesome! braden was nice, funny, got everything right, and he was great about checking in with us. our water glasses were always full, and our food was amazing! there were multiple people who did the water, drinks, and food serving [they did bring out the food to the wrong people, but they got the orders right so what does it matter?].\n\nmy mouth was watering just reading the menu, but i wasn't feeling great so i thought i'd pick smaller options--hah! i got mac'n cheese and <mark>Roasted Cauliflower</mark>. the mac'n cheese wasn't anything amazing, but it tasted pretty good with the cauliflower in it. two people at the table got the lasagna, which tasted like regular lasagna, but it did have a nice presentation. my sister got the gourmet burger. it was $25 and so worth it! she asked for medium, and it was pretty pink and soooo flavorful! it came with thinly sliced and fanned avocado, all the fixings, and incredibly tasty fries. i believe my boyfriend got the <mark>Italian Sausage</mark> pizza with goat cheese, and that was also super tasty and a decent size. \n\nthe only complaint we really had was that the ginger lime iced tea did not taste at all gingery. we agreed that this place was pretty great, and if we're ever in vegas again we'll have to try one of puck's other restaurants! \n\nlast bit--they had quite a large group in there at several long tables, so they can accommodate big groups!",

            "bread-pudding-gasm '07. no shit folks. i would have never have thought that i would be comparing a boring little british dessert like bread pudding to anything related to sex. but, it's true! read on....\n\nwolfgang puck had the honor of being my last meal in 2007 and what started out as a seemingly average dinner of organic chicken with garlic <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> and rosemary jus, i mean seriously i have that like every night.  my meal was accompanied by a vodka tonic and a nice sauvignon blanc, but it just wasn't enough to make me feel like my last '07 wasn't somewhat disappointing.  \n\nuntil....dessert.  imagine how bored i must have felt to pass up chocolate brownies, crme brule and other delectables to settle on bread pudding.  i even gripped about how long it was taking to come out saying that it was just bread pudding and it shouldn't take long.  so imagine my surprise and delight with the king-size portion arrived topped with vanilla ice cream and surrounded by custard and accompanied by an irish coffee...mmmmm. at first bite, i knew...this is living!", 
            "mmm! their red snapper special incorporates delicious elements and is paired well with their <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>. we go here when we want a casual but guaranteed satisfactory experience. the prices are reasonable and it is situated on the floor of the mgm casino so there is always plenty to see. they have a honey lemonade that makes for a great cocktail when ordered with grey goose.\n\npros: food, price, beverages\n\ncons: since it is on the casino floor, it lacks intimacy.", 
            "my husband works at mgm. we have tried a good amount of places there. i recently tried wolfgang pucks. i always pass it when i visit him, so i was curious.\n\ni had the truffle <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> with maytag blue cheese sauce to start off with. oh my goodness! these have to be the most spectacular <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> i have ever had. then again, almost anything cooked with truffle is amazing.  \n\ni was told that the organic chicken was very good. and for my first time there, i always think a chicken dish is pretty safe and hard to ruin. it was quite good. it wasn't dry at all, and the skin was cooked just perfectly. i like the skin to be pretty crunchy.  it was served on top of garlic <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>, honey glazed carrots, and spring peas.  carrots were perfect. i like mine a bit undercooked to give it that crunch texture (if you want soft veggie, go eat baby food).  the potatoes were very good to my tasting, but i am not a potato connoisseur.  \n\nto top off dinner we shared the chocolate beignets. i was expecting the old fashion beignets (like the square ones from new orleans at caf\\u00e9 du monde). of course, leave it to these chefs to re-invent them. these beignets were almost like donut holes, but better! they are almost like the texture of chocolate souffl\\u00e9 that is rolled into a ball. and inside this ball was core of yummy chocolate-ness.  to compliment it all, it was served with vanilla bean ice cream and caramel sauce. \n\nservice was decent. it was incredibly busy when we came, so i am not completely sure how they normally are. i would actually give a 2 1/2 -3 stars for service. but the <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> and beignets make me want to give them four overall.", 
            "basing this review on past experiences. the last time i went i was disappointed in the food, the service was still excellent. \n\ni've eaten here several times and have had the calamari (so-so), the <mark><mark>Mesquite Grilled Prime Flat Iron Steak</mark> Skewers</mark> (amazing), <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> (very good), buffalo cheese pizza (incredible), calves liver (stupid good), caramelized brussel sprouts, <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>, banoffee, and pineapple upside cake with vanilla ice cream. \n\nbasically everything there has been incredibly good. this is another place that i always hit up when i'm in vegas and i'm hoping the last time i was there was just an off night because i would hate to find it's no longer worth stopping at.", 
            "yummy!!!!!  my husband and i love this restaurant!  every time we go to vegas or los angeles we always make it a point to come to this restaurant.\n\nfirst up are their wings.  my husband loves them.  they are always cooked to perfection.  the flavor is great!  he orders them whenever we visit.\n\nnext up is the <mark>Chinois Chicken Salad</mark> sandwich on cherry pecan bread.  talk about delicious!!  the bread's flavor is very unique.  always nice and fresh.  the <mark>Chinois Chicken Salad</mark> is just as good as the bread.  best <mark>Chinois Chicken Salad</mark> i have ever had.\n\n<mark>Italian Sausage</mark> wood oven pizza: excellent.  very good.  flavor is very different from what regular pizza joints have to offer.  \n\nfinally, my absolute favorite, the free range chicken breasts with <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>.  the chicken is absolutely huge (and i do mean huge) but it is always cooked to please.  it is so tender & juicy it just melts in your mouth.  now, i do have to admit, the 1st time i went to the restaurant i was like, what the heck is <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>.  that sounds so nasty, but to my surprise it was great!  very flavorful!  \n\ni would recommend this restaurant to everyone looking to have a great meal.  yeah, it's a little expensive, but it's vegas baby.  what do you expect?", 
            "can i say loooooooooooooooouuuuud? \n\nholy guacamole, it was loud. definitely not a good place for a first date or a meeting or catch-up-talk-story kind of place because it is open to the public but my boyfriend & i enjoyed ourselves, nonetheless. we were shouting at each other rather than talking cause it was so loud but we were laughing the whole time. it was fun. \n\nnow that you've been warned about the noise, onto the food. it's delicious. seriously. the complementary bread and butter was yummy and they didn't hesitate to give us seconds once we were done with our first basket. oh, and the servers were great! very friendly and attentive. refilled our drinks almost instantaneously. okay, back to the food. my boyfriend got the <mark>Grilled Prime Burger</mark>. it was huge, tasty, juicy and flavorful. he devoured it. \n\ni ordered the <mark>Jidori Half Chicken</mark> and <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> with veggies. i practically slurped that rosemary jus because it was just yummy. the chicken is pan seared and baked. honestly, the juiciest chicken i have ever had in my life. not dry or over-salted at all.. it was seasoned perfectly and i was sad after my last bite.\n\nsince we were locals, we ended with a complementary dessert to share. (they won't ask if you're local. just tell them you are & they will be more than happy to hand you the dessert menu). we got the beignets with citrus custard inside and caramel dipping sauce. i wasn't a big fan of the citrus custard and would have loved for it be simply a vanilla custard but i liked it for the most part. \n\nthe price is cheaper than most restaurants on the strip. i was looking for something that wasn't solely burgers but i didn't want to splurge too much so this place was a great choice. will definitely be back someday!", 
            "walked in on a late 1am friday morning.  basically hungry from our flight and just wanted to that white castle craving to go away.  \n\nluckily, there were plenty of tables open, so we were seated right away without reservation.  the dining area was set up nicely and clean.  appearance was colorful,  modern, and quite unique.  we were served by albert, and he was attentive from beginning to end.  only that's about it.\n\nso, we started with the <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> ($11) with a blue cheese sauce.  these were superb, but not anything to rave about.  i mean, i love truffle and i love blue cheese, but it couldn't keep my mind off those belly bombers.  i guess the chips and sauce really brought out the saltiness.  meh, i knew i wanted the <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> instead, oh well.  \n\nnow the ceasar salad ($13) was a winner, well kind of.  fresh baby romaine leaves with the ceasar salad dressing.  though it tasted great, only i personally thought it was small for the price.  the croutons were big and tasteless as well.  \n\nthen there was the <mark>Jidori Half Chicken</mark> ($28) with vegtables, a <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>, topped with rosemary au jus, and a side of kale salad.  now, for $28 this better be the best chicken ever.  it was excellent, but not the best ever!  full of flavor, but you had to mix it all together to drown the over-saltiness.  \n\nbecause of these dishes, we ordered their cheapest bottle of white wine, the nuschese pinot grigio ($32).  a suitable choice especially for the chicken and salad.  a surprisingly enjoyable wine.  thanks again to albert's recommendation, it made for a good compliment;  and we just killed that bottle!\n\nso, overall, i've gone to several wolfgang puck locations and this just confirms i'm not a fan of his style.  after spending a total of $103 for two people, i simply feel this place is overrated and overpriced.  this place already put me in the hole!", 
            "i came across this place and walked right in on a monday afternoon. lots of business looking people and im pretty sure we were the only mexicans there. our server who i forgot his name (a nice, 20something asian guy) was very sweet and checked in on us often.  my mom ordered the veggie pizza and <mark>Home Style Chicken Noodle Soup</mark> as an app. since i ordered the chicken, our server warned us it would take about 20 minutes since they need to make sure its fully cooked. my mom asked i wanted <mark>Home Style Chicken Noodle Soup</mark> and i said no because its boring and im over it. when it came, i saw her soup looked pretty good so i tried  it and it was the most delicou un-boring soup with plenty of flavor. her veggie pizza was okkkk but my chicken with <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> was amazing and worth the wait!!!!! i only wished they served bread sticks or something with your meals."

            "we have been here several times, always for lunch.  we often go here before we have to take that long flight back to the east coast.  this restaurant is also very convenient as we often stay at mgm, so it makes for a quick and easy bite to eat on our way out. \n\nanyways, i have tried the <mark>Home Style Chicken Noodle Soup</mark> (classic <mark>Home Style Chicken Noodle Soup</mark> with big chunks of chicken) and the spicy <mark>Big-Eye Tuna Tartare</mark>.  i have also had the <mark>French Style Omelet</mark> with <mark>Crisp Tuscan Potatoes</mark>.  this meal makes for a great hangover meal when you are too late to catch breakfast.  but the real reason we keep coming back here is for the pizza!  wolfgang knows his pizza and he certainly does it right!  we have tried probably every pizza he offers on his menu (i think about 5) and they are all stupendous!  i really enjoyed the <mark>Mushroom</mark>, leeks, and goat cheese and the hubby prefers the classic pepperoni!\n\nthe dinner menu is like an extension of the lunch menu, so i'm sure it makes for a fabulous dinner as well!  \n\nlove your pizzas puck!", 
            "everything we tried here was really good.... so good we ate here twice during our trip. i highly recommend the apple salad (huge), mac and cheese, prosciutto and pesto pizza and the <mark>Crisp Tuscan Potatoes</mark>. i don't care too much about portion sizes so long as the food is good, but you get both here: wonderful flavors and generous servings.\n\nmy only real complaint: the atmosphere is a little strange. the restaurant is on a platform but there aren't any walls separating the restaurant from the rest of the casino, just railings, so you're right in the fray of the slot machines. that said, it's the only drawback. definitely worth giving this place a try.", 
            "this restaurant wins all around.\n\nthe staff share the responsibility of all tables, so you are never begging for attention...or more of your beverage.\n\nthe food was yummy (we had a pizza, the crispy <mark>Crisp Tuscan Potatoes</mark> and a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>)!\n\nthe design/layout is great.  it felt like you were in a swanky loft in nyc...normal kitchen islands, cabinetry, etc.\n\nall of these for very reasonable prices.  our total bill was less than $50, and that included 2 non-alcoholic (boooooring) drinks on top of the food mentioned.\n\ngreat place to eat if you're on the strip and hungry for a sit-down dinner with quality food!", 
            "what's the top go-to food that's thought of as a classic vegas drunchie meal? \n\nsteak and eggs, baby.\n\nand i'm surprised to say this but wolfgang serves up an awesome steak and eggs dish. pricey ($~29.00), yes, but it's totally worth the extra bucks. not to mention, the plate can easily be shared between two if you aren't super hungry (but you know you need something in your stomach to deter a potential hangover in the morning). \n\n<mark>Mesquite Grilled Prime Flat Iron Steak</mark> and eggs with <mark>Crisp Tuscan Potatoes</mark> and herb hollandaise sauce. mmm doesn't that just sound good to you? \n\nthe steak, ordered medium rare, was cooked beautifully (none of that tough dry steak nonsense here). loved how as soon as i cut into the meat with my steak knife, the firm flesh revealed a warm red center. juicy, flavorful, well-seaseoned deliciousness.\n\nmy friend and i asked for sun side up eggs, which were perfect for eating right over toast (you can choose sourdough, wheat or white, served with butter or jam on the side), and them <mark>Crisp Tuscan Potatoes</mark> were bombdiggity. they reminded me of smashed potatoes except they were prepared in a way where crispiness was not compromised. dip with ketchup and you've struck gold. \n\ni don't think i could eat steak and eggs anywhere else... i've been spoiled so. i'll be sure to return the next time i'm in vegas for crazy drunken shenanegans!", 
            "mmmm, every bite i ate was better than the last.  i thoroughly enjoyed the entire meal.  i ordered the maytag bleu cheese chips for an appetizer and fully plan to go back for another one of these before i go home - so yummy.  they were simple - homemade <mark>Truffled Potato Chips</mark> with bleu cheese sauce topping them, but they were the favorite appetizer among the group i was with.  for dinner, i had the special - an 8oz filet, crusted with blue crab and served with some kind of spiced bearnaise sauce (i forget what the spice was).  on the side, i opted for the crispy <mark>Crisp Tuscan Potatoes</mark>.   everything was really delicious.  the steak was cooked just a little rare for my taste (i ordered medium), but i have come to expect this with filet as it's so thick.  the bearnaise, oh the bearnaise.  i could have ordered a bowl full of it.  the crab crust on top was also very tasty.  the bearnaise and crab elevated the steak, and the combination was perfect.  i highly recommend the <mark>Crisp Tuscan Potatoes</mark>.  they are simple - red skinned potatoes, sliced and tossed with olive oil, salt and some herbs, then flash fried.  they were great.  i was almost talked into the fries, as they are supposed to be excellent. i had the opportunity to try some from one of my tablemates, and they were good, but fries are fries.  so glad i went with the potatoes instead.  \n\nnow, the ambiance...  it is nicely decorated and our server was very good.  he gave us excellent advice and recommendations.  it is very loud, however.  the restaurant has a patio effect, and is open to the casino, passerby, etc.  they have music playing on top of all of that exterior noise, and in order for it to be heard, the music has to be quite loud.  when our server was on the other side of the table explaining the specials, i couldn't hear a word he said.  i was with a group of seven, and i had no hope of hearing those at the other end of the table.  by the time we left, my voice was scratchy as if i had been to a concert.\n\nin summary - food was absolutely fantastic.  i'm going back for lunch just to eat it again.  but don't go if you're looking for a quiet, peaceful or romantic dinner.", 
            "fantastic food and service. one of my favorite restaurants in vegas and they're open till 6am! <mark>Crisp Tuscan Potatoes</mark> and the steak are my favorite things to get. the creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e is delicious as well.", 
            "bf's birthday- \nrestaurant: open air seating on the casino floor - great for people watching. servers are very attentive. \nour meal: $153.64 \nappetizer: saut\\u00e9ed <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cakes</mark> w/ basil pesto aioli & tomato relish $18.00 \nsalad: <mark>Chinois Chicken Salad</mark>, candied cashews, crisp wontons, chinese mustard vinaigrette $16.00 \nentrees: bf- (1) mesquite grilled ribeye, <mark>Crisp Tuscan Potatoes</mark>, saut\\u00e9ed morels, english peas, red wine jus $48.00\nme-(2) <mark>Mesquite Grilled Prime Flat Iron Steak</mark>, blue cheese butter, red wine sauce, fries $37.00 dessert: warm chocolate brownie w/ vanilla bean ice cream - $12.00 (comped) \n\nappetizer: <mark>Maryland Blue Crab Cakes</mark> were the size of a half dollar (being generous) with four on the plate. unfortunately they left no real memory other than small and not fabulous. a 5 out of 10. \n\nsalad: they split the salad in two with both huge portions. it was delicious with an even amount of tasty ingredients to make you fall in love with it. this was a winner, a 10 out of 10. \n\nentrees: our entrees took 30 - 40 minutes or longer. they said it was because the ribeye was ordered 'well done'. (other restaurants have no problem cooking well done in a timely manner.) my bf loved his ribeye and all the accoutrements that came with it. he would give it an 8.5 - 9 out of 10 (just an fyi, he loves all food). <mark>Mesquite Grilled Prime Flat Iron Steak</mark> was rare and flavorful but a bit tough with grit, that happens with these steaks sometimes. i didn't finish the skinny fries as they weren't 'amazing' but they were fresh, crispy and 'fun' for a minute. i would have preferred mashed or baked. fries seem to make the plate weak especially at $37.00. a 7 out of 10. \n\ndessert: the desert was 10 out of 10- a \"warm chocolate melting brownie with vanilla bean ice cream\". they dont 'do' bday's there meaning they dont sing and embarrass you but they did make a beautiful plate with kind wishes. the dessert was comped which was very nice, especially at $12.00. \n\noverall if in vegas again i would go back but for the salad mostly."
