            "what we ordered: \n1. kobe steak <mark>American Wagyu Beef Sashimi, Spicy Radishes</mark> - amazing dish, the highlight of the dinner! the meat was so buttery and the delicate asian flavors of the sauce was a perfect pairing.\n \n2. <mark><mark>Bone Marrow</mark> Flan, Mushroom Marmalade, Parsley Salad</mark> - very good but did not have that intense marrow flavor that i like. i also did not like the accompanying <mark><mark>Bone Marrow</mark> Flan, Mushroom Marmalade, Parsley Salad</mark> as it overpowered the flan. however when eaten by itself the parsley was a good palate cleanser. \n\n3. <mark>Warm Asparagus</mark>, poached <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>, warm bacon vinaigrette - nice salad very good flavor. hard to mess up a dish with those ingredients.\n\n4. nebraska corn fed <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> - not a very thick steak, which i always prefer. the crust was overpowering due to the amount of char. way too much char in my opinion.\n\n5. true japanese 100% wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> - thicker than the nebraska <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> but served in two pieces which i thought was odd. the meat was heavily marbled and very tender. the wagyu steak did not have a very meaty flavor, more relaxed and clean. again though, the charing on the crust proved too much. \n\n6. <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> - very good, recommended. creamy and buttery. \n\nthe service was excellent and the ambiance is very nice. we had a very large and comfortable booth. our sever was very professional and his support staff was very attentive. overall, a good experience but the prices are very high, be prepared to spend. the steaks were too heavily charred for me. almost ruined the high quality meat imho."

            "i love cut in beverly hills, but i think the decor in vegas is better. marino the manager took great care of us, the <mark>Warm Veal Tongue</mark> appetizer was unbelievably good, the sommelier recommended a great italian red to go with my steak which i never would have picked but was great.  the porterhouse for 2 was one of the best steaks i have ever had, and all of our side dishes were amazing, it would be even better if the prices were a little lower.", 
            "we had dinner here last saturday.  we were seated promptly and the waiters were very attentive from the beginning to the end.  we ordered two appetizers the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> and <mark>Warm Veal Tongue</mark> which were delicious.  for steak we ordered the 6oz wagyu filet and the 16oz <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark> which were cooked perfectly and also very delicious! i can't explain the bad reviews here...", 
            "wow this will be short & sweet and to the point.\n im sure all foodies alike have had an eye on cut. of course i have. don't know why i opted to go for it in vegas, but alcohol makes you do strange things. so me and my friend decide to make reservations like an hour before they closed :0 they had no problem with it, it was actually a lot of party's doing the same the hostess  said, so that was a pressure relief \n to know that we wouldn't be getting swept out by the busboys as soon as the meal hits the table. \n\ni like the ipad menu, i thought it was seriously the shit! i played in it for at least 10 minutes before really viewing the menu. so onto the food before we ordered our server for the night, who happened to be the manager, explained the preparation of there steaks, he said they're all soaked in olive oil for 2 days before hittin the kitchen, then they sear it and finish it in the oven, he  then said you wont see blood and a river of juices run out the  bad boys when you slice them because they let it rest when they take it out before serving it to you . it was some bleeping damn good meat!!\n\n  for an appetizer we had the \"<mark>Warm Veal Tongue</mark>, marinated artichokes, shelling beans, \"salsa verde\" i did not enjoy this one bit, like i couldn't even stomach it honestly, i went to the restroom and wanted to stick my finger down my throat, but i didn't know if it was the food or the lava brewing pit of alcohol in my stomach having a bad reaction with the ingredients? my friend loved it, she ate it all so it must of been me?\n\nfor the main course i had the 35 day aged petite <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> and my friend had the 28 day aged <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>. as a side we had the creamed spinach with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> . the steaks here are definitely gonna be ranked between 1 through 5 on my best steak i've ever eaten list. i actually liked my friends <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> about 4 times more than my delicious felit, and since the <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> was so huge she didn't mind sharing with me at all! thank lanz! the creamed spinach was really good pretty rich but delicious.\nto top off this beautiful meal the manager sent us a desert out on the house, that was a super 5 star thumbs up!! the infamous \"banana cream pie, fudgesicle \"ice\", chocolate sauce, valrhona pearls \" this was slamming my taste buds around like a ufc bout was goinng down in my mouth, so many different textures and layers as you eat it and the little pearls of chocolate were rockin..... mmmmm  just thinking about it makes my mouth drool!", 
            "two years and 15 more visits since my last review proves in my mind that cut is the pantheon of steak.  \n\nthe kobe steak sashimi with spicy radish garnish is a perfect way to sample the high quality of the beef.  the fat literally melts in your mouth.  their take on a steak tartare with herb aioli is equally good.  a modern redo of a classic.  finally, the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan is to die for.  (i really like the <mark>Warm Veal Tongue</mark> but don't want animal activist to think i'm heartless).\n\nnow the beef.  this is a true steak lovers paradise.  all of the steaks are beautifully aged, trimmed.  all are prime and above.  all steaks are at least partially grilled over charcoal for the perfect bitterness.  the steaks:\n\n-  illinois corn fed aged 21 days - good beef flavor.  bone in cuts are better.\n\n- nebraska corn fed 35 days - deep beef flavor. very nutty.  strong umame.  not for everyone but outstanding if you like very good aged beef.  the <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> is the top pick.\n\n-  american wagyu - truly outstanding.  tender and buttery.  the cuts are small but with the incredible richness, more than enough food.  do not order this beyond medium rare or it dries up and is a waste.  the <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> is the most flavorful cut.\n\n- australian wagyu - wow. nuff said.\n\nfirst time visitors should try the tasting of <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark>.  it offers an outstanding selection and gives the opportunity to try different super grades of beef.\n\nfinally, the braised short ribs deserve special mention.  if you want something different, this is it.  it is indian spiced so a bit different but absolutely fall of the bone tender.\n\ni have never tried their sauces, toppings, or sides.  naked steaks are best to me.\n\nthe wine list remains extensive.  prices are good.\n\nto those wanting the absolute best in beef, cut is without a doubt it.", 
            "it was the bone in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> illinois corn fed for me.  i requested rare, but i think i got something that was cooked a little more.  other than that, it was still pretty good.\n\ni had a quick sampling of the nebraska version and it was definitely more tender and  tasty.\n\n<mark>Warm Veal Tongue</mark>, while it had a tongue texture/taste, i couldn't tell the difference if someone told me it was veal or non-veal.", 
            "on my drive up to vegas i was thinking kobe beef at cut. so after the cocktail party was over we headed to cut to chow down on some melt in your mouth steak. the following order was devoured without any guilt.\n\n\nkobe steak sashimi,\n<mark>Warm Veal Tongue</mark>,\n<mark>Bone Marrow</mark> dumplings\nhow's that for jacking up your cholesterol. and it was just the beginning.\n\nkobe style\" beef from snake river farms, idaho\nporterhouse 34 oz* (for two) but i ate it all.\n<mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> 6 oz* wagyu \n\nbrussels sprouts, smoky <mark>Fingerling Potatoes, Smokey Bacon, Pearl Onions</mark>\n<mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> & japanese shishito peppers\n<mark>Soft Polenta with Parmesan</mark>\ncavatappi pasta, \"mac & cheese\", quebec cheddar (really cheesy)\n\nno desert for us, i rolled out of cut stuffed like a pig.", 
            "idk how this place could get any less than at least 4 stars. this place is extremely expensive but you definitely get your moneys worth. exceptional customer service, presentation, and food. our husband and i had no complaints whatsoever. we ordered the <mark>Warm Veal Tongue</mark> and <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan which were definitely interesting but tasty. we ordered the american wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> and <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> and it was hands down the best steak we have ever had, i can only imagine how the japanese steak tastes. you must spend the extra $2 on the sauces they recommend for that specific steak it makes a huge difference. also try their baked alaska dessert. amazing. definitely recommend trying this restaurant out.", 
            "very good steak place.  i can see the reason why this place is busting at the seams when db, delmonico, and every other restaurant that serve steak had empty seats on this wednesday night. the friendly staff and reliably good food- it is hard to find much weakness.  from the parmesan breadsticks, cheese puffs, breads, <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark>, after dinner chocolate that are complimentary to your dinner, they complete your meal nicely. i had the lobster and crab appetizer and nebraska <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> and my date had <mark>Warm Veal Tongue</mark> and a nebraska <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> as well. i loved my appetizer but i already got full halfway through it.  we enjoyed the steak but couldn't finish it or the potatoes and the mushrooms.  we still had to try one dessert and we shared baked alaska. it was more beautiful than incredible."

            "my friend wanted to have one really nice dinner for his vegas bday weekend.  we all love steak, so we decided to make reservations at cut.  i had just dined at alexander's( http://www.yelp.com/biz/alexanders-steakhouse-cupertino#hrid:zgok0ixxx8fog1fdfdmgka/src:self ) a few weeks prior and loved it, so i had super high expectations for cut.  we had a party of eight, so we called in for reservations ahead of time. \n\nservice here is definitely outstanding.  there were so many servers waiting on us, i couldn't keep track.  our water glasses were always full, and your napkin would always be folded if you got out of your seat.  our waiter brought out a platter to display the different cuts of wagyu beef....kobe vs. american...so we could see the different marbling.    \n\nfor my first course, i ordered the <mark>Roasted Weiser Farms Baby Beets</mark>, humboldt fog goat cheese, pistachio, citrus, micro basil,  & mint.  i originally was going to get the usda prime <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark>, but it was only $20 more for the american wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>....i was sold.  i added the <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> to top off my lovely piece of steak.  our table also ordered saut\\u00e9ed baby spinach, <mark>Soft Polenta with Parmesan</mark> and <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>.\n\nmy beet appetizer had a very nice presentation.  it was very colorful, and all of the ingredients complimented each other very well.  all of our sides were very tasty.  the polenta was nice and creamy, <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark> were crispy, and the spinach added the \"healthy\" factor to our meal.\n\nthey prepare the steaks over a hard wood and charcoal grill and then finish them off in a broiler.  my steak was cooked to a nice medium rare, and it melted in my mouth.  the steak had great flavor, but i didn't really care much for the charred flavor from the broiler.  the <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> i added went well with my steak and kept it moist from the sauce.  i wasn't able to finish my steak and gave it to my friends who had the usda prime <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>.  they were amazed and could totally tell the difference from the wagyu.\n\nthe only disappointment i had here was that they didn't have foie gras as an add on to your steak.  i was spoiled by alexander's, and left the restaurant craving that melt in your mouth foie gras.  i was so expecting a 5 star dinner here, but i just couldn't give it to them.  please add foie gras to the menu!", 
            "amazing steak and other food, but be prepared for a slight bit of wallet shock.\n\ni made reservations at cut back in may while visiting lv, but due to an unfortunate bout of illness (do not eat duck fried rice from the bellagio poker room)  that required hospitalization, i was forced to give my reservations to my friends. the next day, visiting me in the hospital, they raved about the quality of the steaks, being from overseas. i knew that next time i was in las vegas, i would need to go.\n\nwhat luck that several weeks later my boyfriend did extremely well in a wsop event, and we returned to las vegas and made another reservation at cut for mid june.\n\nwe were seated a booth with a leather tables and service was quick and prompt. we knew we wanted steak, but my boyfriend and i have very different tastes in wine, so the sommelier came over to help us with the (very) awkward ipad wine list. she helped us pick just the right wine that met our desires. \n\nafter ordering our wine, we got down to business. for appetizers, we had the kobe sashimi and the <mark>Roasted Weiser Farms Baby Beets</mark> with goat cheese. they actually balanced quite nicely, as we knew we had a lot of meat ahead of us. \n\nfor our main courses, i chose the american wagyu filet, normally 6 oz, and added an extra 2 oz for extra. i love kobe filet for it's melting butter like quality, and this cut was no exception. it was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and it was the quality and taste i would expect for a $130 steak. my boyfriend chose the <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark> tasting that consisted of the dry aged american sirloin, american wagyu, and nz wagyu. he ordered it rare and it came slightly over rare (which is acceptable, because these cuts were thick) and they were epic. just meaty and buttery at the same time. my steak-loving boyfriend was in heaven. \n\nfor sides, we had the mac & cheese, and spring peas with bacon. to be honest, we didn't eat much of those as we focused primarily on the steak, but both were good - also rich and bacony! \n\nafter some excessive meat consumption, i saw a souffle float by to another table. i had to dig deep down, but i never regretted the chocolate souffle. it was rich but airy at the same time. i didn't even look at the other desserts, but it was one of the best i've had. the small little cookies and tarts were a nice little treat we had wrapped up to-go that went nicely with our coffee for breakfast the next morning.\n\nthe service was extremely attentive and water refills/bread requests came quickly and discretely. (yes, the bread was that good too). my one disappointment is the overall atmosphere. the overly slick design and mirrors everywhere made me feel like i was in an hgtv show <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> of a restaurant.  when i think steakhouse, i think a little more comfortable and a little less \"sleek.\" that said, i also deplored the amount of  people taking pictures...man people, don't use flash in a restaurant, i like to eat my food without blinding. if you're so consumed by where you are, please avoid me at all costs.\n\noverall, i recommend cut if you have money to splurge but you'll be sure to enjoy your meal."

            "thank you, wolfgang puck.......meatatarian...... i am!\n\ni'm not real big on giving out 5 stars to steak places and the only other place that gets this honor is peter luger's in brooklyn.  after visit cut, i realized that it was indeed deserved.\n\neverything is a la carte. we were a group of six which was nice because we were able to get an array of different side dishes and apps.  <mark>Pink Lady & Fuji Apple Salad</mark>, crab & lobster louis cocktail and the tomato salad, there were also some memorable breads.\n\nit was unanimous, everyone ordered \"tasting of <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark>\".  we couldn't pass it up.  there was 4oz of usda prime, 4oz of american \"kobe\" and 2oz of japanese wagyu.   steak heaven.  we chose the <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>, the creamed spinach, the polenta and the <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark>.  the only thing that was terrible was the polenta.... but that's an acquired taste kind of thing.... and i didn't acquire it!\n\ni never in my life wanted to eat steak so slowly as to savor every bite of that kobe.....until i took a bite of the wagyu.  it freaking melts in your mouth! it's served in this trio to say, \"see how much better it is than your usda prime?\" and wow is it true.\n\nthe decor was very ultra lounge.  i loved it.  colors worked well, warm tones.  service was uber professional and very helpful when discussing wines.  i did have a 20 minute wait, even with reservations, but that's to be expected anywhere in vegas so it didn't even phase me.\n\ni will be back.", 
            "highly overrated. highly overpriced.\n\nthe oxtail soup was the only exceptional dish, everything was very mediocre. we had ordered nothing short of the best cut had to offer:  japanese kobe, american wagyu, lobster, polenta, creamed spinach, <mark>Pink Lady & Fuji Apple Salad</mark>, and <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>. nothing spectacular. everything lacked that \"wow\" you would expect when you pay $250 for your dinner. \n\nif you are looking for a great steakhouse in lv, try botero at the encore. they top cut in all respects, no joke. note i did have japanese kobe at both restaurants. \n\ni'd stay away from this place. too much hype all around.", 
            "one of the best steaks i've had in my life.\n\nenough with the complaints about the price though... you know it's going to be expensive when you come here, so be prepared.  i was a bit skeptical when i made reservations because i think wp has over-extended himself in vegas now... is it 6 restos he has?\n\nthat being said, i think he does a fabulous job here.  a group of 5 of us came and the table consensus was that the steaks were amazing.  awesome decor, very masculine, and i loved the spinning chairs.  the wine list is extensive and excellent... for those on expense accounts, you can have your choice of \"esoteric wines\" to boot :)\n\nthe group ordered a variety of salads to start, and i had the <mark>Pink Lady & Fuji Apple Salad</mark> with walnuts and dates - unique and delicious.  crisp and tartness in the apples offset with a hint of cinnamon.\n\nfor steaks, a variety was ordered around the table including the porterhouse, ny sirloin and a friend ordered the scallops.  i went for the american wagyu after the server showed the different cuts (the japanese wagyu looked a little too fatty to me).  the steaks were excellent - nicely flavored and well cut.  it was my first time ordering a wagyu and the meat is a bit fattier than what i'm used to with the marbling, but it was delicious.\n\nthe sides were a bit weak - these are served family style here so we had fries (very good), the broccoli (so-so) and the mushrooms (so-so).\n\nit's pricey but i thought it was worth every penny... even my cheap-ass husband agreed, aside from the sides.\n\nanyone who's also on a low-carb diet should consider forgoing it for the night... there are a few breadsticks to start, but this is followed by a bread service which is excellent.  a server presents a selection of breads on a platter... you must try their special bread.  it's got a soft pretzel with salt like taste and is tdf.  can't wait to come back.", 
            "amidst the plethora of generic steakhouses in vegas cut is not cut above the rest.  pun intended.\n\n i thought the \"shock and awe\" spectacle of presenting beautifully marbled raw beef of different backgrounds (filet, <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, wagyu, <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark>) stacked together to stimulate the salvatory glands was a bit kitchy, maybe silly, but somewhat effective.  \n \nto start, i ordered the <mark>Pink Lady & Fuji Apple Salad</mark>, with bacon lardons and medjool dates.  i had the waiter arrange a wine flight for me, to which he paired a predictable, but delicious, riesling from germany.  it was a nice crisp start considering i was in for an incredibly rich meal.\n\nwhen the waiter presented the raw meat i was smitten with a wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, and demanded it be mine.  i topped it off with <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>, and waited like a famished lioness.  i asked the waiter for a spicy red, and he sent me a full and spicy bordeaux that i couldn't wait to wash down with my meat.  i am a carnivore of the worst kind, and love my meat to be as rare as possible.  for this cut i opted for medium-rare bloody, and received medium charred.  the fatty marble goodness i anticipated had evaporated.  what was left was a dry, grey, and chewy piece of meat.  i summoned our waiter, and he was appalled and embarrassed.  his profuse apologies, could not appease me.  i did not yell or make a scene, because that would be counterproductive, and let's be honest, it's not his fault.  i was pissed at the cook who left that gorgeous piece of meat sitting in the oven too long.  it takes a professional idiot to kill wagyu, and the lack of respect for a valuable product is unforgivable.  feeling sorry for me, my mom offered to share her beautifully prepared <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> wagyu while i waited, but i wanted her to fully enjoy her meal, so i snacked on the potato gratin, and asparagus sides as i festered about the ruined meat.  \n\nour waiter returned with a new piece of meat, more apologies, and offered to comp my meal.  i told him that was ridiculous and unnecessary.  i was angry that a product was wasted, not that i would have to pay for a meal.  what was delivered was sinfully delicious.  tender, juicy, and melt in your mouth.  the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> was buttery, fatty, and a bit iron-y.  it was great with the beef.  accompanied by the bordeaux, it was fantastic.  the sides were pretty forgettable and generic, and maybe that was part my fault for ordering them, but c'mon, protein, starch, and vegetable...how could you mess that up?!\n\ni don't love dessert, but my mom wanted something sweet, so we ordered some chocolate concoction that wasn't memorable.  i had a lovely spanish port that i enjoyed more than the dessert.\n\nwhen we got the bill our persistent waiter had removed my wine, and the dessert.  so i tipped like a rockefeller, and thanked him anyway.\n\ni'm giving three stars because i do not respect a restaurant that believes it is acceptable to send out an overcooked piece of meat to a customer.  first, you have disrespected the animal, and the purveyor from where that meat originated.  it took hours of work and plenty of money, to raise, feed, clean, massage, slaughter, and ship that animal.  when you disrespect the product you disrespect the entire process it took to get that product on the table, as well as the customer, and your profession as a cook.  three stars.", 
            "okay, i love love love steak and i don't mind paying an arm and a leg for it when it tastes amazing... unfortunately this place \"cut\" did not deliver. the only positive i have to say about this restaurant is that the service was impeccable but when you're spending $70-$150 for a steak it should be. this list of con's is many: wayyyy over priced for what you get, ugly strange d\\u00e9cor, uncomfortable chairs (that look like lawn furniture), small tasteless side dishes, crappy overpriced salads and appetizers, and charred overcooked steaks (which should be a crime).\n\nmy biggest complaint? their steak... come on people, this is a freaking steakhouse! you've got to be able to get at least the steak right!!! i ordered my steak (<mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>) medium, you know, so there is some pink in the middle? apparently the chef didn't get the memo because my steak came out as black as coal, charred to a crisp, and well done for sure. literally... i had to use the knife like a saw to cut through the steak, certainly not melt in your mouth like they advertise. once you cut into it the steak was dry and chewy... i am not stretching when i say i have had better steak at outback! several other people at the table commented on how hard it was to cut their steaks, how black and charred their steaks were, and how hard they were to chew. \n\ni also ordered a crab salad with my meal which was $30 bucks and tasted really bad... the crab was good but everything else they mixed with it including this mushy cheese mixture was horrible. i picked out the crab and left everything else. other people in my party ordered the asparagus <mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark>, the heirloom <mark>Pink Lady & Fuji Apple Salad</mark>, and the <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark> avocado salad as appetizers and said they were just ho-hum. \n\nthe side dishes are ridiculous, they are supposed to serve 3 but really only serve 1 and are expensive... we had to order 8 side dishes for 10 people and we only got a few bites each. their potatoes were watery and not very appealing, their mac-and-cheese was okay but i don't think it was any better than kraft's mac and cheese, and their <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark> were blah... they should call them flavorless onion strings! \n\ni realize this review has been quite harsh but come on wolfgang, we expect more from you! when you are spending $200+ per person the meal should be truly amazing and not a charred small portioned mess!\n\nthink twice about going here... there are so many other amazing steakhouses in vegas that far surpass this one.", 
            "i love the ambiance and decor here. the booths are spacious and comfortable. the service here is magnificent. everyone is very attentive, friendly and helpful. i'm not sure if this happens often, but we kept getting free small samples. our server brought what i think was a small pao de queijo and two pieces of chocolate throughout the dinner, which was really nice/neat of them. we had the golden <mark>Pink Lady & Fuji Apple Salad</mark>, which was refreshing and light. we also ordered the <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> which did not seem very fresh and i would not recommend. while they offer other entrees, their steak selection is glorious. they have wet aged 21 days, dry aged 35 days, cows from all over the country and even from australia. personally, i think wagyu beef can taste too gamey so i don't really prefer it as much (i know i am weird). i really love a good bone-in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> so that is exactly what i ordered. because it was wet aged and bone in and prime, it was super greasy and juicy. the meat itself was cooked to perfection. slightly charred on top and very juicy medium rare prime meat on the inside. i didn't order a side, but i think this is where you should get potatoes to soak up all the juice or you save your bread to eat along with the steak because the meat itself and the juiciness can actually be too much after a while. i ended my meal with the chocolate souffle which was very rich. i really enjoyed my meal here, but i wouldn't name it one of my top favorites only because i didn't really care for much else on the menu. steak alone great, everything else ehh.", 
            "this is definitely one of my top picks to eat at when in vegas! my girls took me here for my birthday this year and omg it was so amazing! i ordered the lobster for the table and i regret not ordering the entire thing for myself because it was outta this world good. just thinking about it makes my mouth water thank goodness im going back in two weeks to dine here again! =d we all ordered the steak i think everyone got the <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, as for the steak it was not nearly memorable as the lobster. i dare say cuts lobster more than rival lobster at gary danko and french laundry. for apps the yummiest items that comes to mind is the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> and the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>. the crab cake and <mark>Pink Lady & Fuji Apple Salad</mark> was pretty good. french fries were french fries lol nothing else to say about them other than that. i did love the onion bread and the pretzel bread and i loved how they let you eat as much as you please because i love onion bread cant get enough of it. we ordered i think half the sides on the menu but only thing really stood out were the spicy peppers. for dessert they gave me a baked alaska for my bday yum! it was perfect way to end the meal. we ordered the souffle because i can never say no to chocolate souffle however it did fall short of expectations. i have to say gary danko and alexanders makes it better. the banana creme pie cake was fantastic, so yummy you could really taste the fresh banana. for a group of 6 girls ordering an app, entree and side plus a lobster for the table the bill came out to be 150 a person of course given the exception that my girls wouldnt let me pay for my portion. least to say it is obviously an expensive place to dine at but worth every penny.", 
            "we experienced cut on new years eve after our friends' wedding earlier in the day.   our reservation for 7 was for 7:30p but when i stopped in at the restaurant to check in at 6:30, i was told that our table was ready anytime we were.  good thing, as this was quite the leisurely meal, we soon found out. \n\nwe were seated at the farthest table in the corner of the room. the seating arrangement worked nicely, although i nearly took out a waiter and a patron as the hostess attempted to make conversation over her shoulder with me, while whisking us through the restaurant.  \n\nour servers introduced themselves to us and asked about drinks.   we requested a wine list and started to peruse the menu.  shortly thereafter, we received the explanation of the beefs cuts and what we could expect to taste, as well as how their meats were prepared.  this should have been my first clue for my own meal.  \n\nafter what seemed like an eternity(nearly a half hour), our waiter returned to collect drink orders.  3 glasses of red wine (2 cab, 1 pinot), a beer, and 3 waters.   we waited 10-15 minutes for those to arrive, and then went about ordering our food.  once ordered, we received breads - oooooh so delicious(i'm sure you've read about them here on other reviews)!   breadsticks on the table proved to be messy to eat, as parmesan flaked everywhere.    \n\nwe ordered a few appetizers including the beet salad, <mark>Pink Lady & Fuji Apple Salad</mark>, and <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark> salad, <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, and the maryland blue crab & <mark>Maryland Blue Crab & Carolina Shrimp 'Louis' Cocktail</mark>.   each were delicious and stood soundly with excellent flavor and texture. \n\nour group ordered all different cuts of beef, including the prime porthouse for 2, petit cut filet, and more.  for 7 people, we also ordered 4 side dishes - 2 <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> and 2 mac & cheese. \n\nthis is where things started to fail.  \n\nthe meals were served to the wrong diners, to start.  once the first plate was incorrectly set down, the rest of the team of servers failed.. including one server who set down my \"pork\" in front of me, which was not pork, but bone in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>.   what??  ugh.   from there, there was some swapping of plates and a quick discussion of what went where.  chaos. \n\nthe sides were then served to each diner.  i'm not certain about you, but i like more than a tablespoon of potatoes when i'm served a 20oz <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>.    that's all that was available, though, so we made do.  the potatoes tasted delicious, as did the mac & cheese, which was stringy and difficult for the waiter to serve. \n\nthe kitchen seems to have a problem cooking their meat to the correct temperature.  the petit filet my friend ordered medium, was rare in the middle. i know this is an easy thing to have happen to filet.. but this is cut.  a $52 piece of meat should be prepared correctly!   \n\nmy <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>? wow.. very sad.  i had to physically saw through the char on the steak to get a piece that was not hard and crusted over, and overseasoned.   i'm not a fan of charred meat to begin with but a light char on this piece would have been appropriate.   i was sad to have to leave hunks of  meat behind because they were too tough to even cut through, despite having paid $64. \n\nthe porterhouse for two, for the bride and groom, was cooked inconsistently as well, even though it was ordered medium... one side was rare and the other medium/medium-well.\n\nwith three diners only drinking water, one would think that the servers would be attentive to their glasses and watch for empty.  heck, we've seen better service at applebees when it comes to water.  my husband is a stickler for having a drink at all times, and the service here was an epic fail in that department.  it was so random, the servers would come by, fill up one water glass and neglect two others on the table.  i expected that they ran out of water, but no.. they just moved on to another table and poured more water for another patron.  what the heck?\n\nby the end of our meal, we'd lost a server completely (hadn't seen him in quite a while), and the other, more jovial one, was notified that we were disappointed that they couldn't keep glasses filled, and that the service was lacking.  \ni've eaten at numerous high end places in my day.. this is not one we'll be returning to, sadly.  i have found other steakhouses in vegas to be as comparably priced with excellent cuts of meat and far better service. \n\nwe were seated at our table at 6:30p.  we finally left around 9:30p.  while i'm glad they didn't rush us through, i can now see why they didn't have a reason to.", 
            "the hubby and i are thoroughly enjoying cut in the venetian/palazzo hotel. the service is excellent. the house <mark>Pink Lady & Fuji Apple Salad</mark> was superb. i had the 3 beef sampler with the japanese wagyu, american wagyu, and the regular aged beef. i enjoyed all three. the japanese wagyu was like butter, but the american wagyu was my fav. full of flavor and tenderness. a very nice blend of american beef with japanese wagyu.  i highly recommend you try this place.  also the mac and cheese was great (i'm not a mac and cheese kind of girl)!!!\n\n\n\nvery, very please\n-dr. a", 
            "first off, the service and atmosphere were great, but we go out to eat for the food, so i am going to explain my measly three stars by telling you about the items that we ordered and what was wrong and right with each of them. this is one of most expensive meals i have ever eaten, so if i am going to spend nearly $300 on dinner (w/o wine or other drinks) then it better blow me away. it fell woefully short of that. \n\n1. bread selection-2 out the 5 we were offered were tasty. the rest were bland. the cheese pastry puffs were great, but then they were ruined in a way by being too spicy for bread.\n\n2. drinks-i don't drink alcohol but the arnold palmer i ordered was way too sour. the second try was better, but was too sweet. i had to ask for more lemon and water it down to be enjoyable. \n\n3. salads/appetizers-i ordered the seafood salad with lobster, crab, and shrimp. the top portion was tasty (i don't know how you could go wrong with the holy trinity of shellfish), but on the bottom there was this weird pudding/custard type of stuff that was way too sweet and took up most of the volume of the dish. for a $31 appetizer/ salad i felt that i deserved more than a little bit of seafood on top of a white mystery substance. my wife ordered the <mark>Pink Lady & Fuji Apple Salad</mark>. it was good but dressed too lightly. all i could really taste were the tart pink lady apples. if i was to serve this salad i would have gone heavy on the almonds and cheese to balance out all of the tartness of the apples.\n\n4. main dishes-my wife ordered the dover sole. she can't tolerate garlic. there was quite a debate about the garlic (or lack thereof) in the sauce that goes over the fish between the wait staff and the kitchen. finally it was revealed that the sauce hasn't had garlic in it for a few months, so she got the sauce. her fish was deboned tableside, which was a nice touch, but meant that she had to eat her main before everyone else's meals came out so the fish wouldn't be cold. i had a bite and it was really tasty, but her complaint was that after eating her main, she was still a bit hungry as it was small. \ni ordered the nebraska <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> with a red wine reduction sauce. i would prefer my steak a bit warmer (i ordered medium) and with less spice rub. also, the red wine reduction was just sweet-no saltiness or richness of a pan sauce like i make at home. the mustards were great to have at the table, but why would these be necessary? mustard is usually used to cover up the taste of old meat! having salt along with the mustards was smart and i used it. my <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> was lacking salt, so once i added the salt it was tasty. definitly the most expensive steak i have ever ordered, but the not the best i have ever eaten, so yeah-a let down. also, the other two <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> at the table had lots of grisle and fat. mine was more lean and the fat rendered out more thoroughly.\n\n5. sides- we ordered quite a few. creamed spinach, my favorite side at a steakhouse was the most disappointing. the egg added to the spinach tableside ruined it for me. it tasted like a spinach and egg breakfast burrito. not good at all. whipped potatoes were very bland (lacking salt or butter). no one at the table liked them. brussel sprouts were very good, but had so much sweetness they were like candied vegetables. the best side dish by far were the roasted sweet potatoes with curry spice. very good, we ordered another one. the other side dishes were unmemorable. \n\n6. dessert-i would skip dessert and go somewhere else if i dined with them again. my wife's berry tart was tasty, but she couldn't finish it. way too tart and sweet. my banana cream pie was just ok. the bananas tasted a little under ripe and they were cold. the crust was not good. nothing special here folks. again, for the prices, you would expect to be at least pleasantly surprised, but no.", 
            "here again with my mom and wife for my birthday.  i need to say up front we love cut. it is one of our very favorite steakhouses period.\n\ntonight we were celebrating my birthday. as always they start with an amuse bouche which is simply delish. it is a bite sized cheese souffle. \n\nthe bread offerings at cut are wonderful. best of any of the restaurants we have been to anywhere. onion focaccia, pretzel roll, and pumpernickel as well as cheese encrusted super long and thin bread sticks. wow, so good.\n\nwe all had an appetizer. mine was a crab/lobster dish that was so good and the best of the lot. my wife had the <mark>Pink Lady & Fuji Apple Salad</mark> which she loved and mom had the beet dish.\n\nwe all had steak or course. i didn't see the steak sampler on the menu which gives you a 2.4 oz portion of 3 steaks to try, some aged domestic, a kobe domestic and a japanese kobe, so i asked the waiter and the chef went ahead and let me have it. all were amazing. there is a very distinct difference between the domestic and the kobes to be sure. the kobes are much marbled and the flavor is more subtle. between the domestic kobe and the japanese kobe the difference is there but not enough imo to justify the price difference. in the future i will probably go for the domestic kobe because it is in the sweet spot of price and flavor.\n\nmy wife had the domestic kobe <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> and my mother had a domestic aged strip. all were amazing!\n\nsides: we shared creamed spinach, brussel sprouts, sushito pepper dish. all wonderful.\n\nwine: we shared a bottle of pinot noir which was excellent.\n\ndesert: we shared 3, the banana cream pie dish, the chocolate souffle and lemon cheesecake which was amazing.\n\nthe service was 5+/5, food 5+/5 probably our best experience so far at cut! we can't wait to go back!"

            "i don't think everyone knows this place is open yet, not even the hotel employees- but it is, and its a cut above the rest! my bf and i had the pleasure of dining at wolfgang puck's newbie this last weekend.  it is a spin off of the beverly hills location, but a lot easier - at this point- to get a reservation. \n\nthe decor is very modern and sexy, lots of deep purples, black, silver and mirrors- with kind of a rock vibe as they played classic rock all night long. there was a lounge/bar in the opening room of the restaurant, followed by a large open dining room and a smaller space behind a half wall.  the service was superb, there were at least 7 people involved in taking care of our table- server, sommelier, gm, host... the list goes on. everyone was extremely helpful and you could feel their excitement and anticipation of being apart of a new restaurant. \n\nwithin the first few minutes of sitting down we were brought a selection of breads, homemade and purchased from la brea bakery- my favorite was the pretzel!  we ordered a bottle of spanish red artuzu, which i had never had before, but was surprisingly tasty and affordable. their wine list was many pages long, for those of you lucky folks who have hit it big and can spend your dough. soon after, the cuts of meat that were featured for the day were brought to our table for viewing; i never thought big hunks of blood could look so beautiful, but they did.  the menu highlights particular selections from 4 sources, so that one can choose based on palette preference and budget.  the usda prime was the least expensive, followed by usda prime aged 35 days, american kobe and 100% japanese wagu.  we chose the usda prime 34 oz. porterhouse for 2 and were not disappointed. although my curiosity is killing me about the $80 6 oz. filet : )\n\nas we waited for our steak and potatoes....we wined, sampled the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> appetizer and were given a hot gruyere roll- yumm!  when the entree arrived the steak was cut table side for us. it smelled amazing and was top with fresh thyme for an added effect.  the portion was larger than we expected and divinely cooked- a little pink with no char outside as i had requested. we ate it all!! unfortunately, that left no room for dessert, so i cannot comment on that. but i was so satisfied it didn't matter.  \n\nthings are great now, and i would go back to cut, but can only imagine that things will get better as the staff, kitchen and hotel gets more practice.", 
            "seriously too bad that bf and i both felt nauseous at dinner but the things we did taste were delish!  every freakin person here is so darn nice and friendly - and considering how trendy this place is i was kind of expecting snooty service.  the food was really good - <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, oxtail bouillon, bone-in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>, cream of <mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark> and the handcut fries.  the oxtail bouilon was the standout dish for me...there were bits of <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> floating around!  and the bar menu looks tasty too, hopefully i win lots of money in vegas next time and can give this place another go!", 
            "the best meal i've had in vegas!!! which says a lot, considering the plethora of incredible dining in vegas. it was also the priciest, which was no surprise. dinner for 2 with a $50 bottle of wine came to $360 with tax and tip. \n\nappetizers: kobe sashimi and <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>. i've had <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> a few times by this point, and this one was the best i've had! so smooth, not chewy. kobe sashimi was awesome, so tasty. \n\nbread: so freaking good as everyone has said. the rolls came \"cold\", but that didn't deter from their softness and tastiness.\n\nsteak: we got the sampler and split it. this was such a great steak experience because i've always wanted to try kobe steaks side by side with a regular usda prime to see if there was truly a difference. as many have said, american kobe is the way to go if you have to pick just one steak. it is perfectly marbeled, but not so rich you'd get sick off of it. the japanese was out of control rich. it truly is the piece of meat that would come from steak and foie gras making a baby. \n\nsides: thin, perfectly cut <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark> and some corn. both were delicious but completely unnecessary when we had the yummiest steaks of our lives on the plate. \n\ndessert: the banana dessert with awesome homemade banana icecream. \n\nservice was impeccable. best service i've had in vegas. they weren't rude about us splitting an entree (*cough* t'bones *cough*) and everytime our glass of tap water got even half empty it was filled. they were polite, unobtrusive and friendly. can't say enough.\n\natmosphere was cool/swanky.. but isn't everywhere in vegas nowadays?\n\noverall, this is a must dine place if you are a steak fan! splurge on the american kobe.. it is worth the upgrade from the normal usda.", 
            "bottom line:  this restaurant is all show.  we went in on a saturday night labor day weekend w/o reservations and ordered sirloin and <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> with <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> and heirloom tomatoes as starters.  waiter brings a huge plate of raw meat stacked on top of each other and begins explaining which one is which; this is a cool show but that's about it.  steaks were a bit overdone probably because the surface of the steak was real hard to begin with; i'm sure their meats were good, but just their cooking methods are questionable.  pluses: oregon pinot was excellent, <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> was better than the steak, heirloom tomatoes were great as well.  this is the 1st time that the starters were better than the entrees.  alexander's and pinot brassiere are better imo.", 
            "was lucky enough to freeload a meal off one of my old attorney buddies.  he was staying at palazzo, wanted steak - no brainer - cut\n\npleased to see that palazzo was busy last night - must be some sort of convention in town.  \n\nthey definitely push the breads - started with a parmesan stick, then they bring a sharp cheddar biscuit/puff then later pre-steak, they bring over a bread basket with the bread guy recommending the pretzel roll.  the puff and the pretzel roll are excellent !\n\nenjoyed a rosemary collins cocktail - very refreshing !\n\nordered the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> w/ maple sauce ( $17 )  nebraska corn-fed rib-eye ( $58 )  and we shared the cream spinach and the fingerling/bacon/pearl onion ( i believe $14 each ) \n\nthe <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> was saturated with sauce - it actually tasted a little like saurbraten sauce - too much of it !\n\nthe steak - asked for medium rare - i gotta rare !!  the spinach - too runny, the fingerling potatoes - very tasty !\n\noverall, decent, but i had higher expectations.", 
            "i had dinner at cut last thursday (3/19/09) and was fully satisfied with my meal and more.  decor wise, it has a modern feel with metaillic colors everywhere.  we were nicely greated by the hostess and waiters the entire night.  \n\nfor appetizers, my party of 6 had two orders of <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> and asparagus.  the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> was nice and crispy on the outside and buttery fat on the inside.  well done.  the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> was creamy and delicious and worth trying if you haven't done so already.\n\nfor entrees, we all had different steaks but i'm going to save you some time and say that they're all pretty ridiculously good.  i've eaten at peter luger's in brooklyn several times so its hard to top their steaks but the steaks at cut are pretty close.  \n\noverall - you're going to pay an arm and leg for your meal but my meal was worth every penny.", 
            "when cut first opened in vegas, i was dying to go, what with all the hype behind the beverly hills location.  so, for my fifth wedding anniversary, i took the plunge.  \n\n5 stars for service - we had early (5:30pm...babysitter scheduling) reservations, but we arrived about 20 minutes late.  no problem.  after checking in with the hostess, we were seated immediately.  not even a 10 seconds went by, then our waiter introduced himself.  throughout the night, we were constantly checked on and our water glasses were never empty (we had tap, not bottled).  we ate fast (total meal clocked in at about 2 hours), but at no time were we ever rushed or felt rushed.  the pacing of the dishes matched our eating and they gave ample time between courses to digest.  great front-back of house communication!\n\n4 stars for food - as an amuse bouche, they sent out these cheddar cheese puffs.  no, they're not like cheetos, but they tasted like red lobster chef muffins.  wonderful.  too bad those weren't on the bread tray!  my wife ordered the fava bean and artichoke salad to start, which was surprisingly unappealing.  i'm not a bean fan, so i'm probably just biased.  my wife wished she had ordered something else.  i had the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>.  that was the most incredible appetizer i have eaten in the past year.  the texture was a bit tough on one side (let's call it \"crispy\"), but that took nothing away from the aromas and flavors.  i could have had that as my meal.  the breads and parmesan sticks were good, but nothing extraordinary.  we both had 16 ounce nebraska <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> booked med-rare.  it was juicy and flavorful, but there was a slight bit too much pepper (which counteracted the wine) and the char was slightly thick.  all in all, a good steak, but nothing phenomenal (stripsteak and smith & wollensky do it for me).  for desert, we ordered a strawberry shortcake (the shortcake looked like a biscuit but was surprisingly light and fluffy)  and chocolate souffle (it looked like it would overly sweet and rich, but was a perfect balance).  both were decadent, but not otherworldly (lutece is still the benchmark).  \n\n5 stars for wine service - while the wine list wasn't value oriented (why should it be when a steak runs $60?), there were some interesting buys.  being that my wife doesn't drink, i was looking for order off the by the glass list.  well, they really didn't have anything good and i wasn't about to pay $20 for a glass of something that i can buy at the grocery store for $15,  so i looked at half-bottles.  the pickings were slim there, too.  i ended up buying a full bottle of 1998 leeuwin art series cabernet sauvignon for $85.  not cheap, but a bargain compared to the half bottle of 2005 ramey cabernet for $80.  even thought i ordered a relatively cheap wine, they treated it and me with respect and decanted it well.  \n\nall in all, it was a good meal made great by fantastic service.", 
            "this place serves meat that's more tasty and tender than a grilled newborn. \n\ni went with a friend of mine and we gorged out. we started with the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> ($19). that was served with a little bit of greens, absolutely delicious. we also got the <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> appetizer ($22); it was served with wasabi aioli, avocado, ginger, wonton strips. delicious, high quality. paired the appetizers with a good macallan 18 ($25) and we were in heaven.\n\nfor my main course, i got the 10 oz american wagyu/kobe beef <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> ($80). it was cooked a perfect medium rare, served with a side of <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> ($12) and cauliflower ($12).  paired that with the cut trace manhattan (buffalo trace whiskey, standard manhattan, $14) and i was in heaven.\n\ndessert looked like too much, i couldn't do it. dinner came out to around $275 for the two of us with our 25% off as locals. delicious meal, a+, high on my list, would go again in a heartbeat.", 
            "for my 30th birthday we decided to go to las vegas and wanted to eat at one of the strip's top restaurants.  after reading various reviews, we decided on cut.  i would have to say that the decor and the food lived up to all the hype.  the decor is elegant, yet hip and the swivel chairs and mirrors everywhere give it a real fun vibe.\n\nwe started with the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> and louis shrimp and <mark>Maryland Blue Crab & Carolina Shrimp 'Louis' Cocktail</mark>.  they were both light and delicate with intense flavors.  i then had the 10 oz american waygu (kobe) strip steak and my wife had the 21 day aged filet.  the meat lived up to all of our expectations.  we both had trouble finishing after eating the starters but could not waste the delicious meat.  i would have to recommend splurging for the waygu steaks or even the japanese kobe.  at $80 a steak, the waygu is definitely worth a little more after trying both.  don't get me wrong the filet was great, but hard to compare after eating the strip.\n\nthe reason i can't give it a 5 is because we somehow managed to get the server that must have just got promoted from the \"b\" team.  we could tell the server to our right was top notch but our guy just lacked in so many ways.  he started off by taking our drink order and seriously not bringing it back for ten minutes (place was not slammed).  the table next to us was sat after us and had drinks and bread at least 5 minutes before us.  the sommelier  ended up having to go to the bar to get them for us.  it doesn't seem to hard to pour mccallan 15 yr in a glass but i digress.   then our guy left the meat stand they put next to the table to show the different cut's off at our table for 15 minutes until i had to ask someone to get it out of there.  we asked for recommendations and they were lame.  this website did a better job.  my wife asked what temp he recc'd her filet be cooked at and he said \"med\".  where are we?  and then he recommended <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> with these fine pieces of meat.  \n\nfor the price of the bill, this guy should have been much, much better.  the food was amazing and we had a great night, but i will probably try a few other steakhouses in lv before i venture back.", 
            "this was my second dinner at cut, and the thought of going back gave me a gigantic mental erection.\n\nwent this time with two friends. i started with the trace manhattan cocktail, they had a beer and some kind of delicious pumpkin martini. for apps, we went with the <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark>, the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, and the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan. superb!\n\ni once again went with the 10 oz american wagyu/kobe <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark>, medium rare. got a side of <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> and japanese shishito peppers, alongside the brussel sprouts. \n\nyou can read my other review for more detail on the dishes; it was another incredibly delicious meal and i can't wait to go back. it is pricy, though, so make sure you're okay with spending big bucks on a great dinner. worth every penny, but be warned.", 
            "many restaurants tout fusion sensibilities, but puck's concept truly blends influences from his native austria, france, japan, america and elsewhere. almost painfully serious about beef, servers here bring out a platter of raw kobe and wagyu cuts before you order, to show the differences in the meat. \n\nyour taste buds may not be as sensitive as your eyes, though: we actually preferred the 21 day wet-aged illinois prime bone-in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> to the american wagyu/angus <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark>. cut's ample offerings also include several 35 day dry aged nebraska prime as well as true japanese waygu (kobe) choices (all are grilled over hard wood & charcoal then finished under the broiler). \n\nin fact, cut's menu seems overly eager to please (or overwhelm) with an excess of options in starters (12 the night we visited), side dishes (13), desserts (7) and even sauces (8), though many were excellent, including the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> \"sandwiches\" with wasabi aoli and bar menu's knishes and kobe sliders; and <mark>Wasabi-Yuzu Kosho Butter</mark> and <mark>Cognac & Whole Grain Mustard</mark> were both remarkable. but the creamed spinach topped with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> was almost too rich and the potato tart tatin was mostly just big and bland. the deconstructed nectarine and plum crumble, served with a house-made \"50 bean\" vanilla ice cream was nice, but far too big a portion to end such a meal.\n \na nice selection of original and classic cocktails, but their wine list is a bit pretentious and overpriced ($15 for a glass of argentinian malbec? really? i'd pay that much for a magnum of it in the store)\n\nin short, cut has one of my favorite lounges on the strip (sexy, sleek, just dark enough, fitting for either romance or business rendevous), some fantastic appetizers, and a great cocktail menu. cut has one of my least favorite dining rooms on the strip (like an 80s office, stiff and steely), and good meat--but not quite as good as their orgiastic presentation lends you to expect. i didn't dislike it, but was not wowed as much as i have been at craftsteak, carnevino, and even boa, all in the same price range. \n\np.s. at these prices, you can afford to make the sauces complimentary.", 
            "not as good as my previous visit, but still good.\n\ncame here with three buddies this past saturday and we ended up getting seats in the lounge area.  while i prefer the dining room, there wasn't much choice in the matter, since they were booked solid until 10pm.  the lounge was nice, but the seats could use a lot of improvement.  my back and legs ached before we even received our entrees.  even a couple cocktails didn't numb the discomfort.\n\ncomfort aside, the food and service were on the mark.  we ordered five appetizers:\n\n1.  fava bean salad - my wife didn't like it when she went last time, but this time one of my buddies actually enjoyed it.  go figure.  but seriously, why pay $15 for a bean salad?!?\n2.  big eye carpaccio - not bad, but it felt like such a waste of good tuna to be fixed up.  i would have preferred it sashimi style, but that's just me.  \n3.  <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> - just as yummy as it was the last time.  and i again wish i had just ordered 4 of these for my entree.  i would compare this to sweet, salty baconny goodness.  \n4.  kobe sashimi - everyone on the table loved this we did two orders.  call me a purist, but i really would have liked less...flavor.  like the big eye, there were just too many flavors going on around such a great central ingredient.  the sauce muted the beefy goodness.  on the plus side, this was butter tender and really tasty.  \n\nwe each had different cuts of meat, and everyone was happy with what they had.  if i remember correctly, my friends ordered a filet, <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> strip and illinois <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>.  i had the nebraska <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>.  all steaks were ordered medium rare and all were perfectly cooked.  my buddy who had the illinois (bone in) <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> and i swapped pieces and we both agreed the nebraska was far and away superior in flavor and tenderness.  \n\nfor sides, we only had the creamed spinach and pureed potatoes.  the egg on the spinach could have been cut up better because the pieces were pretty huge (picking nits on that one, eh).  the potatoes were really nothing special and were seriously lacking in flavor; maybe they just need to add some bacon to that thing.\n\ni did order a bottle of kaesler avignon syrah, which went waaaaay to fast.  it felt like our server just wanted to empty the bottle out as quickly as possible.  maybe i'm just a pretentious wine snob, but i like to let the wine in my glass open up before pouring more.  is that too much to ask?  despite this perceived flaw in service, everyone was attentive, friendly and quick (maybe too quick?).  \n\nactually, looking back on my previous review, i should have given cut 5 stars for that visit because this time round it was a step down.", 
            "this seems to be one wolfgang restaurant that isn't suffering from the celebrity chef syndrome. you know... that ailment that seems to affect many restaurants on the strip. the one where a celebrity chef opens an outpost in sin city only to neglect it and have the quality of the product suffer as a result. as an example see spago and postrio or other celeb restaurants like mesa grill. cut bucks the trend successfully by offering some amazing steaks and fabulous accompaniments.\n\nwhile i didn't think the cheese ball amuse bouche was anything special, the bread selection was very good. particularly good were the pretzel bread and focaccia. the fresh burrata (with prosciutto, raisin-rhubarb compote, and arugula) wasn't something that was very memorable. the cold, stringy consistency of the cheese wasn't appetizing and the subtle flavor made the dish forgettable. the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, however, was an unbelievable mix of sweet and savory flavors. it could have benefitted from a little more pork fat to add to the texture and taste, but overall it was one of the best pork dishes i've had in a while.\n\nfor our entrees we had an 8 oz. petit cut filet and the 16 oz nebraska corn fed <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>. we ordered some <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> with the filet and got a side of fingerling potatoes to share. we ordered both medium rare but the filet came out closer to medium. they were both beautifully charred, providing a flavorful crust to the steaks while keeping the centers juicy and tender. \n\nservice was solid, although our waiter did disappear for a few stretches. however, the guy refilling our water was always around. it seemed like after every sip of water he was there to fill it back up to the top.\n\nthe decor is hip, trendy, and modern. quite a contrast to most other steak houses in las vegas. the music was more safe and mainstream, as they played a lot of u2, the beatles, rolling stones, and cold play.\n\nthey give locals a 20% discount off of food, so if you are nevada resident make sure you ask about it when you order.\n\n4.5 stars", 
            "this place is what happens when god makes a steak house!!!  seriously, it's restaurants like these that keep me from turning vegetarian.  i went here as part of my boys bachelor party.  let me start with the dinning environment:  very clean with a slight industrial feel.  the swivel chairs were a very nice change from the clunky wooden chairs you see in most places.  it also helps to get my fat ass in and out of the table a lot easier.  trust me.... after this meal.. you kinda wanna roll back to your room for a cigarette.\n\nappetizers:  <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan, kobe sashimi, and <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>. \n all on point~!!!  the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan was so rich and buttery.  it literally makes your eyes roll back as you take a bite of it off the small crestini.  the kobe sashimi was fresh and light.  the beef was velvety dressed with only a little olive oil and capers.  this is a must try.  and then came the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>.  sweet.... savory... rich... flavorful.... wow....\n\nsides:  creamed spinach and roasted potatoes.   \nlet me preface by saying... i am not a fan of creamed spinach in any variation.  so to me, this dish was bound for failure.  the spinach was topped with a <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> that was mixed in table-side and served to us.  the rest of my table loved it.  i was not a big fan.  no slight to the chef... just personal preference.  it was good, but not my cup of tea.  the potatoes however were great!  roasted simply with some onions and garlic.  sometimes good technique and simplicity just win out.  and this side was a prime example of that.\n\nmain: american wagyu <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> steak\nif you go to a restaurant like this, you dont order the chicken.  you shell out the money and get the best that they offer.  the american wagyu choices were organic beef from idaho, i believe.  the moment my knife touched the soft medium rare beef, i was sure that my knife and fork were the luckiest utensils in the world.  they were the first to make love to that meat.  i have never in my life tasted beef of this magnitude.  the flavor was so unique and undoubtedly unforgettable.  the beef melted in my mouth as i could not believe something that was only rubbed in salt and pepper, had this much flavor.  like i said before, if you come here.  go for the american wagyu.  pricey?  yes.  absolutely worth it?  hell f***ing yes~!!!\n\nwine:  malbec.\nran the decision by the sommelier and she said that was a great choice.  great wine with the meal.  soft flavors, smooth finish, not too much bite.  the wine was a hit with the table.  but at this point.... everything was a hit from this place.  \n\ncongrats alex!  hope you enjoyed your last meal~!!!", 
            "let me start by saying cut is not for the money conscious and expect to spend a pretty penny here (the bill pre-tip for my friend and i was $312).  but you know what they say, you get what you pay for and i had an amazing food experience here.\n\nstarters:\n*complimentary bread - there 4 types of breads, 2 which are made in house.  the 2 breads made in house and is delicious is an onion bread and a pretzel bread.  however, the pretzel bread is a must try!\n*<mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan - mmmm!!  at first i was a bit sketchy about how it sounded when our waitress explained it but i'm so glad we ordered it!  the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> is scooped out and mixed with various ingredients to have the consistency of flan and placed back inside the bone, served with parsley, onions, and capers with a side of mushroom marmalade.  a must order!!\n*<mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> - yum!  the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> had a slight crisp on the outside while still remaining tender and moist in the inside.   bartlett pear compote is place on top of the four pieces that created fantastic taste that wasn't overwhelmingly sweet.\n\nentr\\u00c9e:\na tasting of ny sirloin ($145 plus additional $40 for 2oz. of australian wagyu) - in my defense for ordering a dish at this price, my friend and i shared it.\nnote: they can split your order on two plates for $6 or they can just give you an extra plate for you to split it yourself at no charge.\n*australian wagyu (2oz) - delicious!  i'm not a meat type of person, but i was absolutely blown away by the meat just melts in your mouth!  this was by far, the best of the three tastings.\n*nebraskan usda prime (4oz) - yum!  this was my second favorite tasting of the three.  although the steak didn't melt in my mouth like the australian did, the nebraskan was still juicy and flavorful.\n*american wagyu - good, but my least favorite.  the marbling of the meat wasn't great as the other two pieces of steak.\n \nsides:\n*<mark>Bone Marrow</mark> (add to the cuts) - gooood!  the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> is already scooped out for you so you don't have to do any of the work!\n*creamed spinach with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> - yum!!  the <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> comes on top of the creamed spinach where they then mix it together upon bringing it to your table and adds an additional yummy flavor to the dish.\n\ndessert:\n*strawberry shortcake - mmmm, dessert!!  the strawberry shortcake was delicious!  a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream and strawberry sorbet is placed in between two pieces of shortbread and on top of a warm strawberry mixture.  of course you can't forget about the whipped cream on the top.  simply delicious!\n\nservice:\nphenomenal!!!  sometimes you can expect rather stuck up waiters/waitresses at finer restaurants, but not here.  the staff was extremely friendly, attentive, and even had brief conversations with us.  they all made this dining experience a truly great one!", 
            "we went here for our 2nd anniversary dinner and the service and food were impeccable!  every detail down to the parmesan breadsticks were delectable and every need was catered to without us even asking.  the bill was hefty because we decided to go all out and ordered drinks (a perfect pinot recommendation from our server as well as their famous pear-tini for me), appetizer (melt-in-your-mouth <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>), entree (i had the <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> sampler and my husband enjoyed the austrailian wagyu rib-eye) and we also ordered sides (<mark>Caramelized Onions</mark>, <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>, creamed spinach and fingerling potatoes), and of course dessert (strawberry shortcake).  we were happily surprised by a rich chocolate dessert, compliments of our chef for our special occasion (also got a discount because it was a celebration).  overall, our experience was amazing and can't wait to come back!",

            "visited this wolfgang puck restaurant in january of 2010. three of us in the party. made reservations a week before on opentable.com. we were on time and greated by the hostess when we walked in. restaurant and lounge was full. it was ces week so vegas is usually jammed that week. the hostess originally tried to seat us in the lounge. i was like \"nah\". moved promptly to a nice table in the back of the dining room near the private dining room (which was full with employees from one of the companies at ces). kind of off to the side it was nice and quiet so i could talk to my parents. the table was off balance and every time we tapped it, it would tilt. one of the servers fixed that quick with a folded cocktail napkin right after i pointed it out. good. \n\nfinally unto the meal. my parents do not drink so i rarely do when dining with them. no problems. a round of diet cokes for all. typical bar soda in a high end restaurant. there were a few different servers. everyone works together. the main server brought out a tray to show of the differences in the marbling meat. from kobe beef to wagyu and the dry aged. \n\nsome breadsticks on the table were ok. the bread is awesome. pretzel bread with the different mustard's they put on the table are excellent. they served 4 other types of bread too. all fresh and flavorful. my dad loves his bread. so we had the bread guy come back and fill our plates 3 times throughout the meal. for an app we all split the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>. very tender and cooked well. enough for two not for three. \n\nthen for the steak action. i know my steaks. my first job, a week after i turned 16, was in an old school meat market. all through high school and college i worked in numerous meat departments of retail establishments. so with that said i obviously had to get the <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark> tasting. three portions, three types of cow. at the time, cut had legit a9 kobe beef from japan on the menu. they gave you 2oz. awesome! melt in your mouth. crazy flavor i have never tasted before in beef. 2nd portion was 4oz of american wagyu beef. totally different. a little more beef flavor. the last, was the 4oz portion of dry aged prime corn fed sirloin. again different in flavor and texture. most beef like and recognizable.  still a mighty fine steak. seasoned well with some s&p (salt and pepper). that's all you need for a high end steak like these. i ordered these medium. cooked fine. finished hot. some different <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> were served along side. i tried them each but the steaks did not need them.\n\nmom got a 21 day aged 8oz filet. def looked bigger. she likes it \"mooing\". she did not finish it so i took control of the situation. dad got a strip steak. not sure on the size or aging. \n\nin a nice steakhouse sides are a la carte. no prob. served family style works. we got <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>, creamed spinach with an egg on top ( which was broken and mixed in upon serving), and the <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>. everything was served at once, with multiple servers all explaining everything from the types of steaks we ordered, the sauces, and the sides. they served the sides on our plates and we enjoyed. it was steakhouse overload for me. i freaked out and sent all the staff away from me. \n\nwe were all stuffed from all the food. we did not have dessert. next time. thanks to my dad for picking up the tab, as he always does.",

            "cut is a top notch steak house, with a nice variety on the menu.  compared to many other high-end steak spots in town, it's good, but not the best.  while my group really enjoyed the meal, there were many misses on service and execution.  \n\nfirst the bad:\n\nwhile we were there with a large group on a friday night, drinks took 15-20 minutes to come out each time.   this was discouraging, since most of the time one likes to enjoy the symphony of flavors found in pairing food w/ wine rather than sipping after the meal.  the side dishes are tiny and expensive ($12) even by upscale steakhouse standards.  we ordered as the waitress suggested, and found that we ordered too little.  many of our steaks were not cooked to our requests.  i had the 9 oz. american wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> ($88), and ordered it medium-rare.  it came out medium.  when i brought it to the server's attention, she paid it no mind.  \"it's still quite good medium,\" she responded.  for a place that specializes <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark>, any imperfection in it's preparation is a huge concern.\n\nnow the good:\nthe <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan appetizer was magnificent.  unctuous, rich, beefy, orgasm of flavor.  i've never had <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> executed so well; it was the most loved item of the night, judging from our table's \"mmm's\" and \"damn that's goods.\"  \n\nthe <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> was also incredible.  rich, smokey, bacony goodness; i could have eaten another order, but didn't want to spoil dinner.\n\nthe manhattan (while it takes a while) was perfect.  the whiskey-cured cherry at the bottom of the glass just teases you with flavor, it is the best manhattan i've ever had.  \n\ndecor:  lot's of textures, generally straight lines fused together to create a stylish yet welcoming setting.  it is well-lit, and bright, which isn't something many steakhouses can say.  i like to see my food in all it's vibrant color, and the ambience at cut allows for that special situation.\n\ncut is a special place, but when compared to similar estabilshments, it doesn't shine as bright as one would hope.", 
            "this should be the blueprint for all new steakhouses\n  ambiance is perfect for las vegas, very modern and comfortable. we were seated in an extra large booth fit for 4 guests, but there was only two of us. felt great not to be packed in like sardines.\n they bring out actual raw beef for your inspection. it was interesting to see the differences in the marbling. i was so anamored with the differences of the meat upon presentaion, that  i had to order the ny strip sampler and try them all. this included a 4oz portion of 35day aged nebraskan corn fed, 4oz american waygu from idaho & 2oz of australian waygu. i was very happy with my choice. imo the american waygu from idaho was the best. all three pieces were cooked perfectly and seasoned very well.\n also had the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> app which was fantastic. added <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> to my steak which was a little salty but deliciously and rich. we shared mac n cheese and creamed spinach, both were very tasty as well.\n obviously this place is not cheap, but you get what you pay for and this place is the best steakhouse in vegas.", 
            "this is not for everyday. my group decided to treat ourselves and were not disappointed. as mentioned, the waiter brings out the raw meat and explains the cuts and selections. i ordered the american wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> ($88 for 9 oz.) it was like butter! i've never experience steak like this. my friends had the illinois filet and nebraska strip and were equally happy. the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> was incredible. i couldn't convince them to get the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan so we had the crab and shrimp louis. it was ok but i wouldn't recommend it.\n\nfor sides, the fingerling potatoes were very good and the mac and cheese is worth the $21. two sides was enough for three people. for dessert i had the chocolate souffle. it was outstanding. the raspberry filled doughnuts were excellent as well. i sampled the black forest cake but wasn't too impressed.\n\nthis place is for special occasions and i'm glad we tried it. oh, and get the pretzel bread when they bring it around.", 
            "came here last february.  no reservation, just walked in on a saturday night.  of course no tables available, but we were lucky as there was a love seat table in the bar area that was open.  so my date and i were seated there.  we ordered very simply... no wine, no alcohol, just an appetizer of <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, a side of mushroom/peppers, and a bone-in, 39-ounce american wagyu rib-eye for 2.  <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> was good, mushroom/peppers were beyond excellent!.  the rib-eye was utterly fantastic!  we got it medium rare and it's a lot of meat, but it's like butter.. just melts in your mouth...  the only downside of getting it medium rare for that much meat is that it's so much meat you gotta eat it quick or else the middle pieces get a bit cold.  perhaps eat the middle pieces first and eat the outside pieces last.  anyway, it was an awesome relaxing dinner... we were right by the entrance so we could enjoy ourselves, have good conversation, enjoy the food, people watch, be the envy of all the carnivores walking by... etc.  service was great... they gave us some free chocolate snacks at the end.  it was expensive, but because we didn't order any alcohol, it was only $280 total.  best date ever!", 
            "first day in vegas and we marched to dinner  completely tipsy.  my friend and i walked our drunk asses in stilletos  from paris and all the way to palazzo. its still a blur how we managed that journey but dinner itself was unforgettable.\n\ni booked a 6:30pm reservation that morning and was seated promptly when we arrived. suzie and i both sat in our cozy booth and selected 3 appetizers, a steak and a dessert. \n\nfood:\n<mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan, mushroom marmalade, parsley sala: our favorite! delicious, creamy and full of flavor. absolutely divine!\n\n<mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, asian spices, sesame-orange dressing, dancing demon plum compote: mmmm mmmm finger licking good! it was delicious and the meat was mouth watering and moist.\n\n<mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark>, wasabi aioli, ginger, togarashi crisps, tosa soy: delish!  it was refreshing, lightly crispy and a great balance to our other two, heavier appetizers. i love wasabi aioli!\n\nu.s.d.a. prime, illinois corn fed, aged 21 days\n<mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark> 20 oz* - one of the best steaks i had and it wasnt even wagyu. as usual i love my steaks rare and it was perfectly, juicy and like butter when it hit the knife. i'm still dreaming about it right now. \n\nraspberry stuffed doughnuts, dark chocolate sabayon, raspberry stracciatella- nothing special. wish i ordered something else. it was a bit plain for my taste and i'm a sucker for donuts.\n\nservice: \nwe had excellent customer service and our waiter was professional, personable and an overall very chill guy. none of that prententious bs. \n\n \nin conclusion, everything but the dessert we selected was delicious. i will definitely make an effort to come here every time i visit vegas. im coming back for the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> and steak!", 
            "disclaimer:  our reservation was coordinated through a mutual friend and gm of the source, a wolfgang puck restaurant in dc.\n\nwhen we were in vegas a month ago for the cigar convention, we had heard from a ton of people that we had to try cut.  we got a reservation and decided to hit the bar beforehand.  the bartender was incredibly polite and had a real good time talking to him.  we tried some new shots and had some excellent manhattans.\n\nthe gm/host let us know our table was ready.  after being sat, and introductions, they showed us their wine list, which is on an ipad.  it was very easy to pick the bordeaux that we wanted (2005 chateau gracia).  while we waited for that, we put in an order of appetizers (maryland blue crab and jumbo shrimp crab cake and also <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>).  both were excellent, but i could have eaten that crab cake all day long.\n\nour wine was brought out exactly as it should have been.  presented to the person who ordered it and then poured to the others from there. myself and a friend ordered the 28 day <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, and our other friend ordered the wagyu. for sides we had the squash dish and i think potato something.\n\ncrumbs from bread never lasted long.  someone was always there refilling glasses or cleaning the table.  we knew a lot of people that week and many stopped by.  the staff took notice and never attempted to interfere or rush us to the next part of our meal.  a good friend from a neighboring table decided to buy us a bottle of wine, and once again the ipad menu came out.  the wine can be pricey, so i simply opted to choose a region and allow them to choose the wine.  the waitress was accommodating and polite throughout the process informing the gentlemen we had chosen a bordeaux.  the bottle we received was a 1999 chateau leoville barton which went excellent with out meal.\n\nneedless to say, between the manhattans and the wine, we were all feeling a little good at this point and perhaps even a bit loud for the restaurant.  that being said, we were never asked to be quiet or leave.   later two desserts were brought to our table that we did not order, we're still unsure if these were from the chef or from our friend who we had been at the bar with and had since returned.\n\ni have never had such a beautiful meal or wonderful service.  the gentlemen who took care of us most this night was pasquale, when i return i will definitely request him.", 
            "i'd give a 3.5 stars...and since i had a great weekend overall, i'll round up :)\n\npros:\n-service was excellent.  i  went with a group of 14 and it was so neat to see the coordinated plating of the steaks.  the waiters would all come out at once, look at each other, then bam. steak is served. water glass was always full and the waiters were very knowledgeable of the menu.\n-their pretzel roll is sooo fricken good. i had 3. it was like a pretzel..but in a roll. :p soft and chewy.\n-<mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> is soooo melt-in-your-mouth yummy!  it's drenched in duck fat and had this really awesome plum compote...perfect!\n-<mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan with the mushroom (i forget if it is mushroom confit) soo tasty! :)\n-wine menu on the ipad---fancy schmancy!\n\nroom for improvement:\n\ni had the <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> nebraska cornfed for 28 days...to be honest the steak wasn't as \"wow\" as i had expected.  their appetizers and sides were amazing though. i was expecting it to be more tender and melt in your mouth.  also expecting the seasoning to bring out the taste of the steakmore.\n\noverall...not the best steak i've had but overall good dinner experience.", 
            "we came here to celebrate my 30th birthday during our vegas trip.\n\nthe place really is beautiful and the service is impeccable, although our main server was a bit stuffy.  the pretzel roll was amazing and we asked for more of those.  husby and i shared the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, which was succulent and porky.  the maple gave it a bit of sweetness to cut the fattiness.\n\ni also ordered the 9 oz wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> with <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> and creamed spinach.  it was very rich and had an incredibly smooth texture.  the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> probably was a bit too much for the wagyu, to be honest.  the <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark> were thin and crispy, while the spinach was decent.  i tried husby's bone-in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> but it was not cooked medium-rare and it was a bit tough.  i would have expected a much better cut of meat for the price.  the wine was also marked up way too much and i didn't receive the wine i ordered.  however, the wine i did try was not impressive.\n\nfor my birthday, i received a free half baked alaska dessert and thought it was terrible.  i cannot imagine that particular dish is famous because it tasted very bland.\n\noverall, i'm not sure it was worth the price but it was a lovely experience.",

            "one of the best dining experiences i have ever had - ridiculous service, ridiculous food, best steaks you can find anywhere (lots of wagyu selections).  expect to have a very memorable dinner, but also expect to spend $400+ for 2 people.  highly recommend the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> appetizer and the wagyu usa raised <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>.", 
            "one of my most memorable meals in recent  memory. the strip is littered with a bunch of restaurants, respectively owned by their own celebrity chef. with so many great dining choices, how does one go about choosing a place to satiate their appetite as well as tantalize their tastebuds??? being that i was in vegas for my bachelor party, i didn't find this dilemma too challenging. i figured...i'm with the guys so let's do steak and martinis. with my objective in mind...i set out to find a steakhouse worthy of our patronage. after considering such places as craftsteak, n9ne, and delmonicos...cut was the restaurant that won me over. such decadent offerings as the braised <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> and <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan is what ultimately lured me here. \n\nwe missed our 7pm reservation because we missed our flight out of sfo. we arrived in vegas a little past 7 and considering it was a thursday, i figured that it might be slow enough for them to squeeze us in on a later reservation. so i call the restaurant and they are able to accommodate us with a 9:30 reservation. my first impression was \"awesome!,\" because i was so looking forward to eating here and would have been been a major let down if i wasn't able to. given that this place closes at 10:00, i was worried that we would be rushed through our meal and quickly ushered out of the resturant, and that the whole experience would be ruined because of it. much to my pleasant suprise, it was quite the contrary.\n\nservice was stellar from beginning to end. what we had to eat...\n\nappetizers: \nbraised <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> - this was delicious and wonderfully fatty without being overwhelming\n\nentree:\n14oz aged <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> with <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> topping - one of the best steaks i've ever had. seared perfectly on the outside with a light char and a juicy pink medium center. there is a generous amount of <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> and it is rich, fatty, and flavorful. each bite of my steak would be accompanied by a piece of marrow. i found this delectable and euphoric at first, but after awhile it did get a little too rich for me. i still loved it however, and highly recommend it.\n\ncut was my first experience in vegas of fine dining and with the number of high class restaurants, each with their own prospective celebrity chefs, my expectations were high and i'm glad that cut did not disappoint. food, ambience, and service were all meshed seamlessly. \n\ni'll be back most definitely.", 
            "i've been meaning to try this place and finally did last week.\n\nwe were actually trying to go to other places last minute with no reservation but that was a no-go so we end up coming here since there was no wait and we were already staying in the palazzo.\n\nwell we spent about $300 total for just my friend and i. we got a few complimentary bread appetizers. i ordered a beer. the drink menu given to me was an ipad. the waiter straight up gave me an ipad as a menu--that was a new experience.\n\nanyway, we ordered 2 steaks and a couple of appetizers. we got the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan, a <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark>, and the australian 100% wagyu beef steak (the most expensive thing on the menu). was it worth it? i guess so. to be honest it kind of tastes like a regular steak. you really have to concentrate on it to taste the difference in quality/texture/etc. i'd recommend getting any quality meat rare as possible. if it's truly a high quality cut of meat, then the rarer the better because you'll get the true taste of its origin and chances of developing some disease from undercooked meat is very low.\n\nwe got no dessert.\nright before we went in the restaurant my friend would a quick $100 on blackjack so it wasn't a hard decision to get the $150 steak.",

            "so the bf was in vegas for the first time for his birthday and he picked cut as his expensive steakhouse dinner.  we were not disappointed.  wolfgang puck figured it out with this place.\n\nfirst off, love the atmosphere in here.  clean lines, dark but not too dark lighting, and they had some good tunes going.  mostly classic rock but interspersed with a few more recent rock songs.  i was glad it wasn't boom boom boom techno for once.\n\nwe were immediately seated when we arrived and things started happing in rapid fire succession.  bread was brought to the table.  the waiter took drink orders, recommended wine, and went through the menu.  someone else brought an amuse bouche.  it was a bit overwhelming overload there for a bit but all for a good cause - to get us food and booze!\n\nwe started with the bread.  there were some crispy bread pieces covered in cheese, maybe parmesan?  it was so good we ate all of it.  then we started with the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> with asian spices, sesame orange dressing, and apple compote.  4 pieces of decadent, amazing <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> perfectly offset with sweetness from the apple.  we loved this.  we also tried the shrimp and crab (or was it lobster) cocktail which had a creamy sauce holding it all together.  i'm not much for creamy sauces so that's a personal preference, but it was still very good.\n\nso they bring out the steak cuts and show them to you and explain the differences.  i had already decided in my head on one thing but after hearing about the wagyu steaks from the usa and australia there was only one way to go: the tasting that included 4 oz usda prime aged 35 days steak, 4 oz american wagyu \"kobe style\", and 2 oz australian wagyu.  i just couldn't resist trying each of them against the other and deciding if they were really all that.  we ordered them up medium rare with sides of parmesan polenta and creamed spinach with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>.  the tasting came with sauces for each steak.\nusda prime aged 35 days: really good steak but harder to cut because of the marbling.  i didn't eat all of this one because i wanted to focus on the other 2 cuts.\namerican wagyu: at first, this one was my favorite.  it was buttery smooth with a great flavor.\naustralian wagyu: this one was even more rich and buttery in flavor and soon became my absolute favorite of the three.  i finished all of it.  probably the best steak i have ever had in my life ever...including at my favorite steakhouse in dallas.  next time i believe i'll just fork out the cash for this cut alone.\ncreamed spinach: good, <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> made it different than the usual, but just good, not mind blowing.\npolenta: perfectly cooked, cheesy, great side for the steaks.\n\nfor dessert the bf ordered some sort of table side crumble that came with market fresh peaches and blackberries in it  i don't know what it was called but all i know is that i have never had fruit that fresh and sweet and delicious.  not a single blackberry was sour, the peaches tasted like they came straight off the tree.  it was an amazing dessert.  they also sent out a baked alaska for the bf's b-day gratis and it said \"happy birthday\" written in chocolate on the plate.  fun.\n\nthe price is commensurate with the quality food you are getting which means this shit isn't cheap.  but it is worth it.  i left here stuffed and happy and pleased that the $$$ spent matched the enjoyment had.  give this steak a try, you will not be disappointed.", 
            "4 stars from me as we had an issue with the sommelier, \nand there seems to be a disconnect from the front of the house (hostesses, bar) with the dining room.\n\nbasically the sommelier was a total bi#*h.  she sent out a weird chablis (?) after we rejected the first 2 tastes, and had clearly stated we wanted to start with a white, (we like sancerre, pouilly-fum\\u00e9s, entre-deux-mers or a gavi), then maybe a red with our main course.\n\nwe realized she had been our cocktail server in the bar, while we were waiting for our table. (strange? yes...)\nshe was so rude to us out there; i got really nervous that this dinner was going to be an expensive disaster.\nthankfully it wasn't.\n\nthe wait staff is amazing. \nthe restaurant is gorgeous, comfortable, perfect lighting. \nservers are warm, friendly, articulate, really top notch. the food was delicious. (not the best meal i have ever had, like some reviewers) but really well done.\n\nthe <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> was really f*#king good.\n\nso i'm not sure where the disconnect is...\nthe sommelier never came to our table to ask us what we like, or explain why she thought some of the wines she sent out would be a better pairing with our salad....so we took it as snub since we had already made her \"lovely\" acquaintance in the bar.\n\nwe do not even pretend to be wine experts, but we travel a lot and know what flavors we like. \ni just think if you are going to have specialty food and an extensive wine list, the sommelier or the wine experience should be on par with everything else.\n\nour waiters were really amazing and made up for any faux pas we experienced.\ni would defiantly go back and recommend.", 
            "wagyu! best guys night out spot ever.  attentive service (though a little slow) and some of the best steak i have ever had.  the company i that i brought with me wasn't in the most mature mood, but the impressive decanting process and great steaks made it worthwhile - no one joked about the food's quality.  \n\nsides and appetizers were also highlights - macaroni and cheese was so good that several of us posted immediately to facebook about it.  <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> appetizer was a huge highlight - somewhere a pig died for a very good reason (sorry, babe).  sauteed spinach also excellent and the squash was ok (yours is still better, mom!)\n\ni did the <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> sampler, and most of the others did one of the <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>.  we all loved every bite. highlight - the australian wagyu was about $300 a pound (!) and was as soft and tender as a <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>.  however, the other two were so good, that i'm not sure if it is worth it to pay the difference, unless it is a very special occasion.  \n\nmy taste buds were happy with me, my wallet wasn't, but what the heck - it's vegas - live a little.", 
            "very best steak of my life. and that doens't come lightly. i've eaten at sparks, s&w, del friscos, benjamins, peter lugers, keans, you name it. i've eaten steak on a ranch in argentina, i've eaten steak from family farmers in utah. ive done it all. i ordered the 12 ounch strip 35 day dry aged corn fed nebraska steak and i was blown away. i actualy went back 2 days later. this place is consistent, they almost can't screw up on the temperature (and at 60-180.00 per steak the better not). i had the brussel sprouts with <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, but i really really enjoyed this steak, and will probably not come close to it again. great wine list (displayed on an easy to navigate ipad). my colleagues wife got the dry aged filet (i really dont' see the point in dry aging a filet) and that's pretty much all she ever orders and she preferred the sirloin. it was just that good. little over done ont he seasoning, i don't think the product needed it that much, but i will probably talk about this steak for years.", 
            "this was our 2nd time dining at cut and we were impressed both times. the service and food are outstanding. i had an aged filet the first time and an american wagyu filet the second time.  the first was excellent but the american wagyu was amazing! all appetizers were delicious - between our party we had beet salad, steak tartar and <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>. the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> was out of this world and was so flavorful. all sides were delicious. we will definitely return on our next vegas trip.",

            "we experienced cut on new years eve after our friends' wedding earlier in the day.   our reservation for 7 was for 7:30p but when i stopped in at the restaurant to check in at 6:30, i was told that our table was ready anytime we were.  good thing, as this was quite the leisurely meal, we soon found out. \n\nwe were seated at the farthest table in the corner of the room. the seating arrangement worked nicely, although i nearly took out a waiter and a patron as the hostess attempted to make conversation over her shoulder with me, while whisking us through the restaurant.  \n\nour servers introduced themselves to us and asked about drinks.   we requested a wine list and started to peruse the menu.  shortly thereafter, we received the explanation of the beefs cuts and what we could expect to taste, as well as how their meats were prepared.  this should have been my first clue for my own meal.  \n\nafter what seemed like an eternity(nearly a half hour), our waiter returned to collect drink orders.  3 glasses of red wine (2 cab, 1 pinot), a beer, and 3 waters.   we waited 10-15 minutes for those to arrive, and then went about ordering our food.  once ordered, we received breads - oooooh so delicious(i'm sure you've read about them here on other reviews)!   breadsticks on the table proved to be messy to eat, as parmesan flaked everywhere.    \n\nwe ordered a few appetizers including the beet salad, <mark>Pink Lady & Fuji Apple Salad</mark>, and <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark> salad, <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, and the maryland blue crab & <mark>Maryland Blue Crab & Carolina Shrimp 'Louis' Cocktail</mark>.   each were delicious and stood soundly with excellent flavor and texture. \n\nour group ordered all different cuts of beef, including the prime porthouse for 2, petit cut filet, and more.  for 7 people, we also ordered 4 side dishes - 2 <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> and 2 mac & cheese. \n\nthis is where things started to fail.  \n\nthe meals were served to the wrong diners, to start.  once the first plate was incorrectly set down, the rest of the team of servers failed.. including one server who set down my \"pork\" in front of me, which was not pork, but bone in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>.   what??  ugh.   from there, there was some swapping of plates and a quick discussion of what went where.  chaos. \n\nthe sides were then served to each diner.  i'm not certain about you, but i like more than a tablespoon of potatoes when i'm served a 20oz <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>.    that's all that was available, though, so we made do.  the potatoes tasted delicious, as did the mac & cheese, which was stringy and difficult for the waiter to serve. \n\nthe kitchen seems to have a problem cooking their meat to the correct temperature.  the petit filet my friend ordered medium, was rare in the middle. i know this is an easy thing to have happen to filet.. but this is cut.  a $52 piece of meat should be prepared correctly!   \n\nmy <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>? wow.. very sad.  i had to physically saw through the char on the steak to get a piece that was not hard and crusted over, and overseasoned.   i'm not a fan of charred meat to begin with but a light char on this piece would have been appropriate.   i was sad to have to leave hunks of  meat behind because they were too tough to even cut through, despite having paid $64. \n\nthe porterhouse for two, for the bride and groom, was cooked inconsistently as well, even though it was ordered medium... one side was rare and the other medium/medium-well.\n\nwith three diners only drinking water, one would think that the servers would be attentive to their glasses and watch for empty.  heck, we've seen better service at applebees when it comes to water.  my husband is a stickler for having a drink at all times, and the service here was an epic fail in that department.  it was so random, the servers would come by, fill up one water glass and neglect two others on the table.  i expected that they ran out of water, but no.. they just moved on to another table and poured more water for another patron.  what the heck?\n\nby the end of our meal, we'd lost a server completely (hadn't seen him in quite a while), and the other, more jovial one, was notified that we were disappointed that they couldn't keep glasses filled, and that the service was lacking.  \ni've eaten at numerous high end places in my day.. this is not one we'll be returning to, sadly.  i have found other steakhouses in vegas to be as comparably priced with excellent cuts of meat and far better service. \n\nwe were seated at our table at 6:30p.  we finally left around 9:30p.  while i'm glad they didn't rush us through, i can now see why they didn't have a reason to.", 
            "omg where to start with this place?  everything about it was awesome.  i was in town for ces, and was lucky enough to find a reservation here.  then we got even luckier that the vip table had a cancellation...so we got to eat while reclining on banquette seats and cushions in a semi-quiet little alcove by the front door. \n\ni had the american wagyu beef.  i'd never had it before....it's drop-your-fork delicious, and so tender...the most tender and tasty steak i've ever eaten.  we also had the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> appetizers.....forget about it....that was like bacon heaven.  the mac and cheese is better than mama used to make.  it's very pricey - duh, it's wolfgang puck at the venetian - but it was an awesome, full, well-rounded meal.", 
            "before cut the only vegas steak places i had been to were carne vino (amzing) and envy (terrible). i came to vegas to interview for a job and the guy who recruited me took me to cut for dinner. it was very, very good.\n\ni ordered two different bourbon drinks- i think both had ginger- they don't appear to be on the menu anymore but one was similar to the samurai they serve now. both were delicious. \n\ni got a <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> appetizer- it came with a raspberry sauce on the pork that was incredible- one of the best <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> dishes i have ever had. \n\ni alwyas get bone in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> and potato side when i go to a new steak place for comparison purposes. the steak here didn't have as much of a crust as i would like but it was seasoned well and the meat was very well cooked. the <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> was smooth, not lumpy, seasoned well. \n\nfor desert they brought us free baked alaska because they \"like to take care of thier locals\"- i wasn't a local yet but with food like this i was well on my way to becoming one. it was excellent- baked alaska is a personal favorite of mine and this one was very well done. \n\nlet me say one other thing- the bread. bread can be a good way to distinguish good restaurants from great and cut definately nails it. they have a few different types that seem to rotate from what i can tell (pretzel is one of the best) and they bring it around on a cart. you can get whatever you want, as much as you want. this is good- it avoids fights to the death over the last <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> bread a la gordon ramsay steak. \n\ni have since been back 3-4 times and enjoyed it thoroughly every time. \n\n\na general note on vegas steak - some of the negative reviews of cut are just ludicrous. they didn't have a1? well guess what, you are gonna get a1 almost nowhere when it comes to fine dining. the steak came by itself on a plate without any circles painted on the plate or sliced up vegetables constructed like legos into an art piece? its a steak house. seriously, if you have no idea where you are going its not really fair to post a negative review that boils down to \"this place wasn't the perfect hybrid of sizzler and alinea i was hoping for\". steak places in vegas are producing a very specific product to compete with a very specific set of restaurants. if you want a cheaper place with a1 why are you going to cut? similarly if you care about plating why are you going to a steak restaurant? use your brain.", 
            "servers were great and i loved the swivel chairs. i had the porterhouse, wedge salad, <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, creamed spinach, potatoes, mac n cheese, and a samurai cocktail.\n\nall in all it was fantastic- my only hesitation to give cut five stars is that it didn't distinguish itself from other comparable steak houses. if you're staying at the palazzo/venetian and are looking for a nice steak dinner, there is no need to go any further than cut.",

            "delicious restaurant, expensive, but a must go if you love great steak!  we started with <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> which was good but a little saltier than the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> i've had in the past i wouldn't recommend it.  however, the entrees, sides and drinks were delicious. my husband had the japanese wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> which was top notch and i had the petite <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> which was great. i ordered a side of sauce which was completely unnecessary so save you couple of dollars.  i will say though if you like <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> that is a must add to your steak.  the spinach with quail egg and the polenta were both notable.  my drink was called show me love and it was refreshing. cut will put a dent in your wallet but well worth it for a special occasion.",

            "at one point, this might have been a wolfgang puck establishment, but it's now slid into being a wolfgang suck establishment. *chortle*\n\nwe came here for a friend's bachelor party, because he'd specifically requested that we get a great steak. the place he chose to get it at was cut. we put on our fly gear, and headed on over. our reservation was honored, and we were prepared to have a great meal that was befitting of the weight of the celebrity chef's name and the hefty price tag.\n\none of my friends ordered a caesar salad, that he said was great, but pricey. he also got the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> appetizer which we all agreed was amazing. \n\nthen the meatsplainer (not his official title, as far as i know) came out to illustrate what each cut of steak looked like, and the marbling characteristics of each of the various dry-aging lengths. i went with the 14 oz. 35-day dry aged <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark>. to complement it, i chose 2 sauces: the <mark>Wasabi-Yuzu Kosho Butter</mark>, (which is actually wasabi yuzu<mark>Wasabi-Yuzu Kosho Butter</mark>. yuzukosho is a fermented paste made with yuzu, a japanese citrus fruit, and kosho, chili peppers. if you're ever at an izakaya, it's the green paste that isn't wasabi.) and the red <mark>Shallot-Red Wine Bordelaise</mark>.\n\nbefore our steaks arrived, we were treated to a number of delicious breads. first some long pretzel sticks, second was a basket of really good cheese bread, (a much better version of the stuff that you get at a churrascurria) and last was a selection of bread that we were supposed to use with this roesmary, roasted black pepper, and french salt butter. i was totally jazzed about that.  it turns out that the butter's basically flavorless unless you get it with the small patch of seasoning that's on top of it. this would be a harbinger of things to come...\n\ni tend to like my steaks a little more cooked than most people, but when ours arrived, even my sensibilities were on alert when i saw the dry mass of meat on my plate. the menu says that they sear their steaks in a 1200 degree broiler. that hunk of flesh on my plate wasn't seared, it was charred. unfortunately, our table had enacted harsh penalties for cell-phone usage during the meal, so i have no photographic proof of this calamity, but, i think everyone was kind of disappointed by the way their steak looked.\n\ni cut into mine, and while it was tender, it was bland. one of the guys in our group would say afterwards, \"you want to take that first bite of steak, and to just be like 'oh my god, this is amazing', and that didn't happen.\" no seasoning on the steaks as far as i could tell. maybe it all got burnt off. who knows.\n\ni used the entirety of the butter sauce on my steak. the boredelaise sauce was pretty good, but since my steak had no moisture to speak of, i needed to put the richness back in. it's great that the sauces are good, but it seemed like my steak was just a vehicle for sauce. i could have had chicken and it honestly wouldn't have changed my experience at all. i would have been equally disappointed by the food.\n\nwe chose 4 sides to go with our food, fingerling potatoes, sauteed baby spinach and garlic, artichokes, and mac & cheese. our waiter had told us that these sides were large, and sharable. they're tiny and overpriced. i think our group of 8 maybe got a spoonful of each. the artichokes were ok, but that was mainly because of the bacon. there were maybe 30 fingerling potato halves on the plate. that's not a lot of potatoes. they were ok, i was using them to figure out which sauces i liked best, but that was like $16. in what world can you justify charging 50 cents for a single steak fry? the spinach was freaking pathetic. boiled spinach with undetectable garlic. if there's ever a version of throwdown against wolfgang puck, i'm going to challenge him to make his sauteed spinach with garlic, and i'm going to win by unanimous decision.\n\nthe service was great, i have no complaints about any of that. this review is all based on what i feel was an average steak at high-end steak prices. i asked my friends afterwards what they thought, fully expecting that this group of more savvy steak connoisseurs would tell me how much better their choices were, but to a man, the entire group said that it was \"just ok\". this wasn't the worst steak i've ever had (that distinction is held by delmonico's...which is oddly enough in the same section of this hotel...) but it's definitely in that bottom tier.\n\nwould not recommend for any occasion.", 
            "they present their steaks on a large plate wrapped in napkins and tablecloths.  it's held gingerly under the waiter's armpit as he tells you about the house specials and sweat drips down his brow from the weight of carrying a tray around with show-meat.\n\nit's among the worst steakhouses in town, and a bit of an inside-joke for locals from las vegas.\n\nit's extremely loud and not good for business situations.  go, if you don't want to hear your the voice of your spouse though.\n\navoid: <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, beet salad, <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, kobe sirloin, french fries and polenta\ntry: mashed potatoes, crab salad, fuji apple crumble dessert",

            "where do i begin? this was absolutely a lovely night for me. i landed in vegas around 7pm and had dinner reservations at this place at 8:30 pm. we got there about 10 minutes prior so we decided to get a drink and wait at the bar. the hostess came up to me when our table was ready with a really nice compliment.\n\ni didn't like how we were seated in the open, near the aisle, to the restroom, but i didn't get a lot of traffic walking by so it did not seem to bother me later. our server came by as soon as we were seated. we were given these delicious thin bread sticks that had some type of cheese melted on it. we then placed our order.  after placing our order, another person came by and gave us a choice of other breads they were serving. i believe they served 5 different breads= prezel bread, onion foccaccio, walnut bread, port bread, and pumpernickel bread.\n\nfor the appetizer we ordered the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> and <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>. omg.. <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> was delightful. it was served with some type of mushroom puree which gave some earthiness to the creamy marrow. we also ordered the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>. <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> was a bit crispy in the outside and i love the texture of the inside of the fat. the dish had a balance of sweet and spicy.\n\ni ordered the american wagyu filet minon medium rare with a side of bearnaise. it was perfectly charred on the outside and medium rare in the inside. i took a bite without the sauce. i could taste the smokiness and the salt and pepper. the steak was phenomenal. the piece of steak literally melted in my mouth like butter. i did try a bite with the sauce and of course the sauce was delish, but you really don't need a side sauce with these steaks. my boyfriend ordered the usda prime nebraska corn fed <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> at medium.  same thing.. absolute perfection.\n\nwe had the mac and cheese as our side. i didn't think much of the flavor because i was so into my piece of steak. \n\nwait staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. definitely recommend this place."

            "i think the hype for this restaurant dampened my experience. the interior was nice, very roomy, love the decor, simple yet classy. and the service was excellent, the server was very charming :-) so one star for that. they have a wide selection of wine and drinks. but for the price of over $100 a person, the <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> ($61) was a lil overcooked, and the <mark>Caramelized Onions</mark> contained too much honey, making it for a overpowering sweetened flavor. i ordered the true japanese wagyu beef from kagoshima ($160) and although i know that it is suppose to be so fatty and that's why people enjoy it, i personally felt that it was way too fatty towards the end, and couldn't finish it because it upset my stomach. i don't really know how anyone can finish a whole one to themselves. i guess it would've tasted better if it was shared where everyone takes only a bite or two . the lamb chop ($48) was waaaayyy too overcooked, but yet we saw many tables ordering it. although i don't particularly enjoy flan, everyone seemed to have thoroughly enjoyed the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan with mushroom marmalade and parseley salad. most of the sides with your entree is about $12-13 each side, the <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>, <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>, sweet <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>, french fries, <mark>Soft Polenta with Parmesan</mark>, creamed spinach with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>...etc were good but i felt that it was nothing special.   their garlic bread appetizer and tuna tartar was delicious but not worth $24 a plate. the shrimp  in the <mark>Maryland Blue Crab & Carolina Shrimp 'Louis' Cocktail</mark> was not fresh and i've had better garlic fries at gordan biersh.the one appetizer we ordered 3 plates of, one after another, because it was sooo amazing was the kobe steak sashimi (definitely worth $22 a plate, and i suggest this is a must try! but for those that don't like eating raw meat, trust... it'll change your whole view on it) - overall great experience, but i just feel that it is nothing special especially for how costly it is- and too much hype.", 
            "for my 30th birthday we decided to go to las vegas and wanted to eat at one of the strip's top restaurants.  after reading various reviews, we decided on cut.  i would have to say that the decor and the food lived up to all the hype.  the decor is elegant, yet hip and the swivel chairs and mirrors everywhere give it a real fun vibe.\n\nwe started with the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> and louis shrimp and <mark>Maryland Blue Crab & Carolina Shrimp 'Louis' Cocktail</mark>.  they were both light and delicate with intense flavors.  i then had the 10 oz american waygu (kobe) strip steak and my wife had the 21 day aged filet.  the meat lived up to all of our expectations.  we both had trouble finishing after eating the starters but could not waste the delicious meat.  i would have to recommend splurging for the waygu steaks or even the japanese kobe.  at $80 a steak, the waygu is definitely worth a little more after trying both.  don't get me wrong the filet was great, but hard to compare after eating the strip.\n\nthe reason i can't give it a 5 is because we somehow managed to get the server that must have just got promoted from the \"b\" team.  we could tell the server to our right was top notch but our guy just lacked in so many ways.  he started off by taking our drink order and seriously not bringing it back for ten minutes (place was not slammed).  the table next to us was sat after us and had drinks and bread at least 5 minutes before us.  the sommelier  ended up having to go to the bar to get them for us.  it doesn't seem to hard to pour mccallan 15 yr in a glass but i digress.   then our guy left the meat stand they put next to the table to show the different cut's off at our table for 15 minutes until i had to ask someone to get it out of there.  we asked for recommendations and they were lame.  this website did a better job.  my wife asked what temp he recc'd her filet be cooked at and he said \"med\".  where are we?  and then he recommended <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> with these fine pieces of meat.  \n\nfor the price of the bill, this guy should have been much, much better.  the food was amazing and we had a great night, but i will probably try a few other steakhouses in lv before i venture back.",

            "we experienced cut on new years eve after our friends' wedding earlier in the day.   our reservation for 7 was for 7:30p but when i stopped in at the restaurant to check in at 6:30, i was told that our table was ready anytime we were.  good thing, as this was quite the leisurely meal, we soon found out. \n\nwe were seated at the farthest table in the corner of the room. the seating arrangement worked nicely, although i nearly took out a waiter and a patron as the hostess attempted to make conversation over her shoulder with me, while whisking us through the restaurant.  \n\nour servers introduced themselves to us and asked about drinks.   we requested a wine list and started to peruse the menu.  shortly thereafter, we received the explanation of the beefs cuts and what we could expect to taste, as well as how their meats were prepared.  this should have been my first clue for my own meal.  \n\nafter what seemed like an eternity(nearly a half hour), our waiter returned to collect drink orders.  3 glasses of red wine (2 cab, 1 pinot), a beer, and 3 waters.   we waited 10-15 minutes for those to arrive, and then went about ordering our food.  once ordered, we received breads - oooooh so delicious(i'm sure you've read about them here on other reviews)!   breadsticks on the table proved to be messy to eat, as parmesan flaked everywhere.    \n\nwe ordered a few appetizers including the beet salad, <mark>Pink Lady & Fuji Apple Salad</mark>, and <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark> salad, <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, and the maryland blue crab & <mark>Maryland Blue Crab & Carolina Shrimp 'Louis' Cocktail</mark>.   each were delicious and stood soundly with excellent flavor and texture. \n\nour group ordered all different cuts of beef, including the prime porthouse for 2, petit cut filet, and more.  for 7 people, we also ordered 4 side dishes - 2 <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> and 2 mac & cheese. \n\nthis is where things started to fail.  \n\nthe meals were served to the wrong diners, to start.  once the first plate was incorrectly set down, the rest of the team of servers failed.. including one server who set down my \"pork\" in front of me, which was not pork, but bone in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>.   what??  ugh.   from there, there was some swapping of plates and a quick discussion of what went where.  chaos. \n\nthe sides were then served to each diner.  i'm not certain about you, but i like more than a tablespoon of potatoes when i'm served a 20oz <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>.    that's all that was available, though, so we made do.  the potatoes tasted delicious, as did the mac & cheese, which was stringy and difficult for the waiter to serve. \n\nthe kitchen seems to have a problem cooking their meat to the correct temperature.  the petit filet my friend ordered medium, was rare in the middle. i know this is an easy thing to have happen to filet.. but this is cut.  a $52 piece of meat should be prepared correctly!   \n\nmy <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>? wow.. very sad.  i had to physically saw through the char on the steak to get a piece that was not hard and crusted over, and overseasoned.   i'm not a fan of charred meat to begin with but a light char on this piece would have been appropriate.   i was sad to have to leave hunks of  meat behind because they were too tough to even cut through, despite having paid $64. \n\nthe porterhouse for two, for the bride and groom, was cooked inconsistently as well, even though it was ordered medium... one side was rare and the other medium/medium-well.\n\nwith three diners only drinking water, one would think that the servers would be attentive to their glasses and watch for empty.  heck, we've seen better service at applebees when it comes to water.  my husband is a stickler for having a drink at all times, and the service here was an epic fail in that department.  it was so random, the servers would come by, fill up one water glass and neglect two others on the table.  i expected that they ran out of water, but no.. they just moved on to another table and poured more water for another patron.  what the heck?\n\nby the end of our meal, we'd lost a server completely (hadn't seen him in quite a while), and the other, more jovial one, was notified that we were disappointed that they couldn't keep glasses filled, and that the service was lacking.  \ni've eaten at numerous high end places in my day.. this is not one we'll be returning to, sadly.  i have found other steakhouses in vegas to be as comparably priced with excellent cuts of meat and far better service. \n\nwe were seated at our table at 6:30p.  we finally left around 9:30p.  while i'm glad they didn't rush us through, i can now see why they didn't have a reason to.", 
            "can things get better than a fancy dinner in vegas? i was in town for a girl's weekend and wanted to enjoy one indulgent meal. we decided to make a reservation at cut since wolfgang puck is such a renowned chef. we were not disappointed. i started with the crab and <mark>Maryland Blue Crab & Carolina Shrimp 'Louis' Cocktail</mark>, which was fantastic. the portions were much larger than expected. they even start you off with a huge selection of bread, so don't make the mistake of loading up on carbs. in regards to the steak, we had to try the american wagyu beef. i ordered a <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> (6 oz) with <mark>Caramelized Onions</mark> and the peppercorn sauce. it was the best steak i've ever had. it was so moist and perfectly cooked. we got the creamed spinach and mac and cheese as sides, and this was way more than enough food. to top off our meal, we ordered the banana cream pie, which was fantastic. they also served some small dessert samples which were okay, but i would recommend trying one of their house made desserts.", 
            "i know, i'm super late to the vegas steakhouse party, but to my bf's delight, we've been making up for lost time this year. on this last trip, we tried wolfgang puck's cut in the palazzo. \n\nservice in the lounge area was, to use a word popularized by beyonc\\u00e9, flawless. perfectly smooth symphony of waiters tending to our party of two. \n\nfoods: \n-- breads: pretzel roll was decedent with their rosemary butter, onion focaccia was all flavor without being dense, yummy, long cheesy breadsticks, & sharply-flavored cheese breads. \n-- <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> appetizer: the meaty parts were excellent (i don't eat the fatty parts) \n-- lobster, crab, <mark>Maryland Blue Crab & Carolina Shrimp 'Louis' Cocktail</mark> tower: way too much going on; simple mounds of undressed, fresh seafood would have been better than throwing the lot together with avocado, sauces, savory pudding, etc., \n-- bone-in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, (aged 21 days) for him: generous 20 oz., cooked perfectly medium-rare, nicely grilled.\n-- petite filet (8 oz) for me: cooked perfectly on the inside, a little more charred on the outside than i would've like \n-- sauces ($2 each): <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> was quite sweet, peppercorn was delicious. a variety of mustards were brought out for our steaks, an austrian tradition. the violet mustard, which had a hint of a wine taste, especially brought out amazing flavors when added to our steaks. \n-- sides: <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark> (holy shit, these are good) & mashed potatoes (creamy/buttery)\n-- desserts: banana cream pie (only so-so) & baked alaska (he really enjoyed the meringue.) \n\nprice of our food coma (not including tip): $240.", 
            "when you visit those celebrity chef establishments in casino hotels your expectations with the high price tag are normally expect disappointment.  as we 11 of us head to cut friday evening we enter the upper level high tech looking cut in the shops in the palazzo.  a drink at the bar the check is easily transferred to the table which is a simple thing but not always easy at some of these places.  bravo. \n\nseated at table that really can't fit 11  10 was pushing it but they could not accommodate us any other way so we make due.  menu is different than your standard steak house for appetizers and sides while every type of steak, type of aged, time of aged, type of beef from true kobe to american kobe is available to you.  \n\nwe select a good bottle of wine ok 4 of them...and off we go...\n\nvariety of breads but the absolute winner is their pretzel rolls omg good.\n\nappetizers in no particular order\n\ncaesar salad top notch with traditional dressing. \n\n<mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> no my thing but those who had it said it was simply outstanding. \n\ncombination <mark>Pan Roasted Stonington Maine Lobster</mark>, blue crab & <mark>Maryland Blue Crab & Carolina Shrimp 'Louis' Cocktail</mark> between polenta was truly out of this world \n\nbiggest winner.. homemade burratta cheese with a pesto sauce that made you go holy cow!   all winners...\n\n11 hungry hombres 11 steaks of all types i'll try to do my best on the reviews. \n\n3 wet aged 21 day bone in prime <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>.. all grilled than broiled and perfectly cooked. taste was as it should be through and through not 1 complaint.\n\n3 wet aged 21 days bone in 20 oz ny strips... i had one of these steaks and the two to my left and right were much thicker cut than mine while mine equally as tasty lacked the thickness debt that would have made this a never forget type steak. \n\n1 21 day wet age 8 oz filet was sent back ...  said was just blah nothing to it...  i'll get to how it was retuned shortly. \n\n2 35 day dry aged ny strips no bone were good but could not compete with the wet aged cousin served earlier. \n\n2 gentlemen split the 34 oz american wagu for two and came away saying it was one of best steaks ever. \n\nside dishes: \nspinach with garlic was exceptional \nfries were very hot and tasty with some truffle oil\nreal winner was the mac & cheese that was hands down the best ever tasted. \n\nside note the service here was nothing short of sensational... from appetizers to entrees if you have 11 guys and 7 sides 18 people show up to serve you each with a dish in hand to present your steak and serve sides simultaneously.  the best presentation of service i've ever seen.  \n\neven returning the steak when the new one came out fresh sides were delivered to the person who had the off steak.. nice touch\n\nall and all pricey yes - can we have 2 bad steaks out of 11...not something you wish for... but that keeps it from the 5 star rating should be 4.5  atmosphere excellent and service was truly some of best i've ever seen.. highly recommended."

            "for starters, the bar was awesome.  very chic with great service and equally tasty drinks.  the snacks are very appropriate to get your palate ready.\n\nthen there was dinner with awesome music.  rock during dinner was quite unique and not too loud as others have boasted.  the bread selection was divine and don't miss out on the bavarian pretzels - to die for.  appies:  steak tartare, <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark> avocado salad and big eye tuna (there were more i just lost consciousness after those).\n\nmeat - most of us had the american waygu.  amazing meat and cooked to perfection.  the sauces we ordered were a very nice addition to the meat.  might want to just order a few as the flavors tend to get lost in the party.\n\nlastly, we had just about every dessert.  the fuji apple and the strawberry shortcake were my favorites.  hats off to the chocolate souffle as well - cooked to order and was spot on.  the service by our waiter along with marino could not be matched.  i have dined at all of the puck properties and this rates in the top 3 - maybe top 2.  bring your wallet or expense account because perfection does have a pricetag.  if you are going to eat a fine meat meal once a year - this is the place regardless of the price.", 
            "i dined at several restaurants in my adventure to las vegas (july 2008), and this one by far was the best! upon walking in, the atmosphere struck me as intimate. the dimly lit restaurant itself did not appear to be that large however it was comfortable. the prices were quite a shock, but we dove into the menu anyway. i started with a <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark> salad with cherry tomatoes, large chunks of bleu cheese, avocado, basil, chives and a sweet yet tart vinigarette i can't quite pinpoint an exact mixture of. the salad was bliss! i'd have to say it was my favorite part of the meal. for the main course, i had a medium rare big eye tuna steak (i don't eat much red meat). it was done very nicely and melted in my mouth. my associates enjoyed steaks. the exact cuts they had escape me, however i did try a bite and it was delicious. the vegetable dishes were also beyond amazing! we had the <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>, squash & corn. i couldn't get enough of the corn. perfectly seasoned in a way i had never experienced! for desert, we shared the chocolate souffl\\u00e9 and a banana cream creme brul\\u00e9. i have to say i preferred the souffl\\u00e9, but both were exceptionally fantastic! finally, the service was perfect. my water glass was never empty. our server paid close attention to our needs. cut is fine dining at it's absolute best! a highly recommended experience!", 
            "went with a big b-party before a night of booze and hangovers. it has a sleek \"too cool for school\" vibe which is the signature for vegas celeb chef restaurants. the wagyu platter was impressive as they brought it out rare to show you what you can have if you would like to sell your first born and take out a second mortgage. \n\nwent with the <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark> salad which as very good. bread selection was dominated by the pretzel bread which was phenomenal. i'm not a big steak guy, so i went with the slow roasted short ribs with indian spices. turned out to be a good choice as the doneness of all the steaks at our table were as dependable as hitting a straight flush in the poker room. \n\nsides were good though...i guess \n\nthe thing that made they <mark>Whole Roasted French Loup De Mer</mark> worthwhile was the 25% off my friend somehow came across when booking the restaurant", 
            "delicious, lucious american wagyu from cut makes my top three steaks of all time.  my friend and i splurged on the american wagyu, and i might say it was the best spent $90 of my epicurean life (porterhouse for two is $180). \n\nwe actually missed a friday reservation because of flight delays, but they offered to re-schedule us for saturday.  they only had a table in their lounge (vs the dining room), which we actually preferred.  very cool bar, modern but comfortable lounge with normal tables for dining.  \n\nwe started with a bottle of prosecco that my wonderful friend had sent for my birthday, gougeres and several types of bread with nicely salt and spiced butter. we split a <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark> salad, which was good start.  a side of butternut squash, which came with roasted celery root and leek, was just delicious.\n\nwith our steak, and the addition of two more friends, we ordered a bottle of red -- it was a challenge to find a recession-friendly bottle among the three- and four-digit prices.  we skimped on wine and went with a ~$50 bottle of malbec that did the job.  \n\nback to the wagyu -- they bring out the entire sizzling skillet and carve the ny strip and filet so you get a few of each.  comes with the <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> and a bernaise, though absolutely not necessary.  the savory juices (and frankly fat) spread through your mouth with each bite that is pure heaven.  \n\nmy wonderful friend also sent a birthday dessert, which we swore we all had no space left in our body for, until we had the first bite of banana creme goodness, and proceeded to devour the rest.\n\nmeal was culinary bliss for about two hours, despite the struggles of my corseted friend.  amazing meal.  total for one with tax and tip (minus the champagne and dessert) was $173...", 
            "okay, i love love love steak and i don't mind paying an arm and a leg for it when it tastes amazing... unfortunately this place \"cut\" did not deliver. the only positive i have to say about this restaurant is that the service was impeccable but when you're spending $70-$150 for a steak it should be. this list of con's is many: wayyyy over priced for what you get, ugly strange d\\u00e9cor, uncomfortable chairs (that look like lawn furniture), small tasteless side dishes, crappy overpriced salads and appetizers, and charred overcooked steaks (which should be a crime).\n\nmy biggest complaint? their steak... come on people, this is a freaking steakhouse! you've got to be able to get at least the steak right!!! i ordered my steak (<mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>) medium, you know, so there is some pink in the middle? apparently the chef didn't get the memo because my steak came out as black as coal, charred to a crisp, and well done for sure. literally... i had to use the knife like a saw to cut through the steak, certainly not melt in your mouth like they advertise. once you cut into it the steak was dry and chewy... i am not stretching when i say i have had better steak at outback! several other people at the table commented on how hard it was to cut their steaks, how black and charred their steaks were, and how hard they were to chew. \n\ni also ordered a crab salad with my meal which was $30 bucks and tasted really bad... the crab was good but everything else they mixed with it including this mushy cheese mixture was horrible. i picked out the crab and left everything else. other people in my party ordered the asparagus <mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark>, the heirloom <mark>Pink Lady & Fuji Apple Salad</mark>, and the <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark> avocado salad as appetizers and said they were just ho-hum. \n\nthe side dishes are ridiculous, they are supposed to serve 3 but really only serve 1 and are expensive... we had to order 8 side dishes for 10 people and we only got a few bites each. their potatoes were watery and not very appealing, their mac-and-cheese was okay but i don't think it was any better than kraft's mac and cheese, and their <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark> were blah... they should call them flavorless onion strings! \n\ni realize this review has been quite harsh but come on wolfgang, we expect more from you! when you are spending $200+ per person the meal should be truly amazing and not a charred small portioned mess!\n\nthink twice about going here... there are so many other amazing steakhouses in vegas that far surpass this one.", 
            "this is my second visit to cut steakhouse, i had previously visited the beverly hills location. this time, it was the las vegas location (in the palazzo) that was going to have to try and match my prior experience, and i have to say, they exceeded my expectations. my three friend who also were with my for our guys weekend in vegas also thought this was the best steakhouse they have ever been to as well.\n\nonce again, the atmosphere is very modern for a steakhouse, but i like that, its nice for a change. the staff is tremendous, but this is no shock for a restaurant of this caliber. i can't comment on the sommelier because i selected are wine, but he did present it very professionally (did the whole little swirl in each glass pre-pour trick).... have to love excess. for appetizers, we orders some type of <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark> salad which was very good and a couple of the <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> appetizers, and this is by far one of the best tartar's i have ever had. i essentially forced my table to order a couple of these because of how much i enjoyed it last time i had it (they also loved it). this  may not seem like enough for four men in vegas, but that leads me to the bread. our table easily consumed 5  focaccia loafs, 6 pretzel loafs, and 3lbs of butter....i don't think i need to say anymore on the quality of the bread. everyone ordered ny strip's, mine was from nebraska, and once again, it is the best steak i have ever had (their seasoning/rub is out of this world). no dessert for us... we were too full.\n\nafter my second visit i can comfortably say two things: 1) this is my favorite steakhouse and 2) i hope to god they are going to build one in chicago.", 
            "my husband and i splurged for a high end dining experience at cut last night.  i had heard much about it and were looking forward to seeing if the hype lived up to the expectations.  overall, food and wine were excellent but the price would probably keep us from going back soon.\n\nfor appetizers, my husband chose the <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> and i had the <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark> salad with avocado, bleu cheese and a herb champagne vinagrette.   after we ordered the waiter informed us these were two of the most popular and i can see why. both were fantastic.  the waiter brought around 4 different types of fresh bread.  i had the onion focaccia which was excellent, and my husband the sourdough which was also good.\n\nfor the main course, i had selected the 6 oz american wagyyu <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark>, and my husaband selected the petite <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> cut, both prepared medium rare.  my husband thought his was a bit overseasoned with pepper, but i thought his tasted good.  my steak was excellent, one of the best i have ever had.  but $75 for 6 oz is a lot of $$.  i think most people who probably eat here aren't necessarily concerned about prices. the steaks come with three types of mustard for dipping, two of which were excellent.  we also go the <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> (by far the best of all the sauces) and a herb shallot red <mark>Shallot-Red Wine Bordelaise</mark> that was tasty also.  all sauces are served on the side so that you can try a variety. \n\nour sides were the mac and cheese and creamed spinach with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>.  both were excellent.  the egg gave the creamed spinach a really nice texture, and the mac and cheese was a bit of a twist on an old staple.\n\nwe were stuffed so didn't order dessert, although they gave us some small bites of lemon and chocolate bars which were just enough and tasted excellent.  \n\noverall this was a great dinner, but we ended up spending over $400 on just the two of us, so it would be hard to justify going again.", 
            "be prepared it's the best steak i have ever had ! we were treated like royalty from the second we walked in vegas is a real dry climate and i was parched and the waiter was on point with the water my glass never got empty , the breads were real good then the <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark> salad was awesome ,the steaks were so tender and we just went with the usda steaks about as low of a cut you can get but still amazing ,good sides as well as wines ,i will eat here every time i'm in vegas", 
            "first of all, i don't eat meat so i can't really give a critique on their steaks. so, why would a person who doesn't eat meat review this place? well, because not everyone eats meat and because i can and i want to. but on the real, regardless, meat eater or not, you gotta try cut.\n\nthe restaurant itself is so chic, the decor is beautiful as well the menus (i have a thing for fonts and paper, fyi); hell, even the staff is nice to look at :] no but forreal, the staff is really nice and are there for everything. yes i mean everything; they do the whole pull your chair out, put the napkin over your lap thing. i wish they'd feed me next time lol the bathrooms are really nice too! the only gripe i have would be about those wooden floors; they're slippery as hell. \n\nnow on to the food. the variety of bread they offer is off the chain; the focacciaa was frikkin amazing! i ordered the \"<mark>Butter Lettuce</mark>, avocado, <mark>Point Reyes Blue Cheese</mark>, champagne-herb vinaigrette\". okay, yea, i'm the first one to say \"salad is just salad\" but this salad is not just a salad. it's like the most epic tasting salad i've had... ever and i've had my share of salads. everything was just like butta' melting in my mouth: so creamy and velvety.  prety much it was really frikkin good! all the ingredients were really fresh and the vinaigrette and cheese were delicious. and damn the water was good too. so no complaints.\n\npricewise, like other people have said expect to pay somewhere between $100-$175 per person. i didn't spend nearly as much because i just got the salad and a water.\n\nall in all, the experience and food were exceptional.", 
            "we had dinner here on 12/17/11 ..steak lovers heaven !!! if you love steaks this is the restaurant to come while in vegas. it is pricey but worth every penny..  nice cocktail menu.. creative mixologists at work...i had the asian pear martini and my hubby the traditional ketel one martini a little dirty..  for appetizer the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> is a must try.. it is cruchy on the outside and buttery tender in the inside..perfection.. the <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark> salad it's amazing.. if you can believe that a salad can be amazing you should try this one.  with an array of choices from the meat menu could be quite intimidating but the servers are highly trained to help you make the best selection.  i chose the bone in <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> and my hubby tried the kobe filet both charred to perfection on the outside and buttery in the inside.. melts in your mouth.. wow !!! worth every penny.. for sides we had the brussel sprouts and the spinach both excellent and for dessert the fig cake with gianduja ice cream yum !  please do not let the name wolfgang puck confuse you .. this one is one of his best restaurants.. way different to spago..", 
            "nothing overly special, when comparing to other top end steakhouses.\n\nits been a few months since i went to cut, so i wont give a detailed review, i'll just post my overall feelings and things that stood out.\n\nfirst off, the service was awesome at first and then started fading away towards the end. when i go to top-end steak-houses, i expect top notch service and was not failed for the first 3/4 of our dining experience. but on the back end, the attentiveness wasnt there once our main course was served (he quit filling our wine for us, took a while to clear the plates, took even longer bring dessert menu, took a long time to bring check). and we had a later reservation, so it wasnt like he was in the weeds.\n\nthe crab and shrimp appetizer was good, but nothing outstanding. the asparagus app was very good though. the <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark> salad was just ok to me. im not a fan of the <mark>Point Reyes Blue Cheese</mark> with a vinaigrette salad, but the gf wanted it. my opinion on this is purely just my palate...im sure other would think it was very good.\n\nthe steak...was ok...good, but nothing special (at this price point). i actually enjoy steaks at some other places better (craftsteak, for instance). it was cooked perfectly, but i didnt really care for the lack of seasoning. i know some will argue that point, but that was my main problem with the steak, it lacked seasoning that really brings out the flavors. i suppose its better than over seasoning though.\n\nour sides were the mac and cheese (outstanding!!!!) and some roasted corn or something like that. the mac and cheese was absolutely fantastic and i would go back just for that, but the corn was disappointing. it had some of the hard parts of the cob still attached. while i appreciate the effort of freshly peeled corn, i guess i just wanted to see it done well.\n\n\noverall, i enjoy trying different steakhouses and this place ranks with the others in their price point. it wasnt my favorite, but it was still good. if you are a steakhouse fan like me, its worth trying out.", 
            "we went to vegas for our honeymoon to enjoy the ultimate culinary experience. we booked reservations at 4 top-notch restaurants and we went to cut on our last night. this place is amazing and was the best out of the 4 we tried!!! we both had the american wagyu beef (<mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> and ny steak), with potato pur\\u00e9e and roasted brussel sprouts. the meat was so tender, juicy, and seasoned perfectly, plus it had a wonderful sear on both sides (no need to add any extras/sauces). there is definitely a difference between your \"everyday\" <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> and american wagyu. if you come here expect to splurge, and in my opinion it's pointless to get any cut of beef of lesser quality than the wagyu. \n\nthe pur\\u00e9e was delicious, very creamy and great flavor. the brussel sprouts were roasted with bacon and <mark>Fingerling Potatoes, Smokey Bacon, Pearl Onions</mark> - another very tasty side dish. we ordered the <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark> salad as an appetizer and loved it. my husband, who doesn't usually care for salads, would order it again in a heartbeat. it comes with a spectacular champagne vinaigrette that ties all the flavors together. for dessert we had the chocolate souffl\\u00e9 and banana cream pie. in addition, they bring you bread with dinner. of the 4 choices we recommend the focaccia and pretzel bread...delightful! \n\noverall this place has superb food and great service. we are definitely going back the next time we are in vegas. simply amazing!", 
            "oh cut, i so wanted to love you! but unfortunately, i just like you. 3.5 stars.\n\none of our friends had said this is his favorite steakhouse and he eats here every time he goes to vegas. so for our annual thanksgiving dinner, i suggested cut as the place for my family to dine. we all walked away saying we would not come here again.\n\nservice - top notch!\nambiance - this is a tiny restaurant and it's decorated nicely, but the music was classic rock and didn't really fit the feel of this place.\nthe food - hits and misses, which i'll get to.\nprice - about $1000 for eight people, which is pretty average for a steakhouse.\n\nbread - you are given crispy breadsticks coated in parmesan. tasty, but very messy, the parmesan flaked off all over the place. \nyou are brought a plate of four choices of bread, you tell them which ones you want, and they are served to you by a waiter. i had the pretzel bread and the onion focaccia bread. both were awesome. \n\nstarters - they don't have soup! i really wanted a soup, but there are none on the menu. bummer. my friend ordered the <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark>, avocado, <mark>Point Reyes Blue Cheese</mark>, champagne-herb vinaigrette salad. i had a couple bites and it was very good. \n\nsteak - our friend had told us to splurge and get the japanese wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>. it's $155 for 8 oz. he said it was well worth it, so bf and i split it. japanese wagyu is apparently not for me, it's just too buttery and literally melted in my mouth. i like steak i can chew on a little bit. i don't fault cut, i just think it isn't my thing. my friend ordered a petite filet with <mark>Point Reyes Blue Cheese</mark> and i tried it, i liked his filet a lot and wish we had ordered that <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark>. everybody else said their meat was okay.\n\nsides - brussels sprouts - great flavor, but too undercooked for my taste. not served very hot. creamed spinach topped with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> - just okay, also not very hot, and i could have done without the egg. mac & cheese - good flavor, but the noodles were slightly gummy and also, this wasn't hot. \n\ndessert - we didn't get any, but my friend ordered the chocolate souffle and it was amazing. definitely the best part of the meal. \n\nit wasn't terrible, but there are so many steakhouses in vegas, many of which i think are a lot better. when you are dropping $125 a person, you want to enjoy everything you eat, and that didn't happen here.", 
            "we experienced cut on new years eve after our friends' wedding earlier in the day.   our reservation for 7 was for 7:30p but when i stopped in at the restaurant to check in at 6:30, i was told that our table was ready anytime we were.  good thing, as this was quite the leisurely meal, we soon found out. \n\nwe were seated at the farthest table in the corner of the room. the seating arrangement worked nicely, although i nearly took out a waiter and a patron as the hostess attempted to make conversation over her shoulder with me, while whisking us through the restaurant.  \n\nour servers introduced themselves to us and asked about drinks.   we requested a wine list and started to peruse the menu.  shortly thereafter, we received the explanation of the beefs cuts and what we could expect to taste, as well as how their meats were prepared.  this should have been my first clue for my own meal.  \n\nafter what seemed like an eternity(nearly a half hour), our waiter returned to collect drink orders.  3 glasses of red wine (2 cab, 1 pinot), a beer, and 3 waters.   we waited 10-15 minutes for those to arrive, and then went about ordering our food.  once ordered, we received breads - oooooh so delicious(i'm sure you've read about them here on other reviews)!   breadsticks on the table proved to be messy to eat, as parmesan flaked everywhere.    \n\nwe ordered a few appetizers including the beet salad, <mark>Pink Lady & Fuji Apple Salad</mark>, and <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark> salad, <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, and the maryland blue crab & <mark>Maryland Blue Crab & Carolina Shrimp 'Louis' Cocktail</mark>.   each were delicious and stood soundly with excellent flavor and texture. \n\nour group ordered all different cuts of beef, including the prime porthouse for 2, petit cut filet, and more.  for 7 people, we also ordered 4 side dishes - 2 <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> and 2 mac & cheese. \n\nthis is where things started to fail.  \n\nthe meals were served to the wrong diners, to start.  once the first plate was incorrectly set down, the rest of the team of servers failed.. including one server who set down my \"pork\" in front of me, which was not pork, but bone in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>.   what??  ugh.   from there, there was some swapping of plates and a quick discussion of what went where.  chaos. \n\nthe sides were then served to each diner.  i'm not certain about you, but i like more than a tablespoon of potatoes when i'm served a 20oz <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>.    that's all that was available, though, so we made do.  the potatoes tasted delicious, as did the mac & cheese, which was stringy and difficult for the waiter to serve. \n\nthe kitchen seems to have a problem cooking their meat to the correct temperature.  the petit filet my friend ordered medium, was rare in the middle. i know this is an easy thing to have happen to filet.. but this is cut.  a $52 piece of meat should be prepared correctly!   \n\nmy <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>? wow.. very sad.  i had to physically saw through the char on the steak to get a piece that was not hard and crusted over, and overseasoned.   i'm not a fan of charred meat to begin with but a light char on this piece would have been appropriate.   i was sad to have to leave hunks of  meat behind because they were too tough to even cut through, despite having paid $64. \n\nthe porterhouse for two, for the bride and groom, was cooked inconsistently as well, even though it was ordered medium... one side was rare and the other medium/medium-well.\n\nwith three diners only drinking water, one would think that the servers would be attentive to their glasses and watch for empty.  heck, we've seen better service at applebees when it comes to water.  my husband is a stickler for having a drink at all times, and the service here was an epic fail in that department.  it was so random, the servers would come by, fill up one water glass and neglect two others on the table.  i expected that they ran out of water, but no.. they just moved on to another table and poured more water for another patron.  what the heck?\n\nby the end of our meal, we'd lost a server completely (hadn't seen him in quite a while), and the other, more jovial one, was notified that we were disappointed that they couldn't keep glasses filled, and that the service was lacking.  \ni've eaten at numerous high end places in my day.. this is not one we'll be returning to, sadly.  i have found other steakhouses in vegas to be as comparably priced with excellent cuts of meat and far better service. \n\nwe were seated at our table at 6:30p.  we finally left around 9:30p.  while i'm glad they didn't rush us through, i can now see why they didn't have a reason to.", 
            "3 words.... to die for! what an amazing restaurant. the ambiance is classy, the staff was friendly and knowledgeable and the food was unbelievable. coming from los angeles, our standards for steakhouses are very high and they met the challenge without a sweat. it was hard to decide what to eat because the entire menu was unique and interesting. for starters my husband had the <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark> salad with the most amazing champagne-herb vinaigrette we have ever had. i had a unique beet salad with humboldt fog goat cheese and the flavors blended perfectly. for our steaks it was hard to pick just one (which by the way, they do a tasting of 3 as well...which would be smart if you have never had wagyu before, totally worth it). he had the filet and i had the <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark> of their american wagyu beef from snake river farms idaho. amazing!!! if you are a mushroom person, i would recommend adding this on your steak, the flavors were perfect. for dessert, he had the chocolate souffle and i had the cheese plate, both of which were a perfect ending to a perfect evening. \nthank you to the executive chef and the staff for a memorable last night in vegas for us!", 
            "hands down the best culinary experience of my life.\n\ni know i've reviewed a couple of steakhouses, but this place is by far one of the best meals i've had. my fiancee and i were super excited to come here for his birthday dinner, since we're both such steak lovers. \n\nwe were seated the minute we arrived, which was amazing, because typically steakhouses make you wait 10 minutes past your reservation time (i never understood why). immediately, we had our waiter and another server take care of our utensils and water glasses; i can honestly go on and on about how impeccable the service was at this place. they really have all of the fine details down when it comes to customer service, which added to the amazing experience. \n\nwe both started off with caesar salad, which wasn't on the menu, but our waitress was more than happy to have the salads prepared for us. the salad was prepared on <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark>, and topped with amazing shavings of parmesan cheese, creamy caesar dressing, and anchovies. you could really taste the quality of the ingredients used. the salad also came with two bruschettas topped with what tasted like garlic aioli, fresh cherry tomatoes, and basil. very delicious! we were also served different types of bread, four different kinds to choose from to be exact, and you could ask for as many as you wanted. \n\nfor the main dishes, we ordered the 35 day aged <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark>, 21 day aged bone in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, cavatappi pasta \"mac & cheese\", and <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark> (no,we couldn't finish it). wow. best steak ever. i definitely couldn't finish it all, but i did save some room for the delicious mac and cheese (i highly recommend ordering this side dish!). i'm not a fan of <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>, but i absolutely loved these <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>. the batter was very light and super crisp, which you don't typically find with <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>. \n\nsince it was my fiancee's birthday, the restaurant provided banana cream pie for dessert. the dish was accompanied with creme brulee, chocolate sauce, and roasted banana gelato; it was rich but super light at the same time.\n\ni highly recommend this restaurant for a special date night or celebration. you will not be disappointed.", 
            "another great meal in las vegas!  a friend of mine and i had a great experience monday night at cut.  i started with a glass of champagne and we shared the <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark> salad with a champagne vinaigrette...simple, but delicious.  we both enjoyed the wagyu beef filet and it was melt in your mouth good, but very rich.  we shared the creamed spinach and mac 'n cheese sides...both of which were sinfully good too.  i don't think you can go wrong at cut.  however, this place isn't cheap, so come prepared to spend a mini fortune for this culinary treat!", 
            "if you are steak lover and visiting las vegas you must give this place a try. i had the honor of dining here with several friends. wow! what more can you ask for as a steak lover. i have to say you are going to be paying a lot for your meat. it's worth it all the way. i used to be big fan of mastor's until i came here. hands down the best steak money can buy.\n\nif you are a person who loves great meat and outstanding dishes. what more can you ask for as a steak lover.  it's worth it all the way. i used to be big fan of mastor's until i came here. if you are from ny and love keens steakhouse in manhattan then you need to long no place else.\n\ni highly recommend the bone in filet to the 8 ounce kobe steak. if you are looking for great starters i would get pink fiji peach salad or the <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark>. for side dished i would highly creamed spinach and roasted brussels sprouts. leave room for desert. the banana cream pie or the baked alaska pear.\n\nservice 10+\nquality 10+", 
            "my husband and i had dinner at cut friday evening.  it was truly one of the best steak and steakhouse experiences we have ever had, and we tend to dine at fine steakhouses pretty often.  the service was impeccable and the waitstaff was well versed in both the menu and the ipad wine list.  we shared a <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark> salad to start.  we both chose the american wagyu and each steak was seasoned and cooked to perfection.  one of the managers stopped by with great information about the side sauces and which would compliment our steaks best.  the beef was absolutely melt in your mouth amazing!  we decided on creamed spinach with an <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> on top, which the server quickly chopped and folded into the vegetable before serving. also incredible.  we ended with espresso and the tangerine baked alaska.  what a great twist on a classic dessert and it was yummy!!  we never felt rushed yet always felt like we were attended to when we needed something.  it was a pleasure dining here and i would recommend cut to anyone looking for a great dinner in vegas.", 
            "overall, the service and food were good. however, for the price you pay and the caliber i would expect from wolfgang puck, i was disappointed in the reason you go to a steakhouse: the meat! i'll start with the pros, though:\n\npros: excellent service. i had to wait for my party in the cocktail area and was promptly served bar snacks like duck confit popcorn, homemade salt and vinegar chips, olives, and a glass of wine. after we were seated, the waitstaff was very attentive, took care of all of my food allergies, and we were served in a timely manner.\n\nthe sides and appetizers were incredible. the crab louie, <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark> salad, mushrooms, and creamy polenta were among our favorites. the cocktails and wine list were excellent as well. it was the best cosmo we had the entire trip and the best pinot noir!\n\ncons: the steak. i don't get it. it's a steakhouse and when you're paying $85+ for a wagyu steak, you'd expect top notch preparation. our steaks tasted like lighter fluid. it was pittsburgh style, so it was charred on the outside, but <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> of being searing in butter, it just tasted like gasoline. i didn't even finish my 8 oz filet and neither did others in our party. \n\noverall, i was disappointed, especially considering i frequent the cut in beverly hills quite often. i would try another steak house (of which there are numerous in the palazzo/venetian alone!).", 
            "more of a 4 1/2!  been here a few times and always excellent.  service, even in the bar. is second to none.  had the indian spiced short rib and it's to die for.  so aromatic you can't believe it.  the carrots as a side are nice as well.  they give you so many snacks in the lounge area of the bar - popcorn, olives, miso peas, nuts, small bready pastries and tiny dessert assortment after dinner.  awesome!  also had the <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark> salad and it was very good.  the pretzel and five grain breads were amazing.  had their version of an old fashioned and it was good but i have had better.  a ketel one with three olives was tasty and a 20 year tawny to finish up the meal.  really enjoyed it.  will go back.", 
            "my overall 4 stars in a combination of 3 for food and 5 for service.\n\ncut is a very handsome restaurant and has a real \"high end\" feel to it. the front desk staff were very pleasant and welcoming. \n\ntheir wine list is extensive and you will find something you like. for dinner i started with the <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark> with <mark>Point Reyes Blue Cheese</mark> and champagne vinaigrette. it was outstanding and unfortunately the best part of the meal. for my main i had the petite <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark>. it was good but not outstanding. no sides for me but i had to order the valrhona chocolate souffle. again, it was good but not memorable. i had to return my espresso as it had an odd taste to it. they gladly took it back as i then requested a black coffee.\n\nmy 5 stars for service is based upon sam being my server. he was outstanding from beginning to end. i noticed he pampered all of his guests. he really made me feel like a vip and cut is lucky to have him.\n\nfood was fine -  service was excellent. i would return and give the food another shot-as long as sam was my server!"

            "ok, so here's how last friday goes, i hit the airport, taxi to the hotel, drop my stuff in the room and hit the tables.  for about an hour i had a killer run at blackjack and craps and decided to cash in my winnings and treat myself to a first rate steak.  i see cut online, and though i'd usually classify the place a bit too expensive, i figure \"hey, we're eating on the house's money tonight!\"  so we walk over to the palazzo and settle in for some beef.\n\ni started out with the <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> appetizer.  the avocado was perfect, the tuna was succulent, just a very good appetizer all around.  my entree with the kobe style filet and the yukon gold potatoes with the bernaise sauce.  the steak was cooked perfectly, tender and juicy but not overly charred on the outside.  the 6oz cut was just right.  the bernaise sauce was thick, but just seemed a little flat in flavor.  something was missing, but it surely was no distraction from the meal.  the potatoes were a home run, light yet buttery... oh so good!  i had the strawberry shortcake dessert.  again, good, but not great.\n\ni should give a tip of the cap to the barkeeps there.  i had a couple of very fine manhattans there, and i can't think of a better cocktail to compliment a fine steakhouse meal.  many bartenders don't seem to know how to make a manhattan, so it's always good to get one done right.", 
            "went with a party of 7 on a monday night.  service was outstanding..it felt like we had 2 waiters per person!  i sat on the end so i got to see the waiters serve wine, prepare someone's lobster from shell to plate, refill voss sparkling and still water, etc...\namuse: cheese puffs...nothing special.\ncocktail: can't remember the name, but it was citron, sweet n sour, limoncello and amaretto..with a cinnamon-rimmed glass...soo good\nwine: bottle of red, yummy- not sure what is was because it was picked out before i arrived, went well with beef of course\nbreads: choice of pretzel, onion focaccia, pumpernickel, and sourdough. i went with pretzel - very soft and yummy, but not warm.\nappetizer: <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark>...super delicious reddest tuna i have seen, covered in beautiful avocado slices and masago, with 4 corners of plate covered with baby sliced radishes and cucumbers, ginger, wasabi, and kaiware sprouts + togarashi toasts\nentree: the disappointment of the evening.  i ordered the 8-hour slow-cooked kobe beef short ribs \"indian style\" - served on pureed mint \"raita\" and corn puree.  the curry sauce was wayyyyy too strong...ruined the meat flavor and made it hard to stomach.  the meat was cooked well but really, i could barely touch it.  i know it is a steakhouse so i probably should have gotten a steak, but my stomach didn't agree with that idea so i went with something easier to chew :)\nsides: i picked out the <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> and shisito peppers which i thought were amazing.  i also really liked the cavatappi mac n cheese, and the <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>.  didn't try the fries.  the sauteed spinach and polenta were tasteless.\ndessert: ice cream sandwich with cherry coke float (i only tried the float) and bruleed banana cream pie (i had some banana with chocolate caviar crisp things, that much of it was tasty).\nthe servers brought out more little rectangular bars that i had no room for, but one was \"upscale snickers,\" key lime pie, and chocolate fudge.\nservice: very thorough.  intimidating when sides came out as each side had a waiter bombarding each person at the table with \"do you want some of this?\"  water was refilled asap, and all of the servers knew who had sparkling and who had still.  when cocktails were finished, the glasses were removed quickly.  servers were friendly, information on each steak was provided before we ordered, and the waiters made sure we knew what sides were ordered when it was our turn so we could get something else for the table.\nother: the other person who ordered short ribs didn't like them either.  the lady who ordered lobster said it took so long for the server to take it from shell to plate that it was very cold.  also, they delivered 4 types of mustard and did not explain who or what they were for, but charged for other sauces.\nsummary: i would return as everything but my entree was flavorful and the service was decent.  the drinks were great too.  i would probably work out for 8 hours and fast so i could fit a steak in, but at least my kobe was tender - if it was just in the mint and corn purees and without the curry i bet it would have been simple and fantastic.", 
            "to start, most the negative reviews i've read on here are written by people who don't know about high-quality steak. it's supposed to be marbled with fat -- that's where you get the flavor. and it's supposed to be charred dark on the outside -- it's not burnt but quickly charred to keep the flavor & juiciness in. \n\nthat said, our meal at cut was one of the best dining experiences we've had in a very long time, if not ever.\n\nfirst, we got a great big booth, just the 2 of us, and the atmosphere is very nice -- modern, hip -- even the music is classic rock. i love the little pedestal sinks in the bathroom, and he loved the dining room chandeliers.\n\na breadstick basket with cheese sticks arrived -- delicious -- followed by the best gougeres (cheese puffs) i've ever had. they were made of/in puff pastry, which is unusual, & so good. then, after we ordered, the bread tray with fantastic pretzel bread & focaccia, which we devoured, knowing damn well the meal would be filling. and, oh, it was.\n\nhe had the <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> with avocado on top -- a healthy & delicious portion of both. i had thinly slices asparagus on brioche with a soft-boiled egg & bacon vinagrette on top -- oh my god, it was amazing. i absolutely devoured it. all the flavors came together and made for orgasmically explosive bites.\n\nthen his dry-aged 16-oz bone-in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> & my <mark>Double Thick Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark>. both were thick, juicy, moist, cooked just right, and fantastic. our <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark> on the side were a bit superfluous, but, dipped in panko, we had to eat them cautiously so as not to fill up on such deliciousness. \n\nsomehow, we made room for dessert, and good thing. best chocolate souffle i've ever had -- served in its own little sauce pan. his apricot/blackberry crumble, with a shortbread crumble, wasn't so bad either. :)\n\nas for service, it was perfect. it was timed just right so that we got our appetizers pretty quickly but had some time to digest before dinner. the servers were all attentive, and there were many of them, and the presentation was fantastic, very old-world steakhouse elegant with tableside presentation, dishes all served simultaneously, and everything presented just right. he also loved his martini with blue-cheese-stuffed olives. both our wines were great. a little pricey by the glass, but that was no surprise.\n\nwe were a little hesitant to try cut because a) it's not so cheap, and b) wolfgang puck has spread himself a bit thin over the last 10+ years, and some restaurants have suffered because of it.\n\ncut is not one of those restaurants.", 
            "there's a couple of things to mention first: \n1.  i don't tend to like wolfgang puck restaurants - at least not since dining at spago in the mid 90s.  he puts his name on a lot and i don't know that he pays attention to any of his endeavors.\n2.  we can be food snobs - we live in san francisco and visit vegas frequently.  we have dined in many fine restaurants over time.  we always have high expectations in restaurants where the per head bill is over $100.\n\nso what was our verdict?  while we had very high expectations, we were not prepared to be totally blown away, which is what happened.\n\nit really was a perfect evening.  the service, which is done in teams without anyone missing a beat, was incredibly attentive but not intrusive.  the food was superlative.  the atmosphere was hip, modern and pleasant.  \n\nto start, don't fill up on the bread - and there's lots of it - from parmesan covered breadsticks, to cheese in puff pastry, to the bread basket with pretzels, breads and foccacia, you can make a meal of the bread.\n\nthe food was also not as expected.  it's hard to put inventive twists on normal dishes, but they managed to do so.  the <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> had unique flavors, came with great toast crisps and wasabi aoili.  it also had beautiful slices of avocado on top and presented as a perfect terrine.  normally portions for appetizers, particularly raw tuna, are very small - this was not.  and the taste was outstanding.  i had <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> the previous night at another great restaurant and it didn't compare.\n\nthe asparagus salad was so nicely presented it was almost a shame to cut into it.  each of the very thin, tender asparagus spears were perfectly lined up on a piece of brioche with a perfectly cooked poached egg gently placed on top.  \n\ni had the dry aged nebraska <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> (boneless) 16 oz.  it was a beautiful piece of meat, perfectly char grilled medium rare and with very little fat.  it was juicy, tender and perfect.  my wife had the korobuta <mark>Double Thick Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark>.  korobuta pork is the kobe beef of pork.  it was also moist, juicy and tasted great.  our sides?  fingerling potatoes with bacon confit and <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>.  both of them were perfect, but the <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark> were phenomenal.  \n\nnow my wife is a chocolate snob - she has very high standards for chocolate desserts.  she was driven to orgasmic delight by the chocolate souffle.  i, who don't like chocolate all that much, thought it was great too.\n\ni had trouble deciding between the lemon filled doughnuts and peach/blackberry crumble with 50 bean vanilla ice cream.  the waitress steered me towards the crumble and it was wonderful... they bring it out in a hot metal baking dish and spoon it into a bowl at the table.\n\nwe found out why the waitress steered me away from the doughnuts... it was my birthday and they brought me out a birthday dessert sampler which had, among other things, a lemon custard filled doughnut... the waitress was great about not spoiling the surprise and allowing me to enjoy both desserts i wanted.  \n\nso some final thoughts: \n1.  don't go if you aren't prepared for a very expensive evening - it's not cheap.  if the price tag will ruin your experience then this isn't the place for you.\n2.  the wait staff was excellent.  we were never steered to the most expensive items, she listened to what we told her our tastes were and made recommendations based on that.\n3.  if you have a martini, the <mark>Point Reyes Blue Cheese</mark> stuffed olives are incredible.\n4.  there is a big difference between wet aged, dry aged and kobe beef.  they explained very well all the differences and will help guide you to a great experience if you let them.  let them know your preferences in seasoning as well as in flavor and cooking style.  they really will try to do it your way...\n5.  a la carte is what every steakhouse does.  as annoying as it is, cut isn't the only one to do it.  if a la carte will bother you, then this may not be the place for you.  \n6.  this is both a great place for a romantic dinner and a great place for a group get together.  \n7.  this is a great place to just go and enjoy a fine meal and let the troubles of the world (and the losses at the tables) melt away.  go and enjoy!", 
            "the first few times we came here, it was delicioso! my bf always gets the japanese wagyu and i get the filet because it's a little healthier for me. i looove the bread they bring out in the beginning, a walnut and focaccia bread. my bf loves the cheese bread balls. we usually get seconds on bread. they bring out the meat so you can see the different types of cut, this is the only restaurant i've seen do this. the ambiance and decor is very modern and trendy and the service is good. you share the sides, and we normally go with a large party so we are able to order mac/cheese (which is the favorite), <mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark>, mushrooms, and a bunch of others. my favorite appetizer is the <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark>. \n\nbe sure to look at the wine list because we ordered 2 $700 bottles of wine thinking they were the regular bottles and not a limited edition one. most of the desserts are fabulous. definitely a great steakhouse that offers kobe beef.", 
            "this was my first time at cut and i was hesitant on coming here to begin with. i wanted a more up beat, hip ambiance as my friends and i are all in the 26-30 age range. the restaurant was very loungy and quiet, not loud or high energy. \nwe waited about 15 mins for a table although we had reservations which was fine since we lounged at the bar. \nthey bring out raw cuts of meat to show you the difference which i thought was cool. i started with the <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> which was excellent. my best friend had the kobe beef sashimi which was super salty. easy on the soy sauce chef! our friend had a seafood platter that they forgot to put in so it took awhile, and the crab had way too much mayonnaise.\nfor my entree i went with the $75 6 oz american <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark>.  the filet was excellent and the sauce on the side brought out the flavors of the meat. for a side i picked the cream of spinach with the egg. the flavor of the spinach was good but just didnt go great with my steak. my bill was $150 and i didnt even have a cocktail. oh and they are slick they charge for water unless you specify you want tap water. the steak was the higlight, but the place was over priced the ambiance sucked and i wouldnt go back. \ni hear 9ne at the palms has excellent food and is way more fun, i'll go there next time.", 
            "this place serves meat that's more tasty and tender than a grilled newborn. \n\ni went with a friend of mine and we gorged out. we started with the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> ($19). that was served with a little bit of greens, absolutely delicious. we also got the <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> appetizer ($22); it was served with wasabi aioli, avocado, ginger, wonton strips. delicious, high quality. paired the appetizers with a good macallan 18 ($25) and we were in heaven.\n\nfor my main course, i got the 10 oz american wagyu/kobe beef <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> ($80). it was cooked a perfect medium rare, served with a side of <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> ($12) and cauliflower ($12).  paired that with the cut trace manhattan (buffalo trace whiskey, standard manhattan, $14) and i was in heaven.\n\ndessert looked like too much, i couldn't do it. dinner came out to around $275 for the two of us with our 25% off as locals. delicious meal, a+, high on my list, would go again in a heartbeat.", 
            "one call down to the concierge and i was able to snag a 5:30pm reservation to wolfgang's cut. we walked in and were promptly seated. once seated we were given menus and asked for our drinks.\n\nthe decor is very nice and simple, beautiful tables and swivel chairs!!! that's probably because after you're done eating, you just wanna turn to you're side and get up. while waiting for our waiter, we were offered a variety of things to munch on.\n\n1. parmesean bread sticks- great crisp texture and nice cheesy taste.\n2. some kind of deep fried cheese ball- also tasted good but we let them sit for a while so they were a little cold.\n\nwe got our water glasses filled and were offered the wine list. we picked out a 2000 bordeaux and proceeded to order our meal.\n\nwe decided on 2 appetizers and two sides. the appetizers were:\n\nkobe steak sashimi- wow, this was great. possibly the most tender and flavorful piece of beef i have ever eaten. the radish adds a great texture and went very well with the spicy saucy stuff at the bottom.\n\n<mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark>, wasabi aioli, ginger, togarashi crisps, tosa soy- this was good, the aioli was excellent and the togarashi chips were wonderful. overall a very successful appetizer.\n\nonce the appetizers were finished, the steaks came out. i go tthe bone in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> prepared rare. also with my steak, i got the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>!! i will tell you that it was one of the best cuts of meat i've ever eaten. it was cooked perfectly and had a great crust on it. the meat was very tender and well seasoned. the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> on top was a wonderful addition to my steak. eaten alone it was very fatty and rich, but eat it with a bite of the steak and it was heavenly. also, went very well with the bordeaux.\n\nonce the steaks were set down, our sides came out. we opted for:\n\ncreamed spinach with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>- best spinach i have ever eaten in my life. it was creamy with bits of egg white and egg yolk in it. they cook the egg over easy and break/mix the egg into the spinach table side! yummmmy!\n\n<mark>Soft Polenta with Parmesan</mark>- this was good but the spinach was so damn good, i didn't really pay much attention to it :d i just know it was good!\n\nvery nice place to eat if you like steak! i'll probably be back, maybe to the one in la.", 
            "this was my second dinner at cut, and the thought of going back gave me a gigantic mental erection.\n\nwent this time with two friends. i started with the trace manhattan cocktail, they had a beer and some kind of delicious pumpkin martini. for apps, we went with the <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark>, the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, and the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan. superb!\n\ni once again went with the 10 oz american wagyu/kobe <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark>, medium rare. got a side of <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> and japanese shishito peppers, alongside the brussel sprouts. \n\nyou can read my other review for more detail on the dishes; it was another incredibly delicious meal and i can't wait to go back. it is pricy, though, so make sure you're okay with spending big bucks on a great dinner. worth every penny, but be warned.", 
            "this is my second visit to cut steakhouse, i had previously visited the beverly hills location. this time, it was the las vegas location (in the palazzo) that was going to have to try and match my prior experience, and i have to say, they exceeded my expectations. my three friend who also were with my for our guys weekend in vegas also thought this was the best steakhouse they have ever been to as well.\n\nonce again, the atmosphere is very modern for a steakhouse, but i like that, its nice for a change. the staff is tremendous, but this is no shock for a restaurant of this caliber. i can't comment on the sommelier because i selected are wine, but he did present it very professionally (did the whole little swirl in each glass pre-pour trick).... have to love excess. for appetizers, we orders some type of <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark> salad which was very good and a couple of the <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> appetizers, and this is by far one of the best tartar's i have ever had. i essentially forced my table to order a couple of these because of how much i enjoyed it last time i had it (they also loved it). this  may not seem like enough for four men in vegas, but that leads me to the bread. our table easily consumed 5  focaccia loafs, 6 pretzel loafs, and 3lbs of butter....i don't think i need to say anymore on the quality of the bread. everyone ordered ny strip's, mine was from nebraska, and once again, it is the best steak i have ever had (their seasoning/rub is out of this world). no dessert for us... we were too full.\n\nafter my second visit i can comfortably say two things: 1) this is my favorite steakhouse and 2) i hope to god they are going to build one in chicago.", 
            "my husband and i splurged for a high end dining experience at cut last night.  i had heard much about it and were looking forward to seeing if the hype lived up to the expectations.  overall, food and wine were excellent but the price would probably keep us from going back soon.\n\nfor appetizers, my husband chose the <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> and i had the <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark> salad with avocado, bleu cheese and a herb champagne vinagrette.   after we ordered the waiter informed us these were two of the most popular and i can see why. both were fantastic.  the waiter brought around 4 different types of fresh bread.  i had the onion focaccia which was excellent, and my husband the sourdough which was also good.\n\nfor the main course, i had selected the 6 oz american wagyyu <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark>, and my husaband selected the petite <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> cut, both prepared medium rare.  my husband thought his was a bit overseasoned with pepper, but i thought his tasted good.  my steak was excellent, one of the best i have ever had.  but $75 for 6 oz is a lot of $$.  i think most people who probably eat here aren't necessarily concerned about prices. the steaks come with three types of mustard for dipping, two of which were excellent.  we also go the <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> (by far the best of all the sauces) and a herb shallot red <mark>Shallot-Red Wine Bordelaise</mark> that was tasty also.  all sauces are served on the side so that you can try a variety. \n\nour sides were the mac and cheese and creamed spinach with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>.  both were excellent.  the egg gave the creamed spinach a really nice texture, and the mac and cheese was a bit of a twist on an old staple.\n\nwe were stuffed so didn't order dessert, although they gave us some small bites of lemon and chocolate bars which were just enough and tasted excellent.  \n\noverall this was a great dinner, but we ended up spending over $400 on just the two of us, so it would be hard to justify going again.", 
            "many restaurants tout fusion sensibilities, but puck's concept truly blends influences from his native austria, france, japan, america and elsewhere. almost painfully serious about beef, servers here bring out a platter of raw kobe and wagyu cuts before you order, to show the differences in the meat. \n\nyour taste buds may not be as sensitive as your eyes, though: we actually preferred the 21 day wet-aged illinois prime bone-in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> to the american wagyu/angus <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark>. cut's ample offerings also include several 35 day dry aged nebraska prime as well as true japanese waygu (kobe) choices (all are grilled over hard wood & charcoal then finished under the broiler). \n\nin fact, cut's menu seems overly eager to please (or overwhelm) with an excess of options in starters (12 the night we visited), side dishes (13), desserts (7) and even sauces (8), though many were excellent, including the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> \"sandwiches\" with wasabi aoli and bar menu's knishes and kobe sliders; and <mark>Wasabi-Yuzu Kosho Butter</mark> and <mark>Cognac & Whole Grain Mustard</mark> were both remarkable. but the creamed spinach topped with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> was almost too rich and the potato tart tatin was mostly just big and bland. the deconstructed nectarine and plum crumble, served with a house-made \"50 bean\" vanilla ice cream was nice, but far too big a portion to end such a meal.\n \na nice selection of original and classic cocktails, but their wine list is a bit pretentious and overpriced ($15 for a glass of argentinian malbec? really? i'd pay that much for a magnum of it in the store)\n\nin short, cut has one of my favorite lounges on the strip (sexy, sleek, just dark enough, fitting for either romance or business rendevous), some fantastic appetizers, and a great cocktail menu. cut has one of my least favorite dining rooms on the strip (like an 80s office, stiff and steely), and good meat--but not quite as good as their orgiastic presentation lends you to expect. i didn't dislike it, but was not wowed as much as i have been at craftsteak, carnevino, and even boa, all in the same price range. \n\np.s. at these prices, you can afford to make the sauces complimentary.", 
            "client dinner a few nights back and i waited to post as i had a tough time justifying the price paid to the food. yes, it's vegas and yes its a puck restaurant however, i left dinner feeling unsatisfied. right from the bar and the pre dinner drink through the end of the meal i felt that i was hanging on the edge of something great but it never pushed over the top. the highlight of the <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> was the togarashi crisps. the blue crab & louisiana shrimp \"louis\" cocktail, spicy tomato-horseradish was a. not spicy and b. had a hellmann's mayo flavor that took over. the steaks were perfectly cooked but was my biggest disappointment. i went with the the usda prime nebraska corn fed <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> and sampled the american wagyu which my colleagues had ordered. my <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> just lacked flavor, plain and simple. on the side we shared the potato tarte tatin, broccolini & cavatappi pasta, \"mac & cheese\", quebec cheddar. none was anything special, nor should have they been as the show here needed to be the steak. the restaurant was well appointed and definitely offered a modern look to the classic steakhouse. \n\ni was and still am left without that satisfaction one gets after a great steak dinner. i will be filling that void soon", 
            "had dinner here on saturday night and have to say that cut has made its way to the #1 spot on my \"vegas steakhouse\" list. \n\nthe service was exceptional. we had two servers that catered to us completely. it was almost as if they were standing table-side the entire meal, but they weren't. they were just *that* good. \n\nspeaking of *that* good - the food was more than exceptional. it was downright stupid. porterhouse for two, kobe filet and bone-in ny strip made their way to our table. as did <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark>, asparagus with a poached egg and warm bacon vinaigrette on toasted brioche along <mark>Hand Cut French Fries with Herbs</mark> french fries, mac and cheese, caramelized sweet corn and creamed spinach. \n\nthink we were full by the end of the meal? this was absolutely worth every single calorie.   the desserts looked fabulous, but we just couldn't do it.  \n\nloved the ambiance, the lighting and even the swivel chairs. \n\ncut, i can't wait to see you again. \n\nxoxo.",

            "so torn between 4 and 5 here so, give cut a 4.5.  went there with a group for my birthday dinner on an early november trip and was really looking forward to it.  overall, was not disappointed at all.  i started with the <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> appetizer and it was really delicious.  ultra fresh chopped tuna, topped with some thinly sliced avocado and pressed into a circular mold.  not sure what exactly the sauce drizzled about the plate was but, it matched the tuna perfectly.  as i sampled tastes from everyone else's plates, it was clear that all the dishes were very well conceived.\n\nthere are a number of aged cuts of prime beef from a variety of sources.  i chose a 28 day (i think!) dry aged ny strip from nebraska.  while it was very flavorful, this is where the .5 knockdown comes.  just a wee bit past the medium rare i ordered.  at these prices and with wolfgang puck's name attached one certainly expects absolute perfection and this was a very slight misstep.  normally, i would have sent it back but, we  were trying to make a 9:30 show so, that was not an option.\n\noverall, i would not hesitate to return although i think next trip, i'll keep trying some of the other pricey steak joints in vegas.  what the hey.... i like variety!", 
            "everything is good. and i say this because we nearly got everything offered on the menu!\n\ni split a porterhouse steak and ordered it extra rare. it was basically seared on both sides with an extremely cool (so, yeah almost cold / raw!) center. it melted in my mouth like butter. i sampled my friend's rare american kobe <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> and declared it *overcooked*. how can i ever go back to having normal steaks again? sigh.\n\nlet's see....mac and cheese, delicious. polenta, my favorite side. brussel sprouts, blue crab & shrimp louis cocktail, <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark>...all exceptional. the kobe beef sashimi was freaking out of this world and i would probably kill someone for another bite of the date cake. oh and did i mention the <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark>? it's heaven in a dish. normally my appetite wanes after a few drinks but even after 4 umami's, i managed to clean my plate, sample our 5 desserts and polish off a cheese plate. can you say gluttony? \n\nthe service was really attentive, and everyone was so nice and accommodating. a definite must-do in vegas!", 
            "excellent service!!!\n\nhad a 6:30pm reservations for christmas eve and was placed at the best seat in the house. we overlook the entire dining area, had a table for 6, for us two, in an area with huge dining table and lounge-y corner... love it!!\n\nthe waiters are super helpful and  knowledgeable about the menu. very good at explaining the meat cuts and were very attentive... definitely one of the best service we have had in a very long time!\n\nfor food, we ordered the kobe beef sashimi, <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark>, my bf had the steak tasting and i had the american wagyu mignon... and to top off we had <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> and <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> as side... \n\neverything was wow, the <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> had avocado on top which really works well and kobe sashimi.. yum!!!.... the steaks were really good, melts and yummy.....except the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> makes the steak a little too greasy (personal choice, shouldn't have gotten it! but that's my thought).... lastly we got the banana creme pie... never had it, but loved it... we got 1 to share, should have really gotten 2!! haha.... \n\nwish wolfgang opens up cut in nyc!!! would love to make another visit!!", 
            "great steaks! seasoned and cooked perfectly.  we ordered the steak sampler, <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark>, <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark>, and the kobe.  fantastic flavors to share.  loved the <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark>!", 
            "cut was pretty good, but not amazing.  we ordered the american wagyu steaks, and they were good, but overdone (more medium than midrare, as ordered).  i was also surprised that the presentation was not better.  we essentially got a steak on a big white plate.  sides came in a white bowl.  was surprised to have to pay for water for the table, but was the cheapest part of the meal :)  food was pretty good, but i wouldn't say it was the best steak i've ever had.  <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> appetizer was phenomenal.\n\nservice was outstanding, probably the best i've ever had.  they brought a wrong side, and gave it to us free, and quickly brought out what we had ordered.\n\nso you have idea of price....it ended up being nearly $500 for two people, including a $120 bottle of wine, one appetizer, two steaks, two sides, two bottles of water, and $75 tip.  no dessert.",

            "cut is the vegas experience in a nutshell: impeccable service, amazing food and drink selection, and a dent in your wallet that will leave you longing for more. \n\nright before your order is taken, your waiter/waitress will bring by a platter of steaks wowing you with words such as \"wagyu\", \"kobe\" and \"marbling\". this, is marketing/entertainment at its pinnacle. from the display platter, you will clearly be impressed with how well the australian waygu marbles, even in comparison to its american counterpart. while i \"settled\" for the american wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, the buttery texture and the sweet yet savory flavor of the meat was better than steak i've had previously.\n\nthe service was excellent. our waiter was witty, but not chatty, and apparently has a photographic memory of the wikipedia page on waygu beef. \n\nthe setting was spacious yet extremely intimate. we were seated in one of the side booths, which could have easily sat a party of 6. the booth was filled with plush pillows. food coma? no problem, simply take a nap and continue eating afterwards. \n\nour order of two drinks, <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark>, one usda prime bone in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, one american wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, and one side of <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> and shishito peppers came out to $305, counting tax and tip.",

            "from beginning to end, our dinner at cut was amazing. the decor and ambiance are modern, sophisticated, and classy. the service was unparalleled. erin, the server, was helped by about 6 others and was so attentive without being pushy or intrusive. there were four of us at the table, and we each had two cocktails. the bartender is quite talented, and knew how to make our favorites as well as produce some of the more creative and refreshing drinks i've encountered. each was truly high quality and delicious.\n\nappetizers: we were served amuse bouches and various breads with butter - each was a fantastic mix of flavors. we ordered the burrata with prosciutto, melon and fig. cannot remember a better, more outstanding bite of food. and the <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark>, aside from being the best presentation i've seen of this dish, was also fresh, buttery, and delightful.\n\nwe all ordered the grass-fed <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark>. what a spectacular steak, expertly prepared and just lovely. the sides - spinach with garlic, roasted fingerling potatoes with bacon, and mac-and-cheese were elegant, tasty, and complemented the steaks perfectly.\n\ndessert (can't remember, however!) was also wonderfully presented and served, and a great end to our dinner.\n\nif you are in las vegas and looking to have a luxurious, satisfying experience, try cut.", 
            "my boyfriend and i recently ate here for our anniversary. the service was great and very attentive. they offer complimentary parmesan bread sticks and delicious cheesy soft mini popovers at the beginning of your meal. you must not have too much or else you'll be too full for their prime steaks. \n\nwe ordered the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> and <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> appetizers which were delicious. we were also offered a variety of bread and i definitely recommend the pretzel knot; its sweet and salty.. so yummy! my boyfriend and i both ordered ny strip steak and it was cooked to perfection per our request. we were also offered a complimentary slice of banana cream cake with a sweet 'happy anniversary' message which was just the perfect ending to our meal.",

            "one of the best steaks that i have ever had. the service here is also top notch. the prices were comparable to a chain like morton's but i felt like the service was a notch better at cut. all of the waitstaff is very attentive and well trained such as asking if it is ok for them to cut the <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> that was on top of the asparagus appetizer. there was refilled water and wine before you could barely get through half of the glass. the staff earns every dollar of the gratuity here.\n\nfor an appetizer i ordered the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>. honestly, if they could have just loaded me up on that i would have been satisfied. it was very tender and flavorful. others in my party ordered the tuna tartar and the <mark>Warm Asparagus</mark>. if you're a sushi fan then the tartar is for you. the asparagus dish was different than i expected but very tasty.\n\nmy main course was the 12oz <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> cooked medium-rare. the steak rub used is a tad on the salty side but the tenderness and steak flavor is out of this world. for sides the table ordered the pureed potatoes and the creamed spinach w/ <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>. the all star here was the spinach. i liked the texture the <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> gave to the creamed spinach. \n\ndessert was banana cream pie. overall a very solid dessert but compared to the rest of the meal it was the weakest. if i go again i will probably get the chocolate souffl\\u00e9 <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark>. \n\nbe sure to make reservations and just relax and enjoy the service. save your allowance and treat yourself to a night at cut.\n\nalso, i was under the impression that one needed to dress up a tad for this place. that was not the case. we spotted at least a couple of people in shorts and a baseball cap. but of course their money spends the same as mine.", 
            "yes i'm a meat lover.  call me a caveman, i just love to eat a big juicy steak.   being in hawaii we are a little limited to steakhouses but i have been to most of them at least once.  morton's, hy's, dk's, ruth chris, and also other with steak like kincaids, shoreside grill, and even ruby tuesdays.  well, you get the jist.   i normally will opt for a <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> whenever possible and then maybe a ny or t-bone.  i like my meat to be juicy and have some fat so i normally don't get a filet.\n\nbeing we were heading out for vegas i wanted to have a date night with my wife and get a good steak.  i asked my friend, who is a seasoned chef.  he lived and worked in vegas for some years after grad-ing from the cia and working at the greenbrier among many other accomplishments both abroad and at home.  i figured he'd be the best person to ask for an honest opinion.  he recommended a few places we could try but said if given the choice we should go to cut.  that sealed it, cut it was.  i checked open table to see if i needed to book way ahead but it seemed like we should be fine booking a day in advanced.  great considering we hardly know where we will be in vegas day to day and hour to hour.  once we were out there and could plan our schedule, we were able to lock down a reservation that would work for us.\n\nwe headed out a little early not know how long it would take me to find the parking garage and not know how far we would have to walk to get from the parking to the restaurant.  cut is in the palazzo hotel.  parking was a breeze.  they had a guard asking where you were going so i guess maybe they restrict the parking to guest and customers.  we found a parking pretty close to the elevators which is amazing for a vegas casino.  needless to say we had some time to explore before going to the restaurant.\n\nwe had a reservation at 9 and got there about 10 minutes early.  they were pretty packed.  they didn't have a regular table open yet but did offer us a table off to the side in the lounge area.  we decided to wait for a regular table, not wanting to miss out on the whole steakhouse experience.  we did go to the bar to kill our 10 minutes.  one think that irritated me at the bar was when i asked the bartender what kind of beer they had he immediately stated that they don't carry anything domestic like bud light or coors.  did i f**king say that's what i wanted??  all he had to do was provide me their drink menu, which is on an ipad for customer use.  snooty bartender,  he should be happy i payed for those drinks with my total bill and didn't have to tip him separate.\n\nonce seated we had the best service.  our waiter was chip and from what we saw, he was probably the head waiter as he was directing most of the other workers as he did his job.  he was very knowledgeable about their menu offerings and offered in-depth descriptions about everything they served.\n\nthe menu was a head turner.  they had so many things that sounded delicious.  one of those places you wished you were with a large party so you could sample more.  we decided on the <mark>Warm Asparagus</mark>, poached <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>, warm bacon vinaigrette on a focaccia bread as our appetizer.  along with that we also got  to pick from their selection of homemade breads and also got a couple or long parmesan coated breadsticks and butter puffs, or something like that.\n\nfor the main dish my wife got the indian spiced kobe beef shortribs which they slow cook for 8 hours.  they were very succulent and rich.  they had a distinct indian flavor but not too overpowering.  it was also not very spicy at all.  the meat was so tender it was almost falling off the bone.  it was actually too much for my wife to finish.\n\nafter chip had explained the different lines of meats they carried i was sure i would need to get their sampler to get the best taste of what they had to offer.  i got their \"tasting of <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark> sampler\".  it came with a 4oz of snake river farms american \"kobe\" style beef, 4oz usda prime 35 day aged, and a 2oz of blackmore ranch australian wagyu.  it also came with a medley of different sauces and spices i could add to it.  none of which i needed to use.  they season their steaks with sea salt and black pepper.  it was seasoned perfectly so that the saltiness and pepper was not too overpowering and let the flavor of the beef shine through.  it tasted amazing.  and to be able to taste these 3 different lines of beef side by side really made it easy to see and taste the difference in quality.  all being top notch but clearly easy to rank.  might make me come back for more australian wagyu on a future trip.  we also got a side of their mac and cheese that was suggested by the waiter.  talk about rich and creamy, definitely a grown up mac and cheese.\n\nif you ever are in vegas and in search of a great steakhouse.  make sure to put cut on the shortlist.  you definitely won't be disappointed.  happy eats!", 
            "bar none, i had the best steak of my life here. now, i had to wrestle with the price, but after agreeing to paying $125 for waygu filet, i'm completely glad i had the gastronomique experience of a lifetime. a word to the wise. these waiters, bus people, wine stewards and hell, the receptionist are trained in the fine art of upselling. i thought a few of them must have been on commission! it's kinda ugly. our waiter copped an attitude when we wouldn't order the $264 bottle of wine. <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> we had the $70 malbec that was just great. the creamed spinach was a tad bit heavy with nutmeg and the <mark>Warm Asparagus</mark> salad is to die for too. all in all a terrific meal and i will go back for sure. just remember to bring your big fat wallet! $$$$$", 
            "what we ordered: \n1. kobe steak <mark>American Wagyu Beef Sashimi, Spicy Radishes</mark> - amazing dish, the highlight of the dinner! the meat was so buttery and the delicate asian flavors of the sauce was a perfect pairing.\n \n2. <mark><mark>Bone Marrow</mark> Flan, Mushroom Marmalade, Parsley Salad</mark> - very good but did not have that intense marrow flavor that i like. i also did not like the accompanying <mark><mark>Bone Marrow</mark> Flan, Mushroom Marmalade, Parsley Salad</mark> as it overpowered the flan. however when eaten by itself the parsley was a good palate cleanser. \n\n3. <mark>Warm Asparagus</mark>, poached <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>, warm bacon vinaigrette - nice salad very good flavor. hard to mess up a dish with those ingredients.\n\n4. nebraska corn fed <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> - not a very thick steak, which i always prefer. the crust was overpowering due to the amount of char. way too much char in my opinion.\n\n5. true japanese 100% wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> - thicker than the nebraska <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> but served in two pieces which i thought was odd. the meat was heavily marbled and very tender. the wagyu steak did not have a very meaty flavor, more relaxed and clean. again though, the charing on the crust proved too much. \n\n6. <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> - very good, recommended. creamy and buttery. \n\nthe service was excellent and the ambiance is very nice. we had a very large and comfortable booth. our sever was very professional and his support staff was very attentive. overall, a good experience but the prices are very high, be prepared to spend. the steaks were too heavily charred for me. almost ruined the high quality meat imho.", 
            "probably the best steak i have ever had in my entire life. seriously. and i'm not some rube who orders their steak medium well, and thinks ruth's chris is the end all for steaks. what we ordered:\n\nstarters: \n\n- <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark>, wasabi, ginger, togarashi crisps, tosa soy: \ndelicious, but i wouldn't say a \"must order\"\n\n- <mark>Warm Asparagus</mark>, poached <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>, warm bacon vinaigrette:\nsounds simple, right? well, a guy comes out, breaks the poached eggs for you and pours the warm bacon vinaigrette right there in front of you, so that it hits the asparagus just seconds before it combines and hits your mouth. it was delicious and i would recommend!\n\nentrees:\n\n- american wagyu beef <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> \n\n- true japanese 100% wagyu beef <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> \n\nmy boss and i decided to try the american wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> and the japanese wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, cut them in half, and share, so that we could compare the two. as a person who loves rich food, i must say that the japanese wagyu was actually a bit too fatty for me. \nour server had went over the differences of the meats before we ordered, and had indeed told us that the japanese wagyu was fatty, even bringing out various cuts of the raw steaks, showing us how the fat runs through this type of meat, so we weren't unprepared for it. \nmy american wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> was absolute perfection. i ordered it rare plus, as did my boss with his japanese cut. it was rich and perfectly fatty, in my opinion. the japanese cut, being more of a delicacy and more expensive, made sense to me, it just wasn't my preference. i have a friend who loves to eat the pure fat pieces that hang on the sides of meat.  i could see him totally loving the japanese wagyu.\n\nsides:\n\n-mac & cheese:\nphenomenal. i would believe that night it had truffle in it, and it was perfection. definitely an indulgence that you must try\n\n- curry spiced cauliflower:\nreally good, but i don't think the flavor profiles went well with everything else we ordered. \n\nour server was an absolute delight. i can't remember his name, but i think he said that he was originally from southern california. he looked about 30 with short brown hair and really knew what  he was talking about. if he or anyone from the restaurant is reading this, thank you. he made our experience wonderful. he had a great personality. \n\nthe ambiance in the restaurant is very lovely. sitting down, i immediately felt like i was in a high class establishment and would be in for a treat. overall, this was a heavenly experience that i hope i can take part in again someday!"

            "this place was fabulous. this place is comparable to alexander's steakhouse in cupertino which is my all time favorite. the <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> was fabulous. they bring a bread basket and ask what type of bread you would like. my suggestion: say \"all, please\". they were all very yummy. service was great, their drinks were great and service was excellent. my husband and i thought their sides were good - not excellent but good. definately check this place out when you are in vegas. apparently there is a cut in la that is really hard to get into. we went to this restaurant in early june and it wasn't very busy but i imagine they will start getting busy soon.", 
            "fantastic food.  i loved it.  the only thing i was eh about was that our waitress was really \"stiff.\"  but the food was amazing.  i had their <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> with the <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> and being the sauce junky that i am, i was won over at first dip.\n\nthe zinfandel they have on their list for wines by the glass was fantastic as well.  it's a definite must. \n\ni would recommend the zinfandel with either the steak, steak tartar, or braised short ribs in the indian spiced sauce.  if you have the appetite (and the budget) get all four!  \n\ntwo thumbs up to wolfgang's excellt restaurant.  thumbs down to the manager or whoever hires the staff because our waitress was kind of awkward and stiff, and as we all know, you eat at resturants partly for the food and partly for the service.", 
            "it definitely helps to have rooms comped in vegas so that you can spend the money on a nice dinner <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark>!\n\nwe had reservations for dinner (8/16/08) and right when we walked in, we immediately love the decor and ambiance. the place looks really nice and modern inside. the service was amazing. probably the best service i've ever had.\n\nour server was very helpful and they start off by showing the different cuts they have by bringing them to the table. so we decided to go with the kobe beef sashimi and american kobe filet and the 100% japanese wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>.now if you don't want to go with the kobe, the prices are actually really reasonable for a nice steakhouse. but if you want to splurge, definitely go with kobe. the japanese <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> was $180 for 8 ounces. the american kobe filet i believe was around $70-80.\n\nfirst the bread. the breads that they give you are really good. nice to munch on before your meal. we started off with the beef sashimi and it was definitely more than i expected. very plentiful in my opinion. i was expecting like very thing slices but the servings were very generous (maybe even a little too thick). i really enjoyed it. i think it was a perfect starter. we also ordered a side of the spinach. it was really good as it was almost soup like. the spinach was so finely chopped up but had a really good taste.\n\ni have to admit when you pay for a steak that costs $180 you want something big and juicy. what came was really small, but.. it was awesome!!! by far the most tender steak ive ever had. the way that the outside was charred perfectly but left the inside so tender and buttery was amazing. the same with the filet. the size of the steaks look small, but after finishing them, you definitely feel full. steak just doesn't taste the same anymore.\n\nnow for the price, for 2 steaks 1 side and 1 appetizer, after tax and tip, $350. well most of it was for the japanese kobe. would i pay $180 for it again, maybe. if it was $100, most definitely. but i can't argue that it was the best steak i've ever had. overall it's my favorite steakhouse so far.\n\nmaybe we shall visit it again this weekend =)\n\n***update***\n\n*the <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> carpacio was the best appetizer i've ever had. it's not cheap but it's pretty awesome!*", 
            "mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm... cut!\n\nwe shared the corn salad starter.  now, corn salad sounds so terribly unappealing to me - but it was the one salad the three of us could agree on.  so so so so good!  mmmmm.. corn salad!\n\nand then the bread tray.  i heart bread trays.  we sampled all the bread but my heart and my taste buds have pledged allegiance to the fresh baked, soft, doughy, salty pretzel bread.  the best thing ever.  so good.  the nice waiter actually put six of the pretzels in a container for us - which we snacked on the entire next day - just because we couldn't stop gushing about them.\n\nthere was a small cheese-puff amuse bouche that came out after the salad.  it was yummy.\n\nfor my main course i had the <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark>, cooked to perfection.  seriously.  perfect.  delicious.  wow.  i mean... wow!  what a great steak.\n\nwhile we each ordered sauce - i had the bearnaise (yum), my friend had the horseradish (good) and my sister had the <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> (a bit sweet for me) - we truly didn't need it... what your server doesn't tell you is that they will bring out various mustards - lavender, etc - and that the mustards are just as good as - if not better than - the sauces.\n\nservice was impeccable.  attentive but not in your face.\n\nmy cocktail was okay.  i think it was called a hemingway.  it didn't blow me away.  neither did the mille-feuille the three of us shared... it was okay, not great.  a let down, actually.  the cream was delicious but a mille-feuille translates - literally - into a thousand sheets.  as in \"lots of pastry.\"  and this had maybe 5 sheets.  maybe not.  i would have skipped the dessert and gone somewhere else.  finally, the sides were a mixed back.  the creamed spinach was good, but not great.  the <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> was tasteless... the peppers and mushrooms were deeeeelish.  please, do everyone a favor and order them.  mmmmm.\n\nso, 5 stars for theservice, the meat, the bread and the salad.\n\n4 stars for the sauces.\n\n3 stars for the cocktails and sides.\n\n2 stars for the dessert.\n\n4 stars overall... i'll be back, but i still prefer craftsteak and nero.", 
            "this was my first time at cut and i was hesitant on coming here to begin with. i wanted a more up beat, hip ambiance as my friends and i are all in the 26-30 age range. the restaurant was very loungy and quiet, not loud or high energy. \nwe waited about 15 mins for a table although we had reservations which was fine since we lounged at the bar. \nthey bring out raw cuts of meat to show you the difference which i thought was cool. i started with the <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> which was excellent. my best friend had the kobe beef sashimi which was super salty. easy on the soy sauce chef! our friend had a seafood platter that they forgot to put in so it took awhile, and the crab had way too much mayonnaise.\nfor my entree i went with the $75 6 oz american <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark>.  the filet was excellent and the sauce on the side brought out the flavors of the meat. for a side i picked the cream of spinach with the egg. the flavor of the spinach was good but just didnt go great with my steak. my bill was $150 and i didnt even have a cocktail. oh and they are slick they charge for water unless you specify you want tap water. the steak was the higlight, but the place was over priced the ambiance sucked and i wouldnt go back. \ni hear 9ne at the palms has excellent food and is way more fun, i'll go there next time.", 
            "i am a huge fan of high end steakhouses and had to make sure i tried out cut. i've heard a lot of positive reviews from friends about wolfgang's steakhouse. this really hyped me up when i booked reservations for the location at the venetian. the decor is very modern and feels really elegant. it sure is pricey here but it's known beforehand and wolfgang's name is attached to this place. the bar area had a huge selection and the bartender helped us choose out wine. we actually got a free glass of the moscato dasti'(also my new favorite dessert wine). it was a monday so they place was pretty empty, but the service was excellent. they brought out 4 different kinds of bread. all we amazing and worth trying. \n\ni ordered the <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> and my gf ordered the <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark>. we also got the mashed potatoes and side of the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>. the filet was really good and it just melted down my throat. the mashed potatoes were okay came out a bit cold had to tell them to heat it up a bit. the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> which all my friends recommended me to try, was certainly something i have never ordered. it's like a piece of fat that feels like flan. if you like fat then you'll surely love the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>. that texture was a bit off for me. i do recommend this to fans of high end steakhouses. next up for me is harris in sf, peter luger in ny, and boa.", 
            "my husband and i splurged for a high end dining experience at cut last night.  i had heard much about it and were looking forward to seeing if the hype lived up to the expectations.  overall, food and wine were excellent but the price would probably keep us from going back soon.\n\nfor appetizers, my husband chose the <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> and i had the <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark> salad with avocado, bleu cheese and a herb champagne vinagrette.   after we ordered the waiter informed us these were two of the most popular and i can see why. both were fantastic.  the waiter brought around 4 different types of fresh bread.  i had the onion focaccia which was excellent, and my husband the sourdough which was also good.\n\nfor the main course, i had selected the 6 oz american wagyyu <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark>, and my husaband selected the petite <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> cut, both prepared medium rare.  my husband thought his was a bit overseasoned with pepper, but i thought his tasted good.  my steak was excellent, one of the best i have ever had.  but $75 for 6 oz is a lot of $$.  i think most people who probably eat here aren't necessarily concerned about prices. the steaks come with three types of mustard for dipping, two of which were excellent.  we also go the <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> (by far the best of all the sauces) and a herb shallot red <mark>Shallot-Red Wine Bordelaise</mark> that was tasty also.  all sauces are served on the side so that you can try a variety. \n\nour sides were the mac and cheese and creamed spinach with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>.  both were excellent.  the egg gave the creamed spinach a really nice texture, and the mac and cheese was a bit of a twist on an old staple.\n\nwe were stuffed so didn't order dessert, although they gave us some small bites of lemon and chocolate bars which were just enough and tasted excellent.  \n\noverall this was a great dinner, but we ended up spending over $400 on just the two of us, so it would be hard to justify going again.", 
            "wow.  high five to wolfgang puck for an exceptional dining experience - delicious food with professional & attentive service.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j4cath00yzrq8bne2s4_cw?select=g2-vnaqfscp9bn7z-xjvuq\nwhile waiting, we enjoyed various samples of bread - my favorite was the bavarian pretzel.  slightly salty, sweet, and an incredibly soft texture - divine.  \n\n\nprior to ordering, i loved that the waiter rolled out several variations of the raw cut beef to demonstrate the difference in kobe wagyu & american style wagyu (mixed with angus to give it a meatier texture).  \nmy entree was the <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> (usda illinois) served with the argentinian chimichirri sauce, a light and springy taste with shallots, garlic, and cilantro.  perfectly cooked at medium and absolutely delicious.  refrain from biting the screen:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j4cath00yzrq8bne2s4_cw?select=yxcijyzzvh7cb9vr-cifgg \nthe fiance also loved his american wagyu rib-eye with <mark>Wasabi-Yuzu Kosho Butter</mark> sauce.  while part of the meat was slightly tough, the thicker end of the rib-eye melted in my mouth.  it's not necessary to order an additional sauce with your meat, since they also bring out three condiments for you to use anyhow.  \n\ni do recommend sharing the sides family style with a group - at about $12/side, you get a significant amount of delicious fare.  our group of four split three sides: the delicious creamy mac & cheese with quebec cheddar, the sauteed <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark>, and the butternut squash.  all were incredibly savory!  the best and most amusing part of the dinner was that we had three waiters (one per side dish) hovering next to us individually to explain what the dish was and proceeded to scoop it onto our plate before shuffling to the next person - it felt like culinary musical chairs.  if fighting over equal portions of a dish is an issue, this eliminates that problem...\n\nambiance is very modern and sleek.  it is pretty dim, but it wasn't too bothersome for us.  similar to the sauce, ordering dessert isn't necessary since they brought out a plate with decadent filled chocolates.  an exquisite way to end a satisfying and indulgent meal.", 
            "the hottie and i have been meaning to try cut for awhile.  we finally went on our last trip to vegas.  based upon the reviews we started with the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan.  it was simply one of the best dishes i've ever had anywhere.  then, we decided to get the porterhouse steak for two.  caveat.... the waiter told us that we are supposed to order the steak one notch rarer than we normally would like it because they let the steak sit for 10 minutes after its done so it will cook a bit more.  since the hottie and i are both medium rare people, we ordered the porterhouse rare.  it looked and smelled amazing when the steak finally came to the table!  truthfully, i thought the steak was kinda in between rare and medium rare.  but the <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> portion may have been the best <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> i've had.  so tender, so juicy, with a flavorful crisp on the outside.  yum!  the <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> portion was also very good although a bit too rare for me.  we also ordered three sides... creamed spinach, <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>, <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>.  i thought they were all ok but nothing to write home about.  all in all, a top notch meal.",

            "1 star - overrated and the bf got food poisoning.\n\nwe were looking for a good steakhouse while on vacay in vegas and since we had never been to cut we decided to check it out being that it's highly rated.  what a mistake.\n\nfor the money, you would think you would be getting top notch quality and service.  the service was good (our waiter did seem a tad too snooty, but he thoroughly went over the menu and the different cuts of beef they offer), but the quality was just not there.  \n\ni had my usual, the <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark>, and the bf ordered the <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>.  both seemed overly salty and far too crusty (burnt?) for our liking.  in addition to the steaks, we ordered creamed spinach and mac n cheese for our sides.  the mac n cheese was okay, but the creamed spinach was... yakk (yakk = disgusting).  i just couldn't eat it.  it comes prepared with a raw egg that cooks from the heat of the spinach and i could have done without the egg.  actually, i could have done without the creamed spinach entirely.  \n\nwith tip, the bill came to a whopping $200+, and i walked away feeling utterly ripped off.  i'm never eating at this cut again (i'm also wary to try any other cut) and after the yak-ful night the bf spent on our hotel bathroom floor, i doubt he'll ever want the taste of cut in his mouth again.  \n\ndear cut,\n\nthanks for ruining our vacation.  i think we deserve a refund.\n\nbest regards,\n\npeggy.",

            "came here for the final night of my vacation in vegas.  my friend is a huge steak person as i am not.  but i did inquire a little around town and found out there are pretty much 3 steak houses to visit on the strip - cut @ palazzo, craftsteak @ mgm and surprise! steak house @ circus circus.  originally i booked my reservation @ craftsteak considering we had a 9:30pm ka show, but after reading a bit more reviews and have been @ craftsteak, i decided we should try out cut.  (switch @ encore which is where we were staying was also considered, but after seeing the reviews we passed, i still would like to try it next time)\n\nthe four star rating is for the overall dining experience.  i would say the ambiance and service @ cut deserves a full 5 star.  our waitress definitely knew her stuff.  the restaurant is very nicely appointed, dark decorations but doesn't feel too uptight like the old steak houses in ny.  it has a nice modern feel to it.  we got seated by the door in a very comfortable booth area.  waitress came by and explained everything on the menu including the wine/drinks which came on an ipad.  she was the reason why i feel this restaurant deserved the outrageous bill that came at the end (more on that later).\n\nbeing a steak house, the main thing is the meat itself.  and this restaurant has some of the best selections.  the shining star is australian and american waygus/kobe.  basically skip all the usda crap and go straight to those selections, you would not regret it.  you do indeed pay for what you get, my friend ordered a 6oz australian waygu ny strip while i had the 6oz american waygu <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark>.  6oz may seem like a small size, but trust me you would not need more, i could not finish 1/2 of mine.  the australian waygu definitely was the most buttery steak i have ever tasted, every bite feels like you are going to pass out from just biting into it.\n\nall of the side items are a-la-carte, and they add to your bill exponentially.  the best is definitely the wild mushroom add on.  we also ordered a few other items - cauliflower (definitely recommended, yum!), creamed spinach with poached eggs (i wasn't a huge fan) and <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> (pretty good mashed potatoes but nothing to write home about)  we finished the meal with a banana cream pie/ice cream rendition, it was good, but not exceptional.  it could be however at that point i was pretty much passed out for a food coma.  the food was tiny in amount but felt so very rich that i couldn't take another bite.  i also felt that the sauces (we had chimi churri and wasabi) were too salty since the steaks were already flavored with fleur-de-sel (which they also brought to the table, a very nice touch).  it was just too much of a good thing in this case i think.  the food was simply too rich for my taste, which is one of the reasons i docked 1 star from this otherwise amazing establishment.\n\nthe other reason i took off 1 star is the price.  i have been to some outlandishly expensive restaurants, but this place is not french laundry :)  the bill for 2 came out to be around $480 (including tip), with just 1 glass of wine.  was the steak good?  absolutely.  was it $480 good?  that one i have to think for a bit and i think the answer is probably no.  so if you do decide to go, be choosy on the side items and add-ons you wish to have, because they do add up very quickly.  also ask the waitress for how the sides accompany the overall palette, i have a feeling if i do ever go back again, i will be choosing something that's lighter so it can offset the richness of the other parts of the plate.\n\nin summary, to finish off a very long review, i would come here if you are a steak fanatic and have a bit of money to drop.  it's like everything in vegas, you can do it on the cheap or outlandishly over the top.  you can guess how this one fits :)", 
            "i always believe that a good restaurant is where looks and tastes have to be equally good. i've been to hole-in-the-walls where the decor & presentation of the food don't do the taste justice. unfortunately, cut is quite anti-climatic as the taste doesn't measure up to its fancy decors and delicate presentations. \n\nwhen i walked into the restaurant i was immediately impressed by its edgy and modern atmosphere, and was prepared for a 5-star dining experience. the food was expensive and i felt like i was paying more for the \"looks\" than the food itself. i ordered a medium-well petite <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> but turned out to be well-overcooked. my friend ordered a medium filet but it was more cooked than her liking so she sent it back. but when her second steak came, it was medium, closer to medium-rare, and the middle part was cold. she didn't finish her steak. \n\npositives - i have to say service was great. when my friend sent back her steak they didn't try to push back and didn't charge us for the new steak. also, the bread here is amazing.\n\noverall, i don't think cut is as good as some of the other steakhouses for the price, bu it definitely looks nicer.",

(great...we thought)\n\nanother three minutes go by and he returns with a new <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>. we cut it up...it was raw (not rare because there is a difference). the middle/ temperature of the steak was still cold. i asked the waiter and he said he will send over the manager. manager was the same person that took our steak back the first time. when he arrived i asked if he was the manager, he replied \"no, i am just the guy in a suit\" (oh, great...we have ourselves a smart one!!) i pointed out the steak is raw and it is still cold. he said, \"that's what you ladies asked for and that's what the chef made\".\ni replied rare...not raw. \n\nend of story: he said he will \"take the steak off the bill\". \n\nthank you cut for a wonderful dining experience, we learned a great deal about steak!", 
            "i know this place got mixed reviews, so i figured i'd give my side of the story.\ni've been wanting to go to cut since we first stayed at the venetian last year, but ended up dining somewhere else. on our vegas trip this past weekend, my bf wanted to have a nice dinner and i suggested cut, he heard \"steakhouse\", and that was it. \n\nso we get done shopping and drinking a monster yard from fat tuesday around 530pm, was really buzzed so we decided to take a nap, woke up at 9, and said \"well, there goes our dinner!\" since most upscale restaurants are booked for dinner time on a saturday night, i figured why not give cut a call and see if they have a table open? it's 9pm, kinda late for dinner, other people are getting their dinner over with so they can hit the clubs, why not. they said they can seat us if we get there in 30 minutes, and i've never gotten ready so fast in my life! well, maybe for a hair appointment. \nanyway... we get there and we were seated immediately. the dining area was about 3/4 full, bar was half empty. i didn't get our server's name, but he pretty much took care of us from beginning to end. he took the time to explain the menu, the differences in their meat, where the cattle comes from, what sauces taste good, yada, yada, yada. we started off with the blue-crab crab cakes, and the thing just melts in your mouth! it had a bit much of a mayo-type sauce in it, which i'm not a big fan of, but my bf is so he loved it. i love crab cakes and this is, so far, second best on my list (can't compare to crab cakes from maryland). for my entree, i ordered the illinois corn fed <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> medium well and my bf had the american wagyu/angus kobe style <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> medium well. and both with <mark>Caramelized Onions</mark> and their home <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark>. we also had the quebec cheddar mac and cheese to share (who goes to vegas and orders mac and cheese?). the server told us ahead of time that it's gonna take time to prepare our meal, so he offered us the wine menu - in an ipad! they had my moscato d'asti - extra points! not a lot of restaurants i've visited have that (olive garden, of all places has it). they also had a choice of breads for us to munch on. i was in the ladies room when they came out with the bread, and i guess my bf was overwhelmed with the selection he didn't know what to choose. he figured we both liked the what he calls \"chocolate\" bread aka wheat bread at cheesecake factory, he saw a similar one and picked that one. good choice. \nour meal came, and since there's only 2 of us, it was easy for the servers to figure out which steak was for which person. the mac and cheese was straight out of the oven and mixed in its pan right next to our table and the server gave us 2 spoonfuls each. we got down to business and from the first bite... mmm, mmm, mmm! hands down, best steak we've ever had. one morsel from the mac and cheese... my goodness! who knew canadian cheese was that awesome?!? just like the crab cakes i had from maryland, even though i was full, it was too delicious i couldn't stop eating. all the while, our water glasses were never left empty. if the servers saw it at least 1/4 full, out they came with the pitcher of water. the excellent food and excellent service made up for the wait, but if that's how much time they need to prepare such delicious food, i'll wait! it was a little over $250 for the 2 of us, which is a splurge. but it doesn't hurt to splurge every once in a while. besides... it's vegas, baby!", 
            "came here for a bachelor party dinner and our experience was generally positive! this place does things a little backwards it seems. or i would say the deficiencies are in areas you would not think they would be in.  for instance they took our reservation for 16 and then when we showed up said that we had to sit at two different tables.. which the bachelor was not happy about... then our table was a round table and it was so rickety. if anyone touched it, it would shake violently. they gave us bread and after we finished eating the bread they decided to bring out the sauce to dip the bread???? and when we asked for more of the pretzel sticks to eat they never brought them out. after 3 separate attempts of asking for them and them apologizing they still never ever brought them???\n\nthe little easy things were all wrong, that's what surprised me with this place.\n\nwhat about the food? it was amazing!!!! i had the 16oz bone in <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> at the waiters suggestion and it was amazing. cooked perfectly, soft and tender and had an amazing flavor. i tried the australian waygu kobe beef that the bachelor ordered and it was unreal. it was so tasty.  the mac and cheese, fingerling potatoes, mashed <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> and corn niblets were top notch! i had a 2008 cabernet sauvignon and it was very tasty as well. i spent about $110 after tax and tip and it was well worth it.\n\nnow if they can only get the simple easy details right... like not having a rickety old table in a high end dining establishment.",

            "full disclosure: i have had a massive crush on wolfgang puck since i was little - something about the food and that adorable accent - so i was massively excited to try this place.\n\nwe each ordered a salad to start, and i had the fresh burrata cheese with prosciutto di parma, apples & black mission figs with micro arugula. i have had innumerable similar variations to this - prosciutto and melon, mozzarella and prosciutto, etc... but this was the single best version i have ever had. fresh, salty, sweet perfection.\n\nmy husband had the heirloom tomato salad with humboldt fog goat cheese, white anchovies, and tuscan olive oil which he seemed happy with. i wasn't paying much attention, frankly, as i was absorbed in soft burrata goodness.\n\nwe both ordered the american wagyu <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> - which was fantastic - along with sides of luscious <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>, and creamed spinach with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> (cut in by the server tableside). jasper ordered a <mark>Armagnac & Green Peppercorn</mark> sauce that he never ended up using because the steak was so flavorful. i had some <mark>Creamy Horseradish</mark> sauce that was divine. next time (and there will be a next time) i'd like to top my steak with a bit of <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> - yum.\n\ni'm pretty sure that we had chocolate souffle for dessert, but i can't really remember.  that steak was just so darn good!",

            "excellent carpacio and great pretzel bread before the meal.  the pretzels went really well with the mustards that they bring with the steaks.  i don't think the steak needed any condiments.  i ordered the wagyu (grass fed) 6oz <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> with wasabi mustard, he got the usda (corn fed) 8 oz filet topped with mushrooms and armagnac and <mark>Armagnac & Green Peppercorn</mark> sauce.  they do blacken the steak which may put they temperature a little higher than what you're used to.  i got med rare, and could've went a little less, he was happy with the medium.  the meat was so tender and juicy.  i don't think paying $20 more for the wagyu was worth the flavor, but it's nice knowing the cows were fed grass.  we picked the brussel sprouts with bacon as the side, the bacon chunks were pretty big.  we ordered a bottle of pinor noir from oregon which went really well with the meat, unfortunately i don't remember the name but i can recall the label.  we finished with coffee and split the \"baked alaskan\" which had a raspberry sorbet and a chocolate cake. they also give chocolates and brittle with the bill.\n\nthe service was outstanding, the atmosphere was wonderful.  though this wasn't the best steak i have eaten.  the experience was fantastic!  reservations are a must on weekends.",

(the <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> to top the steak were well worth the extra $12, and were perhaps the best part of the entire steak).  the wine was also good, although i prefer to be handed a more traditional looking wine list, and not an ipad where i have to navigate the various screens.\n\nthere are plenty of top notch restaurants in las vegas that are worth $300 for a dinner for two.  this is simply not one of them.",

            "all things considered, 3 stars.\n\nmy date, another couple & i went out to dinner here.  we had to wait a bit for our table which we didn't mind, and we were seated at the best one in the house.\n\nthe good:\n- service seemed pretty on point the entire night, both from our server to the bread lady to the guys filling the water cups.  server was very knowledgeable about wines & food.\n- bread was ridiculously good.  i highly recommend the pretzel bread & foccacia\n- decor, presentation, ambiance was nice - feels like a fancy restaurant (but with upbeat music & less stuffy)\n- steak itself was delicious - not the best i've ever had (i am partial to morton's), but it was cooked correctly and very flavorful.  i tried both the american wagyu (tasted like a cross between bacon & steak), and the traditional <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark>.  i liked the filet better.\n- sides - 2/3 were very good - i'd recommend both the mac and cheese and fingerling potatoes roasted with bacon and onions.  i'd skip the squash.\n\nthe bad:\n- this place is ridiculously overpriced, even for vegas.  some of the sides we ordered here (which one side could probably feed 2 people) were about $20 bucks, and our steaks were in the  mid $70s.  i've definitely spent more on dinner before and have felt great about the food and service i received - i did not have that same feeling this time.\n- they give you an ipad to order drinks and wine.  while we originally thought it was cool, it ended up being totally cumbersome and dissuaded us from ordering cocktails (we did have lovely wine though).\n- upselling - when the waiter brought over the meats to show us, he only brought over the american wagyu & japanese wagyu beefs - e.g., the most expensive steaks on the menu only.  i felt like this was a little obnoxious - if you're doing a steak demonstration you should be demonstrating all cuts of meat regardless.  as as i don't even like wagyu beef i was a little bit put off by this.\n\nthe ugly:\n- so after all was said and done, for two apps, a bottle of wine, 4 steaks and 3 sides, the bill came out to about $430 dollars.\n\nthe really ugly:\n- when the waiter brought our check over, he told us to \"make sure you fill out each of the three lines i wrote x's on\" - which would be the tip, total, and signature.  i thought this was the single most obnoxious thing i had ever experienced after dropping over $400 bucks on a meal.  i ultimately tipped the waiter exactly 20%, would have tipped him closer to 25-30% if he hasn't felt the need to point the fact i needed to tip out to me, and in retrospect i feel like i should have been closer to 15%.  as a person who has worked in the industry and frequents different bars and restaurants, i'd immediately fire someone who suggested this to a patron.\n\n--------\n\ntl;dr - i'd pick another steakhouse - somewhere where you get a bit more value for what you're spending.",

            "we went to vegas for our honeymoon to enjoy the ultimate culinary experience. we booked reservations at 4 top-notch restaurants and we went to cut on our last night. this place is amazing and was the best out of the 4 we tried!!! we both had the american wagyu beef (<mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> and ny steak), with potato pur\\u00e9e and roasted brussel sprouts. the meat was so tender, juicy, and seasoned perfectly, plus it had a wonderful sear on both sides (no need to add any extras/sauces). there is definitely a difference between your \"everyday\" <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> and american wagyu. if you come here expect to splurge, and in my opinion it's pointless to get any cut of beef of lesser quality than the wagyu. \n\nthe pur\\u00e9e was delicious, very creamy and great flavor. the brussel sprouts were roasted with bacon and <mark>Fingerling Potatoes, Smokey Bacon, Pearl Onions</mark> - another very tasty side dish. we ordered the <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark> salad as an appetizer and loved it. my husband, who doesn't usually care for salads, would order it again in a heartbeat. it comes with a spectacular champagne vinaigrette that ties all the flavors together. for dessert we had the chocolate souffl\\u00e9 and banana cream pie. in addition, they bring you bread with dinner. of the 4 choices we recommend the focaccia and pretzel bread...delightful! \n\noverall this place has superb food and great service. we are definitely going back the next time we are in vegas. simply amazing!", 
            "as a local and a loyal delmonico diner for almost 10 years, we decided it was high time we tried cut: and i really liked it! the food was good, the presentation was imaginative and the service was some of the best at any restaurant i've ever been to. the atmosphere is very modern but not uncomfortable. (ask for a booth as the regular tables and chairs looked not-so-pleasant). \n\nthe prices are pretty high but the quality and presentation makes it (almost) worth it. don't expect to get out of here without paying at least $200 on a dinner for two. we had 2 appetizers, 2 steaks, 2 sides, 2 glasses of wine and 2 dessert and our total check was around $275.00 (before tip). we didn't go for the crazy expensive meat, just the \"regular\" <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> and bone-in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>. the steaks were good and the wood fired cooking gave them a nice flavor. the steaks come with a few different sides of mustards (i've never seen that before at a steakhouse). \n\nas others have noted, i found everything here to be extremely salty. it was like somebody knocked over the salt bowl into the food. i had the squash as a side and it was coated in salt. the steak was crusted with salt. the steaks came out with a small bowl of extra salt and a spoon! the butter for the bread is topped with salt, as is the bread itself (pretzel and foccacia is where it's at, ya'll)! if you are looking for a salt lick, this is the place for you. next time i am going to ask them to tone down the salt in my food, it was almost unbearable but not to the point of making the food inedible.\n\nthe wine list is abysmal but we were told the corkage fee if you bring your own wine is a very steep $50 (that's what the french laundry in napa valley charges)! luckily there were some good options of wines by the glass -- we opted for the hall cabernet for $19 a glass. totally worth it.", 
            "the service was great. however the food was much less impressive. we both ordered <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> medium rare. the steaks were overcooked and i saw some pink, but it's more like medium than medium rare. the steaks were also dry. i have had much better steaks elsewhere. the side (we ordered potatoes) was also just so-so and nothing special about the cocktails neither. \n\ncut just didn't cut it!",

            "amazing dining experience! the service from ben and james was great! we started with the asparagus appetizer- yum yum and perfect rose champagne. we enjoyed the illinois <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> and the nebraska <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> cooked to chefs preference. house steak and peppercorn sauces to dip in. between the two of course the filet was better, but they both cut like butter and melted in your mouth. mac and cheese for our side and it was delicious and a half bottle of sangiovese to compliment our steaks. banana cream pie for dessert it was perfect- light and refreshing. a divine dining experience.", 
            "can things get better than a fancy dinner in vegas? i was in town for a girl's weekend and wanted to enjoy one indulgent meal. we decided to make a reservation at cut since wolfgang puck is such a renowned chef. we were not disappointed. i started with the crab and <mark>Maryland Blue Crab & Carolina Shrimp 'Louis' Cocktail</mark>, which was fantastic. the portions were much larger than expected. they even start you off with a huge selection of bread, so don't make the mistake of loading up on carbs. in regards to the steak, we had to try the american wagyu beef. i ordered a <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> (6 oz) with <mark>Caramelized Onions</mark> and the peppercorn sauce. it was the best steak i've ever had. it was so moist and perfectly cooked. we got the creamed spinach and mac and cheese as sides, and this was way more than enough food. to top off our meal, we ordered the banana cream pie, which was fantastic. they also served some small dessert samples which were okay, but i would recommend trying one of their house made desserts.", 
            "i... don't know what to say. i had really high hopes for this place, thinking this would be one of the best meals of my life. but sadly, i was hugely disappointed.\n\nfor a 6 oz steak that costs $85, i expected a lot more. i ordered the american wagyu <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark>, medium rare. what i got was definitely more rare than medium rare.. most of the steak was red. i even started to question if they gave me the right steak, because it wasn't anything near amazing, like i expected after reading some yelp reviews about the american wagyu.  it was kinda tasteless, didn't melt in my mouth at all, and was even slightly difficult to swallow. mastros in costa mesa is way better..\n\nother reviews on what we ordered:\nappetizer: <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan: this was pretty good. it had a lot of flavor.. even the salad on top was delicious and refreshing amongst all the heavy things we ordered. not a lot in terms of quantity but very tasty. i think it's popular because it's so unique. good but didn't amaze me. \namerican wagyu <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark>: see above. this was ok... sad to say.\namerican wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>: what my bf ordered. he always gets the <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> and i always get the <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark>, which is nice because we get to try both. his <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> was ok. not as fatty and flavorful as <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> usually are. a disappointment as well.. didnt have much flavor.  \nmaybe we were supposed to order some toppings for our steaks to give them more flavor, but we wanted to taste the steak on its own since it's supposed to be such good quality. i guess that's what the sauces and salt (that they offer) are for. i'd rather the chef perfect the steak's flavor for me, though, since they're the pros and we're paying so much. \n\nside: <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark>: this was ok. i would have much preferred other mushrooms. i wouldn't order this again. be careful when you eat the big green pepper as it can be very spicy!\n\nmac n cheese: this was actually really good! not your typical mac n cheese. i loved the texture of the macaroni\n\nwine: i forgot the exact one i ordered, but it was a cabernet sauvignon, which i always get. it was okay. \n\nservice was pretty good. they explain the cuts of meat to you, comparing japanese wagyu and american wagyu. the servers were very efficient and seemed pretty busy. you should definitely ask questions if you have any. they were more than happy to answer my questions. \n\nin the end, our meal was $300 for two people (appetizer, two steaks, two sides and a glass of wine). i wish the price were justified by an unforgettable meal, but i'm left feeling pretty unsatisfied. i didn't even bother to look at the dessert menu, which says a lot. trust me.\n\ncome here to experience a wolfgang puck restaurant if you wish, but just don't get your hopes up.", 
            "ahhhhh the famous cut! i have heard that this steakhouse is super good from an acquaintance so i decided to give it a try while i'm on a vacay. \n\ninterior: good! glassy and dim lights! the furniture is black, neat and comfortable. i like black and glassy places. nice layout. \n\ncustomer service: good again! our guy was really friendly and nice. my girl had a few questions and he was very thorough while answering them. \n\nfood: hmmm i gotta say it's the biggest let down in my life. given that the place has the four dollar signs, i thought it would be top notch. my girl and i got a <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan, american wagyu <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> and <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> with mac and cheese and wildfield mushroom on the side. the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan was very interesting and unique. when i first heard about it, i was very confused. flan is supposed to be sweet, but this particular one was cooked in a <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>. me no comprehender! the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> was good. that's all i could say. it's hard to explain so jus try it lol wildfield mush was aiite. it had that typical mush taste with a lil saltiness. mac and cheese was cheesy and creamy on a decent level. now the finale 'drum roll' the steaks were okay.. my <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> was so plain that i thought maybe i was supposed to get a sauce.. and the thing is the meat itself wasn't exquisite like the waiter explained. it jus tasted like usda black angus prime beef in my opinion. there was nothing wagyu about it. for that reason, i give this restaurant three stars. nothing extraordinary. just plain.", 
            "i wish i could give this place 10 stars, but unfortunately that would break the scale on yelp.  \n\nmy friends and i made a reservation for this restaurant for a friday night dinner and arrived about 15 minutes early.  unfortunately, our table wasn't ready yet which is not the restaurant's fault; however, they offered us a seat at the bar area and gave us complimentary wasabi peas, peanuts, and olives while we waited.  we were seated immediately when the time rolled around and got a booth that faced the dining area - great for people watching.  the ambiance is a bit loud and rowdy, but the dim lighting made it feel quite romantic as well.  we had two servers that night, and they offered us complimentary bread, parmesan breadsticks, and some puffs, which i didn't try.  the waiter also brought out the tray of raw meat so he could explain the different marbling in each of the steaks.  quite impressive and definitely something i've never seen at any other steakhouses.\n\ni ordered the <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> 8 oz cooked medium well with the <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> on the side.  for the sides, it was family style so we shared the asparagus and brussel sprouts.  i liked how they portioned out the sides for us. i must say, i was originally planning to eat half of my steak because 8 oz is too much for me, but after one bite, i was hooked.  the top and bottom of the steak were crunchy and crispy while the middle was nice and soft.  the contrast of the different textures in every bite was amazing. what made it even more amazing was their <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark>.  it was tangy and flavorful, and i noticed that i would dip each slice generously into the sauce.  so good i can drink it. :)  wish they sold it because i would have brought back a bottle.\n\nfor dessert, we shared the chocolate souffle, which was pretty big.  once they brought it out, the server sliced a hole in the middle and poured whipped cream inside and placed a spoonful of nutella on top.  it was delicous! we finished it all in less than 3 minutes.  you would think that would be the last course to end the night, but nope! they offered us a plate of mini desserts - marshmallow, meringue, lemon tart, and jelly - on the house.  \n\nof course, the price for the dinner was outrageously expensive, but that's a given when you're eating at a steakhouse in vegas. i thought it was worth it, and you should too. \n\ntip: the restaurant is located inside the shops at the palazzo.", 
            "definitely worth a visit. and no, it's not one of those places that are overhyped. had the maryland blue crab and carolina shrimp for starter- crab was fresh and sweet, texture of the firm shrimps combined with the soft avocado was well balanced and the horseradish added just the right amount of punch to the sea flavors. i like my meat with more flavor and some texture rather than totally melt-in-your-mouth , so i decided to go with the u.s (<mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> of japanese) wagyu <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark>. this was tender and flavorful for a <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark>. i asked for medium and it was cooked to perfection - well seared on the outside and beautifully charred which gave it that smoky flavor and pink in the middle with the juice retained. creamed spinach was slightly weak in flavor for my liking but mac-n-cheese was great. we paired the meat with a darioush signature range cab sav- good amount of depth but still easy to drink and fairly affordable.", 
            "the best meal i've ever had in las vegas! this place has the best steak there is in town! there are so many assortments of meat to choose from. the waitress came out with an assortment of raw meat for us to look at and choose from at the very beginning. you could see how each type of meat have different amount of fat. i absolutely love the japanese wagyu beef. it literally melts in your mouth. \n\nbest starters - prime sirlo<mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> tartare with her aioli and mustard. and prime <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> carpaccio.\n\nbest steak- japanese wagyu beef <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> \n\nbest add on- <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>( they cut it out for us) \n\nsauce- my favorite is the <mark>Creamy Horseradish</mark> sauce.", 
            "when you charge $65 - $105 per steak, the experience has to be out of this world; i was not blown away. if you plan on coming here, keep your expectations in check and have in the back of your mind that you're paying an additional 25% for the las vegas dining experience; if you do that, you'll be happy.\n\nonto the highlights of our meal -- the service. my golly the service was spot-on. i felt like royalty dining with the duchess of cambridge. when you leave your chair and leave the napkin on the seat, they come by, remove and give you a fresh new one -- it's the attention to detail that makes the service amazing. \n\nthe complimentary bread was fancy bread that was served table-side with a server placing each bread on your plate ever so gently. however, it was not warm bread -- stone cold bread. i was confused. most high end restaurants serve bread warm because it just tastes so much better warm. \n\nonto the reason we came: the steaks. 4 of us came here, we ordered the:\n1. [2x] american waygu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> 9oz ($88 each): this should have been the star of the show but it was not. before ordering your steaks, the waiter actually brings raw steaks wrapped neatly and explains the different cuts of waygu and basically sells you on the more expensive cut. we ordered it. call me a steak-snob, but for waygu, i was expecting melt-in-your-mouth bites -- it was more tough than i expected. it was only marginally better than the 35 dry aged <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, and certainly not $30+ better. \n\n2. [1x] usda prime, nebraska corn fed, dry aged 35 days <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> 12oz ($63): this was a solid cooked <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>. no frills, no overselling. delicious <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>.\n\n3. [1x] <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark>: this was surprisingly the star of the show. it was the melt-in-your-mouth experience i was expecting (and for a fraction of the waygu price). \n\nprotip (seriously protip): if you have a reservation, call ahead, ask to speak to a manager and ask him/her that you want to do \"the sampling\" of the waygu. if you're convincing enough, they will make a dish with a 2 oz cut of the regular dry-aged <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, 2 oz cut of the american waygu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, and 2 oz of the japanese waygu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>. (at least 2 people in your party have to order this) had i known this going in, i would've done this so you can taste the differences <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark>.\n\npros: service is impeccable\ncons: oversold on the waygu (good steak, but not \"out-of-this-world\" great)",

            "cut was an awesome experience.   we walked by after seeing the phantom and were drawn to how cool the interior looked.  after a once over on the menu- we were sold.  being the spontaneous couple that we are, we didn't make reservations and the restaurant was packed with no open table.  our charming hostess then suggested a seat in the \"lounge,\" which we obliged.  \n\nthe lounge was basically the waiting area outside the actual eating area, right in front of the bar.  the full menu was available and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  we started off with a couple glasses of wine and a generous assortments of bread (pumpernickel, pretzel, and a couple other choices), then boyfriend ordered the 8 oz. <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark> with horseradish sauce and a side of creamed spinach.  i had the rotisserie duck and split the spinach. first off, let me say that i was totally jealous of boyfriend's order.  it was wonderful!  the steak was more medium than rare, but buttery and really delicious.  i could have skipped the horseradish (not stingy enough), but it's okay, because the meat was so flavorful that i wouldn't care to mask it with a sauce anyway.  my duck was delicious.  the gastrique was a bit too sweet for my taste, but the meat was tender and the skin was nice and crispy. \n\nthe portions for both plates were generous and more than enough for both of us.  the tab at the end of the meal was pricey; however, the courteous wait staff, out of this world food and generally great experience made it worth every penny.  definitely looking forward to going back next time we're in town.", 
            "i made my bf make a reservation about a month before our trip to vegas.  we studied the menu quite awhile beforehand.  it's important to carefully consider what to eat if you're going to spend a few benjamins!  we started with the maryland blue crab and <mark>Pan Roasted Stonington Maine Lobster</mark> \"louis\" cocktail.  this was surprisingly fresh.  you can taste each of the crab or lobster when separating them into their own bite, but taking in a little bit of seafood, avocado, microgreens and tomato - everything just melds together.  i would have never guessed that the extra creamy bottom layer was panna cotta.  i wasn't into the ultra thin parmesan breadsticks or gougers (too much cheese), but was a bit more enticed by the bread selection.  i choose the onion focaccia, which was a bit salty and super soft, but the onions were sweetly caramelized.  i stay away from pretzels in general, but tried a bite of my bf's roll - best pretzel ever.  also there's no salt on it.  the menu online offered a bone in filet, but was not currently on the menu.  after having more than a few prime filets in the past couple years, i decided to take it to the next level with an american wagyu filet and topped it off with <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark>.  absolutely the most tender meat that has ever melted in my mouth to date.  my bf had the dry aged <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> topped with <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>.  the marrow pieces had a fascinating shape and texture, looking like gnocchi but bursting like gelatinous blobs.  we shared the creamed spinach with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>.  the egg adds quite a bit of extra richness.  splitting the appetizer and sharing one side gave us just enough room for dessert.  the carmelized banana cream pie with valrhona pearls was a delight.  the pearls were like little crunches with a layer inside the slice and scattered on the plate.  there was also a scoop of roasted banana ice cream for cooler contrast.  with the bill arrived yet more sweets of a piece of incredibly rich truffle-like chocolate and not as sweet, chewy cashew caramel.  overall, an amazing meal.\n\nservice was very good, but not perfect.  the d\\u00e9cor is way modern.  i'm not sure i like the swivel chairs with mesh bottoms.  also i wore a super short skirt, so i felt a bit self-conscious.  not to mention the mirrors all around, although they let me see what was happening all around without having to swivel.  now i gotta go downgrade some of my other steakhouse reviews...", 
            "as a self-proclaimed beef connoisseur, i'm always in search of that amazing steak that will just blow your mind.  indeed, i browse the beef section at every market just to check the quality and marbling of their steaks.\n\nin my mind, the \"perfect\" steak has always come down to a 28-35 day, dry-aged, usda prime <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, cooked rare to medium rare with a dash of sea-salt and fresh ground black pepper (what can i say, i'm a purist).\n\ntoday, i say with good authority... that the perfect steak... is whatever they're serving over there at cut.\n\nwell lets get some context - we started off the evening getting a couple of cocktails at the bar while watching usc football dominate ohio.  i look to my left and who should be standing next to me?  wolfgang mother-effen puck!!!  yes, wolfgang puck hangs out at his own restaurant and apparently was routing for usc - go figure.\n\nambiance of the restaurant is great.  suitable contemporary decor for a more modern steakhouse.  lets get down to the food:\n\nthe bad:\nthe side dishes are horrible.  \nherb fries... absolutely nothing special.  \ncheese polenta... quite disgusting.  \ncream of spinach... not much better than what you can get in the frozen food section.  \nfingerling potatoes... are actually quite decent.\n\n\nthe good:\nthey have an amazing mult-course assortment of bread starting with breadsticks, baked cheeseballs, onion bread, and my personal favorite, the pretzels.\n\nthe amazing:\nif you're not planning on having a steak, don't come here.  in fact, i'll take it one step further and say if you're not planning on having kobe beef... don't come here.  the regular usda prime steaks are great, but you'll find steaks of similar caliber elsewhere.  the two people who vouched for mere usda prime <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> were torn with regret by not spending the extra $25 for the \"kobe beef\" upgrade.\n\npersonally, i can only speak for the medium grade kobe (american-raised wagyu cattle).   unbelievable flavorful and tender  they say kobe beef melts in your mouth, and honestly, it really does.  i tried a bite of my friends usda prime <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, and i swear... after having a bite of wagyu beef, dry-aged usda prime meat taste like sizzler.  $85 for an ala carte 10 oz <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> american wakyu steak may seem steep, but in this case, you really do get what you pay for.\n\nmost people got the taste of <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> sampler which included 2 oz of authentic japanese kobe beef, 4 oz of american wagyu, and 4 oz of usda prime.  of course, the purpose is show americans how deprived we are by having mere \"steak,\" while our japanese friends have \"steak!\"  the taste of this culinary sampler - $140 for 10 oz of meat.  yep, $14 an oz.  \n\nbut according to all those who ordered the sampler, the difference between japanese kobe and american kobe... is even bigger and more noticeable than the difference between american kobe and usda prime.  in other words, i have still yet to taste the best of the best.\n\noh wolfgang puck, why must you torment me so with your ridiculously expensive, but oh so delicious cuts of kobe beef?\n\nthe total cost for 11 of us... almost $2,000.", 
            "thank you, wolfgang puck.......meatatarian...... i am!\n\ni'm not real big on giving out 5 stars to steak places and the only other place that gets this honor is peter luger's in brooklyn.  after visit cut, i realized that it was indeed deserved.\n\neverything is a la carte. we were a group of six which was nice because we were able to get an array of different side dishes and apps.  <mark>Pink Lady & Fuji Apple Salad</mark>, crab & lobster louis cocktail and the tomato salad, there were also some memorable breads.\n\nit was unanimous, everyone ordered \"tasting of <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark>\".  we couldn't pass it up.  there was 4oz of usda prime, 4oz of american \"kobe\" and 2oz of japanese wagyu.   steak heaven.  we chose the <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>, the creamed spinach, the polenta and the <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark>.  the only thing that was terrible was the polenta.... but that's an acquired taste kind of thing.... and i didn't acquire it!\n\ni never in my life wanted to eat steak so slowly as to savor every bite of that kobe.....until i took a bite of the wagyu.  it freaking melts in your mouth! it's served in this trio to say, \"see how much better it is than your usda prime?\" and wow is it true.\n\nthe decor was very ultra lounge.  i loved it.  colors worked well, warm tones.  service was uber professional and very helpful when discussing wines.  i did have a 20 minute wait, even with reservations, but that's to be expected anywhere in vegas so it didn't even phase me.\n\ni will be back.", 
            "when i imagine heaven, i think of eating wagyu beef all the time.\n\ncut is heaven on earth.\n\ni went there on a thursday at 6pm and it was really easy to get a table.\n\ni ordered the (american) kobe sashimi and the taste of  <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> which is 4oz. nebraska corn-fed dry aged angus, 4oz. american kobe, and 2oz. japanese wagyu beef.\n\nthe sashimi was dressed in olive oil, soy and ginger, and it was decadent.  i'm so glad that i followed it with the sampler rather than one type of beef.  it really allowed me to experience a wide range of cow goodness.  \n\ni thought that the service was knowledgeable and yeah, they're pushy.  just push back.",

            "one phrase can sum this place up and pun intended, \"a cut above the rest.\" corny, yes but so true. i was completely amazed by cut and being my first time, i sure hope to return soon. \n\nwent there for yet another travel business meeting and had a fairly large group. i can't imagine what the bill came out to but nice thing, we weren't paying. the selection of meats (after all, it is a steakhouse) was amazing and i learned about a brand new type of meat called wagyu (sp?) from japan and it was very good however not the best cut. i did try out the trio of meat sampler and the american \"kobe\" was exquisite ... melted in my mouth! i do not remember having a piece of meat that good before and is by far the best yet. \n\nit is yet another pricey place in vegas but extremely above par like many others. another great dining establishment to impress a business associate or date. the staff was amazing and extremely knowledgeable about the food they have there without hesitation or question. \n\nthe restaurant is yet another creation of world famous chef wolfgang puck and probably the best one of his establishments i have been to yet. i haven't been to a lot of them but a nice handful. \n\nmain course: amazing \nsides: amazing \ndesserts: i made it through, amazing \n\nfavorite dish: tour of <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> which is the three meat sampler. i had it medium but they recommended medium-rare. \n\ngo out and eat!", 
            "i have had the pleasure of having dinner at both cut three times over the last three months.  while i believe cut's food is near the best in las vegas, i actually believed delmonico's had a slight edge with service and i am just a big fan of <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> in general.  \nhowever, this past week, the impeccable service at cut made me a true believer.  the general manager gianni toffonello is extremely professional and did all the small things necessary to make our dining experience truly amazing.  \nwe were there last night to treat our good friend to one last blissful dinner before his deployment to afghanistan.  among the people in our group, we tried the japanese kobe, american wagyu filet, and waygu <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark>.  the quality of the beef was apparent with each bite.  and most importantly, there was no flaw in the service.  i am a huge believer in customer service and i believe that when my friends and me are treated with respect, it makes me want to share my excitement about the restaurant with the rest of the world.\ni have no doubt that i will be returning to cut during my next trip to las vegas.  it is now a staple of any vegas trip.", 
            "if someone else is buying, i'd go back here happily. the detractors were fairly few, but i'll call them out right here.  1, the wine list, though fairly extensive, had unreasonable pricing on the lower end bottles.  i understand the mark-up system, but there should be a more reasonable option for those who need it.  2, the cheese plate was not good.  it was not balanced, and just needed a little fixer to be right.\n\nthe bad news out of the way, it was a tasty place to dine when you're craving red meat.  i had the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan appetizer, which was rich, buttery and flavorful.  the presentation was also very nice.  my main was the indian spiced short ribs. i had a major mental disconnect on this. beef and indian spices?  seriously, isn't shiva going to rain fire down for this?  well, if she does, it would be a pity, as the flavors were wonderful. the texture was perfect.  i also tried the lamb chops which were juicy, flavorful, etc.  another person at my table had the <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark>, and it was also excellent. it had a good char, deep flavor, and was properly cooked. the other people at the table i was at actually requested to have their meat fired again, as their definition of steakhouse medium was actually a proper steakhouse medium well, but i wouldn't fault the restaurant for their preference for meat, which in my opinion is over cooked.  the restaurant was very accomodating to their needs, and provided excellent service.", 
            "amidst the plethora of generic steakhouses in vegas cut is not cut above the rest.  pun intended.\n\n i thought the \"shock and awe\" spectacle of presenting beautifully marbled raw beef of different backgrounds (filet, <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, wagyu, <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark>) stacked together to stimulate the salvatory glands was a bit kitchy, maybe silly, but somewhat effective.  \n \nto start, i ordered the <mark>Pink Lady & Fuji Apple Salad</mark>, with bacon lardons and medjool dates.  i had the waiter arrange a wine flight for me, to which he paired a predictable, but delicious, riesling from germany.  it was a nice crisp start considering i was in for an incredibly rich meal.\n\nwhen the waiter presented the raw meat i was smitten with a wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, and demanded it be mine.  i topped it off with <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>, and waited like a famished lioness.  i asked the waiter for a spicy red, and he sent me a full and spicy bordeaux that i couldn't wait to wash down with my meat.  i am a carnivore of the worst kind, and love my meat to be as rare as possible.  for this cut i opted for medium-rare bloody, and received medium charred.  the fatty marble goodness i anticipated had evaporated.  what was left was a dry, grey, and chewy piece of meat.  i summoned our waiter, and he was appalled and embarrassed.  his profuse apologies, could not appease me.  i did not yell or make a scene, because that would be counterproductive, and let's be honest, it's not his fault.  i was pissed at the cook who left that gorgeous piece of meat sitting in the oven too long.  it takes a professional idiot to kill wagyu, and the lack of respect for a valuable product is unforgivable.  feeling sorry for me, my mom offered to share her beautifully prepared <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> wagyu while i waited, but i wanted her to fully enjoy her meal, so i snacked on the potato gratin, and asparagus sides as i festered about the ruined meat.  \n\nour waiter returned with a new piece of meat, more apologies, and offered to comp my meal.  i told him that was ridiculous and unnecessary.  i was angry that a product was wasted, not that i would have to pay for a meal.  what was delivered was sinfully delicious.  tender, juicy, and melt in your mouth.  the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> was buttery, fatty, and a bit iron-y.  it was great with the beef.  accompanied by the bordeaux, it was fantastic.  the sides were pretty forgettable and generic, and maybe that was part my fault for ordering them, but c'mon, protein, starch, and vegetable...how could you mess that up?!\n\ni don't love dessert, but my mom wanted something sweet, so we ordered some chocolate concoction that wasn't memorable.  i had a lovely spanish port that i enjoyed more than the dessert.\n\nwhen we got the bill our persistent waiter had removed my wine, and the dessert.  so i tipped like a rockefeller, and thanked him anyway.\n\ni'm giving three stars because i do not respect a restaurant that believes it is acceptable to send out an overcooked piece of meat to a customer.  first, you have disrespected the animal, and the purveyor from where that meat originated.  it took hours of work and plenty of money, to raise, feed, clean, massage, slaughter, and ship that animal.  when you disrespect the product you disrespect the entire process it took to get that product on the table, as well as the customer, and your profession as a cook.  three stars.",

            "my husband and i splurged for a high end dining experience at cut last night.  i had heard much about it and were looking forward to seeing if the hype lived up to the expectations.  overall, food and wine were excellent but the price would probably keep us from going back soon.\n\nfor appetizers, my husband chose the <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> and i had the <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark> salad with avocado, bleu cheese and a herb champagne vinagrette.   after we ordered the waiter informed us these were two of the most popular and i can see why. both were fantastic.  the waiter brought around 4 different types of fresh bread.  i had the onion focaccia which was excellent, and my husband the sourdough which was also good.\n\nfor the main course, i had selected the 6 oz american wagyyu <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark>, and my husaband selected the petite <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> cut, both prepared medium rare.  my husband thought his was a bit overseasoned with pepper, but i thought his tasted good.  my steak was excellent, one of the best i have ever had.  but $75 for 6 oz is a lot of $$.  i think most people who probably eat here aren't necessarily concerned about prices. the steaks come with three types of mustard for dipping, two of which were excellent.  we also go the <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> (by far the best of all the sauces) and a herb shallot red <mark>Shallot-Red Wine Bordelaise</mark> that was tasty also.  all sauces are served on the side so that you can try a variety. \n\nour sides were the mac and cheese and creamed spinach with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>.  both were excellent.  the egg gave the creamed spinach a really nice texture, and the mac and cheese was a bit of a twist on an old staple.\n\nwe were stuffed so didn't order dessert, although they gave us some small bites of lemon and chocolate bars which were just enough and tasted excellent.  \n\noverall this was a great dinner, but we ended up spending over $400 on just the two of us, so it would be hard to justify going again.", 
            "many restaurants tout fusion sensibilities, but puck's concept truly blends influences from his native austria, france, japan, america and elsewhere. almost painfully serious about beef, servers here bring out a platter of raw kobe and wagyu cuts before you order, to show the differences in the meat. \n\nyour taste buds may not be as sensitive as your eyes, though: we actually preferred the 21 day wet-aged illinois prime bone-in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> to the american wagyu/angus <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark>. cut's ample offerings also include several 35 day dry aged nebraska prime as well as true japanese waygu (kobe) choices (all are grilled over hard wood & charcoal then finished under the broiler). \n\nin fact, cut's menu seems overly eager to please (or overwhelm) with an excess of options in starters (12 the night we visited), side dishes (13), desserts (7) and even sauces (8), though many were excellent, including the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> \"sandwiches\" with wasabi aoli and bar menu's knishes and kobe sliders; and <mark>Wasabi-Yuzu Kosho Butter</mark> and <mark>Cognac & Whole Grain Mustard</mark> were both remarkable. but the creamed spinach topped with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> was almost too rich and the potato tart tatin was mostly just big and bland. the deconstructed nectarine and plum crumble, served with a house-made \"50 bean\" vanilla ice cream was nice, but far too big a portion to end such a meal.\n \na nice selection of original and classic cocktails, but their wine list is a bit pretentious and overpriced ($15 for a glass of argentinian malbec? really? i'd pay that much for a magnum of it in the store)\n\nin short, cut has one of my favorite lounges on the strip (sexy, sleek, just dark enough, fitting for either romance or business rendevous), some fantastic appetizers, and a great cocktail menu. cut has one of my least favorite dining rooms on the strip (like an 80s office, stiff and steely), and good meat--but not quite as good as their orgiastic presentation lends you to expect. i didn't dislike it, but was not wowed as much as i have been at craftsteak, carnevino, and even boa, all in the same price range. \n\np.s. at these prices, you can afford to make the sauces complimentary.", 
            "the hottie and i have been meaning to try cut for awhile.  we finally went on our last trip to vegas.  based upon the reviews we started with the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan.  it was simply one of the best dishes i've ever had anywhere.  then, we decided to get the porterhouse steak for two.  caveat.... the waiter told us that we are supposed to order the steak one notch rarer than we normally would like it because they let the steak sit for 10 minutes after its done so it will cook a bit more.  since the hottie and i are both medium rare people, we ordered the porterhouse rare.  it looked and smelled amazing when the steak finally came to the table!  truthfully, i thought the steak was kinda in between rare and medium rare.  but the <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> portion may have been the best <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> i've had.  so tender, so juicy, with a flavorful crisp on the outside.  yum!  the <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> portion was also very good although a bit too rare for me.  we also ordered three sides... creamed spinach, <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>, <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>.  i thought they were all ok but nothing to write home about.  all in all, a top notch meal.", 
            "not as good as my previous visit, but still good.\n\ncame here with three buddies this past saturday and we ended up getting seats in the lounge area.  while i prefer the dining room, there wasn't much choice in the matter, since they were booked solid until 10pm.  the lounge was nice, but the seats could use a lot of improvement.  my back and legs ached before we even received our entrees.  even a couple cocktails didn't numb the discomfort.\n\ncomfort aside, the food and service were on the mark.  we ordered five appetizers:\n\n1.  fava bean salad - my wife didn't like it when she went last time, but this time one of my buddies actually enjoyed it.  go figure.  but seriously, why pay $15 for a bean salad?!?\n2.  big eye carpaccio - not bad, but it felt like such a waste of good tuna to be fixed up.  i would have preferred it sashimi style, but that's just me.  \n3.  <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> - just as yummy as it was the last time.  and i again wish i had just ordered 4 of these for my entree.  i would compare this to sweet, salty baconny goodness.  \n4.  kobe sashimi - everyone on the table loved this we did two orders.  call me a purist, but i really would have liked less...flavor.  like the big eye, there were just too many flavors going on around such a great central ingredient.  the sauce muted the beefy goodness.  on the plus side, this was butter tender and really tasty.  \n\nwe each had different cuts of meat, and everyone was happy with what they had.  if i remember correctly, my friends ordered a filet, <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> strip and illinois <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>.  i had the nebraska <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>.  all steaks were ordered medium rare and all were perfectly cooked.  my buddy who had the illinois (bone in) <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> and i swapped pieces and we both agreed the nebraska was far and away superior in flavor and tenderness.  \n\nfor sides, we only had the creamed spinach and pureed potatoes.  the egg on the spinach could have been cut up better because the pieces were pretty huge (picking nits on that one, eh).  the potatoes were really nothing special and were seriously lacking in flavor; maybe they just need to add some bacon to that thing.\n\ni did order a bottle of kaesler avignon syrah, which went waaaaay to fast.  it felt like our server just wanted to empty the bottle out as quickly as possible.  maybe i'm just a pretentious wine snob, but i like to let the wine in my glass open up before pouring more.  is that too much to ask?  despite this perceived flaw in service, everyone was attentive, friendly and quick (maybe too quick?).  \n\nactually, looking back on my previous review, i should have given cut 5 stars for that visit because this time round it was a step down.", 
            "this place is what happens when god makes a steak house!!!  seriously, it's restaurants like these that keep me from turning vegetarian.  i went here as part of my boys bachelor party.  let me start with the dinning environment:  very clean with a slight industrial feel.  the swivel chairs were a very nice change from the clunky wooden chairs you see in most places.  it also helps to get my fat ass in and out of the table a lot easier.  trust me.... after this meal.. you kinda wanna roll back to your room for a cigarette.\n\nappetizers:  <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan, kobe sashimi, and <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>. \n all on point~!!!  the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan was so rich and buttery.  it literally makes your eyes roll back as you take a bite of it off the small crestini.  the kobe sashimi was fresh and light.  the beef was velvety dressed with only a little olive oil and capers.  this is a must try.  and then came the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>.  sweet.... savory... rich... flavorful.... wow....\n\nsides:  creamed spinach and roasted potatoes.   \nlet me preface by saying... i am not a fan of creamed spinach in any variation.  so to me, this dish was bound for failure.  the spinach was topped with a <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> that was mixed in table-side and served to us.  the rest of my table loved it.  i was not a big fan.  no slight to the chef... just personal preference.  it was good, but not my cup of tea.  the potatoes however were great!  roasted simply with some onions and garlic.  sometimes good technique and simplicity just win out.  and this side was a prime example of that.\n\nmain: american wagyu <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> steak\nif you go to a restaurant like this, you dont order the chicken.  you shell out the money and get the best that they offer.  the american wagyu choices were organic beef from idaho, i believe.  the moment my knife touched the soft medium rare beef, i was sure that my knife and fork were the luckiest utensils in the world.  they were the first to make love to that meat.  i have never in my life tasted beef of this magnitude.  the flavor was so unique and undoubtedly unforgettable.  the beef melted in my mouth as i could not believe something that was only rubbed in salt and pepper, had this much flavor.  like i said before, if you come here.  go for the american wagyu.  pricey?  yes.  absolutely worth it?  hell f***ing yes~!!!\n\nwine:  malbec.\nran the decision by the sommelier and she said that was a great choice.  great wine with the meal.  soft flavors, smooth finish, not too much bite.  the wine was a hit with the table.  but at this point.... everything was a hit from this place.  \n\ncongrats alex!  hope you enjoyed your last meal~!!!", 
            "my best friend has been raving about the $28 ounce of kobe from cut and how great it was (his gf didn't let him eat it after she tried it) and so i've wanting to try cut for a while.  i'm not a big fan of steak houses but thought cut would be different.  for the record, i didn't order the $28 an ounce kobe, i did order a dry aged <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark>.  it was a big piece of meat and that's what it was.  it was dry, flavorless, and very average.  i just wasn't impressed.  the wasabi-yuzu sauce was a nice compliment for the steak since it gave it some flavor.   for appetizer, i had heirloom tomato salad which i again thought was very average.  the salad was $21 and the steak was $59 and i don't think it was worth it.  for that same price, i could have ate somewhere else and probably had a tasting menu of some sort.  there wasn't anything spectacular about the meal, it just felt like over priced steak and salad.  \n\nthe service was relatively good, they were attentive and courteous.  the decor was somewhat depressing.  perhaps they were going for the dim lighting of a steakhouse which is fine but i felt it didn't go well with the chairs and tables.\n\nthere were three of us and the bill was $336.  we had some alcohol and also a souffle for dessert which was so so.  my best friend has said that he and i will go to cut together next time i visit him.  i think i'll have to find another restaurant to try <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark>.",

            "visited this wolfgang puck restaurant in january of 2010. three of us in the party. made reservations a week before on opentable.com. we were on time and greated by the hostess when we walked in. restaurant and lounge was full. it was ces week so vegas is usually jammed that week. the hostess originally tried to seat us in the lounge. i was like \"nah\". moved promptly to a nice table in the back of the dining room near the private dining room (which was full with employees from one of the companies at ces). kind of off to the side it was nice and quiet so i could talk to my parents. the table was off balance and every time we tapped it, it would tilt. one of the servers fixed that quick with a folded cocktail napkin right after i pointed it out. good. \n\nfinally unto the meal. my parents do not drink so i rarely do when dining with them. no problems. a round of diet cokes for all. typical bar soda in a high end restaurant. there were a few different servers. everyone works together. the main server brought out a tray to show of the differences in the marbling meat. from kobe beef to wagyu and the dry aged. \n\nsome breadsticks on the table were ok. the bread is awesome. pretzel bread with the different mustard's they put on the table are excellent. they served 4 other types of bread too. all fresh and flavorful. my dad loves his bread. so we had the bread guy come back and fill our plates 3 times throughout the meal. for an app we all split the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>. very tender and cooked well. enough for two not for three. \n\nthen for the steak action. i know my steaks. my first job, a week after i turned 16, was in an old school meat market. all through high school and college i worked in numerous meat departments of retail establishments. so with that said i obviously had to get the <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark> tasting. three portions, three types of cow. at the time, cut had legit a9 kobe beef from japan on the menu. they gave you 2oz. awesome! melt in your mouth. crazy flavor i have never tasted before in beef. 2nd portion was 4oz of american wagyu beef. totally different. a little more beef flavor. the last, was the 4oz portion of dry aged prime corn fed sirloin. again different in flavor and texture. most beef like and recognizable.  still a mighty fine steak. seasoned well with some s&p (salt and pepper). that's all you need for a high end steak like these. i ordered these medium. cooked fine. finished hot. some different <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> were served along side. i tried them each but the steaks did not need them.\n\nmom got a 21 day aged 8oz filet. def looked bigger. she likes it \"mooing\". she did not finish it so i took control of the situation. dad got a strip steak. not sure on the size or aging. \n\nin a nice steakhouse sides are a la carte. no prob. served family style works. we got <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>, creamed spinach with an egg on top ( which was broken and mixed in upon serving), and the <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>. everything was served at once, with multiple servers all explaining everything from the types of steaks we ordered, the sauces, and the sides. they served the sides on our plates and we enjoyed. it was steakhouse overload for me. i freaked out and sent all the staff away from me. \n\nwe were all stuffed from all the food. we did not have dessert. next time. thanks to my dad for picking up the tab, as he always does.",

(yes, the bread was that good too). my one disappointment is the overall atmosphere. the overly slick design and mirrors everywhere made me feel like i was in an hgtv show <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> of a restaurant.  when i think steakhouse, i think a little more comfortable and a little less \"sleek.\" that said, i also deplored the amount of  people taking pictures...man people, don't use flash in a restaurant, i like to eat my food without blinding. if you're so consumed by where you are, please avoid me at all costs.\n\noverall, i recommend cut if you have money to splurge but you'll be sure to enjoy your meal.",

(i really like the <mark>Warm Veal Tongue</mark> but don't want animal activist to think i'm heartless).\n\nnow the beef.  this is a true steak lovers paradise.  all of the steaks are beautifully aged, trimmed.  all are prime and above.  all steaks are at least partially grilled over charcoal for the perfect bitterness.  the steaks:\n\n-  illinois corn fed aged 21 days - good beef flavor.  bone in cuts are better.\n\n- nebraska corn fed 35 days - deep beef flavor. very nutty.  strong umame.  not for everyone but outstanding if you like very good aged beef.  the <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> is the top pick.\n\n-  american wagyu - truly outstanding.  tender and buttery.  the cuts are small but with the incredible richness, more than enough food.  do not order this beyond medium rare or it dries up and is a waste.  the <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> is the most flavorful cut.\n\n- australian wagyu - wow. nuff said.\n\nfirst time visitors should try the tasting of <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark>.  it offers an outstanding selection and gives the opportunity to try different super grades of beef.\n\nfinally, the braised short ribs deserve special mention.  if you want something different, this is it.  it is indian spiced so a bit different but absolutely fall of the bone tender.\n\ni have never tried their sauces, toppings, or sides.  naked steaks are best to me.\n\nthe wine list remains extensive.  prices are good.\n\nto those wanting the absolute best in beef, cut is without a doubt it.", 
            "whenever i'm in vegas, i always like to eat at a nice restaurant. this was my choice one year. \nwe had ordered for appetizers was the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> and <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>. these were amazing. melt-in-your-mouth goodness!!!! \nand for our entrees, i had ordered the 8 oz. <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark>/american wagyu while my bf ordered the \"a tasting of <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark>\". we both requested med-rare as how our steak should be cooked. as for the sides, we had the <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark>, creamed spinach and broccoli-rapini. and of course, a bottle of red wine(i don't remember what it was). when our steaks and sides arrived, i was excited to cut into the steak and taste the wonderfully crusted meat but to my surprise, i was disappointed and didn't like my steak at all. i like my steak crusted but not burnt!!! i didn't touch my steak for the rest of my meal but i did enjoy the wine and the sides we had ordered. i can honestly say that i will not be returning. that's only based on my steak alone bc the service was impeccable.", 
            "every bit of what a vegas steakhouse should be. little bit trendy, terrific service and mouth watering, lip smacking buttery morsels of charred cow parts. mmmm..\n\nwe had a <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> appetizer that literally melted in my mouth. not even sure how they cooked it.. slight bbq flavor. at the table i ordered the tasting of <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark> which included a true piece of wagyu.. those beautiful striations of fat were clearly visible. i've been getting annoyed with bait-and-switches elsewhere.\n\nsides were very good but nothing *that* memorable.",

            "this was my second time at cut and it was just as great as my first experience. this time i tried:\n\nthe american wagyu porterhouse -- this is a large steak. i think it was like 32 oz. i ended up splitting with one of my friends. but i can definitely eat the whole thing myself if i wanted to. the filet side was amazingly tender. unfortunately it was literally like 2 bites. the <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> portion was also very flavorful and juicy!\n\nother things i tried were the mac and cheese, brussels sprouts, creamed spinach, and fries. i'd say that the mac and cheese and brussles sprouts were my favorite. seriously the mac and cheese is amazing. i was also able to try a bite of the kobe steak sashimi, which was delicious. it melts in your mouth. the only complaint was that the sauce was a little salty, but overall a great dish.\n\non thing to note based on my 2 experiences at cut is that they tend to slightly overcook the <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark>. on both occasions anyone who ordered a <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> (medium rare) commented on the fact that it came out closer to medium. it not too big a deal since they are totally willing to accommodate, either offering a new steak or removal from the bill. i think often times they try to bring the steaks out all at the same time and with the porterhouse being much thicker, sometimes the <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> comes out a little over. honestly the steaks are so tender and juicy it really doesn't make too much a difference. despite this little flaw, cut is still one of the best steaks i've ever eaten.\n\ni still look forward to trying the 100% australian wagyu beef. one day i shall return and try that!", 
            "this is my favorite steak house in vegas.  i always get the tasting of the <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark>, side of shishito peppers and <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark>, the mac cheese is good also.  for an app i really like the crab n <mark>Maryland Blue Crab & Carolina Shrimp 'Louis' Cocktail</mark>.  the pretzel beard is delicious with their seasoned butter. pricey but well worth it.  perfect for eating solo at the bar.", 
            "my hubby and i was very excited to the cut since we are steak lovers, but we werent disappointed or happy with the food. the steaks were a 6 on the scale of 1/10. this is 10 being the best, now i had better <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> and <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> strip at a regular 2 star restaurant. i would go back for the ambiebce, and give them a second chance with the steaks. far as the service is was wonderful pasquale was our waiter and i appreciated all his information about the steaks.", 
            "service/ambiance:\n-impeccable, as you would expect from any 5 star steak restaurant. love the decor inside this location and the beverly hills one. high ceilings w/ minimal furniture. lovely.\n\nfood:\n-tasting of <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark> - three of their best cuts served in small portions. cut used to serve japanese wagyu, but now it has been replaced with australian wagyu. i'd say its comparable. the most rich flavorful steak you will ever eat.", 
            "yes i'm a meat lover.  call me a caveman, i just love to eat a big juicy steak.   being in hawaii we are a little limited to steakhouses but i have been to most of them at least once.  morton's, hy's, dk's, ruth chris, and also other with steak like kincaids, shoreside grill, and even ruby tuesdays.  well, you get the jist.   i normally will opt for a <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> whenever possible and then maybe a ny or t-bone.  i like my meat to be juicy and have some fat so i normally don't get a filet.\n\nbeing we were heading out for vegas i wanted to have a date night with my wife and get a good steak.  i asked my friend, who is a seasoned chef.  he lived and worked in vegas for some years after grad-ing from the cia and working at the greenbrier among many other accomplishments both abroad and at home.  i figured he'd be the best person to ask for an honest opinion.  he recommended a few places we could try but said if given the choice we should go to cut.  that sealed it, cut it was.  i checked open table to see if i needed to book way ahead but it seemed like we should be fine booking a day in advanced.  great considering we hardly know where we will be in vegas day to day and hour to hour.  once we were out there and could plan our schedule, we were able to lock down a reservation that would work for us.\n\nwe headed out a little early not know how long it would take me to find the parking garage and not know how far we would have to walk to get from the parking to the restaurant.  cut is in the palazzo hotel.  parking was a breeze.  they had a guard asking where you were going so i guess maybe they restrict the parking to guest and customers.  we found a parking pretty close to the elevators which is amazing for a vegas casino.  needless to say we had some time to explore before going to the restaurant.\n\nwe had a reservation at 9 and got there about 10 minutes early.  they were pretty packed.  they didn't have a regular table open yet but did offer us a table off to the side in the lounge area.  we decided to wait for a regular table, not wanting to miss out on the whole steakhouse experience.  we did go to the bar to kill our 10 minutes.  one think that irritated me at the bar was when i asked the bartender what kind of beer they had he immediately stated that they don't carry anything domestic like bud light or coors.  did i f**king say that's what i wanted??  all he had to do was provide me their drink menu, which is on an ipad for customer use.  snooty bartender,  he should be happy i payed for those drinks with my total bill and didn't have to tip him separate.\n\nonce seated we had the best service.  our waiter was chip and from what we saw, he was probably the head waiter as he was directing most of the other workers as he did his job.  he was very knowledgeable about their menu offerings and offered in-depth descriptions about everything they served.\n\nthe menu was a head turner.  they had so many things that sounded delicious.  one of those places you wished you were with a large party so you could sample more.  we decided on the <mark>Warm Asparagus</mark>, poached <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>, warm bacon vinaigrette on a focaccia bread as our appetizer.  along with that we also got  to pick from their selection of homemade breads and also got a couple or long parmesan coated breadsticks and butter puffs, or something like that.\n\nfor the main dish my wife got the indian spiced kobe beef shortribs which they slow cook for 8 hours.  they were very succulent and rich.  they had a distinct indian flavor but not too overpowering.  it was also not very spicy at all.  the meat was so tender it was almost falling off the bone.  it was actually too much for my wife to finish.\n\nafter chip had explained the different lines of meats they carried i was sure i would need to get their sampler to get the best taste of what they had to offer.  i got their \"tasting of <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark> sampler\".  it came with a 4oz of snake river farms american \"kobe\" style beef, 4oz usda prime 35 day aged, and a 2oz of blackmore ranch australian wagyu.  it also came with a medley of different sauces and spices i could add to it.  none of which i needed to use.  they season their steaks with sea salt and black pepper.  it was seasoned perfectly so that the saltiness and pepper was not too overpowering and let the flavor of the beef shine through.  it tasted amazing.  and to be able to taste these 3 different lines of beef side by side really made it easy to see and taste the difference in quality.  all being top notch but clearly easy to rank.  might make me come back for more australian wagyu on a future trip.  we also got a side of their mac and cheese that was suggested by the waiter.  talk about rich and creamy, definitely a grown up mac and cheese.\n\nif you ever are in vegas and in search of a great steakhouse.  make sure to put cut on the shortlist.  you definitely won't be disappointed.  happy eats!", 
            "great steaks! seasoned and cooked perfectly.  we ordered the steak sampler, <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark>, <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark>, and the kobe.  fantastic flavors to share.  loved the <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark>!", 
            "wow.  just wow.  if you're going to drop $250 on a dinner for two, this is how to do it.  \n\nsteaks are not easy to make well, and even the finest steakhouses can't always guarantee a flawlessly cooked steak.  but my bone-in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> was flawless--nice and fatty and tender with excellent seasoning and flavor.  even better was my wife's <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark>, which was tender and rich and meaty.  never thought a <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> could beat a <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, but i stand corrected.  the sauces were also good, but if you're a real steak lover, you don't need them.  the steaks stand their ground on their own.\n\nappetizers and sides were also knock-out good.  we ordered a burrata and prosciutto dish that was soft and flavorful, and a <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan appetizer that was meaty and rich and light, all at once.  delicious.  for sides, we got the spinach and garlic--nicely done, with lightly seasoned spinach that's cooked, not wilted--and the fingerling potatoes, which came sauteed with delicious bits of roasted garlic and chunks of thick-cut bacon.\n\nservice was also very competent, if just slightly on the overeager side.  our waitress (tara) was very friendly and extremely knowledgeable--she could probably teach a class on the marbleing of wagyu beef.  she stopped by often to chit chat and check in, which was nice, but we would have liked just a bit more privacy.\n\nall in all, a fantastic experience.  among the top three steaks i've ever had, and very possibly the best.",

            "wagyu! best guys night out spot ever.  attentive service (though a little slow) and some of the best steak i have ever had.  the company i that i brought with me wasn't in the most mature mood, but the impressive decanting process and great steaks made it worthwhile - no one joked about the food's quality.  \n\nsides and appetizers were also highlights - macaroni and cheese was so good that several of us posted immediately to facebook about it.  <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> appetizer was a huge highlight - somewhere a pig died for a very good reason (sorry, babe).  sauteed spinach also excellent and the squash was ok (yours is still better, mom!)\n\ni did the <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> sampler, and most of the others did one of the <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>.  we all loved every bite. highlight - the australian wagyu was about $300 a pound (!) and was as soft and tender as a <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>.  however, the other two were so good, that i'm not sure if it is worth it to pay the difference, unless it is a very special occasion.  \n\nmy taste buds were happy with me, my wallet wasn't, but what the heck - it's vegas - live a little.", 
            "after my outstanding experience here, it goes without saying that wolfgang puck's take on steaks is a \"cut\" above the rest!\n\ntucked inside the palazzo resort, cut exhibited a refined contemporary appeal and warmth that was both inviting and comforting.  i especially enjoyed the service by tara who made our visit feel special from the very moment we sat down. \n\nafter allowing us to peruse the menu for awhile, she returned with a cart of steaks and proceeded to give us a brief but detailed description of all their signature cuts and i must say, they all looked enticing! \n\nshortly after, we were served our wine and breads, which included the usual steakhouse suspects of fragrant & savory onion focaccia, pretzel roll, one of my personal favorites, mainly because of the firm outside texture and soft and chewy inside... and it wasn't too salty like most other pretzel breads i've come across. \nparmesan bread stick took a close second  place for its addictive light, crisp & crunchy texture with a generous coating of parmesan breading on the outside.\n\n<mark>Bone Marrow</mark> appetizer - from the buttery soft marrow to the warm, flavorful mushroom sauce, it was a blissful combination of ingredients and love. simply unbelievable. if there's one single dish from this entire trip, i will be craving for months afterwards, it will definitely be this!\n\nsteak tasting \namerican kobe style from snake river - paired with a <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark>. the beef was perfectly tender and seared beautifully leaving my mouthwatering for another juicy bite. the tangy flavor of the <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> was a perfect addition to the meat as it brought on a bright acidity to the steak. let it be known, i'm determined to get the recipe for that irresistible sauce!!!!\nusda prime dry aged - much softer and juicier than the <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark>, this cut of steak was praiseworthy in every way. honestly, it was a cut of perfection on a plate and the accompanying chimichurri sauce added a brightness to my palate that made it all the more satisfying. \naustralian wagyu from blackmore -\nworthy of it namesake, was truly the best of the best. it's like they took 50 steaks and concentrated all the beefiness into one bite. the best steak i've ever had. it came with a b\\u00e9arnaise sauce but honestly this piece needed nothing to dress it. it was perfect all on its own.\n\nwhite corn had a fresh & crunchy bite with a slightly sweet caremelized exterior that added a pleasant rustic flavor to the dish \n\ndessert\nbaked alaska - tasted like a giant strawberry mochi. btw, that's a good thing!  it also came with a small lemon bar, which had a lip puckering natural citrusy flavor!\n\nbanana creme pie came with chocolate ice cream, sauce, and chocolate crunch pearls. now that's what i call a triple chocolate threat! having said that, it was surprisingly mild and less cloyingly sweet, which i really enjoyed.\n\nbefore we left, tara gave us more sweets in the form of a chocalate truffle cookie bar and a chewy peanut brittle...both were absolutely delicious! \n\nservice was very thoughtful and the staff in general were ever present without being overbearing. but i'd have to say tara made all the difference! she transformed a pleasant meal to an unforgettable dining experience with her natural charm and warm tableside manner, which easily made the evening five stars in my book!\n\nbravo to cut for an exquisite meal and extraordinary service! \n\nyou bet ill be back for an encore! \n\nuntil then...\n\nhappy eats!",

            "i absolutely loved my experience at cut during my last visit to vegas. my friend had been several times before, and said it was a must for our last trip. i was not disappointed. we ate relatively early because we are on east coast time and it was our first night, and the restaurant was quiet and relaxed.\n\nour waiter took his time explaining the menu to me, and offered helpful suggestions. i had the beet salad to start, and it was fantastic. then, i tried the tasting of <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark> based on our waiter's recommendation. it included a sampling of american wagyu from snake river farms in idaho, usda prime aged, and true japanese wagyu. next time, i would just stick with my traditional filet and get the snake river farms filet. but for the experience, i'm glad i branched out a tried the sampler, even though i prefer filet.\n\nfor a side, i tried the <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> with shishito peppers, and thye were phenomenal. anytime i see shishito peppers on a menu, i order them. they are my favorite, and cut didn't let me down.\n\nof course i was too stuffed for dessert, but i look forward to sampling some of them next time around!", 
            "pdsf review:  parking is free (hotel parking).  decor is chic modern.  service was absolutely excellent; i sat at the bar; server checked up on me almost every 10 minutes.  food was delicious, but relative to the price, i would have to downgrade.  i got the $60 <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> steak... which was delicious, but i think $40 at ruth chris may result in the same culinary satisfaction.  there is definitely an upcharge for the name and the prestige of eating at cut.  however, the 3 <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> and salt were a great optional add-on.  will not go back.", 
            "3 words.... to die for! what an amazing restaurant. the ambiance is classy, the staff was friendly and knowledgeable and the food was unbelievable. coming from los angeles, our standards for steakhouses are very high and they met the challenge without a sweat. it was hard to decide what to eat because the entire menu was unique and interesting. for starters my husband had the <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark> salad with the most amazing champagne-herb vinaigrette we have ever had. i had a unique beet salad with humboldt fog goat cheese and the flavors blended perfectly. for our steaks it was hard to pick just one (which by the way, they do a tasting of 3 as well...which would be smart if you have never had wagyu before, totally worth it). he had the filet and i had the <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark> of their american wagyu beef from snake river farms idaho. amazing!!! if you are a mushroom person, i would recommend adding this on your steak, the flavors were perfect. for dessert, he had the chocolate souffle and i had the cheese plate, both of which were a perfect ending to a perfect evening. \nthank you to the executive chef and the staff for a memorable last night in vegas for us!",

            "it was sunday night. the last night of our three day binge of vegas to celebrate my 30th birthday and the close of my \"roaring twenties\" decade.\n\nwhere does one go for their last meal in vegas let alone the last meal of their decade? \n\nbeing the dedicated researcher that i am, i found that cut by wolfgang puck had the reputation of being one of the best steak houses in vegas, if not the country. i took a chance and booked this restaurant as the capstone of my trip and hopefully a delicious finish to the decade.\n\nand boy, did it not disappoint.\n\nwhen we arrived, my buddies and i were ushered by a young, pretty hostess to a vip table with couch seating replete with accent pillows overlooking the entire restaurant; almost as if we were seated at the head table and the entire restaurant was attending our party. we opened a parsimonious menu that listed a total of approximately 18 entrees, all steaks, all aged between 21-35 days. one of my buddies ordered the nebraska cattle 14 oz <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> strip (aged 35 days). he was a big guy yet he was barely able to finish his meal.\n\nnow allow me to get to the most important part... the pi\\u00e8ce de r\\u00e9sistance of their menu: authentic wagyu beef imported from japan's miyazaki prefecture. \n\nour server presented our table raw wagyu and \"american wagyu\" (composed of a cross breed of wagyu and american cattle) cuts of <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> and <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> strip to demonstrate the marbling of these impressive specimens of meat. an opportunity was presented for me to check off one of the loftiest items on my bucket list: a wagyu steak dinner. the price of an 8 oz <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> cut of one of the most sought-after steaks on the planet? a cool $155. \n\ndespite the high cost of this privilege, i couldn't turn down an opportunity to enjoy what would likely be one of the greatest meals of my life. another buddy of mine took the plunge with me on this life-changing experience. we both ordered identical items: the 8 oz <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> (medium rare), a side of seasoned french fries, and creamed spinach topped with a <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> accompanied with a glass of malbec. solomon in all his riches never could have ordered a more decadent meal.\n\n40 excruciating minutes later, our meal was at last presented to us. i sliced off my first piece and as i completed the first bite, it felt like the heavens burst forth and angels were singing the hallelujah chorus in rapturous praise. fellow yelpers, i was not eating a steak. oh no. this was god speaking to us. delighting in us. cutting into the steak was like cutting into marbled butter from heaven, with the meat dissolving in my mouth; absorbing into my very soul.\n\n***\n\nt'was a meal that i will never forget. as we finished paying our bill, the manager of the restaurant came and thanked us for patronizing his restaurant though i'm sure it should've been us thanking him. a wonderful meal to cap off a wonderful decade. i'm not sure how many more decades the good lord has in store for me. however, if he should choose to allow me to choose my final meal on this earth, i would like to travel back to this restaurant and enjoy one more time that which is truly a gift from on high.",

            "hands down the best culinary experience of my life.\n\ni know i've reviewed a couple of steakhouses, but this place is by far one of the best meals i've had. my fiancee and i were super excited to come here for his birthday dinner, since we're both such steak lovers. \n\nwe were seated the minute we arrived, which was amazing, because typically steakhouses make you wait 10 minutes past your reservation time (i never understood why). immediately, we had our waiter and another server take care of our utensils and water glasses; i can honestly go on and on about how impeccable the service was at this place. they really have all of the fine details down when it comes to customer service, which added to the amazing experience. \n\nwe both started off with caesar salad, which wasn't on the menu, but our waitress was more than happy to have the salads prepared for us. the salad was prepared on <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark>, and topped with amazing shavings of parmesan cheese, creamy caesar dressing, and anchovies. you could really taste the quality of the ingredients used. the salad also came with two bruschettas topped with what tasted like garlic aioli, fresh cherry tomatoes, and basil. very delicious! we were also served different types of bread, four different kinds to choose from to be exact, and you could ask for as many as you wanted. \n\nfor the main dishes, we ordered the 35 day aged <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark>, 21 day aged bone in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, cavatappi pasta \"mac & cheese\", and <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark> (no,we couldn't finish it). wow. best steak ever. i definitely couldn't finish it all, but i did save some room for the delicious mac and cheese (i highly recommend ordering this side dish!). i'm not a fan of <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>, but i absolutely loved these <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>. the batter was very light and super crisp, which you don't typically find with <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>. \n\nsince it was my fiancee's birthday, the restaurant provided banana cream pie for dessert. the dish was accompanied with creme brulee, chocolate sauce, and roasted banana gelato; it was rich but super light at the same time.\n\ni highly recommend this restaurant for a special date night or celebration. you will not be disappointed.",

(yes, omaha).\n\nthe service was impeccable. what really set it apart for me is when i was looking for a spot to set down an empty appetizer tray and the sommelier - not a busser or waiter - grabbed it and bussed it. really impressive.\n\nall the food was up to the highest steakhouse standards. i didn't spring for kobe beef but i didn't regret that. my steak was excellent and cooked as ordered.\n\nwe had a large group, ~18, and they did a great job accommodating us at two neighboring tables.",

            "finally, a modern streak house thanks to mr. puck. make sure to make a reservation since seating is limited. eating at wolfgang restaurants can be cliche as far as what's expected, but cut is mind blowing for endless reasons. the service was impeccable since brian, my waiter really worked and expressed his efforts. although i felt bad since he was seating, he really did try his best. everyone was extremely attentive. \n\nthe ambiance is very dark/intimate but i also felt a modern office type of vibe. i thought it was rather tacky that there were large framed portfolio head shots around the restaurant of actors such as brad pitt. really threw me off since the concept of the restaurant did not mesh well with those portraits. who cares ? \n\nthe bar area is very tight, it was too small for my liking. \n\nthe food is ultimately what one should care about. be warned to throw them benjamin's for a quick sensation in that mouth that is worth it. as soon as you are, like all wolf gang establishments, you are greeted with an assortment of breads. \n\nlooking at the menu may seem daunting but don't stress out, just order something that won't surprise you. there are many cuts of meat that are offered but it would be best to order the waygu. it's hard to describe through words but wow, it was very tender. it was also a generous cut. \n\nsadly, i was not a fan of paying $2.00 for dressing up the meat aka you get to choose from the following...\n\n<mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark>       \n<mark>Wasabi-Yuzu Kosho Butter</mark>       \n<mark>Shallot-Red Wine Bordelaise</mark>       \narmagnac & <mark>Armagnac & Green Peppercorn</mark>       \n<mark>Argentinean Chimichurri</mark>       \n<mark>Creamy Horseradish</mark>       \nb\\u00e9arnaise  \n\ni was not trying to f up my order by exploring different sauces so i was smart enough to pick something i am familiar with which was the chimichurri. it went perfectly with the waygu. if you are on a budget, the u.s.d.a. prime, \"double r ranch\", loomis, washington, corn fed, aged 28 days <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark> 12 oz is another good option. \n\nthe side options were not that impressive, as far as the options go. i couldn't go wrong by ordering the <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>. yes, this intact did melt in my mouth. very rich and creamy. \n\ni also recommend the  <mark>Pan Roasted Stonington Maine Lobster</mark>, maryland blue crab & carolina shrimp \"louis\" cocktail, spicy tomato-horseradish. the combinations of this palter worked really well and the presentation was very impressive. this actually takes a long time for preparation which you will understand why after that first sip. \n\ni don't know if i would return here just because there are too many other restaurant's to experience. i have not a single complaint.", 
            "this place is absolutely amazing. from the d\\u00e9cor to the customer service to the taste everything is nothing short of spectacular. granted, given the price, it's not something many people could have on a regular basis. but if you're looking for a fancy night out, a special dinner, this has to be on your list of considerations. \nthe wagyu sashimi is a starter you have to try. super tender, not overly seasoned, it's more filling than it looks. \nthe crab cakes are also super fresh and delicious. \ni was recommended the taste of <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark>, which is a sample of their different steaks. although they're all really good, i would recommend skipping it and just going for the 100% japanese wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>. definitely take advantage of the additional ounce option for a better deal. the texture of the meat is unlike anything you've ever tried, guaranteed. the add ons i'm actually not too fond of, but to each their own.", 
            "i came here with my colleagues for a celebration dinner and we all truly loved the meal. cut includes great little touches such as amazing pretzel bread and tasty parmesan cheese sticks before the meal and warm cookies served after dessert. the wine and champagne were delicious and the service was impeccable, but the food really stole the show! \n\ni had the burrata appetizer and it was melt-in-your-mouth creamy and delicious; a fantastic combination of flavors. i also ate about five of the pretzel rolls, which i started to regret once the entrees and sides rolled out. but they were really delicious so i didn't regret it thatttt much.  \n\nfor my meal i ordered the japanese wagyu <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> cut and as the waiters described it was incredibly tender. it does melt in your mouth but i found that sensation was mostly because the meat has so much marbling. i actually preferred my colleague's wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> because it was less fatty. \n\nwe ordered the following sides:\n--creamed spinach with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>- creamed spinach is my go-to steak side dish and this one did not disappoint\n--cavatappi pasta mac & cheese- easily some of the best mac and cheese i've ever tasted\n--<mark>Soft Polenta with Parmesan</mark>- good but not the best\n\nand desserts, all of which were fantastic:\n--creamsicle baked alaska\n--fuji apple & medjool date crumble\n--valrhona chocolate souffl\\u00e9\n--banana cream pie\n\noverall i'd highly recommend cut for a special night out on the town.", 
            "i did not think that this restaurant was anything special. far from it. i was expecting an amazing cut of steak that was seasoned to perfection and could be cut with a butter knife. boy was i wrong....\n\ni will say that the atmosphere is nice, but, i did not like that each place setting was resting on a place mat that looked like it belonged at an outdoor patio table. the knives were also fairly dull, it was very hard to cut my steak with it. \n\ni ordered the nebraska <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> strip 14oz as medium rare ($57), when it arrived along with our sides (man and cheese, <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>, and seasoned asparagus) i was disappointed. the steak was bland with little to no seasoning. i had to coat it with some sea salt, cracked pepper, and a little butter. \n\nthe asparagus was not tender enough and lacked any real flavors. i was in shock when the bill arrived and i noticed that 7 stalks of asparagus cost $21!! the mac and cheese was nothing to write home about either, it was $19 for a decent sized portion. the <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> was bland, it literally tasted like mucky potato and cost $12. \n\ni know we were going with the expectation of spending a lot of money, but for the money i was hoping to be blown away. i still believe that a place like longhorn steakhouse or texas roadhouse had better tasting steak.\n\nif you are looking to spend and arm and a leg for sub-par food, then i would suggest going to cut.", 
            "at one point, this might have been a wolfgang puck establishment, but it's now slid into being a wolfgang suck establishment. *chortle*\n\nwe came here for a friend's bachelor party, because he'd specifically requested that we get a great steak. the place he chose to get it at was cut. we put on our fly gear, and headed on over. our reservation was honored, and we were prepared to have a great meal that was befitting of the weight of the celebrity chef's name and the hefty price tag.\n\none of my friends ordered a caesar salad, that he said was great, but pricey. he also got the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> appetizer which we all agreed was amazing. \n\nthen the meatsplainer (not his official title, as far as i know) came out to illustrate what each cut of steak looked like, and the marbling characteristics of each of the various dry-aging lengths. i went with the 14 oz. 35-day dry aged <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark>. to complement it, i chose 2 sauces: the <mark>Wasabi-Yuzu Kosho Butter</mark>, (which is actually wasabi yuzu<mark>Wasabi-Yuzu Kosho Butter</mark>. yuzukosho is a fermented paste made with yuzu, a japanese citrus fruit, and kosho, chili peppers. if you're ever at an izakaya, it's the green paste that isn't wasabi.) and the red <mark>Shallot-Red Wine Bordelaise</mark>.\n\nbefore our steaks arrived, we were treated to a number of delicious breads. first some long pretzel sticks, second was a basket of really good cheese bread, (a much better version of the stuff that you get at a churrascurria) and last was a selection of bread that we were supposed to use with this roesmary, roasted black pepper, and french salt butter. i was totally jazzed about that.  it turns out that the butter's basically flavorless unless you get it with the small patch of seasoning that's on top of it. this would be a harbinger of things to come...\n\ni tend to like my steaks a little more cooked than most people, but when ours arrived, even my sensibilities were on alert when i saw the dry mass of meat on my plate. the menu says that they sear their steaks in a 1200 degree broiler. that hunk of flesh on my plate wasn't seared, it was charred. unfortunately, our table had enacted harsh penalties for cell-phone usage during the meal, so i have no photographic proof of this calamity, but, i think everyone was kind of disappointed by the way their steak looked.\n\ni cut into mine, and while it was tender, it was bland. one of the guys in our group would say afterwards, \"you want to take that first bite of steak, and to just be like 'oh my god, this is amazing', and that didn't happen.\" no seasoning on the steaks as far as i could tell. maybe it all got burnt off. who knows.\n\ni used the entirety of the butter sauce on my steak. the boredelaise sauce was pretty good, but since my steak had no moisture to speak of, i needed to put the richness back in. it's great that the sauces are good, but it seemed like my steak was just a vehicle for sauce. i could have had chicken and it honestly wouldn't have changed my experience at all. i would have been equally disappointed by the food.\n\nwe chose 4 sides to go with our food, fingerling potatoes, sauteed baby spinach and garlic, artichokes, and mac & cheese. our waiter had told us that these sides were large, and sharable. they're tiny and overpriced. i think our group of 8 maybe got a spoonful of each. the artichokes were ok, but that was mainly because of the bacon. there were maybe 30 fingerling potato halves on the plate. that's not a lot of potatoes. they were ok, i was using them to figure out which sauces i liked best, but that was like $16. in what world can you justify charging 50 cents for a single steak fry? the spinach was freaking pathetic. boiled spinach with undetectable garlic. if there's ever a version of throwdown against wolfgang puck, i'm going to challenge him to make his sauteed spinach with garlic, and i'm going to win by unanimous decision.\n\nthe service was great, i have no complaints about any of that. this review is all based on what i feel was an average steak at high-end steak prices. i asked my friends afterwards what they thought, fully expecting that this group of more savvy steak connoisseurs would tell me how much better their choices were, but to a man, the entire group said that it was \"just ok\". this wasn't the worst steak i've ever had (that distinction is held by delmonico's...which is oddly enough in the same section of this hotel...) but it's definitely in that bottom tier.\n\nwould not recommend for any occasion.", 
            "cut ranks among the top steakhouses in vegas for me. sw and cut are my go to places for a special occasion steak dinner.  my most recent visit was by far my favorite, and it probably had something to do with consuming 8 oz of japanese wagyu. i think it has ruined steak for me forever.\nmy husband decided to take out one of his clients to dinner and we opted for cut located inside of the palazzo. the decor isn't mind blowing and it is pretty straight forward, but the food makes up for it. i also was not super impressed with our server.  we started off with a bottle of wine ($75 a cab of client's choosing) and american wagyu beef sashimi. the appetizer was okay, and i would probably opt for something else at my next visit. they brought bread regularly and although not overly busy, the service seemed very slow and almost disorganized. we were able to start a second bottle of wine by the time our server came by to take our full order and go into his spiel about different types of steaks, the marbling, aging process, etc. \n\ni went with 8 oz <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> true japanese 100% wagyu beef from satsuma prefecture, kagoshima, japan. it is initially offered at about $140 for the 6 ozs and then each additional 2 ozs are about $40. well worth it getting the extra 2 ozs, and if you are splurging you may as well leave full. this was the most delicious piece of meat i have (or probably) will ever have. i know that i had a side as well, but everything faded out during that first bite of the buttery, savory goodness that was the steak. \n\nmy husband had the american wagyu and it was amazing how appreciable the difference in taste and texture was between the two. we topped off the great meal with some gelato. well, i am glad my birthday is coming up!", 
            "most amazing steakhouse ever. we went in march, and it was simply amazing. it may be a little price-y, but it's worth the splurge! we had the kobe steak and a friend had the <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> strip. so delicious.", 
            "we dined here for my bachelor party and it was excellent. the service was top notch. the decor is impeccable and steaks were fabulous. we had the steak \"tasting of <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark>\" which featured a japanese wagyu and american wagyu. ( american wagyu from snake river farms 4 oz* + u.s.d.a. prime dry aged 35 days 4 oz* + true japanese 100% wagyu beef from satsuma prefecture, kagoshima 2 oz* ). \n\nthe japanese wagyu was out of this world good. it blew the other two away though the american wagyu was quite good but in comparison paled to its japanese counterpart. \n\nthe sommelier was excellent and provided great wines to pair with our steaks. \n\na++", 
            "there is no possible way this place gets anything less than 5 stars.  from the service to the food it was all pretty much perfect. upon arrival we were seated immediately with napkins placed in our laps.  we were given some kind of parmesan sticks that were delicious followed by some unreal cheese puffs.  i got up to use the bathroom and came back to a brand new napkin lol.  i ordered the bone-<mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark>, mushrooms & peppers with a whiskey flight.   my bill total came to $102 and it was well worth it. the steak was charred perfectly and had unbelievable flavor. can't wait to go back when i'm back in town!", 
            "food and service is excellent. wine selection is good but lack of variety compared to other high end steak house. i had 35 days dry aged <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> 10oz steak and <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan. it was outstanding. \n\nnothing negative, it was awkward and funny for me that waiter bring raw meat to you to explain the difference and excellence of their meat selection. i think it's too much to show customer stack of meat on a huge tray. it was hilarious.", 
            "i did not expect such wonderful service and excellent food at this restaurant. i highly recommend it if you love steak. the prices are high but completely worth it. we made a group reservation and they attended us right away. i had the <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark>. absolutely delicious! i also like their selection of sample breads that our server was passing around. would definitely come again if i'm back in vegas", 
            "this is the third wolfgang puck restaurant i've been to and for the third time i was not dissapointed! appetizers were amazing, beef selection was spectacular and service was outstanding!\n\ntreated myself to the wagu <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> sttrip and was amazed at the quality of the steak.... was cooked perfectly, and not over seasoned as some places do. also tried a couple of their signature sauces... baronaise and cracked peppercorn.... whipped mashed potatoes and brussel sprouts. \n\nwine selection was pretty impressive as well... the service was excellent and even included personalized wine service. the gentelman actually took the time to season each glass for all members of our party before pouring.\n\nif you are looking for an incredible meal in vegas you'll do well to find yourself at cut! the prices are high but the quality makes it a worthwhile expenditure.", 
            "loved this place, good for steaks!  steaks galore, i had no issues with the service and servers we're continuously checking on us for water, bread, sauces, etc.  i ordered the <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark> 14oz, with sides of mac n' cheese, mashed potatoes and saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms with 3 different types of <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> to sample.  steak cooked to perfection and enjoyed every bite."

            "first off... 4.5 stars... it was very good. the food is excellent. everything i had was very good to excellent. i got the american wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> and was not disappointed (well, it was a thinner cut than i expected but that didn't affect the quality). this is what a steak should taste like. the appetizers were terrific and the chocolate souffl was really good although i was so full by then i could barely eat it. one thing you must try is the bavarian pretzel that is offered from the bread selection - it is fantastic! the service was friendly and surprisingly casual. after receiving our menus we never really felt ignored or had to wait for anything. the sommelier was very knowledgeable and made some good suggestions but a tad too many to begin with. we were very happy with the wine we eventually chose.\n\nthe atmosphere is modern and very hip. this is a typical \"upscale\" vegas restaurant - you see people in everything from suits to t-shirts to shorts (yes, i'm talking about you... the guy with the woman dressed to the nines - can't you at least clean it up for dinner??). probably not a great place to take kids but really there aren't many nice restaurants in vegas that are. parking is not a problem as they offer valet at the hotel.\n\ngreat food doesn't come cheap and this is no exception. if you're willing to drop a couple franklins per person on a terrific dinner and you love great steak this is not to be missed.", 
            "the biggest strike against this restaurant was the intrusive wait staff.  they made a nonstop effort to up-sell menu items:\n\"since you have a large party, we have some great wines in large-format bottles that might make the most sense for you.\" ($200+)\n\"if you're interested in kobe style beef your best choice is probably the steak tasting.\" ($160)\n\"actually, our most premium beer is chimay blue.  would you like that <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark>?\"   (i love chimay, but is \"most premium\" really supposed to be my selection criteria?  what does that even mean?)\n\nthe food was generally tasty, not all of the steak came as ordered, and i would have appreciated a complimentary cheeseburger with my $12 fries.", 
            "the bf and i really enjoyed our dinner here.\nwe started off with the sweet corn and fava bean salad as well as the oxtail boullion with <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> dumplings. both were fantastic!\n\nfor entrees, the bf opted for the 20 oz bone-in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> and i sampled the 8 oz <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark>. again, both were really good but i liked mine just alittle tad more.\n\nwe also ordered a side of the fries and broccolini. \n\nwe were too stuffed for dessert but next time we will try to make room/\n\nservice was awesome too! our waiter recommended a terrific $22 glass of merlot. thank you!",

            "as a self-proclaimed beef connoisseur, i'm always in search of that amazing steak that will just blow your mind.  indeed, i browse the beef section at every market just to check the quality and marbling of their steaks.\n\nin my mind, the \"perfect\" steak has always come down to a 28-35 day, dry-aged, usda prime <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, cooked rare to medium rare with a dash of sea-salt and fresh ground black pepper (what can i say, i'm a purist).\n\ntoday, i say with good authority... that the perfect steak... is whatever they're serving over there at cut.\n\nwell lets get some context - we started off the evening getting a couple of cocktails at the bar while watching usc football dominate ohio.  i look to my left and who should be standing next to me?  wolfgang mother-effen puck!!!  yes, wolfgang puck hangs out at his own restaurant and apparently was routing for usc - go figure.\n\nambiance of the restaurant is great.  suitable contemporary decor for a more modern steakhouse.  lets get down to the food:\n\nthe bad:\nthe side dishes are horrible.  \nherb fries... absolutely nothing special.  \ncheese polenta... quite disgusting.  \ncream of spinach... not much better than what you can get in the frozen food section.  \nfingerling potatoes... are actually quite decent.\n\n\nthe good:\nthey have an amazing mult-course assortment of bread starting with breadsticks, baked cheeseballs, onion bread, and my personal favorite, the pretzels.\n\nthe amazing:\nif you're not planning on having a steak, don't come here.  in fact, i'll take it one step further and say if you're not planning on having kobe beef... don't come here.  the regular usda prime steaks are great, but you'll find steaks of similar caliber elsewhere.  the two people who vouched for mere usda prime <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> were torn with regret by not spending the extra $25 for the \"kobe beef\" upgrade.\n\npersonally, i can only speak for the medium grade kobe (american-raised wagyu cattle).   unbelievable flavorful and tender  they say kobe beef melts in your mouth, and honestly, it really does.  i tried a bite of my friends usda prime <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, and i swear... after having a bite of wagyu beef, dry-aged usda prime meat taste like sizzler.  $85 for an ala carte 10 oz <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> american wakyu steak may seem steep, but in this case, you really do get what you pay for.\n\nmost people got the taste of <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> sampler which included 2 oz of authentic japanese kobe beef, 4 oz of american wagyu, and 4 oz of usda prime.  of course, the purpose is show americans how deprived we are by having mere \"steak,\" while our japanese friends have \"steak!\"  the taste of this culinary sampler - $140 for 10 oz of meat.  yep, $14 an oz.  \n\nbut according to all those who ordered the sampler, the difference between japanese kobe and american kobe... is even bigger and more noticeable than the difference between american kobe and usda prime.  in other words, i have still yet to taste the best of the best.\n\noh wolfgang puck, why must you torment me so with your ridiculously expensive, but oh so delicious cuts of kobe beef?\n\nthe total cost for 11 of us... almost $2,000.", 
            "this place is ... interesting. \n\nyou're seated on fancy, swiveling conference room chairs inside a really swank space (vegas restaurants kick la restaurants' asses in this respect). \n\nmaybe wolfgang thought the restaurant was too pretty for a steakhouse and decided to add more manliness to the establishment by hiring a wait staff completely devoid of uteruses. these men in black are awesome, though, and the service is what you'd expect for a meal that costs as much as an ikea sofa.\n\nmeal-wise this place is all about the wagyu, japanese or american. if you don't get this looking at the menu, they hammer the point home by carrying an armload of wagyu to your table, so they can dazzle you with the marbling. \n\ni've had japanese wagyu in both japan and the states, and while i've come close to weeping with joy several of those times, i didn't feel compelled to shell out $160 for an 8oz <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>. so i went with a 20 oz bone in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> from illinois, much to the chagrin of our waiter. the girlfriend got an american wagyu sirloin. my <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> was decent, but not great (damn you, illinois!). the american wagyu, however, was awesome. \n\nthe appetizers were okay, but the side dishes were amazing. i found it annoying that they charged for sauces. they bring you an assortment of sauces for free anyway. can't tell you about dessert, because we were so stuffed that even an extra molecule of souffl\\u00e9 would've given me a hernia.", 
            "i really liked cut. i understand going in that it's expensive but i thought it was really good. the service was ridiculously good. water glass filled constantly, waiter coming by to check on us numerous times, and the bread waiter came by three times to offer his goods. my bone in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> was cooked perfectly. i got the bernaise sauce on the side and it was great. the mac & cheese was fantastic. i have nothing but positive things to say and would go back again.", 
            "i think the hype for this restaurant dampened my experience. the interior was nice, very roomy, love the decor, simple yet classy. and the service was excellent, the server was very charming :-) so one star for that. they have a wide selection of wine and drinks. but for the price of over $100 a person, the <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> ($61) was a lil overcooked, and the <mark>Caramelized Onions</mark> contained too much honey, making it for a overpowering sweetened flavor. i ordered the true japanese wagyu beef from kagoshima ($160) and although i know that it is suppose to be so fatty and that's why people enjoy it, i personally felt that it was way too fatty towards the end, and couldn't finish it because it upset my stomach. i don't really know how anyone can finish a whole one to themselves. i guess it would've tasted better if it was shared where everyone takes only a bite or two . the lamb chop ($48) was waaaayyy too overcooked, but yet we saw many tables ordering it. although i don't particularly enjoy flan, everyone seemed to have thoroughly enjoyed the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan with mushroom marmalade and parseley salad. most of the sides with your entree is about $12-13 each side, the <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>, <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>, sweet <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>, french fries, <mark>Soft Polenta with Parmesan</mark>, creamed spinach with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>...etc were good but i felt that it was nothing special.   their garlic bread appetizer and tuna tartar was delicious but not worth $24 a plate. the shrimp  in the <mark>Maryland Blue Crab & Carolina Shrimp 'Louis' Cocktail</mark> was not fresh and i've had better garlic fries at gordan biersh.the one appetizer we ordered 3 plates of, one after another, because it was sooo amazing was the kobe steak sashimi (definitely worth $22 a plate, and i suggest this is a must try! but for those that don't like eating raw meat, trust... it'll change your whole view on it) - overall great experience, but i just feel that it is nothing special especially for how costly it is- and too much hype.", 
            "i love cut!!!! this was my second visit to cut and i fell in love all over again. its pricey but since the first time was so goood, i had to come again and make sure i wasn't dreaming before... here's why cut's sooo great:\n\nservice:  the waiters and waitresses go above and beyond to make sure their guests have a wonderful experience. they're attentive and came right over when they felt like we wanted/needed something. my friend and i ordered a bottle of riesling and loved it. unfortunately, we forgot to get the winery it was from and decided to ask the waiter. he wasted no time to find the name for us and came back with all the information we would need in a fancy little envelope. the little things people do always make a big difference. \n\nfood: the bread is delicious!! there's a man that comes around with a platter of different types of breads you can try. i've tried all of them and my faves are the onion bread and the pretzel. so good. we got two appetizers, <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> and kobe sliders. the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> was pretty good, it was very creamy and topped with a sauce that added some saltiness to the dish. the kobe sliders were topped with sweet pickles and sauteed onions. the meat was soft (of course). for the main dishes, my friend ordered a 20 oz. usda bone-in rib-eye with <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>. it was huge!!!! it was cooked perfectly to his liking. my other friend ordered kobe spare ribs. she said that the meat was nice and soft too, but the flavoring wasn't her style. i got the japanese kobe wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> with <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>. omg. like butter, probably because there was fat throughout the meat. it was soft, very, very, very soft. i mean, i knew that japanese wagyu meat was soft, but this practically melted in my mouth. i'm still contemplated whether it was a bit too soft... haha. i dunno. the first time i came i had the american kobe <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> and i might like that one more just because i don't feel like i'm eating butter... :)\n\nanyway, cut is amazing. i have vowed to come back once a year, as long as i'm not broke, of course.", 
            "the good thing about this place is everything but the steaks and waiter. the salad, bread, and dessert, and side dishes were superb. the steak tasted like a $15 steak. i guess it's the way they cook it-- which was meeh for me. once i got my steak, my mouth dropped. the outside of the steak was black. it was burnt! i was so disappointed. i told the waiter and <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> of apologizing, he was defending himself and saying how that's the way the steak is supposed to be. what an ass. i'm paying a lot for my steak and i should at least have an opportunity to enjoy it! the worst waiter ever. although everything but the steak was good, i give it 2 stars due to the fact that this steakhouse can't even perfect a steak (well, it is a steakhouse after all!) and the waiter was a douche bag.", 
            "my boyfriend brought me here for my birthday back in october 2008.  one word: amazing.  i had the japanese wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, and it literally melted in my mouth.  the meat was so tender and so fatty - it was unbelievably delicious.  at first, i could not imagine what type of meat would cost $160 for 6oz, but one bite of this completely blew me away.  a few more bites of this filled me up, as the meat was so rich.  luckily, my boyfriend had the traditional usda prime <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> 16oz so we shared our meats.  for those who has no one to share with, i would recommend the tasting menu (japanese wagyu from kagoshima prefecture 2 oz, american \"kobe style\" from snake river farms 4 oz, u.s.d.a. prime dry age from nebraska 4 oz) so you have a sampling of all 3 levels of meats and you will not be overwhelmed by the wagyu.  \n\nthe quality of the meats was great, and obviously this was a very expensive meal.  without any appetizers, wine, sides, or dessert, our bill came out to be almost $300.  oh, they also bring around a bread basket in the beginning, and you have the option of many many different types of breads.  they were all delicious!  there was also some complimentary dessert and they were just as amazing.\n\noverall, this was a great dining experience.  i've been to quite a good number of steakhouses, and this is my favorite so far.  i plan to come back here again and also visit the one in beverly hills since i'm from la.  oh, i dont remember why we didnt have wine but please make sure you have some with your steak.", 
            "when cut first opened in vegas, i was dying to go, what with all the hype behind the beverly hills location.  so, for my fifth wedding anniversary, i took the plunge.  \n\n5 stars for service - we had early (5:30pm...babysitter scheduling) reservations, but we arrived about 20 minutes late.  no problem.  after checking in with the hostess, we were seated immediately.  not even a 10 seconds went by, then our waiter introduced himself.  throughout the night, we were constantly checked on and our water glasses were never empty (we had tap, not bottled).  we ate fast (total meal clocked in at about 2 hours), but at no time were we ever rushed or felt rushed.  the pacing of the dishes matched our eating and they gave ample time between courses to digest.  great front-back of house communication!\n\n4 stars for food - as an amuse bouche, they sent out these cheddar cheese puffs.  no, they're not like cheetos, but they tasted like red lobster chef muffins.  wonderful.  too bad those weren't on the bread tray!  my wife ordered the fava bean and artichoke salad to start, which was surprisingly unappealing.  i'm not a bean fan, so i'm probably just biased.  my wife wished she had ordered something else.  i had the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>.  that was the most incredible appetizer i have eaten in the past year.  the texture was a bit tough on one side (let's call it \"crispy\"), but that took nothing away from the aromas and flavors.  i could have had that as my meal.  the breads and parmesan sticks were good, but nothing extraordinary.  we both had 16 ounce nebraska <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> booked med-rare.  it was juicy and flavorful, but there was a slight bit too much pepper (which counteracted the wine) and the char was slightly thick.  all in all, a good steak, but nothing phenomenal (stripsteak and smith & wollensky do it for me).  for desert, we ordered a strawberry shortcake (the shortcake looked like a biscuit but was surprisingly light and fluffy)  and chocolate souffle (it looked like it would overly sweet and rich, but was a perfect balance).  both were decadent, but not otherworldly (lutece is still the benchmark).  \n\n5 stars for wine service - while the wine list wasn't value oriented (why should it be when a steak runs $60?), there were some interesting buys.  being that my wife doesn't drink, i was looking for order off the by the glass list.  well, they really didn't have anything good and i wasn't about to pay $20 for a glass of something that i can buy at the grocery store for $15,  so i looked at half-bottles.  the pickings were slim there, too.  i ended up buying a full bottle of 1998 leeuwin art series cabernet sauvignon for $85.  not cheap, but a bargain compared to the half bottle of 2005 ramey cabernet for $80.  even thought i ordered a relatively cheap wine, they treated it and me with respect and decanted it well.  \n\nall in all, it was a good meal made great by fantastic service.", 
            "the best steak i have ever had in my life.\n\nmind you i don't frequent steakhouses that cost more than 100 a head so obviously it was a special treat. but seriously, foods ive never heard of and steaks ive never tasted ever. the service is pretty good. we go a bottle of shiraz and the guy took like 10 min opening and pouring the wine for us. (he did this thing were he \"primed\" the glasses with a little wine) then we each got appetizers. i got a <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan which was the oddest/most delicious thing i had...til i got my 20oz bone in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>...mmmmm. we also got a couple sides which were ok. they also give you breads which you must get the pretzel roll. by the end of the meal we were all struggling to move. we didn't even go to a club because we were in such bad food comas... \n\nobviously unless i'm making some serious cash i'm not going here frequently but when in vegas sometimes you are allowed to splurge.", 
            "in the palazzo hotel las vegas, wolfgang's cut opened with ultra slick  dining room decor and great attention to detail. im not a huge fan or wasn't a huge fan of chef puck  but whoa this steakhouse is incredible. most possibly due to the amount of energy and detail going into the service here. \n\nwe threw down for the kobe ribe eye! $140 big ones. incredible experience. i'm not sure if i would do it again however...kobe steak has a very soft i would say foie gras-esque texture. a teeny tad bit over bearing if you want to get into a good texture of steak. ahh i know ! get your friend that doesn't or hasn't tried it to order it..come on you can convince them with the ol' \" you have to try everything once in your lifetime \" line...then you order the <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> which was also masterfully done. even their cornfed iowa steak offerings are as good as you will get. \nalso did a ton of appetizers which is our 'm.o.' seafood salad was a standout ! \ndesserts...masterfully done...i actually base my <mark>Whole Roasted French Loup De Mer</mark> around getting to dessert.\noverall damage with wine : 6 people $850\n\nonly reason it doesn't get the 5 star is the items on the menu don't stretch out into the creativity zone. this was a religious steak experience by all counts however. what they do there at cut they do well...damn well ! a definite check out !", 
            "i have had the pleasure of having dinner at both cut three times over the last three months.  while i believe cut's food is near the best in las vegas, i actually believed delmonico's had a slight edge with service and i am just a big fan of <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> in general.  \nhowever, this past week, the impeccable service at cut made me a true believer.  the general manager gianni toffonello is extremely professional and did all the small things necessary to make our dining experience truly amazing.  \nwe were there last night to treat our good friend to one last blissful dinner before his deployment to afghanistan.  among the people in our group, we tried the japanese kobe, american wagyu filet, and waygu <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark>.  the quality of the beef was apparent with each bite.  and most importantly, there was no flaw in the service.  i am a huge believer in customer service and i believe that when my friends and me are treated with respect, it makes me want to share my excitement about the restaurant with the rest of the world.\ni have no doubt that i will be returning to cut during my next trip to las vegas.  it is now a staple of any vegas trip.", 
            "there is something to be said about a restaurant when your favorite dish is only a starter. it's like watching a movie with a great beginning but only to fall short at then ending leaving the viewer unsatisfied and wondering what happened?\n\nwhen a starter is so great, it sets the pace for the rest of the meal -- thinking that everything after can only get better. wrong. my so's <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, as he described it, was \"charcoal on a stick...\" my filet was kinda tough, dry and lacked flavor. totally not like the bone-in filet at mastro's. at mastros, it's so tender and velvety and melts right in your mouth. mmmm... mastro's.... oh wait, this is cut.\n\nthe starters: weiser farm's cavallon melon, prosciutto di parma, fresh burrata cheese, tuscan olive oil & the <mark><mark>Bone Marrow</mark> Flan, Mushroom Marmalade, Parsley Salad</mark> was delicious! the creamed spinach was nothing spectacular and i didn't appreciate the egg on top. don't get me wrong. it was edible just not exciting. neither was the morels... this was wayyyyyyyy salty. what could have saved the meal ended up with more disappointment. dessert was okay. seemed like a cheap rough version of a delicate mille-feuille (even though they call it a tatin), served with gelato and berries. booooo..... i give the whole experience maybe 5 of 6 out of 10.", 
            "to start, most the negative reviews i've read on here are written by people who don't know about high-quality steak. it's supposed to be marbled with fat -- that's where you get the flavor. and it's supposed to be charred dark on the outside -- it's not burnt but quickly charred to keep the flavor & juiciness in. \n\nthat said, our meal at cut was one of the best dining experiences we've had in a very long time, if not ever.\n\nfirst, we got a great big booth, just the 2 of us, and the atmosphere is very nice -- modern, hip -- even the music is classic rock. i love the little pedestal sinks in the bathroom, and he loved the dining room chandeliers.\n\na breadstick basket with cheese sticks arrived -- delicious -- followed by the best gougeres (cheese puffs) i've ever had. they were made of/in puff pastry, which is unusual, & so good. then, after we ordered, the bread tray with fantastic pretzel bread & focaccia, which we devoured, knowing damn well the meal would be filling. and, oh, it was.\n\nhe had the <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> with avocado on top -- a healthy & delicious portion of both. i had thinly slices asparagus on brioche with a soft-boiled egg & bacon vinagrette on top -- oh my god, it was amazing. i absolutely devoured it. all the flavors came together and made for orgasmically explosive bites.\n\nthen his dry-aged 16-oz bone-in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> & my <mark>Double Thick Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark>. both were thick, juicy, moist, cooked just right, and fantastic. our <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark> on the side were a bit superfluous, but, dipped in panko, we had to eat them cautiously so as not to fill up on such deliciousness. \n\nsomehow, we made room for dessert, and good thing. best chocolate souffle i've ever had -- served in its own little sauce pan. his apricot/blackberry crumble, with a shortbread crumble, wasn't so bad either. :)\n\nas for service, it was perfect. it was timed just right so that we got our appetizers pretty quickly but had some time to digest before dinner. the servers were all attentive, and there were many of them, and the presentation was fantastic, very old-world steakhouse elegant with tableside presentation, dishes all served simultaneously, and everything presented just right. he also loved his martini with blue-cheese-stuffed olives. both our wines were great. a little pricey by the glass, but that was no surprise.\n\nwe were a little hesitant to try cut because a) it's not so cheap, and b) wolfgang puck has spread himself a bit thin over the last 10+ years, and some restaurants have suffered because of it.\n\ncut is not one of those restaurants.", 
            "there's a couple of things to mention first: \n1.  i don't tend to like wolfgang puck restaurants - at least not since dining at spago in the mid 90s.  he puts his name on a lot and i don't know that he pays attention to any of his endeavors.\n2.  we can be food snobs - we live in san francisco and visit vegas frequently.  we have dined in many fine restaurants over time.  we always have high expectations in restaurants where the per head bill is over $100.\n\nso what was our verdict?  while we had very high expectations, we were not prepared to be totally blown away, which is what happened.\n\nit really was a perfect evening.  the service, which is done in teams without anyone missing a beat, was incredibly attentive but not intrusive.  the food was superlative.  the atmosphere was hip, modern and pleasant.  \n\nto start, don't fill up on the bread - and there's lots of it - from parmesan covered breadsticks, to cheese in puff pastry, to the bread basket with pretzels, breads and foccacia, you can make a meal of the bread.\n\nthe food was also not as expected.  it's hard to put inventive twists on normal dishes, but they managed to do so.  the <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> had unique flavors, came with great toast crisps and wasabi aoili.  it also had beautiful slices of avocado on top and presented as a perfect terrine.  normally portions for appetizers, particularly raw tuna, are very small - this was not.  and the taste was outstanding.  i had <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> the previous night at another great restaurant and it didn't compare.\n\nthe asparagus salad was so nicely presented it was almost a shame to cut into it.  each of the very thin, tender asparagus spears were perfectly lined up on a piece of brioche with a perfectly cooked poached egg gently placed on top.  \n\ni had the dry aged nebraska <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> (boneless) 16 oz.  it was a beautiful piece of meat, perfectly char grilled medium rare and with very little fat.  it was juicy, tender and perfect.  my wife had the korobuta <mark>Double Thick Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark>.  korobuta pork is the kobe beef of pork.  it was also moist, juicy and tasted great.  our sides?  fingerling potatoes with bacon confit and <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>.  both of them were perfect, but the <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark> were phenomenal.  \n\nnow my wife is a chocolate snob - she has very high standards for chocolate desserts.  she was driven to orgasmic delight by the chocolate souffle.  i, who don't like chocolate all that much, thought it was great too.\n\ni had trouble deciding between the lemon filled doughnuts and peach/blackberry crumble with 50 bean vanilla ice cream.  the waitress steered me towards the crumble and it was wonderful... they bring it out in a hot metal baking dish and spoon it into a bowl at the table.\n\nwe found out why the waitress steered me away from the doughnuts... it was my birthday and they brought me out a birthday dessert sampler which had, among other things, a lemon custard filled doughnut... the waitress was great about not spoiling the surprise and allowing me to enjoy both desserts i wanted.  \n\nso some final thoughts: \n1.  don't go if you aren't prepared for a very expensive evening - it's not cheap.  if the price tag will ruin your experience then this isn't the place for you.\n2.  the wait staff was excellent.  we were never steered to the most expensive items, she listened to what we told her our tastes were and made recommendations based on that.\n3.  if you have a martini, the <mark>Point Reyes Blue Cheese</mark> stuffed olives are incredible.\n4.  there is a big difference between wet aged, dry aged and kobe beef.  they explained very well all the differences and will help guide you to a great experience if you let them.  let them know your preferences in seasoning as well as in flavor and cooking style.  they really will try to do it your way...\n5.  a la carte is what every steakhouse does.  as annoying as it is, cut isn't the only one to do it.  if a la carte will bother you, then this may not be the place for you.  \n6.  this is both a great place for a romantic dinner and a great place for a group get together.  \n7.  this is a great place to just go and enjoy a fine meal and let the troubles of the world (and the losses at the tables) melt away.  go and enjoy!", 
            "amidst the plethora of generic steakhouses in vegas cut is not cut above the rest.  pun intended.\n\n i thought the \"shock and awe\" spectacle of presenting beautifully marbled raw beef of different backgrounds (filet, <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, wagyu, <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark>) stacked together to stimulate the salvatory glands was a bit kitchy, maybe silly, but somewhat effective.  \n \nto start, i ordered the <mark>Pink Lady & Fuji Apple Salad</mark>, with bacon lardons and medjool dates.  i had the waiter arrange a wine flight for me, to which he paired a predictable, but delicious, riesling from germany.  it was a nice crisp start considering i was in for an incredibly rich meal.\n\nwhen the waiter presented the raw meat i was smitten with a wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, and demanded it be mine.  i topped it off with <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>, and waited like a famished lioness.  i asked the waiter for a spicy red, and he sent me a full and spicy bordeaux that i couldn't wait to wash down with my meat.  i am a carnivore of the worst kind, and love my meat to be as rare as possible.  for this cut i opted for medium-rare bloody, and received medium charred.  the fatty marble goodness i anticipated had evaporated.  what was left was a dry, grey, and chewy piece of meat.  i summoned our waiter, and he was appalled and embarrassed.  his profuse apologies, could not appease me.  i did not yell or make a scene, because that would be counterproductive, and let's be honest, it's not his fault.  i was pissed at the cook who left that gorgeous piece of meat sitting in the oven too long.  it takes a professional idiot to kill wagyu, and the lack of respect for a valuable product is unforgivable.  feeling sorry for me, my mom offered to share her beautifully prepared <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> wagyu while i waited, but i wanted her to fully enjoy her meal, so i snacked on the potato gratin, and asparagus sides as i festered about the ruined meat.  \n\nour waiter returned with a new piece of meat, more apologies, and offered to comp my meal.  i told him that was ridiculous and unnecessary.  i was angry that a product was wasted, not that i would have to pay for a meal.  what was delivered was sinfully delicious.  tender, juicy, and melt in your mouth.  the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> was buttery, fatty, and a bit iron-y.  it was great with the beef.  accompanied by the bordeaux, it was fantastic.  the sides were pretty forgettable and generic, and maybe that was part my fault for ordering them, but c'mon, protein, starch, and vegetable...how could you mess that up?!\n\ni don't love dessert, but my mom wanted something sweet, so we ordered some chocolate concoction that wasn't memorable.  i had a lovely spanish port that i enjoyed more than the dessert.\n\nwhen we got the bill our persistent waiter had removed my wine, and the dessert.  so i tipped like a rockefeller, and thanked him anyway.\n\ni'm giving three stars because i do not respect a restaurant that believes it is acceptable to send out an overcooked piece of meat to a customer.  first, you have disrespected the animal, and the purveyor from where that meat originated.  it took hours of work and plenty of money, to raise, feed, clean, massage, slaughter, and ship that animal.  when you disrespect the product you disrespect the entire process it took to get that product on the table, as well as the customer, and your profession as a cook.  three stars.", 
            "having just recently been to japan, i was excited to see wagyu/kobe beef being offered.  my fiance raved about this place so i thought i'd give it a try.   i made reservations a week ahead for 8 pm on a friday night.  \n\nthe atmosphere and decor of the restaurant is modern.  the menu isn't cheap,  the steaks avg from $60 - $200.   i ordered the <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> wagyu/kobe beef which was $85.   for the side items, we ordered mac and cheese, potatoes, and spinach.   it took awhile for the food to come out, so we loaded up on the breadsticks and bread they are complimentary.  \n\nout came the steaks..  it was cooked beautifully.  it was seared and cooked to a perfect medium rare.  i got the sauce from argentina and this complimented the steak very well  it was a perfect amount of food, and the hightlight of the evening.  \n\ni will recommend to all!", 
            "cut is a very trendy steakhouse that fits the las vegas atmosphere very well.\n\ni'm going to make this short and simple. service here is good. for appetizers i had the bone mural flan for the first time. it's different but really good. i ordered the nebraska 35 day aged <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>. it was ok considering they overcooked my steak. if i was a medium cooked steak eater, then this would taste right. my friend's cheaper <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> cut was better because it was cooked right. i felt they were inconsistent and it is no excuse for a steakhouse that charge $50-180 for steaks.", 
            "the best things i can say about this place is that the service was terrific, really very attentive, friendly and careful to explain everything we had questions on.  the waitress and sommelier and the guy who served the food, all top notch.\n\nthe porterhouse was overcooked though, the potato tart tatin was, i hate to say it, disgusting, peppery mush inside, hard potato slices on the outside.  the summer corn app had some kind of yogurt mixed in with it that did not agree with me (not that it was \"off\", it was definitely fresh) but it just did not sit right with me.   i felt like a lot of the dishes had one ingredient too many, they could easily simplify them and the main ingredient would stand out <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> of the seasonings taking first place.\n\nthey were out of the wine we selected but the sommelier was so sweet, he gave us another \"better\" bottle at the same price which was so nice but then the staff told us no less than 3x that he gave us a discount and it was written on the bill in, i shit you not, 4 places.  way to ruin a nice gesture.\n\nthe decor was so odd, i felt like i was sitting in a desk chair and for some reason, i hated, hated their chandelier/sconces, i know this  random but they really were hideous.\n\nthere are much better places in vegas to spend your money!", 
            "i was really excited to try this place as i had heard a lot of great things about it.  i went with a group of nine hungry people and tasted the following items on the menu:\n\n- <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan\n- bite of the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> dumpling in ox tail bouillon\n- kobe <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> w/<mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> on the side\n- mac n cheese\n- <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>\n- creamed spinach\n- saut\\u00e9ed spinach\n- caramelized corn\n\nunfortunately i was less then impressed.  the place was swanky as expected and the service was right on point (except one huge thing that happened which i'll mention in a bit) but the food was sub par.  i liked the decor but the only thing was that it was difficult to get into and out of the seats as the chairs were heavy and hard to maneuver around...not a big deal though.  i was most disappointed by the food and service.  let's say i wouldn't recommend this restaurant out of all of the other restaurants on the strip.  \n\nthey first served three or four different types of breads while waiting for our appetizers.  i tried their pretzel and onion bread which was so delicious and warm.  i started off with the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan served with toasted bread which was tasty.  i also had a bite of the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> dumpling which was good too.  then the steaks came out and it was a disaster!  one of the most important things about the preparation of any type of meat is temperature, as we all know, especially at a steakhouse and let me tell you, it was a complete wreck.  i had ordered a medium-rare steak and it literally came out medium-well while my friends who ordered medium steaks came out borderline rare.  after trying to suck it up and eat my well-done steak, my friends told me i should really tell the server.  i finally got myself to tell him (i don't ever send food back to the kitchen...i feel so bad) but he told me that my steak was medium-rare like i didn't know what i was talking about.  it was pretty ridiculous because it was no joke, wayyy overdone.  i didn't push it and ended up trading steaks with my friend who ordered a medium and got a borderline rare steak.  on top of that, i didn't think the steak was flavorful enough and there was nothing special about their <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark>...to me it was like bbq sauce.  with that said, i would like to note that other than the steak incident which was terribly handled, the service was great.\n\nas for the sides, their mac n cheese, creamed spinach and corn were very tasty while the <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark> were not so great (but then again they're just <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>) and sauteed spinach was bland.\n\ni would like to mention that a lot of people did enjoy their food so it may have just been the temperature of my steak and how they were unwilling to do anything about it when it was obviously well overdone but come on, we're at a steakhouse right?!?!  and honestly, i've tasted way better steak...i really wanted to like this restaurant but it failed in my books.", 
            "when my friends and i decided we were going to get true japanese wagyu as our final meal for our trip, we spent a good amount of time walking the strip trying to find out who had a5 wagyu.  unfortunately, cut was primarily the only option (mina's has it but we ate there the first night).  so, the only real reason we went to cut was because it served wagyu.  my biggest complaint is that its a wolfgang puck restaurant and i haven't really had much success with those.  nonetheless, we dove straight in to taste our first wagyu.  \n\npros:\nthe japanese a5 wagyu is everything it is cracked up to be.  i think i'll never look at steak the same way.  it has sortof ruined my tastes for other steak.  i got the <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> and it was amazing.  the steak litterally melts in your mouth.  you can almost push your tongue on the roof of your mouth and a thin slice of wagyu almost melts.  it is pretty fatty but an amazing cut of meat.  something every true meat afficionado has to eat if they ever want to call themselves a meat eater.  easily a bucket list type of meal and this was a box that was crossed off for me.  amazing steak.  they really hit it.\n\npros: \nexcellent appetizers.\nreally one of the few steakhouses on the strip that serves true japanese wagyu.\nservice is fairly good.  reasonably attentive.  \n\n\ncons:\nchef wolfgang does not cook in the back.  so please don't tell me that chef wolfgang is making those mustards that they serve as an amuse bouche.  really!  i mean, really?  is that your amuse bouche?  different types of mustards that i can dip my pretzel looking like bread in?  \nthe decor is more out of a 70s cookie cutter box where dirk diggler is gonna do some blow on the tables before they head out.  really didn't like it as much as i wanted to.  it feels exactly like the location it is, a restaurant in the shoppes in between two great casinos.  \nthe wine by the glass selection is horrible.  actually, the selections of wines by the bottle isn't very good either.  i ended up drinking a scotch and just dreaming of the steak i ate.  \n\nif it wasn't for our decision to eat wagyu, i wouldn't have eaten here.  although it did allow me to eat the steak of my dreams, the wine selection is poor, the decision to serve me mustard and tell me that chef wolfgang in the back decided to provide this for us really kind of put me in a different mood.  heck, maybe he was in the back (sunday night) but for some reason i'm thinking he wasn't.  i know mr. puck is from austria, but mustards?  maybe i'm missing something and i don't know the history of mustards and steak.\n\nin the end, i feel like i'm a part of the assembly line machine that is the wolfgang puck establishment and this just happens to be a steakhouse.  i don't feel any real personality in this place nor any vision with the food.  i have to admit, the steak was excellent but i think the steak speaks for itself, its everything else that i'd rather not hear.",

            "not as good as my previous visit, but still good.\n\ncame here with three buddies this past saturday and we ended up getting seats in the lounge area.  while i prefer the dining room, there wasn't much choice in the matter, since they were booked solid until 10pm.  the lounge was nice, but the seats could use a lot of improvement.  my back and legs ached before we even received our entrees.  even a couple cocktails didn't numb the discomfort.\n\ncomfort aside, the food and service were on the mark.  we ordered five appetizers:\n\n1.  fava bean salad - my wife didn't like it when she went last time, but this time one of my buddies actually enjoyed it.  go figure.  but seriously, why pay $15 for a bean salad?!?\n2.  big eye carpaccio - not bad, but it felt like such a waste of good tuna to be fixed up.  i would have preferred it sashimi style, but that's just me.  \n3.  <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> - just as yummy as it was the last time.  and i again wish i had just ordered 4 of these for my entree.  i would compare this to sweet, salty baconny goodness.  \n4.  kobe sashimi - everyone on the table loved this we did two orders.  call me a purist, but i really would have liked less...flavor.  like the big eye, there were just too many flavors going on around such a great central ingredient.  the sauce muted the beefy goodness.  on the plus side, this was butter tender and really tasty.  \n\nwe each had different cuts of meat, and everyone was happy with what they had.  if i remember correctly, my friends ordered a filet, <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> strip and illinois <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>.  i had the nebraska <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>.  all steaks were ordered medium rare and all were perfectly cooked.  my buddy who had the illinois (bone in) <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> and i swapped pieces and we both agreed the nebraska was far and away superior in flavor and tenderness.  \n\nfor sides, we only had the creamed spinach and pureed potatoes.  the egg on the spinach could have been cut up better because the pieces were pretty huge (picking nits on that one, eh).  the potatoes were really nothing special and were seriously lacking in flavor; maybe they just need to add some bacon to that thing.\n\ni did order a bottle of kaesler avignon syrah, which went waaaaay to fast.  it felt like our server just wanted to empty the bottle out as quickly as possible.  maybe i'm just a pretentious wine snob, but i like to let the wine in my glass open up before pouring more.  is that too much to ask?  despite this perceived flaw in service, everyone was attentive, friendly and quick (maybe too quick?).  \n\nactually, looking back on my previous review, i should have given cut 5 stars for that visit because this time round it was a step down.", 
            "had dinner here w/ a few of my buddies.\n\nordered the wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>.  i've been to a few high end steak houses(maestro, mortons, flemings, ruth chris, delmonico) and the cut i had is by far the most unique flavor i've ever tasted.  the outside had the perfect charred crisp, and the inside was perfection.  the texture was so different from other <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>'s i've tasted.  the inside had the consistency and texture of sushi.  it was delicate and chewy, and would melt in your mouth.\n\nthis might be strange the way i'm reviewing the steak here, but its the only way i can describe it.  its the best steak, in terms of texture, that i've ever had.  the sides were ok, but nothing to wow about.  i'd recommend saving $$$ by not ordering sides, and just order a larger sized cut.  had a nice bold cab to go along w/ the steak which only enhanced the experience even further.\n\nthe service was what you'd expect from a high end establishment.  didn't have any problems, and the timing of the entree's were on the dot.  the decor is more contemporary and sleek, which isn't what you'd expect.  it was very nice inside, but didn't really match the food that they were serving.  can't really explain it, just go and check it out yourself.\n\noverall, i'd come back again.  well worth the $.", 
            "this seems to be one wolfgang restaurant that isn't suffering from the celebrity chef syndrome. you know... that ailment that seems to affect many restaurants on the strip. the one where a celebrity chef opens an outpost in sin city only to neglect it and have the quality of the product suffer as a result. as an example see spago and postrio or other celeb restaurants like mesa grill. cut bucks the trend successfully by offering some amazing steaks and fabulous accompaniments.\n\nwhile i didn't think the cheese ball amuse bouche was anything special, the bread selection was very good. particularly good were the pretzel bread and focaccia. the fresh burrata (with prosciutto, raisin-rhubarb compote, and arugula) wasn't something that was very memorable. the cold, stringy consistency of the cheese wasn't appetizing and the subtle flavor made the dish forgettable. the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, however, was an unbelievable mix of sweet and savory flavors. it could have benefitted from a little more pork fat to add to the texture and taste, but overall it was one of the best pork dishes i've had in a while.\n\nfor our entrees we had an 8 oz. petit cut filet and the 16 oz nebraska corn fed <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>. we ordered some <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> with the filet and got a side of fingerling potatoes to share. we ordered both medium rare but the filet came out closer to medium. they were both beautifully charred, providing a flavorful crust to the steaks while keeping the centers juicy and tender. \n\nservice was solid, although our waiter did disappear for a few stretches. however, the guy refilling our water was always around. it seemed like after every sip of water he was there to fill it back up to the top.\n\nthe decor is hip, trendy, and modern. quite a contrast to most other steak houses in las vegas. the music was more safe and mainstream, as they played a lot of u2, the beatles, rolling stones, and cold play.\n\nthey give locals a 20% discount off of food, so if you are nevada resident make sure you ask about it when you order.\n\n4.5 stars", 
            "i had the most amazing fillet of my life! yes, it was that good! the service is the best, the staff is well training, my server was able to describe and explain the cuts and differences between them.  she was great! \n\nwe order a bottle of wine and i didn't like it, so the sommelier took it back and got us something that we liked better, and we did! we ended ordering two bottles.\n\nmy fillet was juicy, perfectly cooked and seasoned. i also ordered the pommes puree, which were silky smooth, with bordelaise sauce. i didn't care for this sauce. they use port wine <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> of a dry red wine to deglace, not a fan, i don't like sweet sauces on my steak, but i can see how that would work since they do put a heavy pepper rub on the steak, but, i am still a classic bordelaise sauce girl. \nnon the less, it was perfect! \n\nmy boyfriend had the rib-eye dry aged 31 days...omg! talk about perfection, this was it! he ordered it with caramelized onion, they were very sweet and roasted to perfection.\n\nfor dessert: chocolate souffle with choco sauce and gianduja chocolate gelato and it was heavenly....\n\nwe had a wonderful experience, the food was perfectly cooked and seasoned. i would recommend this place and any other wolfgang establishments.",

            "when i lived in beverly hills i would go to cut often. it was either that or mastros. i always found cut a slight cut (begging pun-forgiveness) over mastros. \nbut that certainly is not the case in las vegas.\ni ordered the illinois <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> which was overpriced at $66, and although it was tender, it was also tasteless. a great deal of salt was required just to bring it to a reasonable level of flavor.\nthe service was abysmal. only 6 tables were occupied but getting attention was a constant effort.\nthe wine list is good but criminally overpriced, as are the steaks. the wines by the glass are rudimentary and show no imagination or care.\nthere are so many better steak joints here, both on and off the strip, that cut just doesn't make the cut (okay, now you can shoot me).\ngo to mastros, or joe's, or even envy for a better steak at a better price.", 
            "i've been to many steakhouses and this one tops it all! i have never enjoyed the steaks that i have ordered. first of all the appetizers we ordered were simply amazing. <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> of the usual beef carpaccio i always ordered i decided to try the different appetizers that were offered where you don't see at restaurants.\n\ni started off with the <mark>Warm Asparagus</mark> with poached egg and warm bacon vinegarette and the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> with asian spices, sesame, orange dressing, bartlett pear compote. let me tell you how delicious these appetizers were. i would never have thought that an asparagus dish for an appetizer would be this yummy. and the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>? wow simply tasty and not too salty. both were perfect to start our meal.\n\ni ordered the tasting to ny sirloin: american kobe style from snake farm rivers 4oz, usda prime dry aged  35 days 4oz, and austalian waygu  from victoria falls, australia 2oz. oh my goodness, i don't think i can ever order a regular steak anymore. all three were so tender especially my favorite which is the waygu. melts in your mouth. this place is a little pricey but it's worth it. \n\nlove cut! favorite steakhouse!", 
            "expensive but worth your money. ordered porterhouse, <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> and braised short ribs. sides mac and cheese, creamed spinach, root vegetables. the winner was the porterhouse. great breads to start, make sure you get the pretzel bread, so good! the sides were a little disapointing given the wonderful steaks and bread...so i would have given 4 1/2 stars. \n\ngreat, impeccable service. long wine list. dessert were more on the \"airy, fluffy side\". the banana cream pie was very interesting, and the chocolate peanut better was not too sweet. would try both but would not strongly recommend either. \n\nmodern chic decor, more for a friends and going to eat before going out, not particular romantic if you are looking for a date place.\n\nrecommended!", 
            "we arrived 15 minutes before the kitchen closed (which probably wasn't real popular with the staff). even with our late arrival, we received fantastic service. the bread and butter (can't remember what kind) was great to start. we also had a number of sides, but the fact that i can't remember what they were, might say something.\n\nitems ordered: \n\n-<mark>Maryland Blue Crab & Carolina Shrimp 'Louis' Cocktail</mark> (deconstructed) - this was as fantastic to eat as it was visually appealing.\n\n-american wagyu <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> 10 oz (med rare) - very good, but a little too charred on the outside\n\n-lobster - perfectly cooked, melts in your mouth\n\noverall, the food was very good and the service was exceptional. in fairness, i am writing this review after my completed trip. this meal was consumed on the first night and probably was knocked down a star because of the incredible meal i had at strip steak (mandalay bay) later in the week.", 
            "first, i want to clarify what the stars reflect in this case. here, it reflects the overall experience excluding cost, from the level of service to the quality of the food. i'll comment upon a cost based rating below.\n\n\nthe food was quite good and well prepared as one might reasonably expect from an establishment at the palazzo/venetian. considering that even the grand lux cafe delivers above average fare with great execution at moderate prices, one would expect no less at cut. the steaks were all prepared at the desired wellness (in this case, all medium rare) and were sufficiently rested prior to being served so that the juices did not run all over the plate upon slicing into the steak.\n\nthere was a dizzying array of cuts and types of beef offered, from prime grade domestic beef (aged for varying durations) to domestic wagyu (oxymoron?) to new zealand wagyu (alas, no wagyu from japan).\n\nour party opted for the domestic wagyu, which was priced moderately between the domestic prime and the nz wagyu. the cuts include <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> (my personal favorite), filet and ny sirloin. all cuts were, again, exactly prepared. taste and tenderness were excellent although the beef examples shown to us at the table were not as well marbled as the nz wagyu (domestic beef was not sampled to us).\n\nthat being said, the steaks were not really differentiable from prime grade steaks at other upper end steakhouses at half the cost (or more). nor did it seem better than the prime grade steaks available at costco prepared by sufficiently skilled home chefs. and, it was noticeably not as good as wagyu in japan (whether it be from kobe, yonezawa or the like).\n\nstill, it was an excellent steak that was prepared very well.\n\nall told, however, the 4 stars for an overall, cost considered experience, is generous. the service, as others have noted, is largely impeccable if not a little too familiar. the food is excellent. but the pricing is outrageous when similar quality can be had at less than half the price at other esteemed establishments. not just for the steak but for the sides. $12 for a small side of mashed potatoes? even if they are my favorite yukon golds, it's not like the potatoes are made of gold. cost considered, i would have awarded 3 stars at best -- excellent food, excellent service but average value at best.\n\nif you're on vacation or on an expense account, go ahead and splurge once. i did just to satisfy my curiosity of domestic wagyu. it's a great dinner if you're price insensitive. but if you expect the dinner to match the price, you may not have your expectations met.", 
            "i have been waiting to try this place and finally got to go with a group of friends in las vegas. the decor and service is what you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber...top notch. there was a beat that was missed by the staff and everything was perfect. with regard to the food, i had expected a little more. \n\nwe started with the <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> and a special of blue crab claws. the tartare was excellent however there was really no wow factor and nothing that set it apart from something you would find at any other restaurant. the crab was just that...crab claws. basically a bowl with some crab claws...they weren't even pre-cracked. as much as i love going through cracking shell fish, this wasn't the restaurant i was planning on doing it in and again i had hoped for something more than simply claws. \n\nnext up were the sides (i'll save the steak for last). we each picked something and got the french fries, <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>, swiss chard and autumn root veggies. the chard and the root veggies were good but the fries and rings were completely disappointing. easily something we all took a taste off and could have been happy not having any more of. again nothing special here and no wow factor. \n\nfinally the steak. i ended up with the bone in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> from illinois...rare. this was a fantastic piece of meat. my only complaint here was that they went a little heavy on the seasoning. \n\nthe wine list was incredible. i didnt want to hold the table up as i picked a bottle but i honestly could have read through it for a good 30 minutes. i stayed in the sub $100 range for a bottle and was able to pick an excellent one...but beware as there is little choice in that category. \n\nif i go back i would stay out of the appetizer and side sections and just focus on the meat...and ask them to go light with the seasoning.", 
            "1 star - overrated and the bf got food poisoning.\n\nwe were looking for a good steakhouse while on vacay in vegas and since we had never been to cut we decided to check it out being that it's highly rated.  what a mistake.\n\nfor the money, you would think you would be getting top notch quality and service.  the service was good (our waiter did seem a tad too snooty, but he thoroughly went over the menu and the different cuts of beef they offer), but the quality was just not there.  \n\ni had my usual, the <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark>, and the bf ordered the <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>.  both seemed overly salty and far too crusty (burnt?) for our liking.  in addition to the steaks, we ordered creamed spinach and mac n cheese for our sides.  the mac n cheese was okay, but the creamed spinach was... yakk (yakk = disgusting).  i just couldn't eat it.  it comes prepared with a raw egg that cooks from the heat of the spinach and i could have done without the egg.  actually, i could have done without the creamed spinach entirely.  \n\nwith tip, the bill came to a whopping $200+, and i walked away feeling utterly ripped off.  i'm never eating at this cut again (i'm also wary to try any other cut) and after the yak-ful night the bf spent on our hotel bathroom floor, i doubt he'll ever want the taste of cut in his mouth again.  \n\ndear cut,\n\nthanks for ruining our vacation.  i think we deserve a refund.\n\nbest regards,\n\npeggy.",

            "i love cut so much. i could probably end this review there, but its heavenly goodness deserves an actual descriptor.\n\ni practically, and sort of literally, live in las vegas and this is one of my family's go-tos for our joint favorite meal: steak.  they serve excellent quality meat and good preparation.  sometimes i look at my own pictures and drool a little because i remember how fantastic the marbling is.  and what's more, there's a cut for everyone.  i love the illinois corn fed <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> because it tastes like cow, and my father loves the softer wagyu style, among others.  we've tried most of the steaks on the menu, and i've never been disappointed before.\n\nas if that were't enough for me, i like everything before and after the steak, too.  the pretzels are pretty much fantastic, especially with the assorted mustards (the other breads are good, too).  heirloom tomato salad was great when it was on the menu, but there are a lot of other good choices too, like the <mark>Warm Asparagus</mark> that i love so much.  the sides are admittedly not cut's strongest point, but it's not so bad and frankly, they're really not important.  if you care that much about sides, you may want to go somewhere that actually plates your steak.  here they serve it to you as it is: solitary in its meaty glory.\n\ndessert is surprisingly strong here, too.  last i went, we ordered a souffle, baked alaska, banana cream pie, and a warm berry cobbler.  everything was good.  i ate to a point of serious discomfort because i couldn't stop.  it was too good.  admittedly the souffle was sort of standard fare for a \"good\" chocolate souffle, but everything was clearly very, very good. very.  i would be hardpressed to pick a favorite.\n\nall in all, if you can afford the price, go. get a wine pairing or a cocktail. it's all good.", 
            "my friends and i recently dined at cut to celebrate forthcoming nuptials.  not that i needed an excuse to come here, but the only thing better than good food and drink is good company.  on to the review.\n\n*beef*\nthe quality of the beef was very impressive, but not world class.  the best thing on the menu was <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> wagyu from new zealand.  the marbling was not comparable to more upscale wagyu, like tajima, but for the uninitiated, the beef served at cut is more than sufficient.  i ended up ordering <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> from a wagyu/angus crossbreed.\n\n*preparation*\nthe steak was cooked perfectly.  moist and pink, with the appropriate amount of char.  the mustard sauce was the best.\n\n*drink*\nabove average beer menu for a steakhouse.  i started the evening with a tripel from westmalle; the citric, yeasty notes went well with the appetizers.  the steak was paired with a generic pinor noir from oregon.  the scotch menu needs some serious revamping.\n\n*sides*\nunimpressive, but cut doesn't offer course menus, so it was expected.\n\n*dessert*\ni had a generic souffle.  nothing to write home about\n\noverall, the perfect place to have steak with the guys.  it's not a dining experience as much as it is a place to get your steak cooked properly.", 
            "this was my first upscale dining experience, and it did not disappoint.\n\nservice was exceptional. the gentlemen with the sample cuts of meat was very knowledgeable, and answered all of the questions we threw at him. \n\nthe house bread (mini pretzel roll) was amazing along with the cold french butter. since the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan was talked about in many reviews, we decided to try it out, and dam! it was fucking delicious. definitely not for everybody, though.\n\nfor my steak, i went with the 35 day dry aged <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> which was insanely good; especially the <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark>. you definitely have to try the mac and cheese. totally worth the long wait. it also feeds 3, along with most of the sides.\n\noverall, i was very impressed with this restaurant, and felt it was well worth the extra money i shelled out to eat here.", 
            "this was my second time at cut las vegas. restaurant was beautiful, service was commendable, food was delicious. \n\nsince it was my birthday my sister-in-law treated me by splitting the new zealand <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, which was $180. i was hoping it was going to be better than the american wagyu i had tried last time, but i was a little let down. although the flavor was amazing and the steak was cooked perfectly, the texture did not seem any more tender than any other well-cooked american <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, so not really worth the additional cost to me.\n\nmy friend ordered the <mark>Double Thick Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark>, since she had not been impressed by the steak on her previous visit, and i would have to say it was pretty awesome. it was a huge portion, with the bone, seasoned deliciously and perfectly moist and tender. it was such a large portion that she cut it up into snack size bites to take home and i must say that the pork did not dry out and was still delicious when we snacked on it for breakfast the next morning (that would explain the meat in my bed!)\n\nwe also shared amongst the four of us two of the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> appetizers, a side of the mushrooms and a side of the macaroni & cheese which were all delicious. \n\nthey bring a tray of different breads to your table and you get to choose which one you like before the place it on your plate. they also roll out a cart of their prime cuts of beef to show you the marbling and educate you  more on the meat. the water glasses are filled before they even get 1/4 full. our server did take a little long to bring out our check to us, but no biggie. it was a good first dinner during our weekend in vegas.", 
            "this is not for everyday. my group decided to treat ourselves and were not disappointed. as mentioned, the waiter brings out the raw meat and explains the cuts and selections. i ordered the american wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> ($88 for 9 oz.) it was like butter! i've never experience steak like this. my friends had the illinois filet and nebraska strip and were equally happy. the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> was incredible. i couldn't convince them to get the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan so we had the crab and shrimp louis. it was ok but i wouldn't recommend it.\n\nfor sides, the fingerling potatoes were very good and the mac and cheese is worth the $21. two sides was enough for three people. for dessert i had the chocolate souffle. it was outstanding. the raspberry filled doughnuts were excellent as well. i sampled the black forest cake but wasn't too impressed.\n\nthis place is for special occasions and i'm glad we tried it. oh, and get the pretzel bread when they bring it around.", 
            "ambiance: 4. cut got me interested in writing a review for the first time in a long time. as far as ambiance goes, it does lack that \"wow this is special feeling\" you get from special views or environment's (i'm thinking of bartolotta @ wynn, hugo's cellar downtown in particular). however, cut more than makes up for it through the service & food.\n\ncost: 3. when i'm vegas, i have a tendency to ignore menu prices altogether and i hope most of you end up doing the same.  cut's expensive, just like the rest of vegas' strip restaurants are.  accept it for what it is, and hope blackjack goes your way.\n\nfood quality: 5. in the \"what's your last meal alive scenario\", i always think of myself as more of a seafood person.  that said, cut surely makes me rethink my preference.  filets, <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, steaks we all got were outstanding (across the board, from the basic 8 oz filet to 35 day <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>).  some in our party also did the sirloin tasting, which is probably one's best option looking back to be able to try a few different items.  sides & sauces were all exceptional.  the questionable: appetizers. crab & carolina shrimp was great, but felt like others we ordered were more average, mainly the oxtail/<mark>Bone Marrow</mark> dumplings and <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark>.  all that said, if you avoid the appetizer minefield you're in for a real treat.\n\nservice: 5. we never had problems getting drinks almost immediately, two in our party were late and the staff was more than accommodating, and our waiter was very knowledgeable on best menu options for individuals.  in other words, we didn't get upsold on more expensive wine/steaks at any point and the service was very accommodating. a+\n\nwhen to return: special occasions, steak craving, or after a big vegas win streak.", 
            "amazing steak and other food, but be prepared for a slight bit of wallet shock.\n\ni made reservations at cut back in may while visiting lv, but due to an unfortunate bout of illness (do not eat duck fried rice from the bellagio poker room)  that required hospitalization, i was forced to give my reservations to my friends. the next day, visiting me in the hospital, they raved about the quality of the steaks, being from overseas. i knew that next time i was in las vegas, i would need to go.\n\nwhat luck that several weeks later my boyfriend did extremely well in a wsop event, and we returned to las vegas and made another reservation at cut for mid june.\n\nwe were seated a booth with a leather tables and service was quick and prompt. we knew we wanted steak, but my boyfriend and i have very different tastes in wine, so the sommelier came over to help us with the (very) awkward ipad wine list. she helped us pick just the right wine that met our desires. \n\nafter ordering our wine, we got down to business. for appetizers, we had the kobe sashimi and the <mark>Roasted Weiser Farms Baby Beets</mark> with goat cheese. they actually balanced quite nicely, as we knew we had a lot of meat ahead of us. \n\nfor our main courses, i chose the american wagyu filet, normally 6 oz, and added an extra 2 oz for extra. i love kobe filet for it's melting butter like quality, and this cut was no exception. it was cooked perfectly (medium rare) and it was the quality and taste i would expect for a $130 steak. my boyfriend chose the <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark> tasting that consisted of the dry aged american sirloin, american wagyu, and nz wagyu. he ordered it rare and it came slightly over rare (which is acceptable, because these cuts were thick) and they were epic. just meaty and buttery at the same time. my steak-loving boyfriend was in heaven. \n\nfor sides, we had the mac & cheese, and spring peas with bacon. to be honest, we didn't eat much of those as we focused primarily on the steak, but both were good - also rich and bacony! \n\nafter some excessive meat consumption, i saw a souffle float by to another table. i had to dig deep down, but i never regretted the chocolate souffle. it was rich but airy at the same time. i didn't even look at the other desserts, but it was one of the best i've had. the small little cookies and tarts were a nice little treat we had wrapped up to-go that went nicely with our coffee for breakfast the next morning.\n\nthe service was extremely attentive and water refills/bread requests came quickly and discretely. (yes, the bread was that good too). my one disappointment is the overall atmosphere. the overly slick design and mirrors everywhere made me feel like i was in an hgtv show <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> of a restaurant.  when i think steakhouse, i think a little more comfortable and a little less \"sleek.\" that said, i also deplored the amount of  people taking pictures...man people, don't use flash in a restaurant, i like to eat my food without blinding. if you're so consumed by where you are, please avoid me at all costs.\n\noverall, i recommend cut if you have money to splurge but you'll be sure to enjoy your meal.",

            "disclaimer:  our reservation was coordinated through a mutual friend and gm of the source, a wolfgang puck restaurant in dc.\n\nwhen we were in vegas a month ago for the cigar convention, we had heard from a ton of people that we had to try cut.  we got a reservation and decided to hit the bar beforehand.  the bartender was incredibly polite and had a real good time talking to him.  we tried some new shots and had some excellent manhattans.\n\nthe gm/host let us know our table was ready.  after being sat, and introductions, they showed us their wine list, which is on an ipad.  it was very easy to pick the bordeaux that we wanted (2005 chateau gracia).  while we waited for that, we put in an order of appetizers (maryland blue crab and jumbo shrimp crab cake and also <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>).  both were excellent, but i could have eaten that crab cake all day long.\n\nour wine was brought out exactly as it should have been.  presented to the person who ordered it and then poured to the others from there. myself and a friend ordered the 28 day <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, and our other friend ordered the wagyu. for sides we had the squash dish and i think potato something.\n\ncrumbs from bread never lasted long.  someone was always there refilling glasses or cleaning the table.  we knew a lot of people that week and many stopped by.  the staff took notice and never attempted to interfere or rush us to the next part of our meal.  a good friend from a neighboring table decided to buy us a bottle of wine, and once again the ipad menu came out.  the wine can be pricey, so i simply opted to choose a region and allow them to choose the wine.  the waitress was accommodating and polite throughout the process informing the gentlemen we had chosen a bordeaux.  the bottle we received was a 1999 chateau leoville barton which went excellent with out meal.\n\nneedless to say, between the manhattans and the wine, we were all feeling a little good at this point and perhaps even a bit loud for the restaurant.  that being said, we were never asked to be quiet or leave.   later two desserts were brought to our table that we did not order, we're still unsure if these were from the chef or from our friend who we had been at the bar with and had since returned.\n\ni have never had such a beautiful meal or wonderful service.  the gentlemen who took care of us most this night was pasquale, when i return i will definitely request him.",

            "i used to frequent cut a lot, but for some reason, i feel that the quality of steaks has decreased over the years. i think a lot has to do with the amount of seasoning that cut puts on the steaks, a little too much for my preference. i've had good and bad meals at cut and i think it really has to do with the amount of seasoning that i get (even when i ask for less seasoning). the <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> is really good and so are many of the other steaks that i have had here. i've been to cut for birthday parties (large groups which they can handle) and with small groups. cut is definitely on the higher end of the steakhouses in las vegas as it is in the palazzo hotel and so the cost per person is higher than some of the other steakhouses that i have been to. service is great and very attentive, although the one time we tried to bring a bottle that we wanted to open (for a birthday, it was a bottle of johnny blue label), they wouldnt let us open it. overall,  a good steakhouse, but there are better places to go in las vegas.", 
            "the best meal i've had in my life! started off with the beef sushimi which was full of flavor and wasn't lacking a single thing. i just wish i ordered two! we also go a chop salad which was good as well for main course i had the wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> which was perfectly seasoned and seared excellently. the wine selection was great we had a bottle of pinot grigio and a malbec with great profiles. service was on point and i don't think a meal or experience like this can ever be duplicated. thank you wolfgang puck.", 
            "ate here with a few friends/work associates and we were all blown away.  very memorable meal.  the service, as you'd expect, was top notch.  our server bobby explained the menu well and offered recommendations, all of which were fantastic.  we started with the blue crab/shrimp  louis, the kobe steak sashimi, and the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>.  all the apps were great, but <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> stole the show.  sweet, succulent and so tender.  i'd go back for this dish alone.  on to the main course.  i ordered the 9oz. american wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> with the bleu cheese melted on top.  my steak was cooked to absolute perfection and was very tender.  probably one of the most tender and flavorful steaks i've had.  my only issue was there was slightly too much bleu cheese which distracted from the beefy goodness.  we finished the meal with the banana cream pie.  very decadent.  bobby mentioned they do creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e inside rather than pastry cream....love it.  overall, everybody loved the meal and it was definitely a big hit.", 
            "i love the ambiance and decor here. the booths are spacious and comfortable. the service here is magnificent. everyone is very attentive, friendly and helpful. i'm not sure if this happens often, but we kept getting free small samples. our server brought what i think was a small pao de queijo and two pieces of chocolate throughout the dinner, which was really nice/neat of them. we had the golden <mark>Pink Lady & Fuji Apple Salad</mark>, which was refreshing and light. we also ordered the <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> which did not seem very fresh and i would not recommend. while they offer other entrees, their steak selection is glorious. they have wet aged 21 days, dry aged 35 days, cows from all over the country and even from australia. personally, i think wagyu beef can taste too gamey so i don't really prefer it as much (i know i am weird). i really love a good bone-in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> so that is exactly what i ordered. because it was wet aged and bone in and prime, it was super greasy and juicy. the meat itself was cooked to perfection. slightly charred on top and very juicy medium rare prime meat on the inside. i didn't order a side, but i think this is where you should get potatoes to soak up all the juice or you save your bread to eat along with the steak because the meat itself and the juiciness can actually be too much after a while. i ended my meal with the chocolate souffle which was very rich. i really enjoyed my meal here, but i wouldn't name it one of my top favorites only because i didn't really care for much else on the menu. steak alone great, everything else ehh.", 
            "wow! where do i begin. i left vegas days ago and i'm still raving about this place. the 16oz <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> i had was the best tasting steak i have ever had in my life. it was tender and tasty, like nothing i have ever eaten before. they give you a few different sauces to try, but all you need is a little bit of sea salt and you're good to go. it doesn't come with sides, but you don't really need them. also, the service was excellent. we had a few different people waiting on us, bring us bread and drinks. kind of pricey, but very well worth it and a good place to take a date.", 
            "loved cut! ate here on 11/25. got the american wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> and at $88 it was the best steak i've ever eaten. based on yelp reviews, i was concerned about getting my medium rare and voiced this to our waiter. he assured me it would be fine and the steak came out beautiful. unfortunately no pics as i was intent on getting that baby in my stomach. we got the creamed spinach, yukon potatoes, and brussels sprouts. the creamed spinach with the runny egg was my least favorite and i could've done without. but also consider i like my brussels sprouts. there are a good variety of wine by glass and ranging from $14 to $25. you order on an ipad which was cool but really unnecessary. i finished my entire meal but not without some meat sweats and groaning as i trudged back to our room. \n\nminus 1* based on price. also in vegas, there's always another steakhouse.", 
            "wow!! i am officially a fan of this restaurant!! a week after going there, i'm having major cravings of all the food i tried there. if funds were not an issue, i would eat here every week.\n\nthe place itself was nice, chic, a little upscale but not too stuffy. i liked the decor though it was a little dim (i like to see exactly what i'm eating!) we got a few complimentary treats - first, 3 little cheddar cheese cracker things ( one for each of us.) they were good but it was kind weird because they were so small and kind of tasted like those little goldfish crackers. there was also a bunch of these long, skinny, crunchy breadsticks. they were ok.  we were also able to choose from different breads that they had. i chose the pretzel bread and the focaccacia. they were both really good but the pretzel was especially good with this spicy horseradish mustard sauce they had. it might have been a wasabi mustard. i don't remember but i know that it was very good!!!\n\nthe menu was a little intimidating, as i am not exactly a steak connoisseur. our server tried to explain the menu and how they cooked the steak but i had no idea what he was talking about and i was also not really paying attention. we opted out on the appetizers to keep our bill down but regretted that when we found out our steaks would take 45 minutes before they were ready. i decided on the usda prime, black angus beef 12 oz. <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> from creekstone farms in arkansas city, kansas - aged 28 days ($58)  with chimichurri sauce on the side, which was a couple bucks. my boyfriend ordered the ny sirloin - 8 oz. american wagyu / angus \"kobe style\" beef from snake river farms, idaho ($85) and his brother ordered the australian 100% wagyu beef from oakleigh ranch, alexandria, nsw. 6 oz <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> ($145.) we also got 3 sides - <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> ($12) <mark>Hand Cut French Fries with Herbs</mark> ($12) and cavatappi pasta \"mac & cheese\" - quebec cheddar ($21).\n\nso here's the breakdown - my 12 oz black angus beef <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> dominated my boyfriend and his brother's steaks. it was massive. so if you are super hungry, that would be a great option. i ended up giving a lot of it to them bc i couldn't finish it. anyway, i ordered a medium- well and i should have paid attention to the server because it came out more done than i would have liked. i later learned that all the steaks sit an extra 10 minutes which makes it a little more done. i should have had it done medium <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark>. so it came out pretty firm but it was still absolutely delicious!! there was so much flavor in this steak that i didn't need the chimichurri sauce at all. the flavor from the steak overpowered the chimi sauce!!\n i didn't taste my boyfriends american wagyu ny sirloin but he said it was very good and he was happy with his choice. now the best thing on our table was the australian 100% wagyu beef <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>.  i was very lucky that my future brother in law shared his steak with me. it was honestly one of the best things i've ever tasted in my life!! my mouth is watering thinking about this steak. i've never had wagyu beef before but after tasting it, it makes any other steak seem so average!  wow - literally, i cannot even describe this steak. it was so rich and buttery. it really just melted in your mouth. i'm going to make a plan to go back and order this buttery goodness to myself  in the near future.\n\nand now the sides. the fries were ok. pretty good but we barely ate them so next time we won't be getting those. the mac and cheese was delicious!! it came out way too hot and burnt your tongue but it was very very good so i didn't care. lol. the <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> was phenomenal. it's in my top list of best mashed potatoes ever next to old homestead's garlic mashed.  \n\nso yeah, i would definitely recommend this place to anyone that loves a good steak!! it was a little pricey (with a couple glasses of wine and soda, tax, tip and all it came out to well over $500 for 3 of us.)  it was worth every penny!!!", 
            "some friends  and i were in vegas last weekend for julie v. birthday. we all decided to dine at cut to celebrate! cut was a great experience. probably one of the best steaks i have ever eaten.\n\nupon arrival we were quickly seated. we have a reservation for 9. the service was great. they are very attentive and helpful. they even took the time to bring out some of their wagyu steaks for use to see prior to ordering. they are helpful in explaining the differences in the meat quality.\n\nthe food was great. i ordered the american wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, which is a hybrid between american angus beef and wagyu cattle. the was one minor problem in that some of our steaks were cooked over. we all ordered medium rare and a few came out closer to medium. however our server quickly replaced our steaks with new ones. and to be honest the overcooked steak still tasted great. i seriously contemplated just eating the steak. but ultimately decide to ask for a new one, considering it cost $90. when the replacement came the meat was just delicious! \n\nwe also ordered a large selection of sides, which are served family style. i loved the spinach and the <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>. the only side dish nobody really liked was the potato tarte tatin. it was a bit on the salty side.\n\noverall great experience. i look forward to dining at cut in the future. in terms of meat quality, it far surpasses anything i have had. in the future i really want to try their 100% wagyu steak.", 
            "everything is good. and i say this because we nearly got everything offered on the menu!\n\ni split a porterhouse steak and ordered it extra rare. it was basically seared on both sides with an extremely cool (so, yeah almost cold / raw!) center. it melted in my mouth like butter. i sampled my friend's rare american kobe <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> and declared it *overcooked*. how can i ever go back to having normal steaks again? sigh.\n\nlet's see....mac and cheese, delicious. polenta, my favorite side. brussel sprouts, blue crab & shrimp louis cocktail, <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark>...all exceptional. the kobe beef sashimi was freaking out of this world and i would probably kill someone for another bite of the date cake. oh and did i mention the <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark>? it's heaven in a dish. normally my appetite wanes after a few drinks but even after 4 umami's, i managed to clean my plate, sample our 5 desserts and polish off a cheese plate. can you say gluttony? \n\nthe service was really attentive, and everyone was so nice and accommodating. a definite must-do in vegas!", 
            "the atmosphere and service were top notch but maybe it is because i'm from texas but this steak was just steak.  i got a nebraska raised <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> and it was nothing more than a <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> i can get here in houston at a reputable steak house.  it wasn't a terrible experience but it sure wasn't top notch like the prices are.", 
            "i have been to almost every high end steakhouse in las vegas including here twice, and this place is probably the best in the city. the service is second to none, and the food is excellent. if you are looking at prices, this is not the place for you, but if you are looking to splurge a little and have an excellent experience, get after it!  my gf and i shared an appetizer, a steak, and a dessert because we knew we would not finish our own, and we had one of the best dining experiences we could have imagined.  the wait staff is very polite and will not rush you through a meal like many others do. \n\n*note, if you like ruth's chris, you may not like this place because the meat tastes like beef <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> of butter. if prime rib is your favorite, this is probably not for you, but if you like a real steak, this is the place to be. \n\nthe beef is always perfectly seasoned and cooked to perfection. i would not recommend getting anything that is cooked more than medium rare because they may not know how to do that. real steak should be eaten rare to medium rare... not medium or well. \n\nalso, we had the most memorable dessert ever. it was a baked alaska as recommended by our waiter. \n\ni walked out of here wanting more and i can't wait until the next time i get to put that succulent piece of red meat into my mouth!\n\ntry the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> appetizer. it is to die for!", 
            "this was my second time at cut and it was just as great as my first experience. this time i tried:\n\nthe american wagyu porterhouse -- this is a large steak. i think it was like 32 oz. i ended up splitting with one of my friends. but i can definitely eat the whole thing myself if i wanted to. the filet side was amazingly tender. unfortunately it was literally like 2 bites. the <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> portion was also very flavorful and juicy!\n\nother things i tried were the mac and cheese, brussels sprouts, creamed spinach, and fries. i'd say that the mac and cheese and brussles sprouts were my favorite. seriously the mac and cheese is amazing. i was also able to try a bite of the kobe steak sashimi, which was delicious. it melts in your mouth. the only complaint was that the sauce was a little salty, but overall a great dish.\n\non thing to note based on my 2 experiences at cut is that they tend to slightly overcook the <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark>. on both occasions anyone who ordered a <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> (medium rare) commented on the fact that it came out closer to medium. it not too big a deal since they are totally willing to accommodate, either offering a new steak or removal from the bill. i think often times they try to bring the steaks out all at the same time and with the porterhouse being much thicker, sometimes the <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> comes out a little over. honestly the steaks are so tender and juicy it really doesn't make too much a difference. despite this little flaw, cut is still one of the best steaks i've ever eaten.\n\ni still look forward to trying the 100% australian wagyu beef. one day i shall return and try that!", 
            "restaurant was beautiful and staff was nice. service was good too they were very attentive. the food i thought was ok. if i could i'd  give them 3.5 stars. i had the wagyu center <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> med-rare and it was presented rare. i asked it to be refired and it came back better but rare.  granted was a thick cut but it's a expensive steak joint so it should be perfect. also the use a 5 spice rub on their steaks that i did not like at all. the waiter did mention this upon ordering, so i thought try it. i am picky when it comes to steak and am weary of steak rubs on prime/ wagyu steaks. sides were pretty good we had the <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark> and mac n cheese. sides were plenty for 2-3 people. they get the extra half star for the dessert. i had the berry cobbler...delish! overall it was good but prob would not go back.", 
            "one of the best steaks that i have ever had. the service here is also top notch. the prices were comparable to a chain like morton's but i felt like the service was a notch better at cut. all of the waitstaff is very attentive and well trained such as asking if it is ok for them to cut the <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> that was on top of the asparagus appetizer. there was refilled water and wine before you could barely get through half of the glass. the staff earns every dollar of the gratuity here.\n\nfor an appetizer i ordered the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>. honestly, if they could have just loaded me up on that i would have been satisfied. it was very tender and flavorful. others in my party ordered the tuna tartar and the <mark>Warm Asparagus</mark>. if you're a sushi fan then the tartar is for you. the asparagus dish was different than i expected but very tasty.\n\nmy main course was the 12oz <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> cooked medium-rare. the steak rub used is a tad on the salty side but the tenderness and steak flavor is out of this world. for sides the table ordered the pureed potatoes and the creamed spinach w/ <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>. the all star here was the spinach. i liked the texture the <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> gave to the creamed spinach. \n\ndessert was banana cream pie. overall a very solid dessert but compared to the rest of the meal it was the weakest. if i go again i will probably get the chocolate souffl\\u00e9 <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark>. \n\nbe sure to make reservations and just relax and enjoy the service. save your allowance and treat yourself to a night at cut.\n\nalso, i was under the impression that one needed to dress up a tad for this place. that was not the case. we spotted at least a couple of people in shorts and a baseball cap. but of course their money spends the same as mine.", 
            "my hubby and i was very excited to the cut since we are steak lovers, but we werent disappointed or happy with the food. the steaks were a 6 on the scale of 1/10. this is 10 being the best, now i had better <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> and <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> strip at a regular 2 star restaurant. i would go back for the ambiebce, and give them a second chance with the steaks. far as the service is was wonderful pasquale was our waiter and i appreciated all his information about the steaks.", 
            "ate at cut on a thursday night when i had 7 buddies in town for the ncaa tournament.  the food, as most of the yelpers indicate, was fantastic.  we got an array of appetizers, the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> was probably the run away winner.  the majority of us got the dry aged <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, which is smaller than the other option.  the flavor is much better on the dry aged version, it's worth the extra price and losing a little in terms of the size of the steak.  the service was excellent.  we never were wanting for a wine pour and our water glasses were never empty.  \n\ni will say that carnevino is my favorite steakhouse in las vegas, with the riserva <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> being my favorite steak ever.  this is also located in the palazzo.  but, cut is excellent, right up there with any steakhouse in the city.  if you are at venetian or palazzo, both cut and carnevino are highly recommended.  keep in mind, cut is expensive, so plan accordingly.", 
            "yes i'm a meat lover.  call me a caveman, i just love to eat a big juicy steak.   being in hawaii we are a little limited to steakhouses but i have been to most of them at least once.  morton's, hy's, dk's, ruth chris, and also other with steak like kincaids, shoreside grill, and even ruby tuesdays.  well, you get the jist.   i normally will opt for a <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> whenever possible and then maybe a ny or t-bone.  i like my meat to be juicy and have some fat so i normally don't get a filet.\n\nbeing we were heading out for vegas i wanted to have a date night with my wife and get a good steak.  i asked my friend, who is a seasoned chef.  he lived and worked in vegas for some years after grad-ing from the cia and working at the greenbrier among many other accomplishments both abroad and at home.  i figured he'd be the best person to ask for an honest opinion.  he recommended a few places we could try but said if given the choice we should go to cut.  that sealed it, cut it was.  i checked open table to see if i needed to book way ahead but it seemed like we should be fine booking a day in advanced.  great considering we hardly know where we will be in vegas day to day and hour to hour.  once we were out there and could plan our schedule, we were able to lock down a reservation that would work for us.\n\nwe headed out a little early not know how long it would take me to find the parking garage and not know how far we would have to walk to get from the parking to the restaurant.  cut is in the palazzo hotel.  parking was a breeze.  they had a guard asking where you were going so i guess maybe they restrict the parking to guest and customers.  we found a parking pretty close to the elevators which is amazing for a vegas casino.  needless to say we had some time to explore before going to the restaurant.\n\nwe had a reservation at 9 and got there about 10 minutes early.  they were pretty packed.  they didn't have a regular table open yet but did offer us a table off to the side in the lounge area.  we decided to wait for a regular table, not wanting to miss out on the whole steakhouse experience.  we did go to the bar to kill our 10 minutes.  one think that irritated me at the bar was when i asked the bartender what kind of beer they had he immediately stated that they don't carry anything domestic like bud light or coors.  did i f**king say that's what i wanted??  all he had to do was provide me their drink menu, which is on an ipad for customer use.  snooty bartender,  he should be happy i payed for those drinks with my total bill and didn't have to tip him separate.\n\nonce seated we had the best service.  our waiter was chip and from what we saw, he was probably the head waiter as he was directing most of the other workers as he did his job.  he was very knowledgeable about their menu offerings and offered in-depth descriptions about everything they served.\n\nthe menu was a head turner.  they had so many things that sounded delicious.  one of those places you wished you were with a large party so you could sample more.  we decided on the <mark>Warm Asparagus</mark>, poached <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>, warm bacon vinaigrette on a focaccia bread as our appetizer.  along with that we also got  to pick from their selection of homemade breads and also got a couple or long parmesan coated breadsticks and butter puffs, or something like that.\n\nfor the main dish my wife got the indian spiced kobe beef shortribs which they slow cook for 8 hours.  they were very succulent and rich.  they had a distinct indian flavor but not too overpowering.  it was also not very spicy at all.  the meat was so tender it was almost falling off the bone.  it was actually too much for my wife to finish.\n\nafter chip had explained the different lines of meats they carried i was sure i would need to get their sampler to get the best taste of what they had to offer.  i got their \"tasting of <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark> sampler\".  it came with a 4oz of snake river farms american \"kobe\" style beef, 4oz usda prime 35 day aged, and a 2oz of blackmore ranch australian wagyu.  it also came with a medley of different sauces and spices i could add to it.  none of which i needed to use.  they season their steaks with sea salt and black pepper.  it was seasoned perfectly so that the saltiness and pepper was not too overpowering and let the flavor of the beef shine through.  it tasted amazing.  and to be able to taste these 3 different lines of beef side by side really made it easy to see and taste the difference in quality.  all being top notch but clearly easy to rank.  might make me come back for more australian wagyu on a future trip.  we also got a side of their mac and cheese that was suggested by the waiter.  talk about rich and creamy, definitely a grown up mac and cheese.\n\nif you ever are in vegas and in search of a great steakhouse.  make sure to put cut on the shortlist.  you definitely won't be disappointed.  happy eats!",

            "every time we hit vegas, we want a better dining experience than our previous visit. that's a tough order considering our experience at charlie palmer steak was 5 stars and one of the best dining experiences we've ever enjoyed. \n\ncut is really expensive, let's get that out of the way now. if over the top expensive isn't for you, don't bother b/c who goes to a steakhouse to order the short ribs or the chicken, simply because it's affordable? \n\ntheir hostess is cute as a button, but she makes aubrey o'day from celeb apprentice seem genuine. i mean, fake smile is standard, i get that, but this gal was just blowin' skirts up left n right.\n\nthis place is all about service, food and apparently wine, but i don't drink b/c my boy is bill w and all, so that's neither here nor there for me. bobby,our very astute and proper waiter, offered up a few non alco beverages. a ginger-ale and pineapple number that was really good and a very very tart cranberry option. both were a nice touch for peeps who don't get down with the booze. \n\nbefore you actually order, they discuss the menu in great detail. our waiter, bobby, seemed a bit aggressive, but i think that's just b/c he knows his stuff and has a great understanding of the menu, so once we realized that, it was easier to understand the in your face approach. they have this giant plate, with a black napkin draped over it, loaded with all of their cuts of beef. they describe each in great detail and of course, attempt to get you to choose the most delicious, expensive cut. \n\nbread: numerous options, all made in house\n\ncheese puff: they have a technical fancy pants term for this, but it's a cheese puff and boy is it delightful!\n\nfoccacia: <mark>Caramelized Onions</mark> infused in the soft and chewy bread, excellent\n\npretzel bun: i had my doubts about this, but they were incredibly soft, chewy and also made in house\n\nchoice of cow: 35 day aged nebraska ny sirloin and <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, which bobby helped us choose\n\nthe meat was cooked to perfection, it was tender and juicy and succulent. <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> had a bit too much fat, but not a big deal. ny seemed to have less. they offer up a selection of house mustard (s) b/c apparently wolfy loves to slather mustard on his steak. it's a nice touch, but i could do without b/c the dry rub they offer is very tasty. \n\nsides are not included, but we had to get sides. \n\nmac n cheese: gooey, delicious and it is served piping hot. eat it fast b/c the cheese starts to dry up and get gummy pretty fast. \n\nfingerling potatoes: are served with roasted onions and my favorite, slab bacon! like large cubes of fatty swine, so delicious and just melt in your mouth goodness. \n\nwe had to pass on dessert b/c we killed every bite of dinner, but the dessert menu does look desirable. bobby one upped himself and brought out a few nibblets of goodness. \n\nchoco: rich, creamy dark chocolate ganache over graham cracker crust. very rich, but very good.\n\ncaramel: this was heavenly. it was like a tiny bite of pecan pie mixed with nut brittle and i loved it. nice and sticky and oh so scrumptious! \n\nthat's a wrap and if you made it this far down the page, thanks for reading my novel. cheers mate!", 
            "this is definitely one of my top picks to eat at when in vegas! my girls took me here for my birthday this year and omg it was so amazing! i ordered the lobster for the table and i regret not ordering the entire thing for myself because it was outta this world good. just thinking about it makes my mouth water thank goodness im going back in two weeks to dine here again! =d we all ordered the steak i think everyone got the <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, as for the steak it was not nearly memorable as the lobster. i dare say cuts lobster more than rival lobster at gary danko and french laundry. for apps the yummiest items that comes to mind is the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> and the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>. the crab cake and <mark>Pink Lady & Fuji Apple Salad</mark> was pretty good. french fries were french fries lol nothing else to say about them other than that. i did love the onion bread and the pretzel bread and i loved how they let you eat as much as you please because i love onion bread cant get enough of it. we ordered i think half the sides on the menu but only thing really stood out were the spicy peppers. for dessert they gave me a baked alaska for my bday yum! it was perfect way to end the meal. we ordered the souffle because i can never say no to chocolate souffle however it did fall short of expectations. i have to say gary danko and alexanders makes it better. the banana creme pie cake was fantastic, so yummy you could really taste the fresh banana. for a group of 6 girls ordering an app, entree and side plus a lobster for the table the bill came out to be 150 a person of course given the exception that my girls wouldnt let me pay for my portion. least to say it is obviously an expensive place to dine at but worth every penny.",

            "the cut beats craft out in terms of atmosphere and comfort (at least in vegas). the tables aren't as tight, the service is a bit more on point and i do get a kick out of seeing the bits of cow before it goes in to get cooked. we tried the bone in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> and the wagyu tasting trio. considering how small the pieces of the trio look, you will get full since the ounces do add up. it's hard to eat wagyu while you're eating anything else- the marble meat just melts in your mouth and makes all other meats feel tough and blah. fatty fatty wagyu, what have you done to me? \n\nthe steaks were good (even the <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> was decadent the next day, cold but delicious). however if i were to compare the quality, i would say that steakwise, craft edges out ahead. i felt their cuts were cooked to more of a flavorful end. the <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> was a little dry (i got medium) and the wagyu was good but lacked the umph that i got from craft's fabulous skirt. (the craft's <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> was good too, but the skirt was amazing for the price.)\n\nsides were typical, water was refilled and we had a good dining experience. the place gets filled up after 7:30 so reservations are recommended!", 
            "i wish i could say i had a great dining experience at cut, but unfortunately it wasn't even close.  the service was great, the food was terrible.\n\ni've been to all the major steakhouses in la and lv...except for cut.  my friends recommended that i try it out because it has been one of their favorite destinations for steak.  trying to put the hype aside, i went in there with an open mind and a large appetite.  i was sold on the american wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, ordered medium-rare.  when it came out, it was probably closer to medium than medium rare.  not a deal breaker.  i took my first bite...gristle.  yes, i know <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> tend to be a little fatty, but this was chewy...to the point where i couldn't chew anymore and had to spit it out.  the next bite is right in the center, where i think it would melt in my mouth (wagyu!)...and gristle again.  ok, it's been established that this steak does not melt in my mouth as promised.  the third bite is when i realized that i'm not tasting the meat, but <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> just a bunch of seasoning...mainly salt.  \n\ni thought i might have had a bad steak, but i asked around the table (7 of us) and everyone agreed with me and had the same feedback.  there were talks of cut having an \"off night,\" but i stand pretty firmly on this: an establishment like cut does not have an \"off night.\"  if it did, it wouldn't be this off of a night.\n\nneedless to say, we paid the bill and vowed never to come back.  ok, maybe not never, but it will be a while before i can take the plunge again and pay close to $200 for what's supposed to be an amazing dining experience.", 
            "excellent food and equally excellent service and experience.  the gf and i were looking for a nice steak house while we were in vegas and after reading through a bunch of yelp reviews we finally settled on cut... mostly due to the wide selection of kobe and waygu selections... i mean if you are gonna go all out, go all out!  \n\nthe order\n\nwaygu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> - 5 out of 5 - wow.  the nicest, most tender and most flavorful cut of <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> i've ever had.  i was so looking forward to having an entire cut of waygu and it didn't disappoint.  the steak had a nice char and was well seasoned.  it came out perfectly medium rare.  it was so good that i literally took my time savoring every single bite.\n\nwaygu filet minion - 5 out of 5 - equally good.  oh so tender and flavorful.  if you like fllet minion this will blow your mind.  i can't recall my gf ever being this excited over a steak she's ever had\n\n<mark>Wasabi-Yuzu Kosho Butter</mark> sause - 3 out of 5 - this was an additional sauce you can have on the side of your steak order.  i was expecting a big burst of flavor, but it was much more mild than i expected and didn't hold up to the steak as well as i would have liked.  it added more of a \"richness\" to the steak but not as much flavor as i would have liked.\n\n<mark>Shallot-Red Wine Bordelaise</mark> sauce - 5 out of 5 - wow.  i've had some wine sauces before, but this one may be one of the best i've ever had.  there is a sweetness and an earthy depth to this sauce that perfectly compliments a steak.  really it is an excellent and very much worth it.\n\n<mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> topper - this was another option that you can have on top of your steak. my gf added it to her filet minion and absolutely loved it.  the mushrooms perfectly good.  they had a nice texture and flavor and really went well with the steak and shallot-red wine sauce. \n\ncavatappi pasta \"mac & cheese,\" qu\\u00e9bec cheddar - 4.5 out of 5 - very nice addition to the meal.  the portion size is equal to that of an entree so there is plenty to share.  the mac & cheese came out with a nice crust on the top and the noodles were perfectly cooked.  the sauce creamy and rich and oh so good.  one of the better mac & cheese's i've had.\n\napple stuffed pumpkin doughnuts with maple whipped cream and pumpkin gelato - 5 out of 5 - yeah...it's just as good as it sounds!  the apple stuffed doughnut was airy light.  the maple whipped cream adds a nice subtle sweetness and the pumpkin gelato was seriously out of this world.  it really doesn't get much better than this.\n\nservice\n\nit is really everything you would expect from a top flight steak house.  everyone from the servers to the busboys are top notch and give everyone personal attention.\n\noverall\n\nwhile the prices aren't for the feint of heart, it was worth every single penny.  highly recommended to anyone who is looking for a nice upscale place to eat.", 
            "i was really looking forward to cut, and was hoping i would have liked it better than i did.\n\nit was a good experience, its a sleek, modern ambiance and the service is top notch.   the waiters go above and beyond... they're helpful, pay attention to detail, and educate (a bit too much... i don't care if voss water is from norway!!)  service wise it was what you'd expect from a top notch steakhouse.  they bring out the steaks on a platter, of course pointing to the most expensive waygu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> and recommending it very heavily.  \n\ni went with the bone-in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> and was disappointed.  granted, i'm very particular of my steaks and steakhouses.  i kept on thinking how i could make a better steak myself.  i ordered the steak medium rare, but it was more of a medium cook.  it had a dryness that didn't bod well with me.  i was surprised the marbling and bone didn't give the steak much flavor either.  \n\nsides were good.  mac and cheese was mac and cheese.  solid, but nothing special.  potatoes were good, went well with the steak.\n\ni've heard some people say that they love this steakhouse, which i find surprising.  with so many other great steakhouses in vegas, i wouldn't come here again.", 
            "before dinner, i got a dark and stormy at the bar. very good, they even garnished it with with a piece of crystallized ginger, which i thought was a really nice touch. for those of you who don't know what a dark and stormy is and are wondering what the hell ginger is doing is doing in a drink....it's basically ginger beer (much more of a ginger flavor than ginger ale), black rum, and lime juice. try one, they're tasty and refreshing.\n\nanyway, as for dinner, we started off with the crab & <mark>Maryland Blue Crab & Carolina Shrimp 'Louis' Cocktail</mark>. it was ok, nothing spectacular.\n\nthen came the steak. i opted for one of 21-day aged steaks. these are the cheapest on the menu and are not the dry-aged ones. i had the bone-in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>. now i know dry-aged is better than a normal aged steak (wet aged), but a) it was the end of my trip in which i had already spent a ton of money and wanted to go for the cheaper option and b) i've had plenty of good <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> that were not dry-aged. well, it was kinda tough, too lean for a <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, lacking fat marblization, and wasn't exactly bursting with flavor. overall it was an ok steak, just not what a <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> should be and therefore disappointing. \n\nthe creamed spinach side was ok and the mac and cheese was pretty good. \n\nwe skipped dessert because we had a show to catch, so i'm not sure what i missed out on. \n\ni'm sure the dry-aged steaks here are better and i'm sure the wagyu is quite good. but a good steakhouse should still have a good wet-aged <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>. so in comparison to other upscale steakhouses, this is mediocre. i guess maybe all the people ranking this as one of the top steakhouses in vegas had the better steaks on the menu (dry-aged, wagyu).",

            "let me preface this review by saying i really struggle giving 4 stars. yes, the food was good, and the service was great, but i just don't think you get a good value at cut. there are better places nearby with equally good food and better atmosphere. so here's the info:\n\nallergen info - i'm gluten free (bf is not) and they were amazing about all my questions. the server knew exactly what i could have, and every time they brought my bf bread (which was insanely often), they were apologetic that it had gluten in it. \n\natmosphere - yes, as other posters state, it's quite chic looking inside. but it's also very loud. like super loud. like so loud even the waiter can't hear you. and they have you look at an ipad for drinks, which seemed interesting at first but was really just kind of cheesy. \n\nsteaks - i had the illinois petite filet and bf had the nebraska <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>. both were cooked perfectly with excellent texture and flavor (although my filet was a bit too salty from the rub).\n\nsides - the polenta was delicious with so much cheesy goodness. i could've made a meal out of it alone. the broccoli was outstanding! it had just a hint of a kick from red peppers. soooo yummy.\n\nwine - selection was average but a bit pricy, even for vegas. they had too few bottle choices under $100. variety overall was just too limited. \n\nservice - was excellent. you never wondered if they were going to fill your glass. they were just there! we definitely felt well taken care of. \n\nextras - we chose not to have dessert, but we were pleasantly surprised when they brought out some little bites with the check. they brought gluten-filled ones for my bf and brought me a little scoop of sorbet. it was great. \n\nall in all, the meal was great, but there are so many places that are a notch above it in a city like vegas. i give it an a, but the ambience definitely knocks it down a peg. for my money, i'd rather go back over to delmonico's just across the path for an a+ experience.", 
            "ok i think cut may be my favorite steakhouse...\n\nthe whole experience at cut was amazing. what can i say... the food, service, and atmosphere was all superb!\n\nonce we got to the restaurant we were seated right away by the hostess. our waiter came by and handed us our menus and explained alittle about their steaks. the whole staff was pretty knowledgeable. \n\nwe started the night off with a bottle of wine. cut has an extensive wine list! they have their wine list on an ipad and so the list is actually very overwhelming. upon asking our sommelier he recommended us a bottle of their heitz cellars cabernet sauvignon since we were all going to get steak... and this wine did not disappoint... it was so good! :)\n\nwe started off the night with their steak tartare (4/5) ... wow so amazing.. loved the mustard sauce that complimented it... we had their american wagu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> (5/5) and their american wagu <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> (5/5). for sure the <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> was drier than the <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> as expected. but both were some good quality meat. they were cooked just right and seasoned to perfection. the meat just melted in your mouth... omg i am salivating while writing this review. definitely get the american wagu if money is not too much of an issue. i have friends that came to cut and had their regular cuts and they weren't too impressed. so definitely get the american wagu... you wont be disappointed... for us the japanese wagu looked way too fatty... so that's why we opted for the american wagu... \n\nfor our sides we got their brussle sprouts (4/5) and their mac &cheese (5/5)... the mac & cheese was definitely on the heavy side but i loved it! loved the cheesy-ness of the whole dish... they had such a great combination of cheeses to make this dish... it did not disappoint... but definitely you can't have too much of it... \n\nfor dessert we ordered their banana cream pie which was amazing (4/5)... they were also nice enough to give us an extra dessert (the baked alaska 5/5) because it was one  of our friend's birthday! we didn't even ask them but they brought it out on the house! definitely loved that. \n\nall the staff members were polite and did their job immepeccably. they weren't snobby or rude.. all were very down to earth and made our experience at cut memorable. i would definitely be back here if it didn't damage my wallet too much! nom nom ^^", 
            "oh cut, i so wanted to love you! but unfortunately, i just like you. 3.5 stars.\n\none of our friends had said this is his favorite steakhouse and he eats here every time he goes to vegas. so for our annual thanksgiving dinner, i suggested cut as the place for my family to dine. we all walked away saying we would not come here again.\n\nservice - top notch!\nambiance - this is a tiny restaurant and it's decorated nicely, but the music was classic rock and didn't really fit the feel of this place.\nthe food - hits and misses, which i'll get to.\nprice - about $1000 for eight people, which is pretty average for a steakhouse.\n\nbread - you are given crispy breadsticks coated in parmesan. tasty, but very messy, the parmesan flaked off all over the place. \nyou are brought a plate of four choices of bread, you tell them which ones you want, and they are served to you by a waiter. i had the pretzel bread and the onion focaccia bread. both were awesome. \n\nstarters - they don't have soup! i really wanted a soup, but there are none on the menu. bummer. my friend ordered the <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark>, avocado, <mark>Point Reyes Blue Cheese</mark>, champagne-herb vinaigrette salad. i had a couple bites and it was very good. \n\nsteak - our friend had told us to splurge and get the japanese wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>. it's $155 for 8 oz. he said it was well worth it, so bf and i split it. japanese wagyu is apparently not for me, it's just too buttery and literally melted in my mouth. i like steak i can chew on a little bit. i don't fault cut, i just think it isn't my thing. my friend ordered a petite filet with <mark>Point Reyes Blue Cheese</mark> and i tried it, i liked his filet a lot and wish we had ordered that <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark>. everybody else said their meat was okay.\n\nsides - brussels sprouts - great flavor, but too undercooked for my taste. not served very hot. creamed spinach topped with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> - just okay, also not very hot, and i could have done without the egg. mac & cheese - good flavor, but the noodles were slightly gummy and also, this wasn't hot. \n\ndessert - we didn't get any, but my friend ordered the chocolate souffle and it was amazing. definitely the best part of the meal. \n\nit wasn't terrible, but there are so many steakhouses in vegas, many of which i think are a lot better. when you are dropping $125 a person, you want to enjoy everything you eat, and that didn't happen here.", 
            "every review says to expect good service, but i did not know how truly outstanding it would be. i brought my partner here for our anniversary and we have never been treated so well at a restaurant. as an interracial lesbian couple with a big age gap we are used to some quizzical looks or even questions, there was none of that here. every member of the staff treated us with the utmost respect. the meal service itself was like a well choreographed ballet, which is harder than it looks. (reminded me of that episode of will & grace where jack gets will to be his cater waiter). the servers were charming and funny, not pretentious or stuffy in the least. my girlfriend has a serious gluten allergy and they were so gracious about accommodating her, they never acted as if it was a hassle. they even had the pastry chef make a gluten free chocolate souffl\\u00e9 which was presented very nicely. this was a big deal because my baby used to love souffl\\u00e9s but hasn't had one since discovering her allergy a long time ago. \n\nok, on to the food... \nlobster- we don't eat beef or pork but i brought her to this steakhouse for the lobster with truffle sauce. it was every bit as good as it sounds. it is lightly roasted in the oven which gives a much nicer flavor than your typical steamed lobster. they cut it out of the shell and serve it table side, very neat! truffle sauce was a tad sweet for me but she loved it.\n\njidori rotisserie chicken- wow, they presented the whole bird, which was impressively cooked to perfection, then they took it back to the kitchen to carve it up for me. very cool indeed. the sauce is not gluten free but they let me know in advance so i did not accidentally poison my girlfriend by sharing it with her. the chicken was nicely brined. brining makes such a big difference and causes the chicken to be verry juicy, even the breast! this brine was a little bit sweeter and less herby than the thomas keller bouchon one. the chanterelle mushrooms had a nice marsala flavor to them. \n\nbutternut squash with crispy leeks- delicious as it sounds, but it's a very rich and filling side dish. i think it also had pumpkin seeds and parsnips or something. roasted just right, not too browned. it's gluten free. \n\nmy gf also loved her sauvignon blanc and i couldn't handle anymore booze so i had a nice pot of mint tea. \n\npretzel and onion focaccia bread were crazy good but i wish they were served warm. portions are huge, i was shocked to be served a whole chicken, lol! the food is very rich and they sure don't skimp on the butter. i don't eat beef, but there was some large t <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> that people around us kept ordering, it smelled heavenly! i'm so glad i opted to come here <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> of one of those stuffy french places where every dish is the size of a postage stamp and costs $40. when i like something, i want more, damn it!  so that concept does not appeal to me. i'm a petite girl but i eat a lot and i have no interest in spending $800 on my meal alone. you can bet your sweet ass i will be back here the next time i'm in town. you must try cut, especially if you are celebrating something or you want to treat someone to a perfect dinner. after tip (tip extra because they work hard, take pride in their job and they deserve it), expect to spend around $100 per person, probably more if you are ordering bottles of wine or doing the japanese steaks. the only thing that did not impress me was the corn fed beef on the menu. um, hello...food inc.! those beasts need their grass!", 
            "<mark>Bone Marrow</mark>. crazy good! \nwe visited cut for my mom's 60th birthday. we had a wonderful time there. the food is amazing... however the most important thing is the service there. the staffs there were so professional and friendly. we sat there for 3+ hours and enjoyed everything about this place!\n\nfood: american wagyu boneless <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>. a little bit on the crewy side. they took out the big chunk of fat in it, so it felt more like a <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> strip. how ever it is still good! \n\nusda prime bone-in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>: it's made to perfection. \n\nthey offer 3 types of mustard to go with the steak. i love the wine based mustard.\n\nwe had 3 appetizers, 2 steaks to share, 4 sides, and a desert. very full afterwards. the tap came out to be $295 before tips for the 4 of us. not bad at all.", 
            "service was excellent. food was disappointing. bone in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> medium rare was not seared... it was burnt. like difficult to cut and scraping the roof of my mouth burnt. the meat itself was okay, not juicy at all even though it was definitely pink inside.  i'm pretty sure something is wrong here. dry aged steaks are still supposed to be juicy even though some of the water is lost in the process, right? well cut got my steak wrong or is just wrong in general. i suppose that there strong selling point is the kobe and maybe i should have ordered it, but then why even have the other dry aged steaks on the menu? anyway, i was disappointing with how dry and burnt and tasteless my $60 dry aged bone in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> tasted and probably wouldn't come back. the breads (pretzel especially) were good, sides were just okay (potatoes and brussels sprouts) and the service was excellent.", 
            "we experienced cut on new years eve after our friends' wedding earlier in the day.   our reservation for 7 was for 7:30p but when i stopped in at the restaurant to check in at 6:30, i was told that our table was ready anytime we were.  good thing, as this was quite the leisurely meal, we soon found out. \n\nwe were seated at the farthest table in the corner of the room. the seating arrangement worked nicely, although i nearly took out a waiter and a patron as the hostess attempted to make conversation over her shoulder with me, while whisking us through the restaurant.  \n\nour servers introduced themselves to us and asked about drinks.   we requested a wine list and started to peruse the menu.  shortly thereafter, we received the explanation of the beefs cuts and what we could expect to taste, as well as how their meats were prepared.  this should have been my first clue for my own meal.  \n\nafter what seemed like an eternity(nearly a half hour), our waiter returned to collect drink orders.  3 glasses of red wine (2 cab, 1 pinot), a beer, and 3 waters.   we waited 10-15 minutes for those to arrive, and then went about ordering our food.  once ordered, we received breads - oooooh so delicious(i'm sure you've read about them here on other reviews)!   breadsticks on the table proved to be messy to eat, as parmesan flaked everywhere.    \n\nwe ordered a few appetizers including the beet salad, <mark>Pink Lady & Fuji Apple Salad</mark>, and <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark> salad, <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, and the maryland blue crab & <mark>Maryland Blue Crab & Carolina Shrimp 'Louis' Cocktail</mark>.   each were delicious and stood soundly with excellent flavor and texture. \n\nour group ordered all different cuts of beef, including the prime porthouse for 2, petit cut filet, and more.  for 7 people, we also ordered 4 side dishes - 2 <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> and 2 mac & cheese. \n\nthis is where things started to fail.  \n\nthe meals were served to the wrong diners, to start.  once the first plate was incorrectly set down, the rest of the team of servers failed.. including one server who set down my \"pork\" in front of me, which was not pork, but bone in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>.   what??  ugh.   from there, there was some swapping of plates and a quick discussion of what went where.  chaos. \n\nthe sides were then served to each diner.  i'm not certain about you, but i like more than a tablespoon of potatoes when i'm served a 20oz <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>.    that's all that was available, though, so we made do.  the potatoes tasted delicious, as did the mac & cheese, which was stringy and difficult for the waiter to serve. \n\nthe kitchen seems to have a problem cooking their meat to the correct temperature.  the petit filet my friend ordered medium, was rare in the middle. i know this is an easy thing to have happen to filet.. but this is cut.  a $52 piece of meat should be prepared correctly!   \n\nmy <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>? wow.. very sad.  i had to physically saw through the char on the steak to get a piece that was not hard and crusted over, and overseasoned.   i'm not a fan of charred meat to begin with but a light char on this piece would have been appropriate.   i was sad to have to leave hunks of  meat behind because they were too tough to even cut through, despite having paid $64. \n\nthe porterhouse for two, for the bride and groom, was cooked inconsistently as well, even though it was ordered medium... one side was rare and the other medium/medium-well.\n\nwith three diners only drinking water, one would think that the servers would be attentive to their glasses and watch for empty.  heck, we've seen better service at applebees when it comes to water.  my husband is a stickler for having a drink at all times, and the service here was an epic fail in that department.  it was so random, the servers would come by, fill up one water glass and neglect two others on the table.  i expected that they ran out of water, but no.. they just moved on to another table and poured more water for another patron.  what the heck?\n\nby the end of our meal, we'd lost a server completely (hadn't seen him in quite a while), and the other, more jovial one, was notified that we were disappointed that they couldn't keep glasses filled, and that the service was lacking.  \ni've eaten at numerous high end places in my day.. this is not one we'll be returning to, sadly.  i have found other steakhouses in vegas to be as comparably priced with excellent cuts of meat and far better service. \n\nwe were seated at our table at 6:30p.  we finally left around 9:30p.  while i'm glad they didn't rush us through, i can now see why they didn't have a reason to.", 
            "my review will strictly be on what i ordered:\n\n<mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan - probably the best flan i've had thus far.  they had obviously taken the time and finesse to make sure the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> was cooked evenly.  the texture was luscious, melt-in-you-mouth, and rich.  the mushroom puree alongside was fantastic and brought each bite a bit more earthiness.\n\nu.s.d.a. prime dry aged 35 days - true steak/beefy flavor.  tasted like a nice steak straight from your own grill, just with a bit more quality to it.  \n\namerican wagyu from snake river farms - fat was nicely marbled throughout, without being too overwhelming.  great beefy flavor throughout.  \n\ntrue japanese 100% wagyu beef from miyazaki prefecture, kagoshima - while each bite was to die for, i could only handle just a few.  heavily marbled to the point where that flavor you anticipate from a good steak is lost.  you know that fatty strip alongside a <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>? that's what the entire steak tasted like.  \n\nchocolate souffle - as someone who focuses in patisserie, i was hesitant trying this, given that were were in a steakhouse and typically speciality restaurants lose focus on all other items.  i was wrong.  the souffle was beautiful... light.. airy... yet so decadent at the same time.\n\noverall:  amongst the 3 steaks i've tried, i prefer the american wagyu.  it still delivered a marvelous beefy flavor that you want from a steak, while delivering a slight richness from the marbling.  well balanced in my opinion.  \n\nlike i always say, you won't know unless you try it for yourself!", 
            "the service is always great, very attentive. the food was very tasty, we all had steak, three petite filets and a <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>....brussels sprouts were really good and of course the desserts are delicious. we had a bottle of  coho and biale. it's always nice when robert biale is on the wine list.",

            "if i could give this place a zero, i would. i haven't gotten into the swing of yelping often but this is one of those experiences that is so terrible that you just have to write about it. and actually, i went months ago, but looks like i never finished my review.\n\ncame here with a group of 14 girls for a bachelorette party. we had spent weeks picking out the perfect place for dinner and were really looking forward to our meal. they go through the motions of being a five star restaurant but you can tell they definitely don't think you're a five star customer. you might think we're a prissy/snooty bunch but i assure you, we could have eaten hot dogs and been happy but we chose a nice place so we could have a memorable experience.\n\nstarted with the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> appetizer. it was tasty as marrow usually is, you can probably share it since it came with two pieces and it's so rich. i had the australian wagyu. good quality meat though i've had <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> prepared much better. it's just a slab of meat on your plate, not to mention overcooked. presentation points: 0. *shrugs maybe i wanted to be impressed since it is a wolfgang puck restaurant, oh well. \n\nthey suggested that we get sides to share for each half of the table. there was a misunderstanding when a waiter began to serve out sides on our individual plates that was actually for the other side. even after asking him to stop, he ignored our request and kept serving away. one of the head waitresses came over to ask what was wrong. she told us that all sides were supposed to be family style and left it at that. family style is fine but if that's the case, don't put it on everyone's plate if they don't want to eat it, especially after we asked you not to. her tone was so extremely rude that many of us were taken aback.\n\nmaybe it's because we were a large group but i can honestly say that i have never been treated so poorly at any dining establishment. we even talked to a manager and i can't even bring myself to tell you their response. so disappointing. the only reason cut is 'memorable' is because i can't forget how unhappy we were when we finally left. poor attitudes, poor communication, poor service all around. \n\nnever again. and anytime a friend mentions vegas, i tell them to stay away from cut. really not worth the price you pay.", 
            "before cut the only vegas steak places i had been to were carne vino (amzing) and envy (terrible). i came to vegas to interview for a job and the guy who recruited me took me to cut for dinner. it was very, very good.\n\ni ordered two different bourbon drinks- i think both had ginger- they don't appear to be on the menu anymore but one was similar to the samurai they serve now. both were delicious. \n\ni got a <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> appetizer- it came with a raspberry sauce on the pork that was incredible- one of the best <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> dishes i have ever had. \n\ni alwyas get bone in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> and potato side when i go to a new steak place for comparison purposes. the steak here didn't have as much of a crust as i would like but it was seasoned well and the meat was very well cooked. the <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> was smooth, not lumpy, seasoned well. \n\nfor desert they brought us free baked alaska because they \"like to take care of thier locals\"- i wasn't a local yet but with food like this i was well on my way to becoming one. it was excellent- baked alaska is a personal favorite of mine and this one was very well done. \n\nlet me say one other thing- the bread. bread can be a good way to distinguish good restaurants from great and cut definately nails it. they have a few different types that seem to rotate from what i can tell (pretzel is one of the best) and they bring it around on a cart. you can get whatever you want, as much as you want. this is good- it avoids fights to the death over the last <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> bread a la gordon ramsay steak. \n\ni have since been back 3-4 times and enjoyed it thoroughly every time. \n\n\na general note on vegas steak - some of the negative reviews of cut are just ludicrous. they didn't have a1? well guess what, you are gonna get a1 almost nowhere when it comes to fine dining. the steak came by itself on a plate without any circles painted on the plate or sliced up vegetables constructed like legos into an art piece? its a steak house. seriously, if you have no idea where you are going its not really fair to post a negative review that boils down to \"this place wasn't the perfect hybrid of sizzler and alinea i was hoping for\". steak places in vegas are producing a very specific product to compete with a very specific set of restaurants. if you want a cheaper place with a1 why are you going to cut? similarly if you care about plating why are you going to a steak restaurant? use your brain.",

            "it was sunday night. the last night of our three day binge of vegas to celebrate my 30th birthday and the close of my \"roaring twenties\" decade.\n\nwhere does one go for their last meal in vegas let alone the last meal of their decade? \n\nbeing the dedicated researcher that i am, i found that cut by wolfgang puck had the reputation of being one of the best steak houses in vegas, if not the country. i took a chance and booked this restaurant as the capstone of my trip and hopefully a delicious finish to the decade.\n\nand boy, did it not disappoint.\n\nwhen we arrived, my buddies and i were ushered by a young, pretty hostess to a vip table with couch seating replete with accent pillows overlooking the entire restaurant; almost as if we were seated at the head table and the entire restaurant was attending our party. we opened a parsimonious menu that listed a total of approximately 18 entrees, all steaks, all aged between 21-35 days. one of my buddies ordered the nebraska cattle 14 oz <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> strip (aged 35 days). he was a big guy yet he was barely able to finish his meal.\n\nnow allow me to get to the most important part... the pi\\u00e8ce de r\\u00e9sistance of their menu: authentic wagyu beef imported from japan's miyazaki prefecture. \n\nour server presented our table raw wagyu and \"american wagyu\" (composed of a cross breed of wagyu and american cattle) cuts of <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> and <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> strip to demonstrate the marbling of these impressive specimens of meat. an opportunity was presented for me to check off one of the loftiest items on my bucket list: a wagyu steak dinner. the price of an 8 oz <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> cut of one of the most sought-after steaks on the planet? a cool $155. \n\ndespite the high cost of this privilege, i couldn't turn down an opportunity to enjoy what would likely be one of the greatest meals of my life. another buddy of mine took the plunge with me on this life-changing experience. we both ordered identical items: the 8 oz <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> (medium rare), a side of seasoned french fries, and creamed spinach topped with a <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> accompanied with a glass of malbec. solomon in all his riches never could have ordered a more decadent meal.\n\n40 excruciating minutes later, our meal was at last presented to us. i sliced off my first piece and as i completed the first bite, it felt like the heavens burst forth and angels were singing the hallelujah chorus in rapturous praise. fellow yelpers, i was not eating a steak. oh no. this was god speaking to us. delighting in us. cutting into the steak was like cutting into marbled butter from heaven, with the meat dissolving in my mouth; absorbing into my very soul.\n\n***\n\nt'was a meal that i will never forget. as we finished paying our bill, the manager of the restaurant came and thanked us for patronizing his restaurant though i'm sure it should've been us thanking him. a wonderful meal to cap off a wonderful decade. i'm not sure how many more decades the good lord has in store for me. however, if he should choose to allow me to choose my final meal on this earth, i would like to travel back to this restaurant and enjoy one more time that which is truly a gift from on high.", 
            "cut is definitely one of the top restaurants in las vegas. it's price is comparable to other steakhouses of that quality. i also went to carnevino and thought cut was far better in all aspects. the service was top notch, the steak and tuna tartar were both great as well as the bread and mac and cheese. i had the <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> and my friend had the filet. i would definitely say go with the <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, can't beat the flavor.",

(ask for a booth as the regular tables and chairs looked not-so-pleasant). \n\nthe prices are pretty high but the quality and presentation makes it (almost) worth it. don't expect to get out of here without paying at least $200 on a dinner for two. we had 2 appetizers, 2 steaks, 2 sides, 2 glasses of wine and 2 dessert and our total check was around $275.00 (before tip). we didn't go for the crazy expensive meat, just the \"regular\" <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> and bone-in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>. the steaks were good and the wood fired cooking gave them a nice flavor. the steaks come with a few different sides of mustards (i've never seen that before at a steakhouse). \n\nas others have noted, i found everything here to be extremely salty. it was like somebody knocked over the salt bowl into the food. i had the squash as a side and it was coated in salt. the steak was crusted with salt. the steaks came out with a small bowl of extra salt and a spoon! the butter for the bread is topped with salt, as is the bread itself (pretzel and foccacia is where it's at, ya'll)! if you are looking for a salt lick, this is the place for you. next time i am going to ask them to tone down the salt in my food, it was almost unbearable but not to the point of making the food inedible.\n\nthe wine list is abysmal but we were told the corkage fee if you bring your own wine is a very steep $50 (that's what the french laundry in napa valley charges)! luckily there were some good options of wines by the glass -- we opted for the hall cabernet for $19 a glass. totally worth it.",

            "definitely the best steak i've ever had, ever.  the u.s. wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> that i had (done medium) was juicy and super flavorful. ordered 2 sauces but didn't end up needing them as the steak was fantastic on its own. took the additional caramelized onion topping and it went very well with the steak. highly recommended - i am definitely returning.!!", 
            "definitely worth a visit. and no, it's not one of those places that are overhyped. had the maryland blue crab and carolina shrimp for starter- crab was fresh and sweet, texture of the firm shrimps combined with the soft avocado was well balanced and the horseradish added just the right amount of punch to the sea flavors. i like my meat with more flavor and some texture rather than totally melt-in-your-mouth , so i decided to go with the u.s (<mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> of japanese) wagyu <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark>. this was tender and flavorful for a <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark>. i asked for medium and it was cooked to perfection - well seared on the outside and beautifully charred which gave it that smoky flavor and pink in the middle with the juice retained. creamed spinach was slightly weak in flavor for my liking but mac-n-cheese was great. we paired the meat with a darioush signature range cab sav- good amount of depth but still easy to drink and fairly affordable.", 
            "amazing steak house. had one of the best <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> (with an egg on it). the short rib (cooked with garam masala), wagyu sashimi are amazing.", 
            "the creme de la creme of steakhouses.\n\na group of friends and i had an open sunday, so we decided why not do a fancy dinner. cut was our pick. seating was a breeze. made reservations on opentable and got seated at a large round table in the back when we arrived. it was like our own little area. \n\nit's difficult not to leave impressed. the waiters and waitresses are amazing here. so attentive. they offered a variety of complimentary breads on a tray and we were able to select as little or as many as we wanted. get the focaccia for sure. that was the favorite among the table.\n\ni can only speak for what i personally ordered... the u.s.d.a. prime <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> 12 oz ($59). it was delicious!! cooked to perfection with a fine crust to give it that extra texture but, be warned, there's tons of fat. on the plus side, fat equals flavor! you can also choose from a list of sauces to compliment your meats. i got to try their armagnac and <mark>Armagnac & Green Peppercorn</mark> as well as the spicy red chimichurri ($2 each). both tasted great with the <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>. one was enough for 2-3 people. i had a ton left over.\n\nall the meats are served a la carte. the table got a double order of mac & cheese ($19) and it was to die for! so glad we got a double. we also shared an order of their creamed spinach ($12) and <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> ($22), which were just alright to me. one order for seven people left everyone with only a couple bites of each side. you can see in the attached pictures.\n\nwolfgang puck knows how to do fine-dining well. the atmosphere is elegant and perfect for celebrations or a nice date. just wished it didn't dent the wallet so much. i always cringe a little when i see that four $$$$ sign, but you're paying for quality i suppose!", 
            "cut was one of the best, if not the best steakhouse experience i've ever had.\n\nthe first thing i noticed was a very nice decor - somewhat minimalist, but a bit trendier i'd say than the traidtional wood panelled steakhouse, but not in that i'n your face' all style, no substance way. i think id say very classy. the area was a dimly lit (but not overly so) open space with relatively high ceilings and good spacing between tables. also, for those gentleman hoping to impress a lady friend, the pictures on the wall of brad pitt and denzel washington (depending on your gal's preferences) combined with the wine selection should help your cause. cut is good for various purposes - for example, in the room i was seated, there was a large table of friends (10-12 of mixed gender), a date (me, haha, look at me, right?), and a table of about 4 elegant, but young looking grandmas (love seeing a bunch of grandmas out to devour steaks!). \n\nservice was friendly, attentive and considerate. they start with the ipad wine and drink selection, which is great for two reasons: (1) the date looks at me like i'm classy trying to pair the correct grape and vintage for the type of steak we are getting, while i am actually just sorting from lowest to highest price and obviously going for the cheapest bottle they had (see above, the whole brad pitt thing, fine wine is no longer needed).  (2) i can obviously check to see if clash of clans is also on the ipad so i can make sure my village isn't being raided while i go out for dinner. one thing i will note on the service, i get they are trying to educate the consumer, but the meat cart ala mortons 1998 is really not needed. but who am i to tell mr. puck how to run a restaurant - he did afterall, have a guest appearance on the show las vegas in ohhh 2005, which really upset me that they never finished it a made a season 7.  \n\nanyway, the menu was very interesting, and i kinda liked the different categories of steak. for appetizer we went wtih the crab/shrimp/avocado thing, which was one of the best appetizers i've ever had in  my life.  i would say def give it a try. also the bread selection and butter was excellent.\n\nso on to the steak - we went with the weygu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, and i had the wegyu sirloin sampler, medium rare.  both were cooked perfectly and were some of the best steaks i've ever had.  also, i love when you get a plate with a hunk of meat on it (in my case, 3 lil guys), and not a whole bunch of garnishes and silliness which is an attempt to mask the fact you aren't getting a good steak. so you can order sauces on the side (mine came with sauces), and the sauces were all really good - for the bread and the <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark> (which were very good by the way, not too greasy). because, while i am not going to judge, these weren't really the kind of steaks to put sauce on. the otherside we ordered was creamed spinanch - also excellent.\n\ni had the mango gelatto white cake thingy for dessert, which was just ok - i don't know if it was the dish, or just my palate, but figured id try a dessert anyway.\n\nlastly, the price - $$$$, as you probably already know.  it's very expensive, but in my opinion, well worth it for a special occassion. maybe i'll have good luck at the slot machines and be able to splurge for it again, but until that time, i guess i'll be choosing between denny's and the outback on the strip.", 
            "the best meal i've ever had in las vegas! this place has the best steak there is in town! there are so many assortments of meat to choose from. the waitress came out with an assortment of raw meat for us to look at and choose from at the very beginning. you could see how each type of meat have different amount of fat. i absolutely love the japanese wagyu beef. it literally melts in your mouth. \n\nbest starters - prime sirlo<mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> tartare with her aioli and mustard. and prime <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> carpaccio.\n\nbest steak- japanese wagyu beef <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> \n\nbest add on- <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>( they cut it out for us) \n\nsauce- my favorite is the <mark>Creamy Horseradish</mark> sauce.", 
            "tonight was a great experience from beg fining to end.\nwe started with the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, american wagyu sashimi and <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> appetizers and honestly i'm very confused on what i liked the must, every bite was better than the one prior and god i wouldn't ordered again if i didn't have the main meal coming.\nmy main meal was the japanese wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> with an extra 2oz added to it with the amazing mac and cheese and wow was it good, i saved a two bite piece for as long as i could as i didn't want the wine to be the last taste i had on my evening. \n\nthe service was great but the meal was one to repeat.\n\nhighly recommend the restaurant and the price was not as outrageous as i expected.\n\n\nthanks,", 
            "okay - the food here is absolutely delicious. the <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> was so unbelievably tender, and even more delicious topped with <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>. the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> dumpling and oxtail soup was flavorful, and the perfect start to the meal. the seafood 'lump' salad was refreshing and light.\n\nmy only gripe (it was a big one) was the incident that happened at the end of our meal... my friend had brought cupcakes to celebrate a birthday, and was told over the phone it was a $14 flat rate. the cupcakes came, we sang happy birthday, and went along our merry way. however... when the bill came, it was a whopping $168 for a cake cutting fee.\n\n$168... are you freaking kidding me? for 12 cupcakes? absurd. a few things...\n\n1. you don't cut a cupcake - everyone knows that\n2. when we spoke to the manager, he said he had spoken to my friend on the phone that day and told her about the $14 per person cake cutting fee - which was a lie... my friend had spoken to a different representative weeks ago\n3. desserts at the restaurant aren't even that much\n4. if we had known about the absurd fee, and it had been communicated to us, we wouldn't have brought in the cupcakes\n\nanyways. 5 stars for food and service, but the cupcake incident was a serious debbie downer for our meal. as a restaurant that charges a premium for food and service, they really need respect their customers more.", 
            "overall, the service and food were good. however, for the price you pay and the caliber i would expect from wolfgang puck, i was disappointed in the reason you go to a steakhouse: the meat! i'll start with the pros, though:\n\npros: excellent service. i had to wait for my party in the cocktail area and was promptly served bar snacks like duck confit popcorn, homemade salt and vinegar chips, olives, and a glass of wine. after we were seated, the waitstaff was very attentive, took care of all of my food allergies, and we were served in a timely manner.\n\nthe sides and appetizers were incredible. the crab louie, <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark> salad, mushrooms, and creamy polenta were among our favorites. the cocktails and wine list were excellent as well. it was the best cosmo we had the entire trip and the best pinot noir!\n\ncons: the steak. i don't get it. it's a steakhouse and when you're paying $85+ for a wagyu steak, you'd expect top notch preparation. our steaks tasted like lighter fluid. it was pittsburgh style, so it was charred on the outside, but <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> of being searing in butter, it just tasted like gasoline. i didn't even finish my 8 oz filet and neither did others in our party. \n\noverall, i was disappointed, especially considering i frequent the cut in beverly hills quite often. i would try another steak house (of which there are numerous in the palazzo/venetian alone!).", 
            "first off, the service and atmosphere were great, but we go out to eat for the food, so i am going to explain my measly three stars by telling you about the items that we ordered and what was wrong and right with each of them. this is one of most expensive meals i have ever eaten, so if i am going to spend nearly $300 on dinner (w/o wine or other drinks) then it better blow me away. it fell woefully short of that. \n\n1. bread selection-2 out the 5 we were offered were tasty. the rest were bland. the cheese pastry puffs were great, but then they were ruined in a way by being too spicy for bread.\n\n2. drinks-i don't drink alcohol but the arnold palmer i ordered was way too sour. the second try was better, but was too sweet. i had to ask for more lemon and water it down to be enjoyable. \n\n3. salads/appetizers-i ordered the seafood salad with lobster, crab, and shrimp. the top portion was tasty (i don't know how you could go wrong with the holy trinity of shellfish), but on the bottom there was this weird pudding/custard type of stuff that was way too sweet and took up most of the volume of the dish. for a $31 appetizer/ salad i felt that i deserved more than a little bit of seafood on top of a white mystery substance. my wife ordered the <mark>Pink Lady & Fuji Apple Salad</mark>. it was good but dressed too lightly. all i could really taste were the tart pink lady apples. if i was to serve this salad i would have gone heavy on the almonds and cheese to balance out all of the tartness of the apples.\n\n4. main dishes-my wife ordered the dover sole. she can't tolerate garlic. there was quite a debate about the garlic (or lack thereof) in the sauce that goes over the fish between the wait staff and the kitchen. finally it was revealed that the sauce hasn't had garlic in it for a few months, so she got the sauce. her fish was deboned tableside, which was a nice touch, but meant that she had to eat her main before everyone else's meals came out so the fish wouldn't be cold. i had a bite and it was really tasty, but her complaint was that after eating her main, she was still a bit hungry as it was small. \ni ordered the nebraska <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> with a red wine reduction sauce. i would prefer my steak a bit warmer (i ordered medium) and with less spice rub. also, the red wine reduction was just sweet-no saltiness or richness of a pan sauce like i make at home. the mustards were great to have at the table, but why would these be necessary? mustard is usually used to cover up the taste of old meat! having salt along with the mustards was smart and i used it. my <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> was lacking salt, so once i added the salt it was tasty. definitly the most expensive steak i have ever ordered, but the not the best i have ever eaten, so yeah-a let down. also, the other two <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> at the table had lots of grisle and fat. mine was more lean and the fat rendered out more thoroughly.\n\n5. sides- we ordered quite a few. creamed spinach, my favorite side at a steakhouse was the most disappointing. the egg added to the spinach tableside ruined it for me. it tasted like a spinach and egg breakfast burrito. not good at all. whipped potatoes were very bland (lacking salt or butter). no one at the table liked them. brussel sprouts were very good, but had so much sweetness they were like candied vegetables. the best side dish by far were the roasted sweet potatoes with curry spice. very good, we ordered another one. the other side dishes were unmemorable. \n\n6. dessert-i would skip dessert and go somewhere else if i dined with them again. my wife's berry tart was tasty, but she couldn't finish it. way too tart and sweet. my banana cream pie was just ok. the bananas tasted a little under ripe and they were cold. the crust was not good. nothing special here folks. again, for the prices, you would expect to be at least pleasantly surprised, but no.", 
            "easily the best service i've had in quite some time.  everyone was attentive and great at what they do.  <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> + <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> apps were fantastic.  i had the wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> and the 35+ day aged <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>. both were fantastic, but if i could go back, i'm not sure if i would get the wagyu again.  i was hoping for an out-of-the-world steak, but <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark>, it was just great. \n\ni only had time to go to one steakhouse in vegas.  trust me, i did my research before choosing cut and i'm very glad that i did.", 
            "when you charge $65 - $105 per steak, the experience has to be out of this world; i was not blown away. if you plan on coming here, keep your expectations in check and have in the back of your mind that you're paying an additional 25% for the las vegas dining experience; if you do that, you'll be happy.\n\nonto the highlights of our meal -- the service. my golly the service was spot-on. i felt like royalty dining with the duchess of cambridge. when you leave your chair and leave the napkin on the seat, they come by, remove and give you a fresh new one -- it's the attention to detail that makes the service amazing. \n\nthe complimentary bread was fancy bread that was served table-side with a server placing each bread on your plate ever so gently. however, it was not warm bread -- stone cold bread. i was confused. most high end restaurants serve bread warm because it just tastes so much better warm. \n\nonto the reason we came: the steaks. 4 of us came here, we ordered the:\n1. [2x] american waygu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> 9oz ($88 each): this should have been the star of the show but it was not. before ordering your steaks, the waiter actually brings raw steaks wrapped neatly and explains the different cuts of waygu and basically sells you on the more expensive cut. we ordered it. call me a steak-snob, but for waygu, i was expecting melt-in-your-mouth bites -- it was more tough than i expected. it was only marginally better than the 35 dry aged <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, and certainly not $30+ better. \n\n2. [1x] usda prime, nebraska corn fed, dry aged 35 days <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> 12oz ($63): this was a solid cooked <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>. no frills, no overselling. delicious <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>.\n\n3. [1x] <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark>: this was surprisingly the star of the show. it was the melt-in-your-mouth experience i was expecting (and for a fraction of the waygu price). \n\nprotip (seriously protip): if you have a reservation, call ahead, ask to speak to a manager and ask him/her that you want to do \"the sampling\" of the waygu. if you're convincing enough, they will make a dish with a 2 oz cut of the regular dry-aged <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, 2 oz cut of the american waygu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, and 2 oz of the japanese waygu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>. (at least 2 people in your party have to order this) had i known this going in, i would've done this so you can taste the differences <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark>.\n\npros: service is impeccable\ncons: oversold on the waygu (good steak, but not \"out-of-this-world\" great)", 
            "this place is absolutely amazing. from the d\\u00e9cor to the customer service to the taste everything is nothing short of spectacular. granted, given the price, it's not something many people could have on a regular basis. but if you're looking for a fancy night out, a special dinner, this has to be on your list of considerations. \nthe wagyu sashimi is a starter you have to try. super tender, not overly seasoned, it's more filling than it looks. \nthe crab cakes are also super fresh and delicious. \ni was recommended the taste of <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark>, which is a sample of their different steaks. although they're all really good, i would recommend skipping it and just going for the 100% japanese wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>. definitely take advantage of the additional ounce option for a better deal. the texture of the meat is unlike anything you've ever tried, guaranteed. the add ons i'm actually not too fond of, but to each their own.", 
            "excellent! we ordered the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> to start and i practically licked the plate clean. got the waygu tasting and my husband got the <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>. both were delicious and perfectly cooked. the creamed spinach and polenta we got as sides were also amazing. \n\nthe only thing that wasn't out of this world was the dessert - had the chocolate souffl\\u00e9 which was good but not great. \n\nservice was also very good. no complaints!", 
            "i have been on this earth for 44 years and have spent approximately 43 of those years searching for the perfect steak. i have traveled far and wide, small towns and large cities, dives and, well you get the picture. about 10 years ago i had an elk steak at a restaurant <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> springs, co. said steak was my #1 steak since that time. enter cut and now my steamboat springs steak was finally bumped. \n\nthis was my second visit and had to make sure i wasn't out of my mind the first go around.  i even ordered the exact same meal to ensure an apples to apples comparison. i ordered the american wagyu filet with asparagus, macaroni and cheese, and <mark>Caramelized Onions</mark>.  if memory serves me correctly, the steak was $85 and each side was $13 each. we had a party of 4, 3 of us having the same thing. \n\nall i have to say is damn!  best steak in the history of this guy's life!  a fork will cut this filet and the sides were great. very simple process - sea salt and cracked pepper. if you ask for <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> i hope the waiter bitch slaps you.  service was unbelievable and prompt.  all 4 agreed on one thing - best damn steak and best damn service in the history of meat!", 
            "probably the best steak i have ever had in my entire life. seriously. and i'm not some rube who orders their steak medium well, and thinks ruth's chris is the end all for steaks. what we ordered:\n\nstarters: \n\n- <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark>, wasabi, ginger, togarashi crisps, tosa soy: \ndelicious, but i wouldn't say a \"must order\"\n\n- <mark>Warm Asparagus</mark>, poached <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>, warm bacon vinaigrette:\nsounds simple, right? well, a guy comes out, breaks the poached eggs for you and pours the warm bacon vinaigrette right there in front of you, so that it hits the asparagus just seconds before it combines and hits your mouth. it was delicious and i would recommend!\n\nentrees:\n\n- american wagyu beef <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> \n\n- true japanese 100% wagyu beef <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> \n\nmy boss and i decided to try the american wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> and the japanese wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, cut them in half, and share, so that we could compare the two. as a person who loves rich food, i must say that the japanese wagyu was actually a bit too fatty for me. \nour server had went over the differences of the meats before we ordered, and had indeed told us that the japanese wagyu was fatty, even bringing out various cuts of the raw steaks, showing us how the fat runs through this type of meat, so we weren't unprepared for it. \nmy american wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> was absolute perfection. i ordered it rare plus, as did my boss with his japanese cut. it was rich and perfectly fatty, in my opinion. the japanese cut, being more of a delicacy and more expensive, made sense to me, it just wasn't my preference. i have a friend who loves to eat the pure fat pieces that hang on the sides of meat.  i could see him totally loving the japanese wagyu.\n\nsides:\n\n-mac & cheese:\nphenomenal. i would believe that night it had truffle in it, and it was perfection. definitely an indulgence that you must try\n\n- curry spiced cauliflower:\nreally good, but i don't think the flavor profiles went well with everything else we ordered. \n\nour server was an absolute delight. i can't remember his name, but i think he said that he was originally from southern california. he looked about 30 with short brown hair and really knew what  he was talking about. if he or anyone from the restaurant is reading this, thank you. he made our experience wonderful. he had a great personality. \n\nthe ambiance in the restaurant is very lovely. sitting down, i immediately felt like i was in a high class establishment and would be in for a treat. overall, this was a heavenly experience that i hope i can take part in again someday!", 
            "i came here with my colleagues for a celebration dinner and we all truly loved the meal. cut includes great little touches such as amazing pretzel bread and tasty parmesan cheese sticks before the meal and warm cookies served after dessert. the wine and champagne were delicious and the service was impeccable, but the food really stole the show! \n\ni had the burrata appetizer and it was melt-in-your-mouth creamy and delicious; a fantastic combination of flavors. i also ate about five of the pretzel rolls, which i started to regret once the entrees and sides rolled out. but they were really delicious so i didn't regret it thatttt much.  \n\nfor my meal i ordered the japanese wagyu <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> cut and as the waiters described it was incredibly tender. it does melt in your mouth but i found that sensation was mostly because the meat has so much marbling. i actually preferred my colleague's wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> because it was less fatty. \n\nwe ordered the following sides:\n--creamed spinach with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>- creamed spinach is my go-to steak side dish and this one did not disappoint\n--cavatappi pasta mac & cheese- easily some of the best mac and cheese i've ever tasted\n--<mark>Soft Polenta with Parmesan</mark>- good but not the best\n\nand desserts, all of which were fantastic:\n--creamsicle baked alaska\n--fuji apple & medjool date crumble\n--valrhona chocolate souffl\\u00e9\n--banana cream pie\n\noverall i'd highly recommend cut for a special night out on the town.", 
            "came here with the bf and a friend. this place is good, but i think falls a little short of the 4 stars. \n\nthe pretzel bread they offer is awesome. i like dipping it in the mustard offerings. i also like the onion foccacia bread. i like that they come around with a bread plate to give you as much as you like of any of the breads. most places give you a basket, and it's never enough of the one bread you like and too much of the breads you don't like. \n\nthe friend and i got the american wagyu center cut <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> medium rare. the flavor is incomparable. my bf got the 12 oz omaha <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, which was also very delicious. the omaha was more butter, but the flavor of the wagyu was bolder. we got the sides of the <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> and <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>. the mushrooms had shishito peppers in them that we all felt didn't really complement the flavors of the mushrooms. the mushrooms on their own were good though. the <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> was decent. \n\nservice is stellar here though. they don't miss a beat at all. \n\noverall, i was happy we came, and i ate a lot of steak! :)",

            "soooooo disappointed! overrated, lacking good management and service, hit and miss food. i have been here about 2 years ago and sat at the bar and remember the service and food was great.  saturday march 21st after a rough day at the sports books, i recommeded this place to two friends of mine as our annual steakhouse. had a drink at the bar prior to our table being ready. this was a sign.  barely acknowledged, and 2 of the 3 drinks were incorrect. 10 minutes after initial order we had drinks in hand. sat at our table about 10:30pm. the gentleman that proceeded take our water and wine order was great and we had our wine our without a hitch. waitress came by a few minutes later to tell us about the wagyu. personal preference is wagyu is better cut and cooked sliced or cubed so i proceeded to order the bone-in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>. my friends ordered the sirloin and strip i believe. we ordered 3 sides to split. here is where it goes downhill fast. gentleman that initially helped us comes by 10 minutes after we ordered to tell us they are out of the mac and cheese. ok, dissapointing and curious why the waitress didnt tell us and it took 10 minutes but still anxious for some good steaks coming. almost done with the wine, we noticed its been 40 minutes we noticed the waitress has not come back by the table. the initial gentleman came by once to top off our wine. so i called him over again and asked about our food. he goes to check on it comes back and says he told the waitress and manager of our wait. i would expect either the waitress or manager to come by so i ask him to have them come by our table to express our concern.  the waitress comes by and she says that she placed the order in the kitchen at 10:57, its now 11:40pm. she says that the food will be out in about 8-10 minutes.  ok, someone slipped up or they are backed up, happens. but the restaurant is only about half full for the last 30 minutes. ok consensus now is that the service is not on par with a good steakhouse but a simple diner. interesting enought the steaks come out about 3 minutes later, the apps a full minute afterwards. still optimistic i cut into my steak and wow! overcooked, dry and room temperature. two bites and i asked the gentleman helper to get the manager asap. (never saw the waitress again). of the other two steaks one was average at best and the other was very below average. my friends are starving and decided to eat their steak, i could not eat more than two bites. here is the most frustrating part. generally good restaurant and pricey, so figure this was a total fluke and the manager would be completely empathetic. no! he came over and just the expression is that he was annoyed that he was present. his initial comment was  \"how can i help you\". i told him the whole story and his response was \"i will take that into consideration for next time, what would you like me to do know?\". i could not belive the smug attitude and told him to please take away my steak. he did no remorse, of course they didnt charge me for my steak but he didnt even assure me that he would not (i wanted to see if they would try so didnt say anything). he simply proceeded to leave.  i didnt want anything more, but expected from this type of establishment to be offered a free coffee!?! well again the gentleman helper came by 10 minutes later when we were all done and offered me an espresso. my feeling is this place is overrated, turn and burn.  use their name and location to get people in and dont care if you come back. the service is on par with a diner at best, not a steahkouse. by the way all the sides (fries, cream spinach, <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>) were terrible as well. -ken",

            "you can pretty much assume that every las vegas casino has a steakhouse inside. when choosing an appropriate steakhouse for our bachelor party dinner, cut was the place to go because it has everything you want in a first class restaurant. they start you off with five types of complimentary bread (my favorite was the bread sticks). i ordered the 12 oz <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> medium rare...i couldn't find anything wrong with it except that it was one of the best steaks i've ever had. we split a bunch of sides including the <mark>Hand Cut French Fries with Herbs</mark>, <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>, and creamed spinach with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>. the creamed spinach was arguably the highlight of the meal!\n\nwhether it's the sexy ambiance, impeccable service, or perfectly cooked steak, cut is sure to be in the discussion for best steakhouses in vegas. the venetian/palazzo is my favorite resort to stay at in vegas, and if i'm not feeling adventurous for food one night, i know i'll always have a perfect meal waiting at cut.", 
            "best restaurant ever!\n\ni want to marry one of the waiters because they are so well dress, well manner, and so submissive. our waiter would ask \"would you like more [insert food item here] dear?\"\n\ni got up from the table looking for the bathroom. our waiter saw me and walked me to the bathroom <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> of telling me where it is. \n\nour waiter asked if we wanted any dessert? we had to tell him we couldn't eat another bite.", 
            "here again with my mom and wife for my birthday.  i need to say up front we love cut. it is one of our very favorite steakhouses period.\n\ntonight we were celebrating my birthday. as always they start with an amuse bouche which is simply delish. it is a bite sized cheese souffle. \n\nthe bread offerings at cut are wonderful. best of any of the restaurants we have been to anywhere. onion focaccia, pretzel roll, and pumpernickel as well as cheese encrusted super long and thin bread sticks. wow, so good.\n\nwe all had an appetizer. mine was a crab/lobster dish that was so good and the best of the lot. my wife had the <mark>Pink Lady & Fuji Apple Salad</mark> which she loved and mom had the beet dish.\n\nwe all had steak or course. i didn't see the steak sampler on the menu which gives you a 2.4 oz portion of 3 steaks to try, some aged domestic, a kobe domestic and a japanese kobe, so i asked the waiter and the chef went ahead and let me have it. all were amazing. there is a very distinct difference between the domestic and the kobes to be sure. the kobes are much marbled and the flavor is more subtle. between the domestic kobe and the japanese kobe the difference is there but not enough imo to justify the price difference. in the future i will probably go for the domestic kobe because it is in the sweet spot of price and flavor.\n\nmy wife had the domestic kobe <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> and my mother had a domestic aged strip. all were amazing!\n\nsides: we shared creamed spinach, brussel sprouts, sushito pepper dish. all wonderful.\n\nwine: we shared a bottle of pinot noir which was excellent.\n\ndesert: we shared 3, the banana cream pie dish, the chocolate souffle and lemon cheesecake which was amazing.\n\nthe service was 5+/5, food 5+/5 probably our best experience so far at cut! we can't wait to go back!", 
            "our meal last night was terrific. the service was impeccable without being pretentious including the wine selection assistance and presentation. we all had steak and mine was a substantial bone-in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> which they brought to me perfectly prepared as i wanted it. great char on the outside and quite rare in the middle. those who wanted their meat cooked longer got theirs just as they requested. i also has a wonderful roasted squash soup with chanterrell mushrooms. simply the best i've ever had. the sides were good and gave four diners a modest serving from each. no one could consider dessert as we were fully stuffed, but maybe next time. not a budget destination, but well worth the cost.", 
            "where do i begin? this was absolutely a lovely night for me. i landed in vegas around 7pm and had dinner reservations at this place at 8:30 pm. we got there about 10 minutes prior so we decided to get a drink and wait at the bar. the hostess came up to me when our table was ready with a really nice compliment.\n\ni didn't like how we were seated in the open, near the aisle, to the restroom, but i didn't get a lot of traffic walking by so it did not seem to bother me later. our server came by as soon as we were seated. we were given these delicious thin bread sticks that had some type of cheese melted on it. we then placed our order.  after placing our order, another person came by and gave us a choice of other breads they were serving. i believe they served 5 different breads= prezel bread, onion foccaccio, walnut bread, port bread, and pumpernickel bread.\n\nfor the appetizer we ordered the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> and <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>. omg.. <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> was delightful. it was served with some type of mushroom puree which gave some earthiness to the creamy marrow. we also ordered the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>. <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> was a bit crispy in the outside and i love the texture of the inside of the fat. the dish had a balance of sweet and spicy.\n\ni ordered the american wagyu filet minon medium rare with a side of bearnaise. it was perfectly charred on the outside and medium rare in the inside. i took a bite without the sauce. i could taste the smokiness and the salt and pepper. the steak was phenomenal. the piece of steak literally melted in my mouth like butter. i did try a bite with the sauce and of course the sauce was delish, but you really don't need a side sauce with these steaks. my boyfriend ordered the usda prime nebraska corn fed <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> at medium.  same thing.. absolute perfection.\n\nwe had the mac and cheese as our side. i didn't think much of the flavor because i was so into my piece of steak. \n\nwait staff was very friendly and knowledgeable. definitely recommend this place.", 
            "just ok, service was good but slow on the drinks. party of 10. drinks were good, \nhad the bone in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, medium was cooked medium rare. 3 other peopel had <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> same thing.\nsteak was good but not great.\nnever came with my appetizer.\nbetter choices out there wynn steakhouse for sure is better.", 
            "we ordered the japanese wagyu steaks, <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> and tenderloin cuts to include the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan to start with. 4 words, 'melt in your mouth!' that basically sums up our experience with the food we ordered!! service was great but be prepared to pay a premium!! i totally recommend cut for all those who love steaks! wolfgang puck made due on his promise, cut is one of the top steak restaurants period!!"

            "3 stars goes to cut. \n\nthe steak prepared for me was absolutely spot on, perfect texture, flavor and presentation. \n\nhowever my buddies <mark>Double Thick Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark> was fatty, undercooked and overall poor (why he got a <mark>Double Thick Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark> at a steakhouse is beyond me, but to each his own)\n\nexcellent service and sides as well. but let's be honest, not worth the hype, another of la's great icon's gone bad to vegas.", 
            "to start, most the negative reviews i've read on here are written by people who don't know about high-quality steak. it's supposed to be marbled with fat -- that's where you get the flavor. and it's supposed to be charred dark on the outside -- it's not burnt but quickly charred to keep the flavor & juiciness in. \n\nthat said, our meal at cut was one of the best dining experiences we've had in a very long time, if not ever.\n\nfirst, we got a great big booth, just the 2 of us, and the atmosphere is very nice -- modern, hip -- even the music is classic rock. i love the little pedestal sinks in the bathroom, and he loved the dining room chandeliers.\n\na breadstick basket with cheese sticks arrived -- delicious -- followed by the best gougeres (cheese puffs) i've ever had. they were made of/in puff pastry, which is unusual, & so good. then, after we ordered, the bread tray with fantastic pretzel bread & focaccia, which we devoured, knowing damn well the meal would be filling. and, oh, it was.\n\nhe had the <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> with avocado on top -- a healthy & delicious portion of both. i had thinly slices asparagus on brioche with a soft-boiled egg & bacon vinagrette on top -- oh my god, it was amazing. i absolutely devoured it. all the flavors came together and made for orgasmically explosive bites.\n\nthen his dry-aged 16-oz bone-in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> & my <mark>Double Thick Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark>. both were thick, juicy, moist, cooked just right, and fantastic. our <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark> on the side were a bit superfluous, but, dipped in panko, we had to eat them cautiously so as not to fill up on such deliciousness. \n\nsomehow, we made room for dessert, and good thing. best chocolate souffle i've ever had -- served in its own little sauce pan. his apricot/blackberry crumble, with a shortbread crumble, wasn't so bad either. :)\n\nas for service, it was perfect. it was timed just right so that we got our appetizers pretty quickly but had some time to digest before dinner. the servers were all attentive, and there were many of them, and the presentation was fantastic, very old-world steakhouse elegant with tableside presentation, dishes all served simultaneously, and everything presented just right. he also loved his martini with blue-cheese-stuffed olives. both our wines were great. a little pricey by the glass, but that was no surprise.\n\nwe were a little hesitant to try cut because a) it's not so cheap, and b) wolfgang puck has spread himself a bit thin over the last 10+ years, and some restaurants have suffered because of it.\n\ncut is not one of those restaurants.", 
            "there's a couple of things to mention first: \n1.  i don't tend to like wolfgang puck restaurants - at least not since dining at spago in the mid 90s.  he puts his name on a lot and i don't know that he pays attention to any of his endeavors.\n2.  we can be food snobs - we live in san francisco and visit vegas frequently.  we have dined in many fine restaurants over time.  we always have high expectations in restaurants where the per head bill is over $100.\n\nso what was our verdict?  while we had very high expectations, we were not prepared to be totally blown away, which is what happened.\n\nit really was a perfect evening.  the service, which is done in teams without anyone missing a beat, was incredibly attentive but not intrusive.  the food was superlative.  the atmosphere was hip, modern and pleasant.  \n\nto start, don't fill up on the bread - and there's lots of it - from parmesan covered breadsticks, to cheese in puff pastry, to the bread basket with pretzels, breads and foccacia, you can make a meal of the bread.\n\nthe food was also not as expected.  it's hard to put inventive twists on normal dishes, but they managed to do so.  the <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> had unique flavors, came with great toast crisps and wasabi aoili.  it also had beautiful slices of avocado on top and presented as a perfect terrine.  normally portions for appetizers, particularly raw tuna, are very small - this was not.  and the taste was outstanding.  i had <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> the previous night at another great restaurant and it didn't compare.\n\nthe asparagus salad was so nicely presented it was almost a shame to cut into it.  each of the very thin, tender asparagus spears were perfectly lined up on a piece of brioche with a perfectly cooked poached egg gently placed on top.  \n\ni had the dry aged nebraska <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> (boneless) 16 oz.  it was a beautiful piece of meat, perfectly char grilled medium rare and with very little fat.  it was juicy, tender and perfect.  my wife had the korobuta <mark>Double Thick Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark>.  korobuta pork is the kobe beef of pork.  it was also moist, juicy and tasted great.  our sides?  fingerling potatoes with bacon confit and <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>.  both of them were perfect, but the <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark> were phenomenal.  \n\nnow my wife is a chocolate snob - she has very high standards for chocolate desserts.  she was driven to orgasmic delight by the chocolate souffle.  i, who don't like chocolate all that much, thought it was great too.\n\ni had trouble deciding between the lemon filled doughnuts and peach/blackberry crumble with 50 bean vanilla ice cream.  the waitress steered me towards the crumble and it was wonderful... they bring it out in a hot metal baking dish and spoon it into a bowl at the table.\n\nwe found out why the waitress steered me away from the doughnuts... it was my birthday and they brought me out a birthday dessert sampler which had, among other things, a lemon custard filled doughnut... the waitress was great about not spoiling the surprise and allowing me to enjoy both desserts i wanted.  \n\nso some final thoughts: \n1.  don't go if you aren't prepared for a very expensive evening - it's not cheap.  if the price tag will ruin your experience then this isn't the place for you.\n2.  the wait staff was excellent.  we were never steered to the most expensive items, she listened to what we told her our tastes were and made recommendations based on that.\n3.  if you have a martini, the <mark>Point Reyes Blue Cheese</mark> stuffed olives are incredible.\n4.  there is a big difference between wet aged, dry aged and kobe beef.  they explained very well all the differences and will help guide you to a great experience if you let them.  let them know your preferences in seasoning as well as in flavor and cooking style.  they really will try to do it your way...\n5.  a la carte is what every steakhouse does.  as annoying as it is, cut isn't the only one to do it.  if a la carte will bother you, then this may not be the place for you.  \n6.  this is both a great place for a romantic dinner and a great place for a group get together.  \n7.  this is a great place to just go and enjoy a fine meal and let the troubles of the world (and the losses at the tables) melt away.  go and enjoy!", 
            "low points first: \n- weird, office-like swivle chairs.  uncomfortable & they kill the ambiance of an otherwise decent restaurant.\n-  beef filets, even when prepared medium rare, were dry.\n-  when your food arrives there are a ton of waitstaff, but drinks were refilled too rarely & some in my party didn't get new silverware after the appetizer utensils were cleared.\n-  bernaise sauce was kind of weak.  i'd expected more.  the shallot - red wine reduction was tastier.\n-  they told us we'd reserved the \"banquet room\" and when we should up it was just two long tables standing next to one another in the middle of the dining room.  we wanted to do toasts for the groom but couldn't really without ruining everyone else's dining experience.  kinda felt like they misrepresented the space, it wasn't at all what you'd think of as a \"banquet room\".\n\ngood stuff:\n-  most everything else positive!\n-  one of the best <mark>Double Thick Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark> i've ever tasted\n-  very generous portions (if i'm paying 38 bucks for a <mark>Double Thick Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark> can i really say that?  i say \"yes, i can\".  it was big, juicy, and the size was enormous.  worth the money).  each of the sides were large as well.  unless you're super hungry and just a glutton in general, you should plan to share the app's.\n-  raw kobe app with asian spices was a bit too salty, but the flavors & texture was otherwise satisfying.  \n-  poached egg, asparagus, & bacon app was awkward to eat but was sinfully tasty!\n-  mash potatoes were good but the $25 addition of <mark>Shaved Black Truffles</mark> didn't do much for me\n-  wine was served properly and efficiently\n-  tara, our waitress, we perfect.  she dealt with my group of buddies professionally without being cold.  she gave us honest answers to our questions and made sure to stop by frequently to see if we needed anything.\n\nwith so many good dining options in vegas and me not being a big beef eater, i may not return, but if i do, i'm definitely getting that <mark>Double Thick Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark> again. omg that thing was tasty!", 
            "i went here the past friday. . .my second time being at this location.\ni love everything about it.  the atmosphere, the service and of course the food.  i'm not a really big red meat eater. . .but they have excellent mac and cheese, and sauteed mushrooms.  the <mark>Double Thick Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark> were seasoned to perfection.  my fave appetizer is the marrow.  \nit was me and 3 other gfs celebrating one of my gf's bdays.  \ni loved how attentive the servers were.  our glasses were always full.", 
            "this was my second time at cut las vegas. restaurant was beautiful, service was commendable, food was delicious. \n\nsince it was my birthday my sister-in-law treated me by splitting the new zealand <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, which was $180. i was hoping it was going to be better than the american wagyu i had tried last time, but i was a little let down. although the flavor was amazing and the steak was cooked perfectly, the texture did not seem any more tender than any other well-cooked american <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, so not really worth the additional cost to me.\n\nmy friend ordered the <mark>Double Thick Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark>, since she had not been impressed by the steak on her previous visit, and i would have to say it was pretty awesome. it was a huge portion, with the bone, seasoned deliciously and perfectly moist and tender. it was such a large portion that she cut it up into snack size bites to take home and i must say that the pork did not dry out and was still delicious when we snacked on it for breakfast the next morning (that would explain the meat in my bed!)\n\nwe also shared amongst the four of us two of the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> appetizers, a side of the mushrooms and a side of the macaroni & cheese which were all delicious. \n\nthey bring a tray of different breads to your table and you get to choose which one you like before the place it on your plate. they also roll out a cart of their prime cuts of beef to show you the marbling and educate you  more on the meat. the water glasses are filled before they even get 1/4 full. our server did take a little long to bring out our check to us, but no biggie. it was a good first dinner during our weekend in vegas.",

            "i made my bf make a reservation about a month before our trip to vegas.  we studied the menu quite awhile beforehand.  it's important to carefully consider what to eat if you're going to spend a few benjamins!  we started with the maryland blue crab and <mark>Pan Roasted Stonington Maine Lobster</mark> \"louis\" cocktail.  this was surprisingly fresh.  you can taste each of the crab or lobster when separating them into their own bite, but taking in a little bit of seafood, avocado, microgreens and tomato - everything just melds together.  i would have never guessed that the extra creamy bottom layer was panna cotta.  i wasn't into the ultra thin parmesan breadsticks or gougers (too much cheese), but was a bit more enticed by the bread selection.  i choose the onion focaccia, which was a bit salty and super soft, but the onions were sweetly caramelized.  i stay away from pretzels in general, but tried a bite of my bf's roll - best pretzel ever.  also there's no salt on it.  the menu online offered a bone in filet, but was not currently on the menu.  after having more than a few prime filets in the past couple years, i decided to take it to the next level with an american wagyu filet and topped it off with <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark>.  absolutely the most tender meat that has ever melted in my mouth to date.  my bf had the dry aged <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> topped with <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>.  the marrow pieces had a fascinating shape and texture, looking like gnocchi but bursting like gelatinous blobs.  we shared the creamed spinach with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>.  the egg adds quite a bit of extra richness.  splitting the appetizer and sharing one side gave us just enough room for dessert.  the carmelized banana cream pie with valrhona pearls was a delight.  the pearls were like little crunches with a layer inside the slice and scattered on the plate.  there was also a scoop of roasted banana ice cream for cooler contrast.  with the bill arrived yet more sweets of a piece of incredibly rich truffle-like chocolate and not as sweet, chewy cashew caramel.  overall, an amazing meal.\n\nservice was very good, but not perfect.  the d\\u00e9cor is way modern.  i'm not sure i like the swivel chairs with mesh bottoms.  also i wore a super short skirt, so i felt a bit self-conscious.  not to mention the mirrors all around, although they let me see what was happening all around without having to swivel.  now i gotta go downgrade some of my other steakhouse reviews...", 
            "i am pescetarian, so steakhouses are iffy for me. but this place is the bomb. i ordered something like the blue crab & <mark>Pan Roasted Stonington Maine Lobster</mark> with this almost sweet, buttery sauce.... and just that. simple enough, it was delicious and to the point. it was my stepdad's birthday and they even sang him happy birthday with dessert! the room was filled with belligerent  housewives and couples. i was there with my two little brothers who are 3 and 7, my friend, my mom and stepdad. we were the only family there. at $700+ for 6 people, definitely a steakhouse to spoil yourselves with (totally wasn't paying attention to what anyone else was ordering, though). love!",

            "i can't imagine going to any other steakhouse in las vegas after going to cut. it's the food, it's just near perfect. had the <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> appetizer, picture perfect, the surf and turf special with <mark>Pan Roasted Stonington Maine Lobster</mark> and japanese kobe beef. i if you never had kobe like me you have to try it. its expensive but the first bite says it all. there is nothing like it.\nservice wine and dessert excellent.  be sure to make reservation, it's very popular.", 
            "finally, a modern streak house thanks to mr. puck. make sure to make a reservation since seating is limited. eating at wolfgang restaurants can be cliche as far as what's expected, but cut is mind blowing for endless reasons. the service was impeccable since brian, my waiter really worked and expressed his efforts. although i felt bad since he was seating, he really did try his best. everyone was extremely attentive. \n\nthe ambiance is very dark/intimate but i also felt a modern office type of vibe. i thought it was rather tacky that there were large framed portfolio head shots around the restaurant of actors such as brad pitt. really threw me off since the concept of the restaurant did not mesh well with those portraits. who cares ? \n\nthe bar area is very tight, it was too small for my liking. \n\nthe food is ultimately what one should care about. be warned to throw them benjamin's for a quick sensation in that mouth that is worth it. as soon as you are, like all wolf gang establishments, you are greeted with an assortment of breads. \n\nlooking at the menu may seem daunting but don't stress out, just order something that won't surprise you. there are many cuts of meat that are offered but it would be best to order the waygu. it's hard to describe through words but wow, it was very tender. it was also a generous cut. \n\nsadly, i was not a fan of paying $2.00 for dressing up the meat aka you get to choose from the following...\n\n<mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark>       \n<mark>Wasabi-Yuzu Kosho Butter</mark>       \n<mark>Shallot-Red Wine Bordelaise</mark>       \narmagnac & <mark>Armagnac & Green Peppercorn</mark>       \n<mark>Argentinean Chimichurri</mark>       \n<mark>Creamy Horseradish</mark>       \nb\\u00e9arnaise  \n\ni was not trying to f up my order by exploring different sauces so i was smart enough to pick something i am familiar with which was the chimichurri. it went perfectly with the waygu. if you are on a budget, the u.s.d.a. prime, \"double r ranch\", loomis, washington, corn fed, aged 28 days <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark> 12 oz is another good option. \n\nthe side options were not that impressive, as far as the options go. i couldn't go wrong by ordering the <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>. yes, this intact did melt in my mouth. very rich and creamy. \n\ni also recommend the  <mark>Pan Roasted Stonington Maine Lobster</mark>, maryland blue crab & carolina shrimp \"louis\" cocktail, spicy tomato-horseradish. the combinations of this palter worked really well and the presentation was very impressive. this actually takes a long time for preparation which you will understand why after that first sip. \n\ni don't know if i would return here just because there are too many other restaurant's to experience. i have not a single complaint.",

            "in the palazzo hotel las vegas, wolfgang's cut opened with ultra slick  dining room decor and great attention to detail. im not a huge fan or wasn't a huge fan of chef puck  but whoa this steakhouse is incredible. most possibly due to the amount of energy and detail going into the service here. \n\nwe threw down for the kobe ribe eye! $140 big ones. incredible experience. i'm not sure if i would do it again however...kobe steak has a very soft i would say foie gras-esque texture. a teeny tad bit over bearing if you want to get into a good texture of steak. ahh i know ! get your friend that doesn't or hasn't tried it to order it..come on you can convince them with the ol' \" you have to try everything once in your lifetime \" line...then you order the <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> which was also masterfully done. even their cornfed iowa steak offerings are as good as you will get. \nalso did a ton of appetizers which is our 'm.o.' seafood salad was a standout ! \ndesserts...masterfully done...i actually base my <mark>Whole Roasted French Loup De Mer</mark> around getting to dessert.\noverall damage with wine : 6 people $850\n\nonly reason it doesn't get the 5 star is the items on the menu don't stretch out into the creativity zone. this was a religious steak experience by all counts however. what they do there at cut they do well...damn well ! a definite check out !", 
            "went with a big b-party before a night of booze and hangovers. it has a sleek \"too cool for school\" vibe which is the signature for vegas celeb chef restaurants. the wagyu platter was impressive as they brought it out rare to show you what you can have if you would like to sell your first born and take out a second mortgage. \n\nwent with the <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark> salad which as very good. bread selection was dominated by the pretzel bread which was phenomenal. i'm not a big steak guy, so i went with the slow roasted short ribs with indian spices. turned out to be a good choice as the doneness of all the steaks at our table were as dependable as hitting a straight flush in the poker room. \n\nsides were good though...i guess \n\nthe thing that made they <mark>Whole Roasted French Loup De Mer</mark> worthwhile was the 25% off my friend somehow came across when booking the restaurant",

            "cut is what i envision a steakhouse in heaven would be like. \nin fact, if and when i get to heaven, if there isn't a place like cut there, i will be extremely disappointed.\n\nwe went here for a friend's birthday dinner. we had a reservation, arrived on-time, and were seated promptly. the waiter was extremely knowledgable and attentive. he explained the menu thoroughly and answered any and every question we had. his recommendations were great and his overall <mark>Whole Roasted French Loup De Mer</mark> was friendly and nice. when our food arrived he was joined by several other servers who dished out our sides. the overall presentation and service was very good - i felt quite pampered :)\n\nnow onto the main thing - the food. amazing!! the cheese puffs were delicious, as were the breadsticks. the pretzel bread was wonderful too. but the main course was a grand-slam. there were 4 of us, we each got a different cut of steak and we were all in love with what we ordered. we each got a side to share, and i loved them all, especially the macaroni and cheese but most of all the creamed spinach and egg. i was the one who ordered the spinach, based on what other yelpers had said and that dish did not disappoint!!! it was fantastic, and i wouldn't have ordered it had it not been so highly rated by others on here, so thanks yelpers for helping me step out of my comfort zone and try something new there. \n\nby dessert i was too full for much else, but we got a banana something? and a lemon something? - sorry, i'm being super helpful here, i know - but both were good. but nothing compared with the main meal. it was out-of-this-world delicious.\n\ni should note, here that there was one negative - our waiter forgot our friend's salad. she brought it to his attention, and he apologized and offered to bring it out with the meal, but she declined. but i noticed on the bill that he comped us our desserts, which was a nice touch.\n\nthe bill came to roughly $450 or so for the 4 of us, so no, not cheap but worth it! i think everyone should splurge on a fantastic meal every now and then, and i'm glad we did that at cut. it was wonderful.",

            "came here to finally try it on a saturday night. the place of course was one of the finer dinning places where you would probably dress business casual or better. most of the place was dimly lit. we had reservations at 930pm but were not seated immediately, it took about 30 minutes but they did give us some cheese filled bread puffs. throughout the <mark>Whole Roasted French Loup De Mer</mark>, we didn't get the service you would expect from such a place. the staff seemed very preoccupied everywhere else. i didn't care for the portraits of stars on the wall.\n\ni ended up ordering the true japanese 100% wagyu beef <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> 8 oz*. it was the most expensive dish they had and i can understand why. i had it medium rare and every bite i had, i chewed thoroughly because it was just so juicy in a fatty way. i savored it. the only problem with it was that it was too juicy/fatty. my taste buds were getting overwhelmed at about 6-7 oz into the steak. i usually eat 12-16oz steaks so i wasn't full with just that steak but the last oz or so, there was a huge diminishing on return for the steak. 1 less oz and maybe knock off a few more dollars on the price and i would say it was perfectly worth it.\n\ni also had the mac & cheese and the bagna cauda. i really enjoyed the mac & cheese (i am a huge fan of m&c tho) and the bagna cauda was good."

            "delicious, lucious american wagyu from cut makes my top three steaks of all time.  my friend and i splurged on the american wagyu, and i might say it was the best spent $90 of my epicurean life (porterhouse for two is $180). \n\nwe actually missed a friday reservation because of flight delays, but they offered to re-schedule us for saturday.  they only had a table in their lounge (vs the dining room), which we actually preferred.  very cool bar, modern but comfortable lounge with normal tables for dining.  \n\nwe started with a bottle of prosecco that my wonderful friend had sent for my birthday, gougeres and several types of bread with nicely salt and spiced butter. we split a <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark> salad, which was good start.  a side of butternut squash, which came with roasted celery root and leek, was just delicious.\n\nwith our steak, and the addition of two more friends, we ordered a bottle of red -- it was a challenge to find a recession-friendly bottle among the three- and four-digit prices.  we skimped on wine and went with a ~$50 bottle of malbec that did the job.  \n\nback to the wagyu -- they bring out the entire sizzling skillet and carve the ny strip and filet so you get a few of each.  comes with the <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> and a bernaise, though absolutely not necessary.  the savory juices (and frankly fat) spread through your mouth with each bite that is pure heaven.  \n\nmy wonderful friend also sent a birthday dessert, which we swore we all had no space left in our body for, until we had the first bite of banana creme goodness, and proceeded to devour the rest.\n\nmeal was culinary bliss for about two hours, despite the struggles of my corseted friend.  amazing meal.  total for one with tax and tip (minus the champagne and dessert) was $173...", 
            "for my 30th birthday we decided to go to las vegas and wanted to eat at one of the strip's top restaurants.  after reading various reviews, we decided on cut.  i would have to say that the decor and the food lived up to all the hype.  the decor is elegant, yet hip and the swivel chairs and mirrors everywhere give it a real fun vibe.\n\nwe started with the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> and louis shrimp and <mark>Maryland Blue Crab & Carolina Shrimp 'Louis' Cocktail</mark>.  they were both light and delicate with intense flavors.  i then had the 10 oz american waygu (kobe) strip steak and my wife had the 21 day aged filet.  the meat lived up to all of our expectations.  we both had trouble finishing after eating the starters but could not waste the delicious meat.  i would have to recommend splurging for the waygu steaks or even the japanese kobe.  at $80 a steak, the waygu is definitely worth a little more after trying both.  don't get me wrong the filet was great, but hard to compare after eating the strip.\n\nthe reason i can't give it a 5 is because we somehow managed to get the server that must have just got promoted from the \"b\" team.  we could tell the server to our right was top notch but our guy just lacked in so many ways.  he started off by taking our drink order and seriously not bringing it back for ten minutes (place was not slammed).  the table next to us was sat after us and had drinks and bread at least 5 minutes before us.  the sommelier  ended up having to go to the bar to get them for us.  it doesn't seem to hard to pour mccallan 15 yr in a glass but i digress.   then our guy left the meat stand they put next to the table to show the different cut's off at our table for 15 minutes until i had to ask someone to get it out of there.  we asked for recommendations and they were lame.  this website did a better job.  my wife asked what temp he recc'd her filet be cooked at and he said \"med\".  where are we?  and then he recommended <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> with these fine pieces of meat.  \n\nfor the price of the bill, this guy should have been much, much better.  the food was amazing and we had a great night, but i will probably try a few other steakhouses in lv before i venture back.", 
            "my husband and i splurged for a high end dining experience at cut last night.  i had heard much about it and were looking forward to seeing if the hype lived up to the expectations.  overall, food and wine were excellent but the price would probably keep us from going back soon.\n\nfor appetizers, my husband chose the <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> and i had the <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark> salad with avocado, bleu cheese and a herb champagne vinagrette.   after we ordered the waiter informed us these were two of the most popular and i can see why. both were fantastic.  the waiter brought around 4 different types of fresh bread.  i had the onion focaccia which was excellent, and my husband the sourdough which was also good.\n\nfor the main course, i had selected the 6 oz american wagyyu <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark>, and my husaband selected the petite <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> cut, both prepared medium rare.  my husband thought his was a bit overseasoned with pepper, but i thought his tasted good.  my steak was excellent, one of the best i have ever had.  but $75 for 6 oz is a lot of $$.  i think most people who probably eat here aren't necessarily concerned about prices. the steaks come with three types of mustard for dipping, two of which were excellent.  we also go the <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> (by far the best of all the sauces) and a herb shallot red <mark>Shallot-Red Wine Bordelaise</mark> that was tasty also.  all sauces are served on the side so that you can try a variety. \n\nour sides were the mac and cheese and creamed spinach with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>.  both were excellent.  the egg gave the creamed spinach a really nice texture, and the mac and cheese was a bit of a twist on an old staple.\n\nwe were stuffed so didn't order dessert, although they gave us some small bites of lemon and chocolate bars which were just enough and tasted excellent.  \n\noverall this was a great dinner, but we ended up spending over $400 on just the two of us, so it would be hard to justify going again.", 
            "we were celebrating our first year anniversary. my husband and i stayed at the palazzo and decided that the highlight of our trip would be to eat at the cut. they did not disappoint! on the phone they took our info and asked if we were celebrating anything special. so we had the best seat in the restaurant. special round booth facing the crowd. we were in our special area which made it extra nice. the ambiance and decor was modern- hip. they were playing tribe called quest... its like they knew we were there. lol.. anyway... our attendees always checked on us, refilled our water, replenished our bread and butter ( i chose the pretzel bread- yummy!). \nservice was great! \n\nbeing on a budget we skipped out on the starters and went for cocktails <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark>. we got 2 moscow mules which was impressive and served in copper cans. \n\nmy husband got the 20 oz bone in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> aged 21 days- medium rare\ni got the 16 oz <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> nebraska corn fed 35 days- medium well\nour sides were <mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark> on top, yukon gold mashed potatoes, and mac and cheese with a fancy name i cant recall right now. \n\nall were amazing. we also ordered the <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> for $2. it went very well with the steak but didnt use it too much because honestly it was seasoned to perfection already. \n\nthere was a big difference between the 21 and 35 days. the 35 days was obviously more tender but my husband still enjoyed his bone in. \n\nat the end, we got a complimentary desert strawberry shortcake served on a dish that had \"happy anniversary\" written on it. whaa wha wha. it was nice!\noverall, had a great experience, great staff and service!!!", 
            "visited this wolfgang puck restaurant in january of 2010. three of us in the party. made reservations a week before on opentable.com. we were on time and greated by the hostess when we walked in. restaurant and lounge was full. it was ces week so vegas is usually jammed that week. the hostess originally tried to seat us in the lounge. i was like \"nah\". moved promptly to a nice table in the back of the dining room near the private dining room (which was full with employees from one of the companies at ces). kind of off to the side it was nice and quiet so i could talk to my parents. the table was off balance and every time we tapped it, it would tilt. one of the servers fixed that quick with a folded cocktail napkin right after i pointed it out. good. \n\nfinally unto the meal. my parents do not drink so i rarely do when dining with them. no problems. a round of diet cokes for all. typical bar soda in a high end restaurant. there were a few different servers. everyone works together. the main server brought out a tray to show of the differences in the marbling meat. from kobe beef to wagyu and the dry aged. \n\nsome breadsticks on the table were ok. the bread is awesome. pretzel bread with the different mustard's they put on the table are excellent. they served 4 other types of bread too. all fresh and flavorful. my dad loves his bread. so we had the bread guy come back and fill our plates 3 times throughout the meal. for an app we all split the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>. very tender and cooked well. enough for two not for three. \n\nthen for the steak action. i know my steaks. my first job, a week after i turned 16, was in an old school meat market. all through high school and college i worked in numerous meat departments of retail establishments. so with that said i obviously had to get the <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark> tasting. three portions, three types of cow. at the time, cut had legit a9 kobe beef from japan on the menu. they gave you 2oz. awesome! melt in your mouth. crazy flavor i have never tasted before in beef. 2nd portion was 4oz of american wagyu beef. totally different. a little more beef flavor. the last, was the 4oz portion of dry aged prime corn fed sirloin. again different in flavor and texture. most beef like and recognizable.  still a mighty fine steak. seasoned well with some s&p (salt and pepper). that's all you need for a high end steak like these. i ordered these medium. cooked fine. finished hot. some different <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> were served along side. i tried them each but the steaks did not need them.\n\nmom got a 21 day aged 8oz filet. def looked bigger. she likes it \"mooing\". she did not finish it so i took control of the situation. dad got a strip steak. not sure on the size or aging. \n\nin a nice steakhouse sides are a la carte. no prob. served family style works. we got <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>, creamed spinach with an egg on top ( which was broken and mixed in upon serving), and the <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>. everything was served at once, with multiple servers all explaining everything from the types of steaks we ordered, the sauces, and the sides. they served the sides on our plates and we enjoyed. it was steakhouse overload for me. i freaked out and sent all the staff away from me. \n\nwe were all stuffed from all the food. we did not have dessert. next time. thanks to my dad for picking up the tab, as he always does.", 
            "i know this place got mixed reviews, so i figured i'd give my side of the story.\ni've been wanting to go to cut since we first stayed at the venetian last year, but ended up dining somewhere else. on our vegas trip this past weekend, my bf wanted to have a nice dinner and i suggested cut, he heard \"steakhouse\", and that was it. \n\nso we get done shopping and drinking a monster yard from fat tuesday around 530pm, was really buzzed so we decided to take a nap, woke up at 9, and said \"well, there goes our dinner!\" since most upscale restaurants are booked for dinner time on a saturday night, i figured why not give cut a call and see if they have a table open? it's 9pm, kinda late for dinner, other people are getting their dinner over with so they can hit the clubs, why not. they said they can seat us if we get there in 30 minutes, and i've never gotten ready so fast in my life! well, maybe for a hair appointment. \nanyway... we get there and we were seated immediately. the dining area was about 3/4 full, bar was half empty. i didn't get our server's name, but he pretty much took care of us from beginning to end. he took the time to explain the menu, the differences in their meat, where the cattle comes from, what sauces taste good, yada, yada, yada. we started off with the blue-crab crab cakes, and the thing just melts in your mouth! it had a bit much of a mayo-type sauce in it, which i'm not a big fan of, but my bf is so he loved it. i love crab cakes and this is, so far, second best on my list (can't compare to crab cakes from maryland). for my entree, i ordered the illinois corn fed <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> medium well and my bf had the american wagyu/angus kobe style <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> medium well. and both with <mark>Caramelized Onions</mark> and their home <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark>. we also had the quebec cheddar mac and cheese to share (who goes to vegas and orders mac and cheese?). the server told us ahead of time that it's gonna take time to prepare our meal, so he offered us the wine menu - in an ipad! they had my moscato d'asti - extra points! not a lot of restaurants i've visited have that (olive garden, of all places has it). they also had a choice of breads for us to munch on. i was in the ladies room when they came out with the bread, and i guess my bf was overwhelmed with the selection he didn't know what to choose. he figured we both liked the what he calls \"chocolate\" bread aka wheat bread at cheesecake factory, he saw a similar one and picked that one. good choice. \nour meal came, and since there's only 2 of us, it was easy for the servers to figure out which steak was for which person. the mac and cheese was straight out of the oven and mixed in its pan right next to our table and the server gave us 2 spoonfuls each. we got down to business and from the first bite... mmm, mmm, mmm! hands down, best steak we've ever had. one morsel from the mac and cheese... my goodness! who knew canadian cheese was that awesome?!? just like the crab cakes i had from maryland, even though i was full, it was too delicious i couldn't stop eating. all the while, our water glasses were never left empty. if the servers saw it at least 1/4 full, out they came with the pitcher of water. the excellent food and excellent service made up for the wait, but if that's how much time they need to prepare such delicious food, i'll wait! it was a little over $250 for the 2 of us, which is a splurge. but it doesn't hurt to splurge every once in a while. besides... it's vegas, baby!", 
            "this was my first upscale dining experience, and it did not disappoint.\n\nservice was exceptional. the gentlemen with the sample cuts of meat was very knowledgeable, and answered all of the questions we threw at him. \n\nthe house bread (mini pretzel roll) was amazing along with the cold french butter. since the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan was talked about in many reviews, we decided to try it out, and dam! it was fucking delicious. definitely not for everybody, though.\n\nfor my steak, i went with the 35 day dry aged <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> which was insanely good; especially the <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark>. you definitely have to try the mac and cheese. totally worth the long wait. it also feeds 3, along with most of the sides.\n\noverall, i was very impressed with this restaurant, and felt it was well worth the extra money i shelled out to eat here.", 
            "everything is good. and i say this because we nearly got everything offered on the menu!\n\ni split a porterhouse steak and ordered it extra rare. it was basically seared on both sides with an extremely cool (so, yeah almost cold / raw!) center. it melted in my mouth like butter. i sampled my friend's rare american kobe <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> and declared it *overcooked*. how can i ever go back to having normal steaks again? sigh.\n\nlet's see....mac and cheese, delicious. polenta, my favorite side. brussel sprouts, blue crab & shrimp louis cocktail, <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark>...all exceptional. the kobe beef sashimi was freaking out of this world and i would probably kill someone for another bite of the date cake. oh and did i mention the <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark>? it's heaven in a dish. normally my appetite wanes after a few drinks but even after 4 umami's, i managed to clean my plate, sample our 5 desserts and polish off a cheese plate. can you say gluttony? \n\nthe service was really attentive, and everyone was so nice and accommodating. a definite must-do in vegas!", 
            "after my outstanding experience here, it goes without saying that wolfgang puck's take on steaks is a \"cut\" above the rest!\n\ntucked inside the palazzo resort, cut exhibited a refined contemporary appeal and warmth that was both inviting and comforting.  i especially enjoyed the service by tara who made our visit feel special from the very moment we sat down. \n\nafter allowing us to peruse the menu for awhile, she returned with a cart of steaks and proceeded to give us a brief but detailed description of all their signature cuts and i must say, they all looked enticing! \n\nshortly after, we were served our wine and breads, which included the usual steakhouse suspects of fragrant & savory onion focaccia, pretzel roll, one of my personal favorites, mainly because of the firm outside texture and soft and chewy inside... and it wasn't too salty like most other pretzel breads i've come across. \nparmesan bread stick took a close second  place for its addictive light, crisp & crunchy texture with a generous coating of parmesan breading on the outside.\n\n<mark>Bone Marrow</mark> appetizer - from the buttery soft marrow to the warm, flavorful mushroom sauce, it was a blissful combination of ingredients and love. simply unbelievable. if there's one single dish from this entire trip, i will be craving for months afterwards, it will definitely be this!\n\nsteak tasting \namerican kobe style from snake river - paired with a <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark>. the beef was perfectly tender and seared beautifully leaving my mouthwatering for another juicy bite. the tangy flavor of the <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> was a perfect addition to the meat as it brought on a bright acidity to the steak. let it be known, i'm determined to get the recipe for that irresistible sauce!!!!\nusda prime dry aged - much softer and juicier than the <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark>, this cut of steak was praiseworthy in every way. honestly, it was a cut of perfection on a plate and the accompanying chimichurri sauce added a brightness to my palate that made it all the more satisfying. \naustralian wagyu from blackmore -\nworthy of it namesake, was truly the best of the best. it's like they took 50 steaks and concentrated all the beefiness into one bite. the best steak i've ever had. it came with a b\\u00e9arnaise sauce but honestly this piece needed nothing to dress it. it was perfect all on its own.\n\nwhite corn had a fresh & crunchy bite with a slightly sweet caremelized exterior that added a pleasant rustic flavor to the dish \n\ndessert\nbaked alaska - tasted like a giant strawberry mochi. btw, that's a good thing!  it also came with a small lemon bar, which had a lip puckering natural citrusy flavor!\n\nbanana creme pie came with chocolate ice cream, sauce, and chocolate crunch pearls. now that's what i call a triple chocolate threat! having said that, it was surprisingly mild and less cloyingly sweet, which i really enjoyed.\n\nbefore we left, tara gave us more sweets in the form of a chocalate truffle cookie bar and a chewy peanut brittle...both were absolutely delicious! \n\nservice was very thoughtful and the staff in general were ever present without being overbearing. but i'd have to say tara made all the difference! she transformed a pleasant meal to an unforgettable dining experience with her natural charm and warm tableside manner, which easily made the evening five stars in my book!\n\nbravo to cut for an exquisite meal and extraordinary service! \n\nyou bet ill be back for an encore! \n\nuntil then...\n\nhappy eats!", 
            "i'm always hesitant about celebrity chefs' restaurants. i hate being disappointed so i walked into cut with medium expectations. thankfully, we had an excellent experience and i'm happy to give it 4 stars.\n\n+ easy to book via opentable (do so more than a week in advanced otherwise you'll be eating at 6pm or 930pm)\n+ great service throughout (they called to confirm our reservation; i ended up cancelling it online because i was still stuck on the runway at las airport; then i got to the hotel with 15-minutes to spare and called them and they gave me back my reservation; also the dining staff was spot on and very attentive)\n+ a few little starters - cheesy breadsticks, bread basket, cheese puff (all complimentary)\n+/- i wasn't that impressed with the american waygu but we got the porterhouse for 2 (30oz...i do agree with other reviewers that the filet was so much better than the <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> side)\n+ lots of sauces (complimentary mustards, <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> and a b\\u00e9arnaise sauce)\n- didn't need the $2 wasabi butter sauce\n+ best polenta, ever\n+/- creamed spinach with a sunny side up egg that's mixed in table side (interesting, but not sure i'd order it again)\n+/- great beer selection but very pricey\n+ small desserts, also complimentary\n+ lovely to go bag that i devoured later that night haha", 
            "pdsf review:  parking is free (hotel parking).  decor is chic modern.  service was absolutely excellent; i sat at the bar; server checked up on me almost every 10 minutes.  food was delicious, but relative to the price, i would have to downgrade.  i got the $60 <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> steak... which was delicious, but i think $40 at ruth chris may result in the same culinary satisfaction.  there is definitely an upcharge for the name and the prestige of eating at cut.  however, the 3 <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> and salt were a great optional add-on.  will not go back.", 
            "all i can say is wagyu!!!! melt in your mouth deliciousness with great selection of <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> to pick from. i prefer their meats to the other high end places in town. a beautiful restaurant, great service, and fabulous steaks!!! this is my favorite steakhouse on the strip. plus it's not crazy loud inside so you can still hear the people at your table.", 
            "i know, i'm super late to the vegas steakhouse party, but to my bf's delight, we've been making up for lost time this year. on this last trip, we tried wolfgang puck's cut in the palazzo. \n\nservice in the lounge area was, to use a word popularized by beyonc\\u00e9, flawless. perfectly smooth symphony of waiters tending to our party of two. \n\nfoods: \n-- breads: pretzel roll was decedent with their rosemary butter, onion focaccia was all flavor without being dense, yummy, long cheesy breadsticks, & sharply-flavored cheese breads. \n-- <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> appetizer: the meaty parts were excellent (i don't eat the fatty parts) \n-- lobster, crab, <mark>Maryland Blue Crab & Carolina Shrimp 'Louis' Cocktail</mark> tower: way too much going on; simple mounds of undressed, fresh seafood would have been better than throwing the lot together with avocado, sauces, savory pudding, etc., \n-- bone-in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, (aged 21 days) for him: generous 20 oz., cooked perfectly medium-rare, nicely grilled.\n-- petite filet (8 oz) for me: cooked perfectly on the inside, a little more charred on the outside than i would've like \n-- sauces ($2 each): <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> was quite sweet, peppercorn was delicious. a variety of mustards were brought out for our steaks, an austrian tradition. the violet mustard, which had a hint of a wine taste, especially brought out amazing flavors when added to our steaks. \n-- sides: <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark> (holy shit, these are good) & mashed potatoes (creamy/buttery)\n-- desserts: banana cream pie (only so-so) & baked alaska (he really enjoyed the meringue.) \n\nprice of our food coma (not including tip): $240.", 
            "i wish i could give this place 10 stars, but unfortunately that would break the scale on yelp.  \n\nmy friends and i made a reservation for this restaurant for a friday night dinner and arrived about 15 minutes early.  unfortunately, our table wasn't ready yet which is not the restaurant's fault; however, they offered us a seat at the bar area and gave us complimentary wasabi peas, peanuts, and olives while we waited.  we were seated immediately when the time rolled around and got a booth that faced the dining area - great for people watching.  the ambiance is a bit loud and rowdy, but the dim lighting made it feel quite romantic as well.  we had two servers that night, and they offered us complimentary bread, parmesan breadsticks, and some puffs, which i didn't try.  the waiter also brought out the tray of raw meat so he could explain the different marbling in each of the steaks.  quite impressive and definitely something i've never seen at any other steakhouses.\n\ni ordered the <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> 8 oz cooked medium well with the <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> on the side.  for the sides, it was family style so we shared the asparagus and brussel sprouts.  i liked how they portioned out the sides for us. i must say, i was originally planning to eat half of my steak because 8 oz is too much for me, but after one bite, i was hooked.  the top and bottom of the steak were crunchy and crispy while the middle was nice and soft.  the contrast of the different textures in every bite was amazing. what made it even more amazing was their <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark>.  it was tangy and flavorful, and i noticed that i would dip each slice generously into the sauce.  so good i can drink it. :)  wish they sold it because i would have brought back a bottle.\n\nfor dessert, we shared the chocolate souffle, which was pretty big.  once they brought it out, the server sliced a hole in the middle and poured whipped cream inside and placed a spoonful of nutella on top.  it was delicous! we finished it all in less than 3 minutes.  you would think that would be the last course to end the night, but nope! they offered us a plate of mini desserts - marshmallow, meringue, lemon tart, and jelly - on the house.  \n\nof course, the price for the dinner was outrageously expensive, but that's a given when you're eating at a steakhouse in vegas. i thought it was worth it, and you should too. \n\ntip: the restaurant is located inside the shops at the palazzo.", 
            "finally, a modern streak house thanks to mr. puck. make sure to make a reservation since seating is limited. eating at wolfgang restaurants can be cliche as far as what's expected, but cut is mind blowing for endless reasons. the service was impeccable since brian, my waiter really worked and expressed his efforts. although i felt bad since he was seating, he really did try his best. everyone was extremely attentive. \n\nthe ambiance is very dark/intimate but i also felt a modern office type of vibe. i thought it was rather tacky that there were large framed portfolio head shots around the restaurant of actors such as brad pitt. really threw me off since the concept of the restaurant did not mesh well with those portraits. who cares ? \n\nthe bar area is very tight, it was too small for my liking. \n\nthe food is ultimately what one should care about. be warned to throw them benjamin's for a quick sensation in that mouth that is worth it. as soon as you are, like all wolf gang establishments, you are greeted with an assortment of breads. \n\nlooking at the menu may seem daunting but don't stress out, just order something that won't surprise you. there are many cuts of meat that are offered but it would be best to order the waygu. it's hard to describe through words but wow, it was very tender. it was also a generous cut. \n\nsadly, i was not a fan of paying $2.00 for dressing up the meat aka you get to choose from the following...\n\n<mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark>       \n<mark>Wasabi-Yuzu Kosho Butter</mark>       \n<mark>Shallot-Red Wine Bordelaise</mark>       \narmagnac & <mark>Armagnac & Green Peppercorn</mark>       \n<mark>Argentinean Chimichurri</mark>       \n<mark>Creamy Horseradish</mark>       \nb\\u00e9arnaise  \n\ni was not trying to f up my order by exploring different sauces so i was smart enough to pick something i am familiar with which was the chimichurri. it went perfectly with the waygu. if you are on a budget, the u.s.d.a. prime, \"double r ranch\", loomis, washington, corn fed, aged 28 days <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark> 12 oz is another good option. \n\nthe side options were not that impressive, as far as the options go. i couldn't go wrong by ordering the <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>. yes, this intact did melt in my mouth. very rich and creamy. \n\ni also recommend the  <mark>Pan Roasted Stonington Maine Lobster</mark>, maryland blue crab & carolina shrimp \"louis\" cocktail, spicy tomato-horseradish. the combinations of this palter worked really well and the presentation was very impressive. this actually takes a long time for preparation which you will understand why after that first sip. \n\ni don't know if i would return here just because there are too many other restaurant's to experience. i have not a single complaint.", 
            "first off, the service and atmosphere were great, but we go out to eat for the food, so i am going to explain my measly three stars by telling you about the items that we ordered and what was wrong and right with each of them. this is one of most expensive meals i have ever eaten, so if i am going to spend nearly $300 on dinner (w/o wine or other drinks) then it better blow me away. it fell woefully short of that. \n\n1. bread selection-2 out the 5 we were offered were tasty. the rest were bland. the cheese pastry puffs were great, but then they were ruined in a way by being too spicy for bread.\n\n2. drinks-i don't drink alcohol but the arnold palmer i ordered was way too sour. the second try was better, but was too sweet. i had to ask for more lemon and water it down to be enjoyable. \n\n3. salads/appetizers-i ordered the seafood salad with lobster, crab, and shrimp. the top portion was tasty (i don't know how you could go wrong with the holy trinity of shellfish), but on the bottom there was this weird pudding/custard type of stuff that was way too sweet and took up most of the volume of the dish. for a $31 appetizer/ salad i felt that i deserved more than a little bit of seafood on top of a white mystery substance. my wife ordered the <mark>Pink Lady & Fuji Apple Salad</mark>. it was good but dressed too lightly. all i could really taste were the tart pink lady apples. if i was to serve this salad i would have gone heavy on the almonds and cheese to balance out all of the tartness of the apples.\n\n4. main dishes-my wife ordered the dover sole. she can't tolerate garlic. there was quite a debate about the garlic (or lack thereof) in the sauce that goes over the fish between the wait staff and the kitchen. finally it was revealed that the sauce hasn't had garlic in it for a few months, so she got the sauce. her fish was deboned tableside, which was a nice touch, but meant that she had to eat her main before everyone else's meals came out so the fish wouldn't be cold. i had a bite and it was really tasty, but her complaint was that after eating her main, she was still a bit hungry as it was small. \ni ordered the nebraska <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> with a red wine reduction sauce. i would prefer my steak a bit warmer (i ordered medium) and with less spice rub. also, the red wine reduction was just sweet-no saltiness or richness of a pan sauce like i make at home. the mustards were great to have at the table, but why would these be necessary? mustard is usually used to cover up the taste of old meat! having salt along with the mustards was smart and i used it. my <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> was lacking salt, so once i added the salt it was tasty. definitly the most expensive steak i have ever ordered, but the not the best i have ever eaten, so yeah-a let down. also, the other two <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> at the table had lots of grisle and fat. mine was more lean and the fat rendered out more thoroughly.\n\n5. sides- we ordered quite a few. creamed spinach, my favorite side at a steakhouse was the most disappointing. the egg added to the spinach tableside ruined it for me. it tasted like a spinach and egg breakfast burrito. not good at all. whipped potatoes were very bland (lacking salt or butter). no one at the table liked them. brussel sprouts were very good, but had so much sweetness they were like candied vegetables. the best side dish by far were the roasted sweet potatoes with curry spice. very good, we ordered another one. the other side dishes were unmemorable. \n\n6. dessert-i would skip dessert and go somewhere else if i dined with them again. my wife's berry tart was tasty, but she couldn't finish it. way too tart and sweet. my banana cream pie was just ok. the bananas tasted a little under ripe and they were cold. the crust was not good. nothing special here folks. again, for the prices, you would expect to be at least pleasantly surprised, but no.", 
            "i have been on this earth for 44 years and have spent approximately 43 of those years searching for the perfect steak. i have traveled far and wide, small towns and large cities, dives and, well you get the picture. about 10 years ago i had an elk steak at a restaurant <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> springs, co. said steak was my #1 steak since that time. enter cut and now my steamboat springs steak was finally bumped. \n\nthis was my second visit and had to make sure i wasn't out of my mind the first go around.  i even ordered the exact same meal to ensure an apples to apples comparison. i ordered the american wagyu filet with asparagus, macaroni and cheese, and <mark>Caramelized Onions</mark>.  if memory serves me correctly, the steak was $85 and each side was $13 each. we had a party of 4, 3 of us having the same thing. \n\nall i have to say is damn!  best steak in the history of this guy's life!  a fork will cut this filet and the sides were great. very simple process - sea salt and cracked pepper. if you ask for <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> i hope the waiter bitch slaps you.  service was unbelievable and prompt.  all 4 agreed on one thing - best damn steak and best damn service in the history of meat!", 
            "dined here last week for our anniversary getaway to vegas. restaurant is inside the palazzo hotel, which in my opinion is one of the top three resorts, didn't stay here this time but many other occasions and this place never disappoints. \n\non to the restaurant.. made my reservations here about three days in advance and they did call to confirm my anniversary celebration. the restaurant itself is modern in d\\u00e9cor and medium sized. my wife wasn't too fond of the table settings - seemed to be more appropriate for outdoor patio furniture as opposed to fine dining. \n\nwe both had the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan which was good.\n\nmy wife loved the sea bass and described it as the best she's ever had. kudos for me ;)\n\ni unfortunately was disappointed on my long awaited steak. ordered the dry aged <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> good portion size, however it came out lukewarm. i ordered it slightly above medium and some portions were still a little bloody. my waiter was nowhere to be found and after being almost halfway into the meal (was hungry,) he only offered to warm it up which after the fact, the dinner completely lost its appeal. the quality of the steak was good however some portions were not seasoned properly to the point where i had to add some table salt. frankly i regrettably found my meal to be mediocre.\n\non a positive note; the drinks and sides - especially the mushroom saut\\u00e9 was very good. i even liked their <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> as such condiments usually should not be accompanied with fine meat. \n\nafter our meals, we were treated to strawberry shortcake as our anniversary treat which was much appreciated although the waiter basically forgot of our purpose of celebration there and was asking if we wanted our check. \n\nto sum up our experience, the restaurant didn't really provide the high end vibe, quality or service we usually experience at other steakhouses such as mastros, ruths or even fogo. too bad because we live in la and were anxious to dine again at the cut location in beverly.", 
            "very good steak place.  i can see the reason why this place is busting at the seams when db, delmonico, and every other restaurant that serve steak had empty seats on this wednesday night. the friendly staff and reliably good food- it is hard to find much weakness.  from the parmesan breadsticks, cheese puffs, breads, <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark>, after dinner chocolate that are complimentary to your dinner, they complete your meal nicely. i had the lobster and crab appetizer and nebraska <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> and my date had <mark>Warm Veal Tongue</mark> and a nebraska <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> as well. i loved my appetizer but i already got full halfway through it.  we enjoyed the steak but couldn't finish it or the potatoes and the mushrooms.  we still had to try one dessert and we shared baked alaska. it was more beautiful than incredible.",

            "many restaurants tout fusion sensibilities, but puck's concept truly blends influences from his native austria, france, japan, america and elsewhere. almost painfully serious about beef, servers here bring out a platter of raw kobe and wagyu cuts before you order, to show the differences in the meat. \n\nyour taste buds may not be as sensitive as your eyes, though: we actually preferred the 21 day wet-aged illinois prime bone-in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> to the american wagyu/angus <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark>. cut's ample offerings also include several 35 day dry aged nebraska prime as well as true japanese waygu (kobe) choices (all are grilled over hard wood & charcoal then finished under the broiler). \n\nin fact, cut's menu seems overly eager to please (or overwhelm) with an excess of options in starters (12 the night we visited), side dishes (13), desserts (7) and even sauces (8), though many were excellent, including the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> \"sandwiches\" with wasabi aoli and bar menu's knishes and kobe sliders; and <mark>Wasabi-Yuzu Kosho Butter</mark> and <mark>Cognac & Whole Grain Mustard</mark> were both remarkable. but the creamed spinach topped with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> was almost too rich and the potato tart tatin was mostly just big and bland. the deconstructed nectarine and plum crumble, served with a house-made \"50 bean\" vanilla ice cream was nice, but far too big a portion to end such a meal.\n \na nice selection of original and classic cocktails, but their wine list is a bit pretentious and overpriced ($15 for a glass of argentinian malbec? really? i'd pay that much for a magnum of it in the store)\n\nin short, cut has one of my favorite lounges on the strip (sexy, sleek, just dark enough, fitting for either romance or business rendevous), some fantastic appetizers, and a great cocktail menu. cut has one of my least favorite dining rooms on the strip (like an 80s office, stiff and steely), and good meat--but not quite as good as their orgiastic presentation lends you to expect. i didn't dislike it, but was not wowed as much as i have been at craftsteak, carnevino, and even boa, all in the same price range. \n\np.s. at these prices, you can afford to make the sauces complimentary.", 
            "wow.  high five to wolfgang puck for an exceptional dining experience - delicious food with professional & attentive service.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j4cath00yzrq8bne2s4_cw?select=g2-vnaqfscp9bn7z-xjvuq\nwhile waiting, we enjoyed various samples of bread - my favorite was the bavarian pretzel.  slightly salty, sweet, and an incredibly soft texture - divine.  \n\n\nprior to ordering, i loved that the waiter rolled out several variations of the raw cut beef to demonstrate the difference in kobe wagyu & american style wagyu (mixed with angus to give it a meatier texture).  \nmy entree was the <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> (usda illinois) served with the argentinian chimichirri sauce, a light and springy taste with shallots, garlic, and cilantro.  perfectly cooked at medium and absolutely delicious.  refrain from biting the screen:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j4cath00yzrq8bne2s4_cw?select=yxcijyzzvh7cb9vr-cifgg \nthe fiance also loved his american wagyu rib-eye with <mark>Wasabi-Yuzu Kosho Butter</mark> sauce.  while part of the meat was slightly tough, the thicker end of the rib-eye melted in my mouth.  it's not necessary to order an additional sauce with your meat, since they also bring out three condiments for you to use anyhow.  \n\ni do recommend sharing the sides family style with a group - at about $12/side, you get a significant amount of delicious fare.  our group of four split three sides: the delicious creamy mac & cheese with quebec cheddar, the sauteed <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark>, and the butternut squash.  all were incredibly savory!  the best and most amusing part of the dinner was that we had three waiters (one per side dish) hovering next to us individually to explain what the dish was and proceeded to scoop it onto our plate before shuffling to the next person - it felt like culinary musical chairs.  if fighting over equal portions of a dish is an issue, this eliminates that problem...\n\nambiance is very modern and sleek.  it is pretty dim, but it wasn't too bothersome for us.  similar to the sauce, ordering dessert isn't necessary since they brought out a plate with decadent filled chocolates.  an exquisite way to end a satisfying and indulgent meal.",

            "day 4 of my las vegas getaway (almost two weeks ago).  day 1 included dinner at gallagher's for steak which i found to be pretty good but not great.  so, let's try steak again but this time at wolfgang puck's cut.  \n\nthe restaurant was busy with a nice energetic ambiance.  i ordered the nebraska corn-fed rib-eye with <mark>Armagnac & Green Peppercorn</mark> sauce and <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark>.  on the side i had the fingerling potatoes with bacon and onions and glass of heitz cellars cabernet.  cocktail was called pins and needles.\n\nthe good - the service was efficient and impeccable.  the wine was perfect and the cocktail was excellent.  the fingerling potato side with bacon was great.  i could have eaten an entire plate of them.  maybe i should have after you read the bad and the ugly below.\n\nthe bad and the ugly - i had such high hopes to finish my stay in las vegas with a great steakhouse experience.  what a disappointment.  the rib-eye i ordered was cooked perfectly and oh so tender.  the first bite was heaven.  after three or four bites i realized how salty the steak was.  before i finished half of the steak there was so much salt on my palate i could barely taste my wine and other food.  i had to drink the entire 750 ml bottle of sparkling water i ordered.  because of the salty meat i could finish neither my meal, wine, or the cocktail.\n\nthe waiter did remove the cost of the meat from my bill but i didn't care about that.  i wanted a great steakhouse experience and was sorely disappointed.   wolfgang, this establishment needs some of your personal attention.\n\n(i updated my review based on the response i received from management; professional and courteous as you would expect.  i will indeed give cut another try on my next trip to vegas and am confident that it will be a much better experience as others here have raved.)", 
            "the creme de la creme of steakhouses.\n\na group of friends and i had an open sunday, so we decided why not do a fancy dinner. cut was our pick. seating was a breeze. made reservations on opentable and got seated at a large round table in the back when we arrived. it was like our own little area. \n\nit's difficult not to leave impressed. the waiters and waitresses are amazing here. so attentive. they offered a variety of complimentary breads on a tray and we were able to select as little or as many as we wanted. get the focaccia for sure. that was the favorite among the table.\n\ni can only speak for what i personally ordered... the u.s.d.a. prime <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> 12 oz ($59). it was delicious!! cooked to perfection with a fine crust to give it that extra texture but, be warned, there's tons of fat. on the plus side, fat equals flavor! you can also choose from a list of sauces to compliment your meats. i got to try their armagnac and <mark>Armagnac & Green Peppercorn</mark> as well as the spicy red chimichurri ($2 each). both tasted great with the <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>. one was enough for 2-3 people. i had a ton left over.\n\nall the meats are served a la carte. the table got a double order of mac & cheese ($19) and it was to die for! so glad we got a double. we also shared an order of their creamed spinach ($12) and <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> ($22), which were just alright to me. one order for seven people left everyone with only a couple bites of each side. you can see in the attached pictures.\n\nwolfgang puck knows how to do fine-dining well. the atmosphere is elegant and perfect for celebrations or a nice date. just wished it didn't dent the wallet so much. i always cringe a little when i see that four $$$$ sign, but you're paying for quality i suppose!",

            "many restaurants tout fusion sensibilities, but puck's concept truly blends influences from his native austria, france, japan, america and elsewhere. almost painfully serious about beef, servers here bring out a platter of raw kobe and wagyu cuts before you order, to show the differences in the meat. \n\nyour taste buds may not be as sensitive as your eyes, though: we actually preferred the 21 day wet-aged illinois prime bone-in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> to the american wagyu/angus <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark>. cut's ample offerings also include several 35 day dry aged nebraska prime as well as true japanese waygu (kobe) choices (all are grilled over hard wood & charcoal then finished under the broiler). \n\nin fact, cut's menu seems overly eager to please (or overwhelm) with an excess of options in starters (12 the night we visited), side dishes (13), desserts (7) and even sauces (8), though many were excellent, including the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> \"sandwiches\" with wasabi aoli and bar menu's knishes and kobe sliders; and <mark>Wasabi-Yuzu Kosho Butter</mark> and <mark>Cognac & Whole Grain Mustard</mark> were both remarkable. but the creamed spinach topped with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> was almost too rich and the potato tart tatin was mostly just big and bland. the deconstructed nectarine and plum crumble, served with a house-made \"50 bean\" vanilla ice cream was nice, but far too big a portion to end such a meal.\n \na nice selection of original and classic cocktails, but their wine list is a bit pretentious and overpriced ($15 for a glass of argentinian malbec? really? i'd pay that much for a magnum of it in the store)\n\nin short, cut has one of my favorite lounges on the strip (sexy, sleek, just dark enough, fitting for either romance or business rendevous), some fantastic appetizers, and a great cocktail menu. cut has one of my least favorite dining rooms on the strip (like an 80s office, stiff and steely), and good meat--but not quite as good as their orgiastic presentation lends you to expect. i didn't dislike it, but was not wowed as much as i have been at craftsteak, carnevino, and even boa, all in the same price range. \n\np.s. at these prices, you can afford to make the sauces complimentary.",

            "i know this place got mixed reviews, so i figured i'd give my side of the story.\ni've been wanting to go to cut since we first stayed at the venetian last year, but ended up dining somewhere else. on our vegas trip this past weekend, my bf wanted to have a nice dinner and i suggested cut, he heard \"steakhouse\", and that was it. \n\nso we get done shopping and drinking a monster yard from fat tuesday around 530pm, was really buzzed so we decided to take a nap, woke up at 9, and said \"well, there goes our dinner!\" since most upscale restaurants are booked for dinner time on a saturday night, i figured why not give cut a call and see if they have a table open? it's 9pm, kinda late for dinner, other people are getting their dinner over with so they can hit the clubs, why not. they said they can seat us if we get there in 30 minutes, and i've never gotten ready so fast in my life! well, maybe for a hair appointment. \nanyway... we get there and we were seated immediately. the dining area was about 3/4 full, bar was half empty. i didn't get our server's name, but he pretty much took care of us from beginning to end. he took the time to explain the menu, the differences in their meat, where the cattle comes from, what sauces taste good, yada, yada, yada. we started off with the blue-crab crab cakes, and the thing just melts in your mouth! it had a bit much of a mayo-type sauce in it, which i'm not a big fan of, but my bf is so he loved it. i love crab cakes and this is, so far, second best on my list (can't compare to crab cakes from maryland). for my entree, i ordered the illinois corn fed <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> medium well and my bf had the american wagyu/angus kobe style <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> medium well. and both with <mark>Caramelized Onions</mark> and their home <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark>. we also had the quebec cheddar mac and cheese to share (who goes to vegas and orders mac and cheese?). the server told us ahead of time that it's gonna take time to prepare our meal, so he offered us the wine menu - in an ipad! they had my moscato d'asti - extra points! not a lot of restaurants i've visited have that (olive garden, of all places has it). they also had a choice of breads for us to munch on. i was in the ladies room when they came out with the bread, and i guess my bf was overwhelmed with the selection he didn't know what to choose. he figured we both liked the what he calls \"chocolate\" bread aka wheat bread at cheesecake factory, he saw a similar one and picked that one. good choice. \nour meal came, and since there's only 2 of us, it was easy for the servers to figure out which steak was for which person. the mac and cheese was straight out of the oven and mixed in its pan right next to our table and the server gave us 2 spoonfuls each. we got down to business and from the first bite... mmm, mmm, mmm! hands down, best steak we've ever had. one morsel from the mac and cheese... my goodness! who knew canadian cheese was that awesome?!? just like the crab cakes i had from maryland, even though i was full, it was too delicious i couldn't stop eating. all the while, our water glasses were never left empty. if the servers saw it at least 1/4 full, out they came with the pitcher of water. the excellent food and excellent service made up for the wait, but if that's how much time they need to prepare such delicious food, i'll wait! it was a little over $250 for the 2 of us, which is a splurge. but it doesn't hurt to splurge every once in a while. besides... it's vegas, baby!", 
            "every time we hit vegas, we want a better dining experience than our previous visit. that's a tough order considering our experience at charlie palmer steak was 5 stars and one of the best dining experiences we've ever enjoyed. \n\ncut is really expensive, let's get that out of the way now. if over the top expensive isn't for you, don't bother b/c who goes to a steakhouse to order the short ribs or the chicken, simply because it's affordable? \n\ntheir hostess is cute as a button, but she makes aubrey o'day from celeb apprentice seem genuine. i mean, fake smile is standard, i get that, but this gal was just blowin' skirts up left n right.\n\nthis place is all about service, food and apparently wine, but i don't drink b/c my boy is bill w and all, so that's neither here nor there for me. bobby,our very astute and proper waiter, offered up a few non alco beverages. a ginger-ale and pineapple number that was really good and a very very tart cranberry option. both were a nice touch for peeps who don't get down with the booze. \n\nbefore you actually order, they discuss the menu in great detail. our waiter, bobby, seemed a bit aggressive, but i think that's just b/c he knows his stuff and has a great understanding of the menu, so once we realized that, it was easier to understand the in your face approach. they have this giant plate, with a black napkin draped over it, loaded with all of their cuts of beef. they describe each in great detail and of course, attempt to get you to choose the most delicious, expensive cut. \n\nbread: numerous options, all made in house\n\ncheese puff: they have a technical fancy pants term for this, but it's a cheese puff and boy is it delightful!\n\nfoccacia: <mark>Caramelized Onions</mark> infused in the soft and chewy bread, excellent\n\npretzel bun: i had my doubts about this, but they were incredibly soft, chewy and also made in house\n\nchoice of cow: 35 day aged nebraska ny sirloin and <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, which bobby helped us choose\n\nthe meat was cooked to perfection, it was tender and juicy and succulent. <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> had a bit too much fat, but not a big deal. ny seemed to have less. they offer up a selection of house mustard (s) b/c apparently wolfy loves to slather mustard on his steak. it's a nice touch, but i could do without b/c the dry rub they offer is very tasty. \n\nsides are not included, but we had to get sides. \n\nmac n cheese: gooey, delicious and it is served piping hot. eat it fast b/c the cheese starts to dry up and get gummy pretty fast. \n\nfingerling potatoes: are served with roasted onions and my favorite, slab bacon! like large cubes of fatty swine, so delicious and just melt in your mouth goodness. \n\nwe had to pass on dessert b/c we killed every bite of dinner, but the dessert menu does look desirable. bobby one upped himself and brought out a few nibblets of goodness. \n\nchoco: rich, creamy dark chocolate ganache over graham cracker crust. very rich, but very good.\n\ncaramel: this was heavenly. it was like a tiny bite of pecan pie mixed with nut brittle and i loved it. nice and sticky and oh so scrumptious! \n\nthat's a wrap and if you made it this far down the page, thanks for reading my novel. cheers mate!", 
            "great food and service! we had the waygu filet which was delicious and melted in our mouths! we could cut the steak with just a fork! we also tried the ny strip! super juicy and seasoned just perfect. i added the <mark>Caramelized Onions</mark> and they were absolutely delicious! the mac and cheese that is made with four different cheeses was just to die for! it was so creamy and all the different types of cheeses made it taste so good! the other side we got was the creamed spinach. i liked it but probably would not order it again. it was very good but not as creamy and thick as i would of liked it. i like that they put the <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> on top thought that was going to be good, but i would of preferred to have taken it off. they stirred the <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> in, which added crunchy edge and i would of rather of kept that soft creamy taste throughout! \noverall amazing experience and service was impeccable! a must try in vegas!", 
            "can things get better than a fancy dinner in vegas? i was in town for a girl's weekend and wanted to enjoy one indulgent meal. we decided to make a reservation at cut since wolfgang puck is such a renowned chef. we were not disappointed. i started with the crab and <mark>Maryland Blue Crab & Carolina Shrimp 'Louis' Cocktail</mark>, which was fantastic. the portions were much larger than expected. they even start you off with a huge selection of bread, so don't make the mistake of loading up on carbs. in regards to the steak, we had to try the american wagyu beef. i ordered a <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> (6 oz) with <mark>Caramelized Onions</mark> and the peppercorn sauce. it was the best steak i've ever had. it was so moist and perfectly cooked. we got the creamed spinach and mac and cheese as sides, and this was way more than enough food. to top off our meal, we ordered the banana cream pie, which was fantastic. they also served some small dessert samples which were okay, but i would recommend trying one of their house made desserts.", 
            "i have been on this earth for 44 years and have spent approximately 43 of those years searching for the perfect steak. i have traveled far and wide, small towns and large cities, dives and, well you get the picture. about 10 years ago i had an elk steak at a restaurant <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> springs, co. said steak was my #1 steak since that time. enter cut and now my steamboat springs steak was finally bumped. \n\nthis was my second visit and had to make sure i wasn't out of my mind the first go around.  i even ordered the exact same meal to ensure an apples to apples comparison. i ordered the american wagyu filet with asparagus, macaroni and cheese, and <mark>Caramelized Onions</mark>.  if memory serves me correctly, the steak was $85 and each side was $13 each. we had a party of 4, 3 of us having the same thing. \n\nall i have to say is damn!  best steak in the history of this guy's life!  a fork will cut this filet and the sides were great. very simple process - sea salt and cracked pepper. if you ask for <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> i hope the waiter bitch slaps you.  service was unbelievable and prompt.  all 4 agreed on one thing - best damn steak and best damn service in the history of meat!"

            "i made my bf make a reservation about a month before our trip to vegas.  we studied the menu quite awhile beforehand.  it's important to carefully consider what to eat if you're going to spend a few benjamins!  we started with the maryland blue crab and <mark>Pan Roasted Stonington Maine Lobster</mark> \"louis\" cocktail.  this was surprisingly fresh.  you can taste each of the crab or lobster when separating them into their own bite, but taking in a little bit of seafood, avocado, microgreens and tomato - everything just melds together.  i would have never guessed that the extra creamy bottom layer was panna cotta.  i wasn't into the ultra thin parmesan breadsticks or gougers (too much cheese), but was a bit more enticed by the bread selection.  i choose the onion focaccia, which was a bit salty and super soft, but the onions were sweetly caramelized.  i stay away from pretzels in general, but tried a bite of my bf's roll - best pretzel ever.  also there's no salt on it.  the menu online offered a bone in filet, but was not currently on the menu.  after having more than a few prime filets in the past couple years, i decided to take it to the next level with an american wagyu filet and topped it off with <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark>.  absolutely the most tender meat that has ever melted in my mouth to date.  my bf had the dry aged <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> topped with <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>.  the marrow pieces had a fascinating shape and texture, looking like gnocchi but bursting like gelatinous blobs.  we shared the creamed spinach with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>.  the egg adds quite a bit of extra richness.  splitting the appetizer and sharing one side gave us just enough room for dessert.  the carmelized banana cream pie with valrhona pearls was a delight.  the pearls were like little crunches with a layer inside the slice and scattered on the plate.  there was also a scoop of roasted banana ice cream for cooler contrast.  with the bill arrived yet more sweets of a piece of incredibly rich truffle-like chocolate and not as sweet, chewy cashew caramel.  overall, an amazing meal.\n\nservice was very good, but not perfect.  the d\\u00e9cor is way modern.  i'm not sure i like the swivel chairs with mesh bottoms.  also i wore a super short skirt, so i felt a bit self-conscious.  not to mention the mirrors all around, although they let me see what was happening all around without having to swivel.  now i gotta go downgrade some of my other steakhouse reviews...", 
            "i guess my premonitions were right on this restaurant.  i see a lot of not very good reviews.  this restaurant is over-rated and over-priced for the cuisine they present to you.  i went to this restaurant with a friend and we ordered the illinois <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> with <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> and kobe beef shortribs \"indian spiced\" with herb french fries.  both dishes were too salty.  i can't say that the quality of the meat was not good because it was, but they need to learn how to prepare it better.  \n\nservice was excellent.  the ambiance was amazing.  but i just can't get over the terrible preparation of these entrees.  such a waste of such high quality beef!  they gave us a complementary dessert when we complained about the dishes...the chocolate souflee which was decent.  \n\nthis place has so much potential but not until they change chefs.", 
            "thank you, wolfgang puck.......meatatarian...... i am!\n\ni'm not real big on giving out 5 stars to steak places and the only other place that gets this honor is peter luger's in brooklyn.  after visit cut, i realized that it was indeed deserved.\n\neverything is a la carte. we were a group of six which was nice because we were able to get an array of different side dishes and apps.  <mark>Pink Lady & Fuji Apple Salad</mark>, crab & lobster louis cocktail and the tomato salad, there were also some memorable breads.\n\nit was unanimous, everyone ordered \"tasting of <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark>\".  we couldn't pass it up.  there was 4oz of usda prime, 4oz of american \"kobe\" and 2oz of japanese wagyu.   steak heaven.  we chose the <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>, the creamed spinach, the polenta and the <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark>.  the only thing that was terrible was the polenta.... but that's an acquired taste kind of thing.... and i didn't acquire it!\n\ni never in my life wanted to eat steak so slowly as to savor every bite of that kobe.....until i took a bite of the wagyu.  it freaking melts in your mouth! it's served in this trio to say, \"see how much better it is than your usda prime?\" and wow is it true.\n\nthe decor was very ultra lounge.  i loved it.  colors worked well, warm tones.  service was uber professional and very helpful when discussing wines.  i did have a 20 minute wait, even with reservations, but that's to be expected anywhere in vegas so it didn't even phase me.\n\ni will be back.", 
            "wow this place is awesome! i came here for an anniversary dinner with the bf on a wed night. we had reservations at 7pm, but even though we got there early, we were still seated right away in a cozy little booth. the decor is modern with lots of browns and dimmed lights and the vibe just felt cool haha...we were probably the youngest diners in the restaurant but for a wednesday night, the place was pretty packed.\n\nour server, carlos was attentive, efficient, and super friendly. he was able to describe the meats and wines to us and offered great recommendations. after much deliberation, we skipped the starters (since they do give you a good amount of bread) and went straight for the meat! i opted for the american wagyu filet ($80) and it was delicious! it was cooked perfectly medium rare and yes it was 'charred', but nothing extreme and the meat didn't taste burnt or anything like that. lots of yelpers complained about the saltiness of the meat, but i thought the seasoning was just right...in fact, they served my steak with a side of extra salt just in case i needed more haha. our side dishes of <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> and <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> were just right to compliment the steak. in addition to the awesome food, the service was impeccable, our wine and water glasses were always filled and i swear just as we had finished up our meal, our plates were cleared in an instant. we were checked up on and i never felt like i was rushed. another plus was our complementary dessert. the words \"happy anniversary\" were spelled out in chocolate and served alongside 4 different crackers/cookies...it was quite a pleasant surprise since i wasnt expecting anything like that. overall this was a sensational dining experience! everything was spot on and i'll definitely have to save my money for my next visit to cut haha", 
            "the food was absolutely delicious. i had the american wagyu filet, which was excellently prepared and amazingly tender. the <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> side was wonderful as well and i would have been happy eating them as a meal themselves.\n\nservice was also great, though the waiter confessed that although he was a certified sommelier, it was \"really just a certificate he got.\" no matter, a brief discussion and we decided on a bottle of gigondas that paired beautifully with the steaks.\n\nthe only real downside was, naturally, the price. however, i did not pick up the tab on this one, and i recommend you do the same. if you end up paying, come prepared to spend a lot and have a bit extra in your pocket.", 
            "went with a party of 7 on a monday night.  service was outstanding..it felt like we had 2 waiters per person!  i sat on the end so i got to see the waiters serve wine, prepare someone's lobster from shell to plate, refill voss sparkling and still water, etc...\namuse: cheese puffs...nothing special.\ncocktail: can't remember the name, but it was citron, sweet n sour, limoncello and amaretto..with a cinnamon-rimmed glass...soo good\nwine: bottle of red, yummy- not sure what is was because it was picked out before i arrived, went well with beef of course\nbreads: choice of pretzel, onion focaccia, pumpernickel, and sourdough. i went with pretzel - very soft and yummy, but not warm.\nappetizer: <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark>...super delicious reddest tuna i have seen, covered in beautiful avocado slices and masago, with 4 corners of plate covered with baby sliced radishes and cucumbers, ginger, wasabi, and kaiware sprouts + togarashi toasts\nentree: the disappointment of the evening.  i ordered the 8-hour slow-cooked kobe beef short ribs \"indian style\" - served on pureed mint \"raita\" and corn puree.  the curry sauce was wayyyyy too strong...ruined the meat flavor and made it hard to stomach.  the meat was cooked well but really, i could barely touch it.  i know it is a steakhouse so i probably should have gotten a steak, but my stomach didn't agree with that idea so i went with something easier to chew :)\nsides: i picked out the <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> and shisito peppers which i thought were amazing.  i also really liked the cavatappi mac n cheese, and the <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>.  didn't try the fries.  the sauteed spinach and polenta were tasteless.\ndessert: ice cream sandwich with cherry coke float (i only tried the float) and bruleed banana cream pie (i had some banana with chocolate caviar crisp things, that much of it was tasty).\nthe servers brought out more little rectangular bars that i had no room for, but one was \"upscale snickers,\" key lime pie, and chocolate fudge.\nservice: very thorough.  intimidating when sides came out as each side had a waiter bombarding each person at the table with \"do you want some of this?\"  water was refilled asap, and all of the servers knew who had sparkling and who had still.  when cocktails were finished, the glasses were removed quickly.  servers were friendly, information on each steak was provided before we ordered, and the waiters made sure we knew what sides were ordered when it was our turn so we could get something else for the table.\nother: the other person who ordered short ribs didn't like them either.  the lady who ordered lobster said it took so long for the server to take it from shell to plate that it was very cold.  also, they delivered 4 types of mustard and did not explain who or what they were for, but charged for other sauces.\nsummary: i would return as everything but my entree was flavorful and the service was decent.  the drinks were great too.  i would probably work out for 8 hours and fast so i could fit a steak in, but at least my kobe was tender - if it was just in the mint and corn purees and without the curry i bet it would have been simple and fantastic.",

            "wow.  high five to wolfgang puck for an exceptional dining experience - delicious food with professional & attentive service.  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j4cath00yzrq8bne2s4_cw?select=g2-vnaqfscp9bn7z-xjvuq\nwhile waiting, we enjoyed various samples of bread - my favorite was the bavarian pretzel.  slightly salty, sweet, and an incredibly soft texture - divine.  \n\n\nprior to ordering, i loved that the waiter rolled out several variations of the raw cut beef to demonstrate the difference in kobe wagyu & american style wagyu (mixed with angus to give it a meatier texture).  \nmy entree was the <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> (usda illinois) served with the argentinian chimichirri sauce, a light and springy taste with shallots, garlic, and cilantro.  perfectly cooked at medium and absolutely delicious.  refrain from biting the screen:  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/j4cath00yzrq8bne2s4_cw?select=yxcijyzzvh7cb9vr-cifgg \nthe fiance also loved his american wagyu rib-eye with <mark>Wasabi-Yuzu Kosho Butter</mark> sauce.  while part of the meat was slightly tough, the thicker end of the rib-eye melted in my mouth.  it's not necessary to order an additional sauce with your meat, since they also bring out three condiments for you to use anyhow.  \n\ni do recommend sharing the sides family style with a group - at about $12/side, you get a significant amount of delicious fare.  our group of four split three sides: the delicious creamy mac & cheese with quebec cheddar, the sauteed <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark>, and the butternut squash.  all were incredibly savory!  the best and most amusing part of the dinner was that we had three waiters (one per side dish) hovering next to us individually to explain what the dish was and proceeded to scoop it onto our plate before shuffling to the next person - it felt like culinary musical chairs.  if fighting over equal portions of a dish is an issue, this eliminates that problem...\n\nambiance is very modern and sleek.  it is pretty dim, but it wasn't too bothersome for us.  similar to the sauce, ordering dessert isn't necessary since they brought out a plate with decadent filled chocolates.  an exquisite way to end a satisfying and indulgent meal.", 
            "this seems to be one wolfgang restaurant that isn't suffering from the celebrity chef syndrome. you know... that ailment that seems to affect many restaurants on the strip. the one where a celebrity chef opens an outpost in sin city only to neglect it and have the quality of the product suffer as a result. as an example see spago and postrio or other celeb restaurants like mesa grill. cut bucks the trend successfully by offering some amazing steaks and fabulous accompaniments.\n\nwhile i didn't think the cheese ball amuse bouche was anything special, the bread selection was very good. particularly good were the pretzel bread and focaccia. the fresh burrata (with prosciutto, raisin-rhubarb compote, and arugula) wasn't something that was very memorable. the cold, stringy consistency of the cheese wasn't appetizing and the subtle flavor made the dish forgettable. the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, however, was an unbelievable mix of sweet and savory flavors. it could have benefitted from a little more pork fat to add to the texture and taste, but overall it was one of the best pork dishes i've had in a while.\n\nfor our entrees we had an 8 oz. petit cut filet and the 16 oz nebraska corn fed <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>. we ordered some <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> with the filet and got a side of fingerling potatoes to share. we ordered both medium rare but the filet came out closer to medium. they were both beautifully charred, providing a flavorful crust to the steaks while keeping the centers juicy and tender. \n\nservice was solid, although our waiter did disappear for a few stretches. however, the guy refilling our water was always around. it seemed like after every sip of water he was there to fill it back up to the top.\n\nthe decor is hip, trendy, and modern. quite a contrast to most other steak houses in las vegas. the music was more safe and mainstream, as they played a lot of u2, the beatles, rolling stones, and cold play.\n\nthey give locals a 20% discount off of food, so if you are nevada resident make sure you ask about it when you order.\n\n4.5 stars", 
            "my friend wanted to have one really nice dinner for his vegas bday weekend.  we all love steak, so we decided to make reservations at cut.  i had just dined at alexander's( http://www.yelp.com/biz/alexanders-steakhouse-cupertino#hrid:zgok0ixxx8fog1fdfdmgka/src:self ) a few weeks prior and loved it, so i had super high expectations for cut.  we had a party of eight, so we called in for reservations ahead of time. \n\nservice here is definitely outstanding.  there were so many servers waiting on us, i couldn't keep track.  our water glasses were always full, and your napkin would always be folded if you got out of your seat.  our waiter brought out a platter to display the different cuts of wagyu beef....kobe vs. american...so we could see the different marbling.    \n\nfor my first course, i ordered the <mark>Roasted Weiser Farms Baby Beets</mark>, humboldt fog goat cheese, pistachio, citrus, micro basil,  & mint.  i originally was going to get the usda prime <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark>, but it was only $20 more for the american wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>....i was sold.  i added the <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> to top off my lovely piece of steak.  our table also ordered saut\\u00e9ed baby spinach, <mark>Soft Polenta with Parmesan</mark> and <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>.\n\nmy beet appetizer had a very nice presentation.  it was very colorful, and all of the ingredients complimented each other very well.  all of our sides were very tasty.  the polenta was nice and creamy, <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark> were crispy, and the spinach added the \"healthy\" factor to our meal.\n\nthey prepare the steaks over a hard wood and charcoal grill and then finish them off in a broiler.  my steak was cooked to a nice medium rare, and it melted in my mouth.  the steak had great flavor, but i didn't really care much for the charred flavor from the broiler.  the <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> i added went well with my steak and kept it moist from the sauce.  i wasn't able to finish my steak and gave it to my friends who had the usda prime <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>.  they were amazed and could totally tell the difference from the wagyu.\n\nthe only disappointment i had here was that they didn't have foie gras as an add on to your steak.  i was spoiled by alexander's, and left the restaurant craving that melt in your mouth foie gras.  i was so expecting a 5 star dinner here, but i just couldn't give it to them.  please add foie gras to the menu!",

            "i love steakhouses and i love wolfgang puck, so i stopped in with a few of my coworkers this past weekend. \n\nthe wait staff was very accommodating and friendly. the bartender mentioned to our server about my date's birthday. i thought it was very nice and sweet of them to be very aware of important events being celebrated. our drinks were never empty and the food just kept on coming. we ordered the steak tartare and louis appetizers. i am not a fan of raw beef, but the tartare was very tender and just melted in my mouth. i thoroughly enjoyed my bone-in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> with <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> and <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark>. steak without <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> is just not as tasty. it was a perfect medium rare throughout and the side dishes complemented the entree well. we had sauteed spinach, mac n cheese, shisito peppers, and artichokes. the mac n cheese tops morton's hands down. creamy, with the breadcrumbs. it was a great suggestion by our server. i also tasted my date's dish of lamb. the crust was great and the sauce put me in heaven all over again. \n\nthe best part of the evening for me is always dessert. i loved the raspberry doughnuts, baked alaska, and chocolate souffle. the doughnuts are on the sweeter side, with decadence coming from the chocolate desserts. \n\ni can't wait for my next trip to vegas, so i can taste the wagyu beef!",

            "i've had a lot of steak in my life, and i had the best one ever - here at cut!  the whole experience here -- pure butter.  wolfgang puck is a genius!\n\nbeautiful place.  i was in a party of 4 for a special occasion.  we were given a table in the back, where it was a bit more quiet so we could chat with each other.  from the moment we entered, friendly and warmly greeted...and our server was super great.  he, along with the most amazing steak ever, made this a very memorable evening for all of us.\n\ni ordered the 10 oz petite filet - omg - seriously, it's cooked in butter and herbs and each bite completely melted in my mouth in both flavor and tenderness.\n\nwith choices of cuts, sizes, and aging, the selection can be a little intimidating.  don't be afraid to ask for your recommendations!  as with most other steakhouses, it's a la carte.  great sides accompaniment and i liked everything we ordered: herb french fries, <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark>, creamed spinich, and brocoll-rapini.  the wine selection is fine and wide, with many choices by the bottle or glass.\n\nthe only other memorable part are the prices, ranging from $50-$120. it is definitely high, so make sure you are having a good day at the tables!  but seriously, this is one fine dining experience.  for the quality and service amply given, and in vegas -- i would never question dining here based on price.  \n\nnext time in vegas, i am so going back!", 
            "if i had gone to the outback or the sizzler, i probably would have given this place 4 stars.  but at $75-$150 per steak (plus extras), i expect a significantly higher quality.  i didn't get that.  i had a steak that was ok, not prepared exactly to my liking, and quite a bit of gristle and tendons/ligaments.\n\ni like my steaks to be prepared rare.  and by rare, i do mean rare.  that is a cool to warm red center.\n\ni ordered the 16 oz. bone-in <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark>.  it came out somewhere between medium-rare and medium.  after a couple of bites, i complained to the waiter.  rather than offering to replace the steak with one to my liking, he explained that their unique cooking process drained all of the visible blood from the steak, and so even if the steak appeared to be overcooked, it was in fact rare.  perhaps i was too polite, and should have called bullsh*t on the spot, but i accepted his explanation and continued to eat the overcooked steak.  it was not rare.  it did not taste rare.  and no matter what kind of magic wolfgang puck thinks he can work with special cooking techniques, a rare steak should look like and taste like a rare steak.\n\nwhile most of the steak was fairly tender - as you would expect a <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> to be - there were areas of tendon, ligament and gristle which were simply impenetrable by the standard steak knives they offered.  since my complaints were already rebuffed once, i chose not to complain again.  i'm sure wolfgang's mignons would have had another excuse to offer.\n\nservice was good, and the side items were good.  (the <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> to top the steak were well worth the extra $12, and were perhaps the best part of the entire steak).  the wine was also good, although i prefer to be handed a more traditional looking wine list, and not an ipad where i have to navigate the various screens.\n\nthere are plenty of top notch restaurants in las vegas that are worth $300 for a dinner for two.  this is simply not one of them.",

            "day 4 of my las vegas getaway (almost two weeks ago).  day 1 included dinner at gallagher's for steak which i found to be pretty good but not great.  so, let's try steak again but this time at wolfgang puck's cut.  \n\nthe restaurant was busy with a nice energetic ambiance.  i ordered the nebraska corn-fed rib-eye with <mark>Armagnac & Green Peppercorn</mark> sauce and <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark>.  on the side i had the fingerling potatoes with bacon and onions and glass of heitz cellars cabernet.  cocktail was called pins and needles.\n\nthe good - the service was efficient and impeccable.  the wine was perfect and the cocktail was excellent.  the fingerling potato side with bacon was great.  i could have eaten an entire plate of them.  maybe i should have after you read the bad and the ugly below.\n\nthe bad and the ugly - i had such high hopes to finish my stay in las vegas with a great steakhouse experience.  what a disappointment.  the rib-eye i ordered was cooked perfectly and oh so tender.  the first bite was heaven.  after three or four bites i realized how salty the steak was.  before i finished half of the steak there was so much salt on my palate i could barely taste my wine and other food.  i had to drink the entire 750 ml bottle of sparkling water i ordered.  because of the salty meat i could finish neither my meal, wine, or the cocktail.\n\nthe waiter did remove the cost of the meat from my bill but i didn't care about that.  i wanted a great steakhouse experience and was sorely disappointed.   wolfgang, this establishment needs some of your personal attention.\n\n(i updated my review based on the response i received from management; professional and courteous as you would expect.  i will indeed give cut another try on my next trip to vegas and am confident that it will be a much better experience as others here have raved.)", 
            "we had dinner here for my fiances birthday after heavily debating which of the many steakhouses in vegas to dine at. we are serious foodies, and are certainly not afraid to spend serious bucks on a delicious meal. with that being said, i do believe this is the most i have ever spent on a meal for 2 people. \n\nambiance - 3 stars - \n-different decor than your normal steakhouse. lots of metals/mirrors gave it a bit more of a modern feel leather benches (if you're lucky enough to get a booth) with leather table tops were nice. we thought the decor was a bit \"cold\" due to the usage of sharp edges and more modern materials. \n-the seats in the middle of the restaurant did not seem appealing at all. the chairs looked like something you would sit on in a conference room at your office. \n-it is loud in here. there is not an lot of space, and the use of hard materials   everywhere causes sound to bounce in every direction. they could really use some sound absorbing materials on the ceiling to cut down the noise. we were lucky to be sitting right next to each-other in a booth, because if we weren't we would most likely have been shouting across the table. \n\nservice - 4.5 stars - \n- immediately seated at a nice booth, with reservations. wait staff was attentive. items were brought to the table in a timely manner. steak was carved and plated table-side along with the side dishes. sides were also refilled by the wait staff as they were consumed from the plate, which was a nice touch. \n\nfood - 3 stars - \n- all of the items brought out prior to dinner were quite good. bread sticks, cheese pastries, and the assorted bread tray. we did not get any appetizers as to not spoil the, assumed to be, spectacular cut of beef we would receive for our main course. i would give the \"breads\" an overall 4.5 stars. the focaccia and pretzel roll were both really tasty. the bread sticks were buttery. the pastry was buttery. and of course, the bread was served with butter topped with rosmary and smoked sea salt. \n- main course: 34 oz. wagyu porterhouse for 2. sides: cavatappi pasta mac & cheese, <mark>Cavatappi Pasta 'Mac & Cheese,' Qubec Cheddar</mark>, shaved baby squash, <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark>. \n- <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark>: 5 stars, these were delicious and a great addition to the steak. generously buttered. \n- shaved baby squash: 4 stars. nothing too special about this, but it was a good change of pace from all of the butter used on everything else. fresh & crisp, seasoned lightly. \n- cavatappi pasta mac & cheese, <mark>Cavatappi Pasta 'Mac & Cheese,' Qubec Cheddar</mark>: 3.5 stars. it got old, quick. a good take on mac & cheese. i'm always a fan of mac that uses more elegant cheeses than just yellow cheddar or even american, but this didn't have that \"comfort\" feeling you normally get with mac. after one spoonful it gets old. thick, cheesy, buttery. \n\n- 34 oz. wagyu porterhouse for 2, served medium-rare: 2 stars. this isn't the first time that we have had a wagyu porterhouse at a steakhouse, and we had high expectations. unfortunately they fell very short. even before choosing a restaurant we knew we wanted wagyu. it was served with 5 different sauces. we sampled them, but normally don't take sauce with our steak - as the beef itself should be the star. \n\n after all the build up from the waiter about how the steaks are 100% wagyu, and our past experiences with wagyu and kobe - i was seriously excited. my first impression was that it looked small. i would say we were served something more along the lines of 24-28oz. it was not a \"pretty\" cut of meat, it looked a bit beat up, grizzly, and fatty. when he brought it out my heart sank, and i immediately knew this was not going to be the mouth watering heart melting piece of beef we had set out for. \n\nthe steak had just the right amount of salt/pepper/garlic/onion on the outside. the beef itself, however, did not live up to the hype. the filet portion was extremely tender, and decently flavorful (for filet). the strip portion had around the same flavor quality as the filet, unexpected. the beef did not have that glorious taste you would expect from a fine piece of meat like this, especially for the price. when you're paying triple digits for a steak, you expect it to be superb. the overall flavor profile for the steak was butter. the beef was not rich tasting at all, and was actually quite bland.\n\ndessert - 5 stars - we didn't order anything, but the hotel concierge made note that it was my fiances birthday. they brought out a generous slice of the banana pie which was absolutely amazing. served on a plate with a scoop of ice cream, and happy birthday in chocolate sauce. dessert was probably the best part of the meal.\n\ncost - 4 stars - it's inflated, but it's vegas. \n\nmaybe our taste buds were off that night, or we actually did receive a sub-par cut of beef, i'm not sure. the asst. gm, matt, gave me his card and assured us the next cut of beef we received from them would surpass our expectations. with all the 5 star reviews, i would probably give it another chance.", 
            "i... don't know what to say. i had really high hopes for this place, thinking this would be one of the best meals of my life. but sadly, i was hugely disappointed.\n\nfor a 6 oz steak that costs $85, i expected a lot more. i ordered the american wagyu <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark>, medium rare. what i got was definitely more rare than medium rare.. most of the steak was red. i even started to question if they gave me the right steak, because it wasn't anything near amazing, like i expected after reading some yelp reviews about the american wagyu.  it was kinda tasteless, didn't melt in my mouth at all, and was even slightly difficult to swallow. mastros in costa mesa is way better..\n\nother reviews on what we ordered:\nappetizer: <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan: this was pretty good. it had a lot of flavor.. even the salad on top was delicious and refreshing amongst all the heavy things we ordered. not a lot in terms of quantity but very tasty. i think it's popular because it's so unique. good but didn't amaze me. \namerican wagyu <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark>: see above. this was ok... sad to say.\namerican wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>: what my bf ordered. he always gets the <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> and i always get the <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark>, which is nice because we get to try both. his <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> was ok. not as fatty and flavorful as <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> usually are. a disappointment as well.. didnt have much flavor.  \nmaybe we were supposed to order some toppings for our steaks to give them more flavor, but we wanted to taste the steak on its own since it's supposed to be such good quality. i guess that's what the sauces and salt (that they offer) are for. i'd rather the chef perfect the steak's flavor for me, though, since they're the pros and we're paying so much. \n\nside: <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark>: this was ok. i would have much preferred other mushrooms. i wouldn't order this again. be careful when you eat the big green pepper as it can be very spicy!\n\nmac n cheese: this was actually really good! not your typical mac n cheese. i loved the texture of the macaroni\n\nwine: i forgot the exact one i ordered, but it was a cabernet sauvignon, which i always get. it was okay. \n\nservice was pretty good. they explain the cuts of meat to you, comparing japanese wagyu and american wagyu. the servers were very efficient and seemed pretty busy. you should definitely ask questions if you have any. they were more than happy to answer my questions. \n\nin the end, our meal was $300 for two people (appetizer, two steaks, two sides and a glass of wine). i wish the price were justified by an unforgettable meal, but i'm left feeling pretty unsatisfied. i didn't even bother to look at the dessert menu, which says a lot. trust me.\n\ncome here to experience a wolfgang puck restaurant if you wish, but just don't get your hopes up.", 
            "to start off the night we came here to cut to try their wagyu steak and compare it to a few other steak houses. first impression of this location was a great ambiance. my boyfriend and i were helped by carlos and ivan. they were really polite and attentive. the best thing that we had was the parmesan bread sticks mind that we did order a wagyu <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> that was over cooked and way to salty. along with our steak we ordered the <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> and brussel sprouts that were also way over cooked and seasoned. they did do a few things right which includes their cocktail drinks, service, bread, and blue crab appetizer. i don't think we will be coming back to this location due to poor quality of food.", 
            "read the reviews and ordered the porterhouse for two with a side of <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>...wow..was the marrow rich..i think we drank an extra bottle of wine because of that.\n\nthe porterhouse rare..was perfect..cold center and melt in your mouth tender.\n\nthe <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> sides was delicious.", 
            "the creme de la creme of steakhouses.\n\na group of friends and i had an open sunday, so we decided why not do a fancy dinner. cut was our pick. seating was a breeze. made reservations on opentable and got seated at a large round table in the back when we arrived. it was like our own little area. \n\nit's difficult not to leave impressed. the waiters and waitresses are amazing here. so attentive. they offered a variety of complimentary breads on a tray and we were able to select as little or as many as we wanted. get the focaccia for sure. that was the favorite among the table.\n\ni can only speak for what i personally ordered... the u.s.d.a. prime <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> 12 oz ($59). it was delicious!! cooked to perfection with a fine crust to give it that extra texture but, be warned, there's tons of fat. on the plus side, fat equals flavor! you can also choose from a list of sauces to compliment your meats. i got to try their armagnac and <mark>Armagnac & Green Peppercorn</mark> as well as the spicy red chimichurri ($2 each). both tasted great with the <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>. one was enough for 2-3 people. i had a ton left over.\n\nall the meats are served a la carte. the table got a double order of mac & cheese ($19) and it was to die for! so glad we got a double. we also shared an order of their creamed spinach ($12) and <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> ($22), which were just alright to me. one order for seven people left everyone with only a couple bites of each side. you can see in the attached pictures.\n\nwolfgang puck knows how to do fine-dining well. the atmosphere is elegant and perfect for celebrations or a nice date. just wished it didn't dent the wallet so much. i always cringe a little when i see that four $$$$ sign, but you're paying for quality i suppose!", 
            "came here with the bf and a friend. this place is good, but i think falls a little short of the 4 stars. \n\nthe pretzel bread they offer is awesome. i like dipping it in the mustard offerings. i also like the onion foccacia bread. i like that they come around with a bread plate to give you as much as you like of any of the breads. most places give you a basket, and it's never enough of the one bread you like and too much of the breads you don't like. \n\nthe friend and i got the american wagyu center cut <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> medium rare. the flavor is incomparable. my bf got the 12 oz omaha <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, which was also very delicious. the omaha was more butter, but the flavor of the wagyu was bolder. we got the sides of the <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> and <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>. the mushrooms had shishito peppers in them that we all felt didn't really complement the flavors of the mushrooms. the mushrooms on their own were good though. the <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> was decent. \n\nservice is stellar here though. they don't miss a beat at all. \n\noverall, i was happy we came, and i ate a lot of steak! :)", 
            "another amazing steakhouse. the restaurant is beautiful and the food is very tasty. always enjoying a bottle of wine with dinner, the corkage fee is not ridiculous. it was nice to see a steakhouse with such an amazing selection of dry aged beef; which you cannot find everywhere. my wife and i shared the 21 day aged porterhouse steak. delicious, delicious. shared <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> and <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>. could not be more satisfied. we are going back to vegas for labor day and will most likely be going back if we can at least for desert. stop in for a good time.", 
            "solid steaks. pricy. worth the melt in your mouth...\n\namerican wagyu beef sashimi - the tender slices of beef and sauce made it excellent... *drool...*\n\n100% japanese wagyu - gahhhh must i say more?! \ni added the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> topping and that was a mistake on my part.  the cut didn't need the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>, but i must say i didn't regret eating all that <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>. \n\nside of <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> & japanese shishito peppers -  just perfectly seasoned. i hate peppers yet these were so good. \n\nthis steak restaurant made it to the top of my steak restaurant list.  now, i don't need to fly all the way to oregon for urban farmer.  i hope cut is as good in beverly hills.\n\noh, totally forgot that the waiters present the different cut of meat at your table and escort you to the restroom. *feeling princess*"

            "there's a couple of things to mention first: \n1.  i don't tend to like wolfgang puck restaurants - at least not since dining at spago in the mid 90s.  he puts his name on a lot and i don't know that he pays attention to any of his endeavors.\n2.  we can be food snobs - we live in san francisco and visit vegas frequently.  we have dined in many fine restaurants over time.  we always have high expectations in restaurants where the per head bill is over $100.\n\nso what was our verdict?  while we had very high expectations, we were not prepared to be totally blown away, which is what happened.\n\nit really was a perfect evening.  the service, which is done in teams without anyone missing a beat, was incredibly attentive but not intrusive.  the food was superlative.  the atmosphere was hip, modern and pleasant.  \n\nto start, don't fill up on the bread - and there's lots of it - from parmesan covered breadsticks, to cheese in puff pastry, to the bread basket with pretzels, breads and foccacia, you can make a meal of the bread.\n\nthe food was also not as expected.  it's hard to put inventive twists on normal dishes, but they managed to do so.  the <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> had unique flavors, came with great toast crisps and wasabi aoili.  it also had beautiful slices of avocado on top and presented as a perfect terrine.  normally portions for appetizers, particularly raw tuna, are very small - this was not.  and the taste was outstanding.  i had <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> the previous night at another great restaurant and it didn't compare.\n\nthe asparagus salad was so nicely presented it was almost a shame to cut into it.  each of the very thin, tender asparagus spears were perfectly lined up on a piece of brioche with a perfectly cooked poached egg gently placed on top.  \n\ni had the dry aged nebraska <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> (boneless) 16 oz.  it was a beautiful piece of meat, perfectly char grilled medium rare and with very little fat.  it was juicy, tender and perfect.  my wife had the korobuta <mark>Double Thick Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark>.  korobuta pork is the kobe beef of pork.  it was also moist, juicy and tasted great.  our sides?  fingerling potatoes with bacon confit and <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>.  both of them were perfect, but the <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark> were phenomenal.  \n\nnow my wife is a chocolate snob - she has very high standards for chocolate desserts.  she was driven to orgasmic delight by the chocolate souffle.  i, who don't like chocolate all that much, thought it was great too.\n\ni had trouble deciding between the lemon filled doughnuts and peach/blackberry crumble with 50 bean vanilla ice cream.  the waitress steered me towards the crumble and it was wonderful... they bring it out in a hot metal baking dish and spoon it into a bowl at the table.\n\nwe found out why the waitress steered me away from the doughnuts... it was my birthday and they brought me out a birthday dessert sampler which had, among other things, a lemon custard filled doughnut... the waitress was great about not spoiling the surprise and allowing me to enjoy both desserts i wanted.  \n\nso some final thoughts: \n1.  don't go if you aren't prepared for a very expensive evening - it's not cheap.  if the price tag will ruin your experience then this isn't the place for you.\n2.  the wait staff was excellent.  we were never steered to the most expensive items, she listened to what we told her our tastes were and made recommendations based on that.\n3.  if you have a martini, the <mark>Point Reyes Blue Cheese</mark> stuffed olives are incredible.\n4.  there is a big difference between wet aged, dry aged and kobe beef.  they explained very well all the differences and will help guide you to a great experience if you let them.  let them know your preferences in seasoning as well as in flavor and cooking style.  they really will try to do it your way...\n5.  a la carte is what every steakhouse does.  as annoying as it is, cut isn't the only one to do it.  if a la carte will bother you, then this may not be the place for you.  \n6.  this is both a great place for a romantic dinner and a great place for a group get together.  \n7.  this is a great place to just go and enjoy a fine meal and let the troubles of the world (and the losses at the tables) melt away.  go and enjoy!", 
            "i love a good hunk of beef.  i love me the wolfgang puck.\n\nwow...this place is very chic and modern.  the ambience was nice - it was an open area.  the bar seating is quite expansive.  the entire front of the restaurant with lots of seating.  \n\nwe had a 7 p.m. reservation and no wait at all.  seated immediately.\n\nthe best thing about this place was the awesome wait staff.  we had some great waiters who really were professional waiters.  they pulled out my chair (which ooops i missed ladies, never sit facing the door) and of course they were very knowledgable about the menu.\n\nok, the wait staff was awesome, but so was the food.  we ordered the proscuitto with figs and some kind of fresh cheese.  the cheese was to die for.  fresh figs in season - to die.\n\ni also had a glass of a lovely pinot which they brought out in its own caraffe to pour into my glass.  very classy.  \n\ni got some 6 oz wagyu monstrosity and had <mark>Point Reyes Blue Cheese</mark> and onions on top.  the waiters brought out the meat to look at.  it was delicious.  i think $135 for my steak?  something like that.  but man was it worth it.  especially with the carmelized onions and <mark>Point Reyes Blue Cheese</mark>.\n\nthe only negative i would say is the music.  they were playing tom petty and some other stuff that just didn't seem to go with what i would picture as an upscale restaurant.  it was a little off...\n\ni wish we had room for dessert.  we didn't.  \n\nit was also our last night of the trip, so we were soooo full and sunburnt.  i really loved this place, but would have loved it more if i didn't have a steak the night before.", 
            "first i must preface this by saying that my husband came here before and would have given it 5 stars on yelp!  he said it has declined at least 30% since his last visit.\n\nalright, onto my review.... knowing that many celebs frequent the la restaurant, and having heard my husband's review.... i was expecting a delicious sophisticated meal at an expensive restaurant.  it was pricey, but none of the other things i had hoped for.\n\nthe martinis we ordered came with a choice of <mark>Point Reyes Blue Cheese</mark>, jalapeno, or pimento, i chose <mark>Point Reyes Blue Cheese</mark> having had them at a different bar.  the martinis were okay.... but after drinking down the vodka, started to smell like vomit.  not the best way to start my meal.  \n\nthey brought a huge platter of raw meat to our table and began to explain where they were from, etc.  being a carnivore, i was not turned off by the display of dead animal, but i can see how it might be offensive to some.  we opted for the bone-in filet.\n\nthey came by with a tray of fresh breads and we chose the pretzel and pumpernickel which were fabulous, but cold.  i expected this tray of fresh bread to smell like a bakery and for the warm slices to melt in my mouth... not so much. (however the butter, that they said was from france was room temperature and easy to spread!)\n\nthe sides--\ncavatapi mac and cheese was baked with a delicious sharp cheddar, was pure comfort food and worth every calorie.\ncreamed spinach with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> (not sure if the spinach was organic, but they make a point of saying the egg is...) good...not great.... but i love anything with an egg over medium....\nfingerling potatoes with bacon and <mark>Fingerling Potatoes, Smokey Bacon, Pearl Onions</mark> were awesome.  wish i had them now for breakfast.  comfort food, thick chunks of bacon and the <mark>Fingerling Potatoes, Smokey Bacon, Pearl Onions</mark> i could eat for days....\n\noverall service was very efficient but lacked any personality.  they aren't the snobby servers of elite fine dining places, and they aren't the overly helpful staff of.... let's say a casino cafe.  they seem uncomfortable, and in a restaurant that is designed like a dark cafeteria, they need to do something to warm the place up a bit.  the decor was moody and the design pieces well chosen, but i would prefer a little different floor plan for this type of hype.  every diner should feel like a celebrity in a place that charges $60-$185 a steak.\n\nenjoyed the food and atmosphere of craftsteak much more.... but then i guess everyone can have an off day.", 
            "overall...a sensational effort.  from the atmosphere (clean, stylish and modern...but not too cold or sterile) to the food (superb) to the service (attentive and knowledgeable staff)....the dining experience was a memorable one.  i am from chicago so my bar is set pretty high...and cut compares favorably with the best steak houses i have visited.\n\ni had a decadent <mark>Point Reyes Blue Cheese</mark> wedge salad and the succulent bone in filet...along with a superb bottle of peter michael \"les pavots\"...sure...$789 is a lot for dinner for two...maybe the most i have ever spent...but it was most delectable and i dont deduct for costs (since you should know the price range going in)...\n\na world class steakhouse...", 
            "first of all, i don't eat meat so i can't really give a critique on their steaks. so, why would a person who doesn't eat meat review this place? well, because not everyone eats meat and because i can and i want to. but on the real, regardless, meat eater or not, you gotta try cut.\n\nthe restaurant itself is so chic, the decor is beautiful as well the menus (i have a thing for fonts and paper, fyi); hell, even the staff is nice to look at :] no but forreal, the staff is really nice and are there for everything. yes i mean everything; they do the whole pull your chair out, put the napkin over your lap thing. i wish they'd feed me next time lol the bathrooms are really nice too! the only gripe i have would be about those wooden floors; they're slippery as hell. \n\nnow on to the food. the variety of bread they offer is off the chain; the focacciaa was frikkin amazing! i ordered the \"<mark>Butter Lettuce</mark>, avocado, <mark>Point Reyes Blue Cheese</mark>, champagne-herb vinaigrette\". okay, yea, i'm the first one to say \"salad is just salad\" but this salad is not just a salad. it's like the most epic tasting salad i've had... ever and i've had my share of salads. everything was just like butta' melting in my mouth: so creamy and velvety.  prety much it was really frikkin good! all the ingredients were really fresh and the vinaigrette and cheese were delicious. and damn the water was good too. so no complaints.\n\npricewise, like other people have said expect to pay somewhere between $100-$175 per person. i didn't spend nearly as much because i just got the salad and a water.\n\nall in all, the experience and food were exceptional.", 
            "nothing overly special, when comparing to other top end steakhouses.\n\nits been a few months since i went to cut, so i wont give a detailed review, i'll just post my overall feelings and things that stood out.\n\nfirst off, the service was awesome at first and then started fading away towards the end. when i go to top-end steak-houses, i expect top notch service and was not failed for the first 3/4 of our dining experience. but on the back end, the attentiveness wasnt there once our main course was served (he quit filling our wine for us, took a while to clear the plates, took even longer bring dessert menu, took a long time to bring check). and we had a later reservation, so it wasnt like he was in the weeds.\n\nthe crab and shrimp appetizer was good, but nothing outstanding. the asparagus app was very good though. the <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark> salad was just ok to me. im not a fan of the <mark>Point Reyes Blue Cheese</mark> with a vinaigrette salad, but the gf wanted it. my opinion on this is purely just my palate...im sure other would think it was very good.\n\nthe steak...was ok...good, but nothing special (at this price point). i actually enjoy steaks at some other places better (craftsteak, for instance). it was cooked perfectly, but i didnt really care for the lack of seasoning. i know some will argue that point, but that was my main problem with the steak, it lacked seasoning that really brings out the flavors. i suppose its better than over seasoning though.\n\nour sides were the mac and cheese (outstanding!!!!) and some roasted corn or something like that. the mac and cheese was absolutely fantastic and i would go back just for that, but the corn was disappointing. it had some of the hard parts of the cob still attached. while i appreciate the effort of freshly peeled corn, i guess i just wanted to see it done well.\n\n\noverall, i enjoy trying different steakhouses and this place ranks with the others in their price point. it wasnt my favorite, but it was still good. if you are a steakhouse fan like me, its worth trying out.", 
            "cut is casual but elegant in presentation and food quality. first of all the staff;we had roberto house manager and chip our waiter; you couldn't ask for better. roberto made us feel like he knew us and was at our command. chip was a fountain of wine information. i have eaten at four of pucks restaurants now in vegas and la, only lupo at mgm grand was bad.-\nbut cut delivers. i had the special beef carpaccio with shaved white truffles and white truffle holindaise. what can i say it was delicious and chip paired a perfect viongne. next was a bibb lettuce salad with <mark>Point Reyes Blue Cheese</mark> and avocado, i didn't know a salad could be so perfect. next a prime quailty <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> cooked medium rare + . i like my steak inbetween med and med rare. it came absolutely perfect. the sides where pur\\u00e9ed yellow fine potato and broiled asparagus with bread crumbs and parmesan. chip again paired a perfect glass of hietz cabernet. \neach item i ordered was perfectly cooked, perfectly executed, and nicely presented.\ni would go back in a heartbeat .\ni also found out from roberto that they have remodeled spago in la and re-did the menu.\ni can't wait to go back there now cause it was a little dated and meals kinda old county clubish.\ni highly recommend cut las vegas, you won't be disappointed. it's not cheap but it is well worth it.\n\nvisited october 2012", 
            "oh cut, i so wanted to love you! but unfortunately, i just like you. 3.5 stars.\n\none of our friends had said this is his favorite steakhouse and he eats here every time he goes to vegas. so for our annual thanksgiving dinner, i suggested cut as the place for my family to dine. we all walked away saying we would not come here again.\n\nservice - top notch!\nambiance - this is a tiny restaurant and it's decorated nicely, but the music was classic rock and didn't really fit the feel of this place.\nthe food - hits and misses, which i'll get to.\nprice - about $1000 for eight people, which is pretty average for a steakhouse.\n\nbread - you are given crispy breadsticks coated in parmesan. tasty, but very messy, the parmesan flaked off all over the place. \nyou are brought a plate of four choices of bread, you tell them which ones you want, and they are served to you by a waiter. i had the pretzel bread and the onion focaccia bread. both were awesome. \n\nstarters - they don't have soup! i really wanted a soup, but there are none on the menu. bummer. my friend ordered the <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark>, avocado, <mark>Point Reyes Blue Cheese</mark>, champagne-herb vinaigrette salad. i had a couple bites and it was very good. \n\nsteak - our friend had told us to splurge and get the japanese wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>. it's $155 for 8 oz. he said it was well worth it, so bf and i split it. japanese wagyu is apparently not for me, it's just too buttery and literally melted in my mouth. i like steak i can chew on a little bit. i don't fault cut, i just think it isn't my thing. my friend ordered a petite filet with <mark>Point Reyes Blue Cheese</mark> and i tried it, i liked his filet a lot and wish we had ordered that <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark>. everybody else said their meat was okay.\n\nsides - brussels sprouts - great flavor, but too undercooked for my taste. not served very hot. creamed spinach topped with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> - just okay, also not very hot, and i could have done without the egg. mac & cheese - good flavor, but the noodles were slightly gummy and also, this wasn't hot. \n\ndessert - we didn't get any, but my friend ordered the chocolate souffle and it was amazing. definitely the best part of the meal. \n\nit wasn't terrible, but there are so many steakhouses in vegas, many of which i think are a lot better. when you are dropping $125 a person, you want to enjoy everything you eat, and that didn't happen here.", 
            "excellent service from the start, you are welcomed by several waiters. each very friendly, professional, and knowledgeable.\n\nfood was was amazing! they first bring out a few small bites, cheese gruyere's and parmesan seasons breadsticks. later, an assortment of fresh baked bread and butter. then the main course!!!\n\nwe ordered <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> for appetizers, wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> 9oz steaks for our main course, creamed spinach with a <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>, and mash potatoes for sides.\n\nthe <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> is cooked to protection. it's topped with some greens and fruit compote. adding peppery and sweet flavors making it a well balanced dish. \n\nthe wagyu <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> was cooked perfectly to my liking. charred and medium rare. they provide several steak dipping sauces on the side; hot mustard, multi<mark>Cognac & Whole Grain Mustard</mark>, sea salt, and bbq. you can also request ranch, and <mark>Point Reyes Blue Cheese</mark>. the steak melts like butter. seriously the best <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> i've ever had. so juicy and flavorful!\n\nthe sides were also very good. best mashed potatoes ever -must try! the creamed spinach was a great contrast to all of our heavy dishes.\n\nthey have a variety of beverages also, from high end wine to light beer. \n\ndefinitely recommend if you feel like splurging!", 
            "my overall 4 stars in a combination of 3 for food and 5 for service.\n\ncut is a very handsome restaurant and has a real \"high end\" feel to it. the front desk staff were very pleasant and welcoming. \n\ntheir wine list is extensive and you will find something you like. for dinner i started with the <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark> with <mark>Point Reyes Blue Cheese</mark> and champagne vinaigrette. it was outstanding and unfortunately the best part of the meal. for my main i had the petite <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark>. it was good but not outstanding. no sides for me but i had to order the valrhona chocolate souffle. again, it was good but not memorable. i had to return my espresso as it had an odd taste to it. they gladly took it back as i then requested a black coffee.\n\nmy 5 stars for service is based upon sam being my server. he was outstanding from beginning to end. i noticed he pampered all of his guests. he really made me feel like a vip and cut is lucky to have him.\n\nfood was fine -  service was excellent. i would return and give the food another shot-as long as sam was my server!"

            "seriously too bad that bf and i both felt nauseous at dinner but the things we did taste were delish!  every freakin person here is so darn nice and friendly - and considering how trendy this place is i was kind of expecting snooty service.  the food was really good - <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, oxtail bouillon, bone-in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>, cream of <mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark> and the handcut fries.  the oxtail bouilon was the standout dish for me...there were bits of <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> floating around!  and the bar menu looks tasty too, hopefully i win lots of money in vegas next time and can give this place another go!", 
            "i made my bf make a reservation about a month before our trip to vegas.  we studied the menu quite awhile beforehand.  it's important to carefully consider what to eat if you're going to spend a few benjamins!  we started with the maryland blue crab and <mark>Pan Roasted Stonington Maine Lobster</mark> \"louis\" cocktail.  this was surprisingly fresh.  you can taste each of the crab or lobster when separating them into their own bite, but taking in a little bit of seafood, avocado, microgreens and tomato - everything just melds together.  i would have never guessed that the extra creamy bottom layer was panna cotta.  i wasn't into the ultra thin parmesan breadsticks or gougers (too much cheese), but was a bit more enticed by the bread selection.  i choose the onion focaccia, which was a bit salty and super soft, but the onions were sweetly caramelized.  i stay away from pretzels in general, but tried a bite of my bf's roll - best pretzel ever.  also there's no salt on it.  the menu online offered a bone in filet, but was not currently on the menu.  after having more than a few prime filets in the past couple years, i decided to take it to the next level with an american wagyu filet and topped it off with <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark>.  absolutely the most tender meat that has ever melted in my mouth to date.  my bf had the dry aged <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> topped with <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>.  the marrow pieces had a fascinating shape and texture, looking like gnocchi but bursting like gelatinous blobs.  we shared the creamed spinach with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>.  the egg adds quite a bit of extra richness.  splitting the appetizer and sharing one side gave us just enough room for dessert.  the carmelized banana cream pie with valrhona pearls was a delight.  the pearls were like little crunches with a layer inside the slice and scattered on the plate.  there was also a scoop of roasted banana ice cream for cooler contrast.  with the bill arrived yet more sweets of a piece of incredibly rich truffle-like chocolate and not as sweet, chewy cashew caramel.  overall, an amazing meal.\n\nservice was very good, but not perfect.  the d\\u00e9cor is way modern.  i'm not sure i like the swivel chairs with mesh bottoms.  also i wore a super short skirt, so i felt a bit self-conscious.  not to mention the mirrors all around, although they let me see what was happening all around without having to swivel.  now i gotta go downgrade some of my other steakhouse reviews...", 
            "i think the hype for this restaurant dampened my experience. the interior was nice, very roomy, love the decor, simple yet classy. and the service was excellent, the server was very charming :-) so one star for that. they have a wide selection of wine and drinks. but for the price of over $100 a person, the <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> ($61) was a lil overcooked, and the <mark>Caramelized Onions</mark> contained too much honey, making it for a overpowering sweetened flavor. i ordered the true japanese wagyu beef from kagoshima ($160) and although i know that it is suppose to be so fatty and that's why people enjoy it, i personally felt that it was way too fatty towards the end, and couldn't finish it because it upset my stomach. i don't really know how anyone can finish a whole one to themselves. i guess it would've tasted better if it was shared where everyone takes only a bite or two . the lamb chop ($48) was waaaayyy too overcooked, but yet we saw many tables ordering it. although i don't particularly enjoy flan, everyone seemed to have thoroughly enjoyed the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan with mushroom marmalade and parseley salad. most of the sides with your entree is about $12-13 each side, the <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>, <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>, sweet <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>, french fries, <mark>Soft Polenta with Parmesan</mark>, creamed spinach with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>...etc were good but i felt that it was nothing special.   their garlic bread appetizer and tuna tartar was delicious but not worth $24 a plate. the shrimp  in the <mark>Maryland Blue Crab & Carolina Shrimp 'Louis' Cocktail</mark> was not fresh and i've had better garlic fries at gordan biersh.the one appetizer we ordered 3 plates of, one after another, because it was sooo amazing was the kobe steak sashimi (definitely worth $22 a plate, and i suggest this is a must try! but for those that don't like eating raw meat, trust... it'll change your whole view on it) - overall great experience, but i just feel that it is nothing special especially for how costly it is- and too much hype.", 
            "the first few times we came here, it was delicioso! my bf always gets the japanese wagyu and i get the filet because it's a little healthier for me. i looove the bread they bring out in the beginning, a walnut and focaccia bread. my bf loves the cheese bread balls. we usually get seconds on bread. they bring out the meat so you can see the different types of cut, this is the only restaurant i've seen do this. the ambiance and decor is very modern and trendy and the service is good. you share the sides, and we normally go with a large party so we are able to order mac/cheese (which is the favorite), <mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark>, mushrooms, and a bunch of others. my favorite appetizer is the <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark>. \n\nbe sure to look at the wine list because we ordered 2 $700 bottles of wine thinking they were the regular bottles and not a limited edition one. most of the desserts are fabulous. definitely a great steakhouse that offers kobe beef.", 
            "amazing meal and gorgeous restaurant. best we had all weekend in vegas. filet was awesome and so were the other dishes ordered in our party of 12. dover sole was unbelievable and so are all of the sides including melt in your mouth polenta and creamed spinach with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>. service was as wonderful as our food. pricey but worth every penny. for dessert get the baked alaska- it was to die for.", 
            "one call down to the concierge and i was able to snag a 5:30pm reservation to wolfgang's cut. we walked in and were promptly seated. once seated we were given menus and asked for our drinks.\n\nthe decor is very nice and simple, beautiful tables and swivel chairs!!! that's probably because after you're done eating, you just wanna turn to you're side and get up. while waiting for our waiter, we were offered a variety of things to munch on.\n\n1. parmesean bread sticks- great crisp texture and nice cheesy taste.\n2. some kind of deep fried cheese ball- also tasted good but we let them sit for a while so they were a little cold.\n\nwe got our water glasses filled and were offered the wine list. we picked out a 2000 bordeaux and proceeded to order our meal.\n\nwe decided on 2 appetizers and two sides. the appetizers were:\n\nkobe steak sashimi- wow, this was great. possibly the most tender and flavorful piece of beef i have ever eaten. the radish adds a great texture and went very well with the spicy saucy stuff at the bottom.\n\n<mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark>, wasabi aioli, ginger, togarashi crisps, tosa soy- this was good, the aioli was excellent and the togarashi chips were wonderful. overall a very successful appetizer.\n\nonce the appetizers were finished, the steaks came out. i go tthe bone in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> prepared rare. also with my steak, i got the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>!! i will tell you that it was one of the best cuts of meat i've ever eaten. it was cooked perfectly and had a great crust on it. the meat was very tender and well seasoned. the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> on top was a wonderful addition to my steak. eaten alone it was very fatty and rich, but eat it with a bite of the steak and it was heavenly. also, went very well with the bordeaux.\n\nonce the steaks were set down, our sides came out. we opted for:\n\ncreamed spinach with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>- best spinach i have ever eaten in my life. it was creamy with bits of egg white and egg yolk in it. they cook the egg over easy and break/mix the egg into the spinach table side! yummmmy!\n\n<mark>Soft Polenta with Parmesan</mark>- this was good but the spinach was so damn good, i didn't really pay much attention to it :d i just know it was good!\n\nvery nice place to eat if you like steak! i'll probably be back, maybe to the one in la.",

            "this place is what happens when god makes a steak house!!!  seriously, it's restaurants like these that keep me from turning vegetarian.  i went here as part of my boys bachelor party.  let me start with the dinning environment:  very clean with a slight industrial feel.  the swivel chairs were a very nice change from the clunky wooden chairs you see in most places.  it also helps to get my fat ass in and out of the table a lot easier.  trust me.... after this meal.. you kinda wanna roll back to your room for a cigarette.\n\nappetizers:  <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan, kobe sashimi, and <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>. \n all on point~!!!  the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan was so rich and buttery.  it literally makes your eyes roll back as you take a bite of it off the small crestini.  the kobe sashimi was fresh and light.  the beef was velvety dressed with only a little olive oil and capers.  this is a must try.  and then came the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>.  sweet.... savory... rich... flavorful.... wow....\n\nsides:  creamed spinach and roasted potatoes.   \nlet me preface by saying... i am not a fan of creamed spinach in any variation.  so to me, this dish was bound for failure.  the spinach was topped with a <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> that was mixed in table-side and served to us.  the rest of my table loved it.  i was not a big fan.  no slight to the chef... just personal preference.  it was good, but not my cup of tea.  the potatoes however were great!  roasted simply with some onions and garlic.  sometimes good technique and simplicity just win out.  and this side was a prime example of that.\n\nmain: american wagyu <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> steak\nif you go to a restaurant like this, you dont order the chicken.  you shell out the money and get the best that they offer.  the american wagyu choices were organic beef from idaho, i believe.  the moment my knife touched the soft medium rare beef, i was sure that my knife and fork were the luckiest utensils in the world.  they were the first to make love to that meat.  i have never in my life tasted beef of this magnitude.  the flavor was so unique and undoubtedly unforgettable.  the beef melted in my mouth as i could not believe something that was only rubbed in salt and pepper, had this much flavor.  like i said before, if you come here.  go for the american wagyu.  pricey?  yes.  absolutely worth it?  hell f***ing yes~!!!\n\nwine:  malbec.\nran the decision by the sommelier and she said that was a great choice.  great wine with the meal.  soft flavors, smooth finish, not too much bite.  the wine was a hit with the table.  but at this point.... everything was a hit from this place.  \n\ncongrats alex!  hope you enjoyed your last meal~!!!",

            "yes i'm a meat lover.  call me a caveman, i just love to eat a big juicy steak.   being in hawaii we are a little limited to steakhouses but i have been to most of them at least once.  morton's, hy's, dk's, ruth chris, and also other with steak like kincaids, shoreside grill, and even ruby tuesdays.  well, you get the jist.   i normally will opt for a <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> whenever possible and then maybe a ny or t-bone.  i like my meat to be juicy and have some fat so i normally don't get a filet.\n\nbeing we were heading out for vegas i wanted to have a date night with my wife and get a good steak.  i asked my friend, who is a seasoned chef.  he lived and worked in vegas for some years after grad-ing from the cia and working at the greenbrier among many other accomplishments both abroad and at home.  i figured he'd be the best person to ask for an honest opinion.  he recommended a few places we could try but said if given the choice we should go to cut.  that sealed it, cut it was.  i checked open table to see if i needed to book way ahead but it seemed like we should be fine booking a day in advanced.  great considering we hardly know where we will be in vegas day to day and hour to hour.  once we were out there and could plan our schedule, we were able to lock down a reservation that would work for us.\n\nwe headed out a little early not know how long it would take me to find the parking garage and not know how far we would have to walk to get from the parking to the restaurant.  cut is in the palazzo hotel.  parking was a breeze.  they had a guard asking where you were going so i guess maybe they restrict the parking to guest and customers.  we found a parking pretty close to the elevators which is amazing for a vegas casino.  needless to say we had some time to explore before going to the restaurant.\n\nwe had a reservation at 9 and got there about 10 minutes early.  they were pretty packed.  they didn't have a regular table open yet but did offer us a table off to the side in the lounge area.  we decided to wait for a regular table, not wanting to miss out on the whole steakhouse experience.  we did go to the bar to kill our 10 minutes.  one think that irritated me at the bar was when i asked the bartender what kind of beer they had he immediately stated that they don't carry anything domestic like bud light or coors.  did i f**king say that's what i wanted??  all he had to do was provide me their drink menu, which is on an ipad for customer use.  snooty bartender,  he should be happy i payed for those drinks with my total bill and didn't have to tip him separate.\n\nonce seated we had the best service.  our waiter was chip and from what we saw, he was probably the head waiter as he was directing most of the other workers as he did his job.  he was very knowledgeable about their menu offerings and offered in-depth descriptions about everything they served.\n\nthe menu was a head turner.  they had so many things that sounded delicious.  one of those places you wished you were with a large party so you could sample more.  we decided on the <mark>Warm Asparagus</mark>, poached <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>, warm bacon vinaigrette on a focaccia bread as our appetizer.  along with that we also got  to pick from their selection of homemade breads and also got a couple or long parmesan coated breadsticks and butter puffs, or something like that.\n\nfor the main dish my wife got the indian spiced kobe beef shortribs which they slow cook for 8 hours.  they were very succulent and rich.  they had a distinct indian flavor but not too overpowering.  it was also not very spicy at all.  the meat was so tender it was almost falling off the bone.  it was actually too much for my wife to finish.\n\nafter chip had explained the different lines of meats they carried i was sure i would need to get their sampler to get the best taste of what they had to offer.  i got their \"tasting of <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark> sampler\".  it came with a 4oz of snake river farms american \"kobe\" style beef, 4oz usda prime 35 day aged, and a 2oz of blackmore ranch australian wagyu.  it also came with a medley of different sauces and spices i could add to it.  none of which i needed to use.  they season their steaks with sea salt and black pepper.  it was seasoned perfectly so that the saltiness and pepper was not too overpowering and let the flavor of the beef shine through.  it tasted amazing.  and to be able to taste these 3 different lines of beef side by side really made it easy to see and taste the difference in quality.  all being top notch but clearly easy to rank.  might make me come back for more australian wagyu on a future trip.  we also got a side of their mac and cheese that was suggested by the waiter.  talk about rich and creamy, definitely a grown up mac and cheese.\n\nif you ever are in vegas and in search of a great steakhouse.  make sure to put cut on the shortlist.  you definitely won't be disappointed.  happy eats!", 
            "so the bf was in vegas for the first time for his birthday and he picked cut as his expensive steakhouse dinner.  we were not disappointed.  wolfgang puck figured it out with this place.\n\nfirst off, love the atmosphere in here.  clean lines, dark but not too dark lighting, and they had some good tunes going.  mostly classic rock but interspersed with a few more recent rock songs.  i was glad it wasn't boom boom boom techno for once.\n\nwe were immediately seated when we arrived and things started happing in rapid fire succession.  bread was brought to the table.  the waiter took drink orders, recommended wine, and went through the menu.  someone else brought an amuse bouche.  it was a bit overwhelming overload there for a bit but all for a good cause - to get us food and booze!\n\nwe started with the bread.  there were some crispy bread pieces covered in cheese, maybe parmesan?  it was so good we ate all of it.  then we started with the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> with asian spices, sesame orange dressing, and apple compote.  4 pieces of decadent, amazing <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> perfectly offset with sweetness from the apple.  we loved this.  we also tried the shrimp and crab (or was it lobster) cocktail which had a creamy sauce holding it all together.  i'm not much for creamy sauces so that's a personal preference, but it was still very good.\n\nso they bring out the steak cuts and show them to you and explain the differences.  i had already decided in my head on one thing but after hearing about the wagyu steaks from the usa and australia there was only one way to go: the tasting that included 4 oz usda prime aged 35 days steak, 4 oz american wagyu \"kobe style\", and 2 oz australian wagyu.  i just couldn't resist trying each of them against the other and deciding if they were really all that.  we ordered them up medium rare with sides of parmesan polenta and creamed spinach with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>.  the tasting came with sauces for each steak.\nusda prime aged 35 days: really good steak but harder to cut because of the marbling.  i didn't eat all of this one because i wanted to focus on the other 2 cuts.\namerican wagyu: at first, this one was my favorite.  it was buttery smooth with a great flavor.\naustralian wagyu: this one was even more rich and buttery in flavor and soon became my absolute favorite of the three.  i finished all of it.  probably the best steak i have ever had in my life ever...including at my favorite steakhouse in dallas.  next time i believe i'll just fork out the cash for this cut alone.\ncreamed spinach: good, <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> made it different than the usual, but just good, not mind blowing.\npolenta: perfectly cooked, cheesy, great side for the steaks.\n\nfor dessert the bf ordered some sort of table side crumble that came with market fresh peaches and blackberries in it  i don't know what it was called but all i know is that i have never had fruit that fresh and sweet and delicious.  not a single blackberry was sour, the peaches tasted like they came straight off the tree.  it was an amazing dessert.  they also sent out a baked alaska for the bf's b-day gratis and it said \"happy birthday\" written in chocolate on the plate.  fun.\n\nthe price is commensurate with the quality food you are getting which means this shit isn't cheap.  but it is worth it.  i left here stuffed and happy and pleased that the $$$ spent matched the enjoyment had.  give this steak a try, you will not be disappointed.", 
            "i don't even know where to start, other than to say this place was fantastic.\n\nappetizer - steak tartare.  it was fantastic!  also tried the <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark>, which was very very good.\n\ndinner - snake river farms <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> - medium (recommended over med rare by server due to marbling).  #1 steak in my life - no lie.  i tried the armagnac sauce on the side, but just go straight meat.  don't dress it up at all.\n\nsides - mac and cheese, which is their signature - it was very good, but very rich.  <mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark> was great.  also had the potato mash, which was very very good.\n\ndesert - their baked alaska, which was great.\n\ni tried a couple of bottles of my favorite - tignanello.\n\noverall this place is a grip of cash - but if you have a special occasion and want a treat - go here.", 
            "what we ordered: \n1. kobe steak <mark>American Wagyu Beef Sashimi, Spicy Radishes</mark> - amazing dish, the highlight of the dinner! the meat was so buttery and the delicate asian flavors of the sauce was a perfect pairing.\n \n2. <mark><mark>Bone Marrow</mark> Flan, Mushroom Marmalade, Parsley Salad</mark> - very good but did not have that intense marrow flavor that i like. i also did not like the accompanying <mark><mark>Bone Marrow</mark> Flan, Mushroom Marmalade, Parsley Salad</mark> as it overpowered the flan. however when eaten by itself the parsley was a good palate cleanser. \n\n3. <mark>Warm Asparagus</mark>, poached <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>, warm bacon vinaigrette - nice salad very good flavor. hard to mess up a dish with those ingredients.\n\n4. nebraska corn fed <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> - not a very thick steak, which i always prefer. the crust was overpowering due to the amount of char. way too much char in my opinion.\n\n5. true japanese 100% wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> - thicker than the nebraska <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> but served in two pieces which i thought was odd. the meat was heavily marbled and very tender. the wagyu steak did not have a very meaty flavor, more relaxed and clean. again though, the charing on the crust proved too much. \n\n6. <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> - very good, recommended. creamy and buttery. \n\nthe service was excellent and the ambiance is very nice. we had a very large and comfortable booth. our sever was very professional and his support staff was very attentive. overall, a good experience but the prices are very high, be prepared to spend. the steaks were too heavily charred for me. almost ruined the high quality meat imho.", 
            "overrated. \n\ni think i ordered the wrong steak but at $60 a steak, i still expected a good steak. \n\ni read the reviews and i still ordered the bone in since bone in has such good flavor. yes, i understand it wouldn't be the most tender cut of meat, but it was chewy. i have had much better steaks in texas (also corn fed like they highly describe on their menu and by the waiter) than at cut. \n\nthe rest - the sides were ok. i really enjoyed the mac and cheese that gets prepped (stirred) at the table as well as the <mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark>. but the other sides were just ok. \n\nwine/drink: they had a drink menu on an ipad and yes that's impressive but when it's a group of seven (mostly guys - i was the lone girl) it might be smart to give us more than one unit. \n\nthe cheesy bread was amazing - that's the only reason this place got two stars. \n\nservice was great - but expected at a place of this size. \n\nall said and done, i paid two hundred dollars for my meal of a bad steak and ok mac and cheese. \n\nwill not come again.", 
            "i had dinner here last weekend. \n\nfirst of all, the service here is amazing. we actually couldn't get reservations for the main dining room-last minute decision to go-but we were able to get a reservation for the bar. didn't even feel like we were at the bar-our server was so awesome. \n\nwe started with the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan. oh my gawd. must try!! it was so good!!! presentation was beautiful, too. it came with slices of brioche so you could smear the delectable <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> on it. the brioche looked like small triangles of wonder bread, but definitely did not taste like cheap wonder bread. i'm sure a stick of butter was used on each slice, but it was delish! the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>-delish!! \n\nthen we had the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>. sweet and smoky. very tender. another must try! \n\nthen for our main entree, my friend and i both got the tasting of <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark>. the usda prime was very tender and delish. the japanese wagyu-amaziing. so tender. melted in my mouth. but i've never had it before, so i might sound a little over zealous. but seriously, amazing. too bad the tasting only comes with 2 ounces of it. the american wagyu. meh. i didn't even finish it. i prob should've ate it first, not last. haha. the japanese wagyu put it to shame. we also ordered the creamed spinach with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>. yumm. great complement. \n\noverall, great experience. but if i come back, i'll have to save up and get a normal size portion of the japanese wagyu. mmmmmm. so good!", 
            "great food and service! we had the waygu filet which was delicious and melted in our mouths! we could cut the steak with just a fork! we also tried the ny strip! super juicy and seasoned just perfect. i added the <mark>Caramelized Onions</mark> and they were absolutely delicious! the mac and cheese that is made with four different cheeses was just to die for! it was so creamy and all the different types of cheeses made it taste so good! the other side we got was the creamed spinach. i liked it but probably would not order it again. it was very good but not as creamy and thick as i would of liked it. i like that they put the <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> on top thought that was going to be good, but i would of preferred to have taken it off. they stirred the <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> in, which added crunchy edge and i would of rather of kept that soft creamy taste throughout! \noverall amazing experience and service was impeccable! a must try in vegas!",

            "i came here with my colleagues for a celebration dinner and we all truly loved the meal. cut includes great little touches such as amazing pretzel bread and tasty parmesan cheese sticks before the meal and warm cookies served after dessert. the wine and champagne were delicious and the service was impeccable, but the food really stole the show! \n\ni had the burrata appetizer and it was melt-in-your-mouth creamy and delicious; a fantastic combination of flavors. i also ate about five of the pretzel rolls, which i started to regret once the entrees and sides rolled out. but they were really delicious so i didn't regret it thatttt much.  \n\nfor my meal i ordered the japanese wagyu <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> cut and as the waiters described it was incredibly tender. it does melt in your mouth but i found that sensation was mostly because the meat has so much marbling. i actually preferred my colleague's wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> because it was less fatty. \n\nwe ordered the following sides:\n--creamed spinach with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>- creamed spinach is my go-to steak side dish and this one did not disappoint\n--cavatappi pasta mac & cheese- easily some of the best mac and cheese i've ever tasted\n--<mark>Soft Polenta with Parmesan</mark>- good but not the best\n\nand desserts, all of which were fantastic:\n--creamsicle baked alaska\n--fuji apple & medjool date crumble\n--valrhona chocolate souffl\\u00e9\n--banana cream pie\n\noverall i'd highly recommend cut for a special night out on the town.",

            "six months ago, i proclaimed del frisco's as the best steakhouse in las vegas. that may very well still hold true; however, the best steak goes to cut. hey, there's precedence of the mvp going to the losing team: jerry west in 1969 in the nba finals, chuck howley in 1971 in super bowl v (and now cut).\n\nthe steak here is unlike any i've tried. it is a triple-threat, five-tool star player as they would say in the sports world. while there were several cuts, ages, and locations to choose from, i went with one of their more popular ones, the 14 oz ny sirloin aged 35 days from nebraska. the aspect that makes this steak so magical is the crust. oh, my god, dat crust! it was so crispy and charred on the outside with great seasonings while maintaining the perfect medium-rare on the inside. you can have additional sauces and toppings, but plain is all you need for flavor. \n\nservice was excellent as would be expected from a wolfgang puck restaurant. we added on a couple of classic steak sides including the creamed spinach with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> and <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> to round out our meal. the addition of the <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> was a nice touch to an already delicious side dish. bonus points for the complimentary puff pastry and small bite desserts to end our meal. i've been wanting to try this steakhouse for a couple of years now, but reservations were tough to come by, but we finally managed to snag one this friday at 10:30 pm so book them early.", 
            "you can pretty much assume that every las vegas casino has a steakhouse inside. when choosing an appropriate steakhouse for our bachelor party dinner, cut was the place to go because it has everything you want in a first class restaurant. they start you off with five types of complimentary bread (my favorite was the bread sticks). i ordered the 12 oz <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> medium rare...i couldn't find anything wrong with it except that it was one of the best steaks i've ever had. we split a bunch of sides including the <mark>Hand Cut French Fries with Herbs</mark>, <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>, and creamed spinach with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>. the creamed spinach was arguably the highlight of the meal!\n\nwhether it's the sexy ambiance, impeccable service, or perfectly cooked steak, cut is sure to be in the discussion for best steakhouses in vegas. the venetian/palazzo is my favorite resort to stay at in vegas, and if i'm not feeling adventurous for food one night, i know i'll always have a perfect meal waiting at cut."

            "seriously too bad that bf and i both felt nauseous at dinner but the things we did taste were delish!  every freakin person here is so darn nice and friendly - and considering how trendy this place is i was kind of expecting snooty service.  the food was really good - <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, oxtail bouillon, bone-in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>, cream of <mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark> and the handcut fries.  the oxtail bouilon was the standout dish for me...there were bits of <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> floating around!  and the bar menu looks tasty too, hopefully i win lots of money in vegas next time and can give this place another go!", 
            "i made my bf make a reservation about a month before our trip to vegas.  we studied the menu quite awhile beforehand.  it's important to carefully consider what to eat if you're going to spend a few benjamins!  we started with the maryland blue crab and <mark>Pan Roasted Stonington Maine Lobster</mark> \"louis\" cocktail.  this was surprisingly fresh.  you can taste each of the crab or lobster when separating them into their own bite, but taking in a little bit of seafood, avocado, microgreens and tomato - everything just melds together.  i would have never guessed that the extra creamy bottom layer was panna cotta.  i wasn't into the ultra thin parmesan breadsticks or gougers (too much cheese), but was a bit more enticed by the bread selection.  i choose the onion focaccia, which was a bit salty and super soft, but the onions were sweetly caramelized.  i stay away from pretzels in general, but tried a bite of my bf's roll - best pretzel ever.  also there's no salt on it.  the menu online offered a bone in filet, but was not currently on the menu.  after having more than a few prime filets in the past couple years, i decided to take it to the next level with an american wagyu filet and topped it off with <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark>.  absolutely the most tender meat that has ever melted in my mouth to date.  my bf had the dry aged <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> topped with <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>.  the marrow pieces had a fascinating shape and texture, looking like gnocchi but bursting like gelatinous blobs.  we shared the creamed spinach with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>.  the egg adds quite a bit of extra richness.  splitting the appetizer and sharing one side gave us just enough room for dessert.  the carmelized banana cream pie with valrhona pearls was a delight.  the pearls were like little crunches with a layer inside the slice and scattered on the plate.  there was also a scoop of roasted banana ice cream for cooler contrast.  with the bill arrived yet more sweets of a piece of incredibly rich truffle-like chocolate and not as sweet, chewy cashew caramel.  overall, an amazing meal.\n\nservice was very good, but not perfect.  the d\\u00e9cor is way modern.  i'm not sure i like the swivel chairs with mesh bottoms.  also i wore a super short skirt, so i felt a bit self-conscious.  not to mention the mirrors all around, although they let me see what was happening all around without having to swivel.  now i gotta go downgrade some of my other steakhouse reviews...", 
            "this is my 4th visit to cut . in the past, i have not had the best experiences at cut yet the valued opinions of several people on yelp and chowhound keep me coming back to this place to give chef puck's people another chance. \n\nlast night some friends from the good 'ol days were in town and invited me out for drinks ( can't even count how many times they've been in town in the past and we were unable to meet-up ) - finally, and luckily, we were able to hook-up. after several drinks and lively conversation going down memory lane, it was time to absorb the large quantities of alcohol we consumed with some serious eats. \n\nwe first walked to delmonico's - booked solid ( good ! ) then to cut - a 15 minute wait. a nice cocktail at the bar ( further inebriation ) and whisked off to the dining room. \n\ni'll limit my review to what i ate ( with one exception ) \n\nstarted with the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan with the mushroom marmalade and <mark><mark>Bone Marrow</mark> Flan, Mushroom Marmalade, Parsley Salad</mark> - damn ! and i mean damn - that was good ! very minor issue - no <mark><mark>Bone Marrow</mark> Flan, Mushroom Marmalade, Parsley Salad</mark> - who cares ! \n\ni had the sirloin three ways - basically american, american kobe and japanese wagyu - perfectly cooked, great flavor, we all agreed, surprisingly, that the american kobe had the best flavor. \n\nhad sides of mushrooms, asparagus and the mac n cheese. the fav - the m&c - of what little i had of it since one of my fellow diners held on to the serving spoon for dear life and used it to shovel the m&c into her piehole ! \n\nthe only comment on one of my dining mates main entree - the short ribs - slow cooked for a million hours with pumpkin curry, blah blah blah - the curry was too strong, also too sweet. funny thing is, the dish reminded me of my mom's home-cooked saurbraten ( given chef puck's lineage is this coincidence ? or was i too drunk to know any better ! ) \n\noverall, i was very pleased with the meal but damn it ! i felt bad because my friends flipped the bill - as we all know this place ain't cheap ! they kindly insisted given my past generosity to them when we first became friends - i was very flattered by this - it's nice to know i had a positive impact on the lives of others ! \n\nhappy eating !", 
            "i had dinner at cut last thursday (3/19/09) and was fully satisfied with my meal and more.  decor wise, it has a modern feel with metaillic colors everywhere.  we were nicely greated by the hostess and waiters the entire night.  \n\nfor appetizers, my party of 6 had two orders of <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> and asparagus.  the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> was nice and crispy on the outside and buttery fat on the inside.  well done.  the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> was creamy and delicious and worth trying if you haven't done so already.\n\nfor entrees, we all had different steaks but i'm going to save you some time and say that they're all pretty ridiculously good.  i've eaten at peter luger's in brooklyn several times so its hard to top their steaks but the steaks at cut are pretty close.  \n\noverall - you're going to pay an arm and leg for your meal but my meal was worth every penny.", 
            "i think the hype for this restaurant dampened my experience. the interior was nice, very roomy, love the decor, simple yet classy. and the service was excellent, the server was very charming :-) so one star for that. they have a wide selection of wine and drinks. but for the price of over $100 a person, the <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> ($61) was a lil overcooked, and the <mark>Caramelized Onions</mark> contained too much honey, making it for a overpowering sweetened flavor. i ordered the true japanese wagyu beef from kagoshima ($160) and although i know that it is suppose to be so fatty and that's why people enjoy it, i personally felt that it was way too fatty towards the end, and couldn't finish it because it upset my stomach. i don't really know how anyone can finish a whole one to themselves. i guess it would've tasted better if it was shared where everyone takes only a bite or two . the lamb chop ($48) was waaaayyy too overcooked, but yet we saw many tables ordering it. although i don't particularly enjoy flan, everyone seemed to have thoroughly enjoyed the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan with mushroom marmalade and parseley salad. most of the sides with your entree is about $12-13 each side, the <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>, <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>, sweet <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>, french fries, <mark>Soft Polenta with Parmesan</mark>, creamed spinach with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>...etc were good but i felt that it was nothing special.   their garlic bread appetizer and tuna tartar was delicious but not worth $24 a plate. the shrimp  in the <mark>Maryland Blue Crab & Carolina Shrimp 'Louis' Cocktail</mark> was not fresh and i've had better garlic fries at gordan biersh.the one appetizer we ordered 3 plates of, one after another, because it was sooo amazing was the kobe steak sashimi (definitely worth $22 a plate, and i suggest this is a must try! but for those that don't like eating raw meat, trust... it'll change your whole view on it) - overall great experience, but i just feel that it is nothing special especially for how costly it is- and too much hype.", 
            "i love cut!!!! this was my second visit to cut and i fell in love all over again. its pricey but since the first time was so goood, i had to come again and make sure i wasn't dreaming before... here's why cut's sooo great:\n\nservice:  the waiters and waitresses go above and beyond to make sure their guests have a wonderful experience. they're attentive and came right over when they felt like we wanted/needed something. my friend and i ordered a bottle of riesling and loved it. unfortunately, we forgot to get the winery it was from and decided to ask the waiter. he wasted no time to find the name for us and came back with all the information we would need in a fancy little envelope. the little things people do always make a big difference. \n\nfood: the bread is delicious!! there's a man that comes around with a platter of different types of breads you can try. i've tried all of them and my faves are the onion bread and the pretzel. so good. we got two appetizers, <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> and kobe sliders. the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> was pretty good, it was very creamy and topped with a sauce that added some saltiness to the dish. the kobe sliders were topped with sweet pickles and sauteed onions. the meat was soft (of course). for the main dishes, my friend ordered a 20 oz. usda bone-in rib-eye with <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>. it was huge!!!! it was cooked perfectly to his liking. my other friend ordered kobe spare ribs. she said that the meat was nice and soft too, but the flavoring wasn't her style. i got the japanese kobe wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> with <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>. omg. like butter, probably because there was fat throughout the meat. it was soft, very, very, very soft. i mean, i knew that japanese wagyu meat was soft, but this practically melted in my mouth. i'm still contemplated whether it was a bit too soft... haha. i dunno. the first time i came i had the american kobe <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> and i might like that one more just because i don't feel like i'm eating butter... :)\n\nanyway, cut is amazing. i have vowed to come back once a year, as long as i'm not broke, of course.",

            "if someone else is buying, i'd go back here happily. the detractors were fairly few, but i'll call them out right here.  1, the wine list, though fairly extensive, had unreasonable pricing on the lower end bottles.  i understand the mark-up system, but there should be a more reasonable option for those who need it.  2, the cheese plate was not good.  it was not balanced, and just needed a little fixer to be right.\n\nthe bad news out of the way, it was a tasty place to dine when you're craving red meat.  i had the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan appetizer, which was rich, buttery and flavorful.  the presentation was also very nice.  my main was the indian spiced short ribs. i had a major mental disconnect on this. beef and indian spices?  seriously, isn't shiva going to rain fire down for this?  well, if she does, it would be a pity, as the flavors were wonderful. the texture was perfect.  i also tried the lamb chops which were juicy, flavorful, etc.  another person at my table had the <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark>, and it was also excellent. it had a good char, deep flavor, and was properly cooked. the other people at the table i was at actually requested to have their meat fired again, as their definition of steakhouse medium was actually a proper steakhouse medium well, but i wouldn't fault the restaurant for their preference for meat, which in my opinion is over cooked.  the restaurant was very accomodating to their needs, and provided excellent service.",

            "i was really excited to try this place as i had heard a lot of great things about it.  i went with a group of nine hungry people and tasted the following items on the menu:\n\n- <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan\n- bite of the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> dumpling in ox tail bouillon\n- kobe <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> w/<mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> on the side\n- mac n cheese\n- <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>\n- creamed spinach\n- saut\\u00e9ed spinach\n- caramelized corn\n\nunfortunately i was less then impressed.  the place was swanky as expected and the service was right on point (except one huge thing that happened which i'll mention in a bit) but the food was sub par.  i liked the decor but the only thing was that it was difficult to get into and out of the seats as the chairs were heavy and hard to maneuver around...not a big deal though.  i was most disappointed by the food and service.  let's say i wouldn't recommend this restaurant out of all of the other restaurants on the strip.  \n\nthey first served three or four different types of breads while waiting for our appetizers.  i tried their pretzel and onion bread which was so delicious and warm.  i started off with the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan served with toasted bread which was tasty.  i also had a bite of the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> dumpling which was good too.  then the steaks came out and it was a disaster!  one of the most important things about the preparation of any type of meat is temperature, as we all know, especially at a steakhouse and let me tell you, it was a complete wreck.  i had ordered a medium-rare steak and it literally came out medium-well while my friends who ordered medium steaks came out borderline rare.  after trying to suck it up and eat my well-done steak, my friends told me i should really tell the server.  i finally got myself to tell him (i don't ever send food back to the kitchen...i feel so bad) but he told me that my steak was medium-rare like i didn't know what i was talking about.  it was pretty ridiculous because it was no joke, wayyy overdone.  i didn't push it and ended up trading steaks with my friend who ordered a medium and got a borderline rare steak.  on top of that, i didn't think the steak was flavorful enough and there was nothing special about their <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark>...to me it was like bbq sauce.  with that said, i would like to note that other than the steak incident which was terribly handled, the service was great.\n\nas for the sides, their mac n cheese, creamed spinach and corn were very tasty while the <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark> were not so great (but then again they're just <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>) and sauteed spinach was bland.\n\ni would like to mention that a lot of people did enjoy their food so it may have just been the temperature of my steak and how they were unwilling to do anything about it when it was obviously well overdone but come on, we're at a steakhouse right?!?!  and honestly, i've tasted way better steak...i really wanted to like this restaurant but it failed in my books.", 
            "okay. i consider myself a lover of all food, someone who has had a taste of everything here and there. and while i think that i've had the best of the best, and the worst of the worst, i must say that after all my years on this earth i feel like i have wasted them all until i ate at cut. \n\ni'm exaggerating, yes. but you know what? one bite of a steak at cut tasted like heaven. here i was, lalala-ing about how i've had so much good food in my life, and then one bite of a petit (haha) ny strip steak made me want to jump out of my seat and sing from the rooftops and fields in europe. laaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!\n\ni guess i've been selling myself short... i've never had a dry aged steak before. i never thought steak would taste so good, let alone without soy sauce (filipino thing). it was grilled on some wood grill and then fired in a billion degree oven with all these spices. ahh, yes. and the peppercorn sauce that i got along with it? delightful. heaven in my mouth. the side dishes: fingerling potatoes with bacon confit and caramelized <mark>Fingerling Potatoes, Smokey Bacon, Pearl Onions</mark>, mac n cheese, sauteed spinach, creamed spinach... all very good too. my cousin and i indulged in that yummy <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan... all delightfully good. the side dishes may not have been a good idea, as it was a struggle to even finish my steak. but i finished it. if my steak was $55 dollars, all of it better be in my stomach by the end of the night.\n\ni don't exaggerate the greatness of cut... the next night i found myself at a restaurant back home in sf and i pretty much ordered the same thing: steak, sides, etc. once i took a bite and swallowed that piece of meat, i sighed. cut basically ruined steak for me. not that the steak that i was having at the time wasn't good, it's just that it didn't have the same juiciness and tenderness of the previous steak. it made me question my eating habits, the way i choose my food, the way i live my life. ugh, it was so delicious. i need to come back here.",

            "first day in vegas and we marched to dinner  completely tipsy.  my friend and i walked our drunk asses in stilletos  from paris and all the way to palazzo. its still a blur how we managed that journey but dinner itself was unforgettable.\n\ni booked a 6:30pm reservation that morning and was seated promptly when we arrived. suzie and i both sat in our cozy booth and selected 3 appetizers, a steak and a dessert. \n\nfood:\n<mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan, mushroom marmalade, parsley sala: our favorite! delicious, creamy and full of flavor. absolutely divine!\n\n<mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, asian spices, sesame-orange dressing, dancing demon plum compote: mmmm mmmm finger licking good! it was delicious and the meat was mouth watering and moist.\n\n<mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark>, wasabi aioli, ginger, togarashi crisps, tosa soy: delish!  it was refreshing, lightly crispy and a great balance to our other two, heavier appetizers. i love wasabi aioli!\n\nu.s.d.a. prime, illinois corn fed, aged 21 days\n<mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark> 20 oz* - one of the best steaks i had and it wasnt even wagyu. as usual i love my steaks rare and it was perfectly, juicy and like butter when it hit the knife. i'm still dreaming about it right now. \n\nraspberry stuffed doughnuts, dark chocolate sabayon, raspberry stracciatella- nothing special. wish i ordered something else. it was a bit plain for my taste and i'm a sucker for donuts.\n\nservice: \nwe had excellent customer service and our waiter was professional, personable and an overall very chill guy. none of that prententious bs. \n\n \nin conclusion, everything but the dessert we selected was delicious. i will definitely make an effort to come here every time i visit vegas. im coming back for the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> and steak!",

            "two years and 15 more visits since my last review proves in my mind that cut is the pantheon of steak.  \n\nthe kobe steak sashimi with spicy radish garnish is a perfect way to sample the high quality of the beef.  the fat literally melts in your mouth.  their take on a steak tartare with herb aioli is equally good.  a modern redo of a classic.  finally, the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan is to die for.  (i really like the <mark>Warm Veal Tongue</mark> but don't want animal activist to think i'm heartless).\n\nnow the beef.  this is a true steak lovers paradise.  all of the steaks are beautifully aged, trimmed.  all are prime and above.  all steaks are at least partially grilled over charcoal for the perfect bitterness.  the steaks:\n\n-  illinois corn fed aged 21 days - good beef flavor.  bone in cuts are better.\n\n- nebraska corn fed 35 days - deep beef flavor. very nutty.  strong umame.  not for everyone but outstanding if you like very good aged beef.  the <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> is the top pick.\n\n-  american wagyu - truly outstanding.  tender and buttery.  the cuts are small but with the incredible richness, more than enough food.  do not order this beyond medium rare or it dries up and is a waste.  the <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> is the most flavorful cut.\n\n- australian wagyu - wow. nuff said.\n\nfirst time visitors should try the tasting of <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark>.  it offers an outstanding selection and gives the opportunity to try different super grades of beef.\n\nfinally, the braised short ribs deserve special mention.  if you want something different, this is it.  it is indian spiced so a bit different but absolutely fall of the bone tender.\n\ni have never tried their sauces, toppings, or sides.  naked steaks are best to me.\n\nthe wine list remains extensive.  prices are good.\n\nto those wanting the absolute best in beef, cut is without a doubt it.",

            "one of my most memorable meals in recent  memory. the strip is littered with a bunch of restaurants, respectively owned by their own celebrity chef. with so many great dining choices, how does one go about choosing a place to satiate their appetite as well as tantalize their tastebuds??? being that i was in vegas for my bachelor party, i didn't find this dilemma too challenging. i figured...i'm with the guys so let's do steak and martinis. with my objective in mind...i set out to find a steakhouse worthy of our patronage. after considering such places as craftsteak, n9ne, and delmonicos...cut was the restaurant that won me over. such decadent offerings as the braised <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> and <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan is what ultimately lured me here. \n\nwe missed our 7pm reservation because we missed our flight out of sfo. we arrived in vegas a little past 7 and considering it was a thursday, i figured that it might be slow enough for them to squeeze us in on a later reservation. so i call the restaurant and they are able to accommodate us with a 9:30 reservation. my first impression was \"awesome!,\" because i was so looking forward to eating here and would have been been a major let down if i wasn't able to. given that this place closes at 10:00, i was worried that we would be rushed through our meal and quickly ushered out of the resturant, and that the whole experience would be ruined because of it. much to my pleasant suprise, it was quite the contrary.\n\nservice was stellar from beginning to end. what we had to eat...\n\nappetizers: \nbraised <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> - this was delicious and wonderfully fatty without being overwhelming\n\nentree:\n14oz aged <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> with <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> topping - one of the best steaks i've ever had. seared perfectly on the outside with a light char and a juicy pink medium center. there is a generous amount of <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> and it is rich, fatty, and flavorful. each bite of my steak would be accompanied by a piece of marrow. i found this delectable and euphoric at first, but after awhile it did get a little too rich for me. i still loved it however, and highly recommend it.\n\ncut was my first experience in vegas of fine dining and with the number of high class restaurants, each with their own prospective celebrity chefs, my expectations were high and i'm glad that cut did not disappoint. food, ambience, and service were all meshed seamlessly. \n\ni'll be back most definitely.",

            "we came here in a group of 5 for my boyfriend's birthday dinner.  the cocktail menu was featured on an ipad, which was a very cool concept.  i ordered the \"lots of love\" cocktail, which was a good mix of sweet and sour.  we ordered the american wagyu porterhouse for two ($190) with <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> and <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>.  as for sides, we ordered the <mark>Hand Cut French Fries with Herbs</mark>, creamed spinach, and the mac and cheese.  the house bread served at the beginning is delicious, especially the pretzel bread with the butter.\n\nwe were told it would be 15-20 minutes for our steaks to arrive, but it took about 45+ minutes.  the servers cut the steaks for us, and even served our sides to us.  i must have had really high expectations because i thought the steak was only mediocre.  the sides, especially the mac and cheese and <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark>, were excellent though.\n\noverall, i thought cut was just another average steakhouse.  there was nothing really \"special\" that stood out from it.  i've experienced better at stk and sw in vegas.  although the service was consistent, (they constantly picked up our plates and refilled our waters) minus waiting longer than told for our food, i'd definitely look into other options next time i'm in vegas.", 
            "came here with the bf on the friday of memorial day weekend.  we made reservations for about 10:30pm and the place still had a nice number of people inside but it wasn't crowded at all.\n\nmy feedback is as follows:\n\nservice = service was impeccable and lived up to what you expect giving the reputation of the restaurants.  our waiter did an excellent job explaining the different cuts of meat.  our water glasses were never empty and the table was always kept clean.  i got a kick out of the ipad menu and ended up playing it with it more than i needed to. \n\nfood taste/quality = everything was so delicious!  we ordered:\n\n- <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>\n- <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan\n- bone-in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> w/extra marrow on top\n- miso glazed salmon\n- creamed spinach w/egg (a little too watery)\n- crown & coke\n- lots of love martini \n- kettle one tonic\n\ntotal with tip = $240.00\n\nthe only complaint that we had about the food was that when we added the additional marrow to the steak, it was too heavy due to the fatty content and texture.  after a few bites, we almost needed to scrape the rest off to work on the steak.\n\nall-in-all, the place lived up to the expectations.  i have had my fair share of experiences at steakhouses.  while this wasn't the absolute best, it was still very good.", 
            "why i like cut!\n\nwe went there last night for dinner to celebrate our friends birthday and i wanted to try a new experience that was well recommended!  cut fit the bill!\n\n1.  service - 5 star.  very proactive, a whole team to help you, support you and to give you suggestions. very knowledgeable and helpful when you cannot pick that right cut of meat.\n\n2.  bread and water - nah, you are not in prison.  but the bread they come out with is really great and of course you have your choice of ice water (tap water) or bottled.  we're local so we stayed with the ice water.  but, the bread is really great. what was it, not sure... yet, i give it 5 stars.\n\n3.  the food - \n\n<mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan and steak tartare - ok, we were being a bit risky with these two and they were simply awesome. the flan was moist nuggets of marrow that you put onto thin pieces of toasted bread.  the steak tartare was so delicious. 5 stars\n\nkobe beef short ribs - great flavor, not so great texture. i actually thought the indian spices on this were a good mix, and i like indian spices.  however, the texture of the meat was more crock pot vs. slow braised.  meah, i have to give this two star.\n\nbone in <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> - now, how many times can you say you had a bone in filet?  sure for a <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> or other cuts, yet i never had it in a filet. our friends had this and i have to say, that this is 4 star for sure. \n\nthe ambiance here is very nice, elegant, yet comfortable. you do feel that you are seated in an open area due to the seating arrangements, so it seems less intimate, however, the lighting and all makes it just right.  the place is a bit noisy due to the loud music that they pipe in, otherwise, nice. 4 start here.\n\nprice wise, the place is typical of a strip steak place, expensive.  worth it overall.", 
            "continuing my steakhouse journey through las vegas, cut was next on the list.\n\noverall, i enjoyed the experience.  everything from the drinks to the service was all top notch.  there was one minor annoyance i'll get to later.\n\ndrinks:\nfantastic cocktails.  expensive? yes.  delicious? yes!\ni had the pepino's revenge which was patron silver, cucumber, basil, and lime juice.  the samurai sword was yamazaki 12, cointreau, honey simple syrup, and ginger.  both were wonderful.\n\nappetizer:\ni started with the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan on the recommendation from the server.  it was very tasty.  i also had a bite of the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> that was pretty good as well.\n\nentree:\nbone-in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>.  i've never had a bad steak in vegas and that streak continues.  cooked perfectly.  it was a very nice piece of beef.\n\nsides:\ni look forward to the sides going to these places more than the steak itself.  it's weird, but whatever.  we ordered a boatload of sides.  the mac and cheese came in first place.  that is a must try, imo.  the polenta was very good a well.  there were a couple others not as notable as the two above.  the only one i really didn't care for was the mushrooms and japanese peppers.  the mushrooms were good, but the peppers had a unique taste that just didn't do it for me, but to each their own.", 
            "after my outstanding experience here, it goes without saying that wolfgang puck's take on steaks is a \"cut\" above the rest!\n\ntucked inside the palazzo resort, cut exhibited a refined contemporary appeal and warmth that was both inviting and comforting.  i especially enjoyed the service by tara who made our visit feel special from the very moment we sat down. \n\nafter allowing us to peruse the menu for awhile, she returned with a cart of steaks and proceeded to give us a brief but detailed description of all their signature cuts and i must say, they all looked enticing! \n\nshortly after, we were served our wine and breads, which included the usual steakhouse suspects of fragrant & savory onion focaccia, pretzel roll, one of my personal favorites, mainly because of the firm outside texture and soft and chewy inside... and it wasn't too salty like most other pretzel breads i've come across. \nparmesan bread stick took a close second  place for its addictive light, crisp & crunchy texture with a generous coating of parmesan breading on the outside.\n\n<mark>Bone Marrow</mark> appetizer - from the buttery soft marrow to the warm, flavorful mushroom sauce, it was a blissful combination of ingredients and love. simply unbelievable. if there's one single dish from this entire trip, i will be craving for months afterwards, it will definitely be this!\n\nsteak tasting \namerican kobe style from snake river - paired with a <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark>. the beef was perfectly tender and seared beautifully leaving my mouthwatering for another juicy bite. the tangy flavor of the <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> was a perfect addition to the meat as it brought on a bright acidity to the steak. let it be known, i'm determined to get the recipe for that irresistible sauce!!!!\nusda prime dry aged - much softer and juicier than the <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark>, this cut of steak was praiseworthy in every way. honestly, it was a cut of perfection on a plate and the accompanying chimichurri sauce added a brightness to my palate that made it all the more satisfying. \naustralian wagyu from blackmore -\nworthy of it namesake, was truly the best of the best. it's like they took 50 steaks and concentrated all the beefiness into one bite. the best steak i've ever had. it came with a b\\u00e9arnaise sauce but honestly this piece needed nothing to dress it. it was perfect all on its own.\n\nwhite corn had a fresh & crunchy bite with a slightly sweet caremelized exterior that added a pleasant rustic flavor to the dish \n\ndessert\nbaked alaska - tasted like a giant strawberry mochi. btw, that's a good thing!  it also came with a small lemon bar, which had a lip puckering natural citrusy flavor!\n\nbanana creme pie came with chocolate ice cream, sauce, and chocolate crunch pearls. now that's what i call a triple chocolate threat! having said that, it was surprisingly mild and less cloyingly sweet, which i really enjoyed.\n\nbefore we left, tara gave us more sweets in the form of a chocalate truffle cookie bar and a chewy peanut brittle...both were absolutely delicious! \n\nservice was very thoughtful and the staff in general were ever present without being overbearing. but i'd have to say tara made all the difference! she transformed a pleasant meal to an unforgettable dining experience with her natural charm and warm tableside manner, which easily made the evening five stars in my book!\n\nbravo to cut for an exquisite meal and extraordinary service! \n\nyou bet ill be back for an encore! \n\nuntil then...\n\nhappy eats!", 
            "what we ordered: \n1. kobe steak <mark>American Wagyu Beef Sashimi, Spicy Radishes</mark> - amazing dish, the highlight of the dinner! the meat was so buttery and the delicate asian flavors of the sauce was a perfect pairing.\n \n2. <mark><mark>Bone Marrow</mark> Flan, Mushroom Marmalade, Parsley Salad</mark> - very good but did not have that intense marrow flavor that i like. i also did not like the accompanying <mark><mark>Bone Marrow</mark> Flan, Mushroom Marmalade, Parsley Salad</mark> as it overpowered the flan. however when eaten by itself the parsley was a good palate cleanser. \n\n3. <mark>Warm Asparagus</mark>, poached <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>, warm bacon vinaigrette - nice salad very good flavor. hard to mess up a dish with those ingredients.\n\n4. nebraska corn fed <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> - not a very thick steak, which i always prefer. the crust was overpowering due to the amount of char. way too much char in my opinion.\n\n5. true japanese 100% wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> - thicker than the nebraska <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> but served in two pieces which i thought was odd. the meat was heavily marbled and very tender. the wagyu steak did not have a very meaty flavor, more relaxed and clean. again though, the charing on the crust proved too much. \n\n6. <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> - very good, recommended. creamy and buttery. \n\nthe service was excellent and the ambiance is very nice. we had a very large and comfortable booth. our sever was very professional and his support staff was very attentive. overall, a good experience but the prices are very high, be prepared to spend. the steaks were too heavily charred for me. almost ruined the high quality meat imho.",

            "best steak we've had in us but still not as good as bistecca fiorentina in tuscany. we shared a porterhouse for 2, medium rare (warm red center, as per our server). it came on a sizzling hot plate and was carved table side. the fillet mignon side was a little dry imo while the ny strip side was much better (warm red as promised). i should have skipped the fillet and just eaten the strip side :-p the only thing i didn't like was some unchewable tendons in the ny strip (which you don't find in the amazing italian cow)...\n\ncomplimentary breads were amazing. some great bakers they've got. their complimentary gougere was better than tartine sf's, even is that's not really my thing. the cheese sticks were even better. and the pretzel bread (husband's fav), pumpernickel (yum) and onion foccacia were good enough for a bakery.\n\nwe shared a <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan for starters. very good. i find plain <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> a little scary but this was so good. went well with the toasted brioche, mushroom marmalade, sauce, parsley and onion. we ate it all up :-)\n\nfor sides we shared the butternut squash, celery root, leeks and chestnuts. perfect dish for autumn/winter ;-)\n\ni had the leftover side and meat for lunch (cold) the next day. good lunch :-)\n\nwe couldn't even finish our dinner so no way could we squeeze in any dessert. seems to be a common \"problem\" for most diners :-p\n\ni had a xiang li cocktail as well. nice and fragrant (loved the pear puree) but a bit too gingery and starts to get cloying after a while. a subtler take on the execution might be better.\n\nafter dinner we went next door for illy coffee as a digestive :-) if we ever want steak again, kobe style (half-kobe mix) might be a better choice for us. more tender but not as fatty as actual wagyu...",

            "cut remains one of the top steakhouses in vegas.  why the update?  the return of real japanese beef to the menu.\n\nexcess foodie trivia:  japanese wagyu beef varies in quality and flavor depending on sub species, rearing, and environment.  there are dozens of wagyu \"brands\", the top being matsusaka ushi (virgin females fed rice and beer, massaged daily producing extremely deep even marbling, whose fat is the only one that melts at human body temperature).  kobe with its rice like aroma and omi with its viscous fat round out the top three.  regardless of brand and ranking in japan, all are far beyond the quality of the best usda prime.\n\nback to cut. outstanding starters are modified seasonally.  i'm longing for autumns return and the incredible carpaccio with celery hearts, truffle hollandaise and shaved white alba truffles.  perhaps the perfect version of a carpaccio, white truffles enhance the sweet, mineral beef flavor and the otherworldly white truffle hollandaise it's richness all surrounded by an umame fog of aromas.  the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan is extremely rich, it's flavor sweetened by an earthy mushroom marmalade and brightened by an herbaceous, green <mark><mark>Bone Marrow</mark> Flan, Mushroom Marmalade, Parsley Salad</mark>.   excellent.\n\nto the beef.  all grilled over hardwood for a gentle smoked flavor and finished under a broiler.  well seared, very evenly cooked, always to temperature.\n\nin general, bone in usda prime cuts are gently aged deriving their beefy flavor from the bone.  hearty beefy texture and deep beef flavor.  the boneless cuts have more aging and a nuttier, more pronounced umame goodness.  slightly greasy, mouth feel and lingering flavor.  very high quality american steaks.  \n\nthe american wagyu, very tender, sweet, mild beef flavor.  extremely rich whose fat leaves a slight cloying mouth feel..\n\nfinally,  japanese wagyu from saga prefecture.  a4 quality.  deep, even marbling.  very sweet with a good beef flavor.  extremely rich.  very smooth mouth feel, the fat is not cloying having the viscosity of wine, not olive oil. excellent.\n\nmany return visits, still no desert.\n\nservice remains steakhouse refined and efficient.  \n\nthe wine list remains excellent.\n\nprices match the quality but hey, it's vegas, all it takes is one spin.",

            "my review will strictly be on what i ordered:\n\n<mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan - probably the best flan i've had thus far.  they had obviously taken the time and finesse to make sure the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> was cooked evenly.  the texture was luscious, melt-in-you-mouth, and rich.  the mushroom puree alongside was fantastic and brought each bite a bit more earthiness.\n\nu.s.d.a. prime dry aged 35 days - true steak/beefy flavor.  tasted like a nice steak straight from your own grill, just with a bit more quality to it.  \n\namerican wagyu from snake river farms - fat was nicely marbled throughout, without being too overwhelming.  great beefy flavor throughout.  \n\ntrue japanese 100% wagyu beef from miyazaki prefecture, kagoshima - while each bite was to die for, i could only handle just a few.  heavily marbled to the point where that flavor you anticipate from a good steak is lost.  you know that fatty strip alongside a <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>? that's what the entire steak tasted like.  \n\nchocolate souffle - as someone who focuses in patisserie, i was hesitant trying this, given that were were in a steakhouse and typically speciality restaurants lose focus on all other items.  i was wrong.  the souffle was beautiful... light.. airy... yet so decadent at the same time.\n\noverall:  amongst the 3 steaks i've tried, i prefer the american wagyu.  it still delivered a marvelous beefy flavor that you want from a steak, while delivering a slight richness from the marbling.  well balanced in my opinion.  \n\nlike i always say, you won't know unless you try it for yourself!", 
            "we all talk about the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan because it's one of the most novel dishes at this wolfgang puck steakhouse.  the pureed mushrooms add a mellow earthy accent to the otherwise robust and rich <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>.\n\nas far as steak houses go, it's a solid choice but you're clearly paying for the wp brand.  the cut clearly prides itself on steak and offering an assortment of the best cuts of beef from around the world.  whether you're looking at idaho, nebraska, or japan.  ever spend $155 of a 8 ounces of steak?  might as well live it up in vegas.\n\nare there better choices in vegas?  sure.  but you might as well live it up while you're at the venetian.  [original visit: december 2013]", 
            "carnivores must come!\n\nthe waiters were well dressed and professional. the parmesan crispy thing to start off with was soooo messy to eat.  the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan was to die for. i wanted to pick up the bone and lick it out clean but i was dressed too pretty to do that.  <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> was fabulous but for rare i thought it was a little overcooked but it was a fabulous piece of meat. my friend had the chicken with truffles and it was sooooo good. the brocolli and polenta were to die for!", 
            "continuing the tradition of doing one fine dining per trip to vegas me and my buddy decided to try cut by wolfgang puck.  we decided to try this restaurant due to the fact that they served true japanese 100% japan wagyu which is really hard to find.  most place serve either american kobe, american wagyu or australian wagyu.  rarely do they serve authentic wagu. \n\nreservation: reservation was not bad at all.  you could easily make reservations the day of.  however, i would suggest making it several hours in advance just to be on the safe side.  the more last moment u make the reservation the later the time it seemed like. (i had gotten a reservation at 8pm but when i called around 7 to add 2 more people it got pushed to 10pm)\n\nlocation:  cut was located inside the palazzo hotel on the lobby floor.\n\ndecor:  the decor was very nice.  it had somewhat of a modern theme.  like with most fine dining restaurants, it had a slightly romantic dim light setting.  however it was not quiet nor too loud which was really nice since you can actually have a conversation with  your date or friends and not feel like your talking to loud or have a hard time hearing them.\n\nfood: \n\n<mark><mark>Bone Marrow</mark> Flan, Mushroom Marmalade, Parsley Salad</mark> - this dish was delicious  and cooked perfectly.  it was evenly cooked and the mushroom marmalade complimented the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> very nicely.\n\ntrue japanese 100% wagyu beef from miyazaki prefecture, kagoshima-  what can i say about this dish except that it was truly melt in your mouth delicious.  this was probably one of the best steaks i have had.  typically for steaks, i have meat cooked at a medium rare but this time i asked the waiter how i should have this cut cooked since it was my first time eating 100% wagyu.  his recommendation was medium.  his reason was that it would allow all the heavy marbling to melt and absorb into the meat.  cooking it medium rare may not melt the marbling completely and may leave it chewy.  as a result i went with medium and i am glad i did.  the wagyu came out perfectly cooked and full of flavor.  i love the fact that they charred the top and bottom slightly so you get an initial flavorful crunch and then as u sink your teeth further into the meat it slowly melts away.  8oz was just perfect enough to get you full due to how rich it is.\n\ni will def be coming back again for some more <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> and wagyu.", 
            "if i could give this place a zero, i would. i haven't gotten into the swing of yelping often but this is one of those experiences that is so terrible that you just have to write about it. and actually, i went months ago, but looks like i never finished my review.\n\ncame here with a group of 14 girls for a bachelorette party. we had spent weeks picking out the perfect place for dinner and were really looking forward to our meal. they go through the motions of being a five star restaurant but you can tell they definitely don't think you're a five star customer. you might think we're a prissy/snooty bunch but i assure you, we could have eaten hot dogs and been happy but we chose a nice place so we could have a memorable experience.\n\nstarted with the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> appetizer. it was tasty as marrow usually is, you can probably share it since it came with two pieces and it's so rich. i had the australian wagyu. good quality meat though i've had <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> prepared much better. it's just a slab of meat on your plate, not to mention overcooked. presentation points: 0. *shrugs maybe i wanted to be impressed since it is a wolfgang puck restaurant, oh well. \n\nthey suggested that we get sides to share for each half of the table. there was a misunderstanding when a waiter began to serve out sides on our individual plates that was actually for the other side. even after asking him to stop, he ignored our request and kept serving away. one of the head waitresses came over to ask what was wrong. she told us that all sides were supposed to be family style and left it at that. family style is fine but if that's the case, don't put it on everyone's plate if they don't want to eat it, especially after we asked you not to. her tone was so extremely rude that many of us were taken aback.\n\nmaybe it's because we were a large group but i can honestly say that i have never been treated so poorly at any dining establishment. we even talked to a manager and i can't even bring myself to tell you their response. so disappointing. the only reason cut is 'memorable' is because i can't forget how unhappy we were when we finally left. poor attitudes, poor communication, poor service all around. \n\nnever again. and anytime a friend mentions vegas, i tell them to stay away from cut. really not worth the price you pay.", 
            "this restaurant is awesome.\nmy better half and i spent a wonderful weekend in las vegas and stayed at the palazzo. coming to this restaurant was just too convenient to pass, and the fact that it is a wolfgang puck restaurant made it that much more of a desirable dinner choice. \nwe were sat very quickly and within minutes we had a wine menu in front of us. we both chose a malbec that was so amazing!!!\n\nwe chose 2 items from the appetizers section but i don't remember their names.... one had oxtail and <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> dumplings? it was really good, weird, but good.\nand i chose a baby beet salad with this insanely delicious cheese on top. \n\nso far, dinner was great!!!\n\nwe got the porterhouse steak for 2 as our main course with a side of cream spinach and mac and cheese. the steak was perfectly cooked. it came with all these different types of sauces so it made it fun to go through such a large piece of steak. \nthe spinach was.....ok. not my favorite! but the hubby to be really enjoyed it. and the mac and cheese...... it is worth the extra few bucks. omg.\n\noverall the experience was great, i can see why everyone is so amazed by this chef and his restaurants. they did not miss one detail. everything was perfect. \none thing i noticed that i absolutely loved, all the waiters serve the food at the exact same time. there was a table of 8 gentlemen next to us and when they got their food, 6 or 7 food runners rounded the table and once they were all set in place, they set the plates on the table simultaneously. i liked that.\n\ni'd like to go back some time. maybe try the beverly hills location", 
            "during my buddy's bachelor party, we decided to dine here for one night since we were staying at the venetian.  we had originally made reservations for a party of 8 but later realized we didn't count a few people.  luckily, cut was able to accomodate us but <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> of being in the dining room we were now seated out near the bar.  service was as good as the bh location and the delicious parmesan bread sticks didn't disappoint.  after ordering a few bottles of wine for the group, the appetizers began coming out.  we ordered the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan which didn't seem as flavorful as i remembered it being.  the beef carpaccio didn't disappoint!\n\nordered the prime <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cut-las-vegas?select=in0kn-y0agu9gr8uorwmzw#qwxo8agwoqpqco1ju93gwg along with a few sides for a few of us to share .... creamed spinach w/ <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>, mac n cheese, and the sauteed mushrooms http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cut-las-vegas?select=in0kn-y0agu9gr8uorwmzw#hg1z92uuzb-o4bi1kqugua.  as with the location in bh, cut has a tendancy to overcook their steaks so since i like my steaks rare, i order it black and blue.  mentioned this to the other people in our group and a few listened and a few didn't.", 
            "went with a large group, the server was awesome. was able to explain to everyone about what was on the menu. \nafter the food this is what we all kind of thought of the food. \n\n***<mark>Bone Marrow</mark> (had a weird texture but don't forget to add the sauce together) \n** smoked salmon (didn't taste as good as i thought it would, i'm used to it being cut in thin slices. this was in chunks) \n*** cesar salad (very refreshing) \n***** waygu steak. cooked perfectly! \n***** mac and cheese (big fan of cheese) \n**** tuna tartar. (fresh) \n\nwill def be coming back for the steak and mac and cheese.", 
            "i... don't know what to say. i had really high hopes for this place, thinking this would be one of the best meals of my life. but sadly, i was hugely disappointed.\n\nfor a 6 oz steak that costs $85, i expected a lot more. i ordered the american wagyu <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark>, medium rare. what i got was definitely more rare than medium rare.. most of the steak was red. i even started to question if they gave me the right steak, because it wasn't anything near amazing, like i expected after reading some yelp reviews about the american wagyu.  it was kinda tasteless, didn't melt in my mouth at all, and was even slightly difficult to swallow. mastros in costa mesa is way better..\n\nother reviews on what we ordered:\nappetizer: <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan: this was pretty good. it had a lot of flavor.. even the salad on top was delicious and refreshing amongst all the heavy things we ordered. not a lot in terms of quantity but very tasty. i think it's popular because it's so unique. good but didn't amaze me. \namerican wagyu <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark>: see above. this was ok... sad to say.\namerican wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>: what my bf ordered. he always gets the <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> and i always get the <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark>, which is nice because we get to try both. his <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> was ok. not as fatty and flavorful as <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> usually are. a disappointment as well.. didnt have much flavor.  \nmaybe we were supposed to order some toppings for our steaks to give them more flavor, but we wanted to taste the steak on its own since it's supposed to be such good quality. i guess that's what the sauces and salt (that they offer) are for. i'd rather the chef perfect the steak's flavor for me, though, since they're the pros and we're paying so much. \n\nside: <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark>: this was ok. i would have much preferred other mushrooms. i wouldn't order this again. be careful when you eat the big green pepper as it can be very spicy!\n\nmac n cheese: this was actually really good! not your typical mac n cheese. i loved the texture of the macaroni\n\nwine: i forgot the exact one i ordered, but it was a cabernet sauvignon, which i always get. it was okay. \n\nservice was pretty good. they explain the cuts of meat to you, comparing japanese wagyu and american wagyu. the servers were very efficient and seemed pretty busy. you should definitely ask questions if you have any. they were more than happy to answer my questions. \n\nin the end, our meal was $300 for two people (appetizer, two steaks, two sides and a glass of wine). i wish the price were justified by an unforgettable meal, but i'm left feeling pretty unsatisfied. i didn't even bother to look at the dessert menu, which says a lot. trust me.\n\ncome here to experience a wolfgang puck restaurant if you wish, but just don't get your hopes up.", 
            "ahhhhh the famous cut! i have heard that this steakhouse is super good from an acquaintance so i decided to give it a try while i'm on a vacay. \n\ninterior: good! glassy and dim lights! the furniture is black, neat and comfortable. i like black and glassy places. nice layout. \n\ncustomer service: good again! our guy was really friendly and nice. my girl had a few questions and he was very thorough while answering them. \n\nfood: hmmm i gotta say it's the biggest let down in my life. given that the place has the four dollar signs, i thought it would be top notch. my girl and i got a <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan, american wagyu <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> and <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> with mac and cheese and wildfield mushroom on the side. the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan was very interesting and unique. when i first heard about it, i was very confused. flan is supposed to be sweet, but this particular one was cooked in a <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>. me no comprehender! the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> was good. that's all i could say. it's hard to explain so jus try it lol wildfield mush was aiite. it had that typical mush taste with a lil saltiness. mac and cheese was cheesy and creamy on a decent level. now the finale 'drum roll' the steaks were okay.. my <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> was so plain that i thought maybe i was supposed to get a sauce.. and the thing is the meat itself wasn't exquisite like the waiter explained. it jus tasted like usda black angus prime beef in my opinion. there was nothing wagyu about it. for that reason, i give this restaurant three stars. nothing extraordinary. just plain.", 
            "this place was amazing. while i only saw the bar part, and i use the term \"saw\" loosely here because it is very dark in the bar. so much so that the couple next to us was using their flash on their cellphone cameras to look at the wine list. \n\nthe service here was what you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber and price point. very attentive, knowledgeable and professional. \n\nwhile the food here was amazing, it was a pity i couldn't see it any better or get any decent pictures. so dark! i understand ambiance and mood, but come on. \n\nmy girlfriend and i had the australian oxtail bouillon with <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> dumplings. it melted in your mouth. the flavors danced on my tongue, and my stomach purred from its depths. it was that good. the dry aged, corn fed ny strips we got were phenominal. night and day difference in that mine was rare and girly girl's was well done. both cooked to perfection. side of creamed spinach with a fresh egg on top. wow. and the creamy polenta is what did me in. perfectly executed both texturally and flavor. and i know, because i make this at home. \n\nwe somehow sneaked in on a saturday evening during the mr.olympia weekend, i think we just got lucky. highly recommend a reservation.", 
            "just dined here this evening with a group of foodies. i was left without words. best steak i've had in my life. period. \n\nfrom entering this fine dining establishment to leaving after paying a generous tip, cut las vegas delivered every aspect of a modern steakhouse to a 100% level. fantastic service and impeccable food. a medium rare grass fed dry aged piece of meat has never tasted so good. i would post a photo but all you would see is an empty plate. yelp pointer - try their sides. add <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> to your steak. enjoy a glass of red wine. appreciate life's beauty with great company and amazing food.", 
            "read the reviews and ordered the porterhouse for two with a side of <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>...wow..was the marrow rich..i think we drank an extra bottle of wine because of that.\n\nthe porterhouse rare..was perfect..cold center and melt in your mouth tender.\n\nthe <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> sides was delicious.", 
            "the best meal i've ever had in las vegas! this place has the best steak there is in town! there are so many assortments of meat to choose from. the waitress came out with an assortment of raw meat for us to look at and choose from at the very beginning. you could see how each type of meat have different amount of fat. i absolutely love the japanese wagyu beef. it literally melts in your mouth. \n\nbest starters - prime sirlo<mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> tartare with her aioli and mustard. and prime <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> carpaccio.\n\nbest steak- japanese wagyu beef <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> \n\nbest add on- <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>( they cut it out for us) \n\nsauce- my favorite is the <mark>Creamy Horseradish</mark> sauce.", 
            "tonight was a great experience from beg fining to end.\nwe started with the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, american wagyu sashimi and <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> appetizers and honestly i'm very confused on what i liked the must, every bite was better than the one prior and god i wouldn't ordered again if i didn't have the main meal coming.\nmy main meal was the japanese wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> with an extra 2oz added to it with the amazing mac and cheese and wow was it good, i saved a two bite piece for as long as i could as i didn't want the wine to be the last taste i had on my evening. \n\nthe service was great but the meal was one to repeat.\n\nhighly recommend the restaurant and the price was not as outrageous as i expected.\n\n\nthanks,", 
            "okay - the food here is absolutely delicious. the <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> was so unbelievably tender, and even more delicious topped with <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>. the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> dumpling and oxtail soup was flavorful, and the perfect start to the meal. the seafood 'lump' salad was refreshing and light.\n\nmy only gripe (it was a big one) was the incident that happened at the end of our meal... my friend had brought cupcakes to celebrate a birthday, and was told over the phone it was a $14 flat rate. the cupcakes came, we sang happy birthday, and went along our merry way. however... when the bill came, it was a whopping $168 for a cake cutting fee.\n\n$168... are you freaking kidding me? for 12 cupcakes? absurd. a few things...\n\n1. you don't cut a cupcake - everyone knows that\n2. when we spoke to the manager, he said he had spoken to my friend on the phone that day and told her about the $14 per person cake cutting fee - which was a lie... my friend had spoken to a different representative weeks ago\n3. desserts at the restaurant aren't even that much\n4. if we had known about the absurd fee, and it had been communicated to us, we wouldn't have brought in the cupcakes\n\nanyways. 5 stars for food and service, but the cupcake incident was a serious debbie downer for our meal. as a restaurant that charges a premium for food and service, they really need respect their customers more.", 
            "easily the best service i've had in quite some time.  everyone was attentive and great at what they do.  <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> + <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> apps were fantastic.  i had the wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> and the 35+ day aged <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>. both were fantastic, but if i could go back, i'm not sure if i would get the wagyu again.  i was hoping for an out-of-the-world steak, but <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark>, it was just great. \n\ni only had time to go to one steakhouse in vegas.  trust me, i did my research before choosing cut and i'm very glad that i did.", 
            "top notch steakhouse! the food was very well prepared and the service was impeccable! we started with the pretzel rolls and the weird little sesame breadsticks. next was the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> dumplings, the <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> over spinach and the creamy polenta.  to die for! for the main course, we has 2 orders of the wagyu sampler with the coordinated sauces! perfect! for the wine, i chose an cab-merlot blend. everything was well coordinated and the waiter was pleasant, friendly and knowledgeable about the items on the menu.  great las vegas dining experience!", 
            "excellent! we ordered the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> to start and i practically licked the plate clean. got the waygu tasting and my husband got the <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>. both were delicious and perfectly cooked. the creamed spinach and polenta we got as sides were also amazing. \n\nthe only thing that wasn't out of this world was the dessert - had the chocolate souffl\\u00e9 which was good but not great. \n\nservice was also very good. no complaints!", 
            "wow. what can i say that hasn't already been said?\n\nthe space is beautiful and modern.\n\nthe cocktail and wine menu is presented via ipad so you can filter by price/country/grape/etc. i expected a varied wine list, but i was pleasantly surprised by the 2 delicious cocktails we had. very well made and presented with cool huge ice cubes. bonus points for having some inventive mocktails in there!\n\nyou already know the food is delicious. we followed all the yelp recommendations and they are spot on:\n<mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> (great, as expected). \n<mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan (a must-try. i was scared to try it, but the waiter talked me into it and i'm so glad he did! it's a custard...a baby step to straight marrow).\npretzel bread (it really is not an exaggeration to say, \"best pretzel roll of your life.\") \nnebraska <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> (great steak. duh)\n<mark>Double Thick Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark> (this will surprise you - it's so smooth, not chewy, lighter than a steak)\n<mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark> (a unique flavor, love the twist on the steakhouse classic)\nmushrooms & peppers (the surprise of the meal. loved it)\nbaked alaska (very good, but potentially too sweet. not that i didn't eat it of course!)\n\nthe service was great the entire night, and i think that is what really set this experience apart for us. everybody was friendly, offered great recommendations, anticipated every need, but not pushy or intrusive. they really made us feel like vips.\n\nfor all our food, plus cocktails, wine and dessert wines....$350. obviously it's expensive, but seriously worth it for a splurge meal. you could easily conserve by splitting a main (it's a ton of meat, neither of us finished), skipping dessert, and having only one glass of wine each.", 
            "delicious restaurant, expensive, but a must go if you love great steak!  we started with <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> which was good but a little saltier than the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> i've had in the past i wouldn't recommend it.  however, the entrees, sides and drinks were delicious. my husband had the japanese wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> which was top notch and i had the petite <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> which was great. i ordered a side of sauce which was completely unnecessary so save you couple of dollars.  i will say though if you like <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> that is a must add to your steak.  the spinach with quail egg and the polenta were both notable.  my drink was called show me love and it was refreshing. cut will put a dent in your wallet but well worth it for a special occasion.", 
            "overall good dinner. the a5 japanese wagyu beef was wonderful, same goes with the <mark>Double Thick Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark>. the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan is not very good, and the <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> is just okay. i would not order those again.", 
            "dinner presentation was on point, great customer service, and ambiance was trendy. we had the japanese wagyu which was very juicy and succulent. for side dishes we had mac and cheese was on point, saut\\u00e9ed spinach was ok and mushrooms were ok. oh i forgot the appetizers; <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> was outstanding, crab louie was good and the tuna tartar was fresh and tasty.", 
            "as good as a steak house gets, and i lived in dallas for eight years.  this place understand beef and it is tough to beat these steaks. they bring around a cart with the cuts of the evening. the choices are vast. i elected to go with an aged strip. this was my first steak in over six months (may be why i enjoyed it so much!) but seriously, the marbling, taste and texture were incredible.\nloved the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> appetizer to start.\nwhat a fantastic restaurant. look forward to a return visit.", 
            "the overall experience was amazing at cut. you come in and they bring out some cheese puff bread, cheesy breadsticks, and then a whole bunch of different kinds of bread (pretzel one is the best). then they bring out the steak and show you the different cuts and the marbleization of it. i got the american rib-eye and i don't think it was the best rib-eye i ever had. it was good, and i don't think there is a need to get the extra 2 ounces. we also had the beef sashimi, <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>, tuna tartar as appetizers. those were all really good, the beef sashimi was probably the best followed by the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>. no point in getting <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> on the side if you get the appetizer. these appetizers can be split amongst 4 people. for sides we tried creamy spinach and mushrooms. the creamy spinach was really creamy....not my cup of tea. the mushrooms were good, but probably not worth it. those can be shared amongst 3 people maybe. \n\nservice is really good though.", 
            "fully enjoyed my experience <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> is a knock out and the japanese wagyu strip is like butter.", 
            "idk how this place could get any less than at least 4 stars. this place is extremely expensive but you definitely get your moneys worth. exceptional customer service, presentation, and food. our husband and i had no complaints whatsoever. we ordered the <mark>Warm Veal Tongue</mark> and <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan which were definitely interesting but tasty. we ordered the american wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> and <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> and it was hands down the best steak we have ever had, i can only imagine how the japanese steak tastes. you must spend the extra $2 on the sauces they recommend for that specific steak it makes a huge difference. also try their baked alaska dessert. amazing. definitely recommend trying this restaurant out.", 
            "dined here last week for our anniversary getaway to vegas. restaurant is inside the palazzo hotel, which in my opinion is one of the top three resorts, didn't stay here this time but many other occasions and this place never disappoints. \n\non to the restaurant.. made my reservations here about three days in advance and they did call to confirm my anniversary celebration. the restaurant itself is modern in d\\u00e9cor and medium sized. my wife wasn't too fond of the table settings - seemed to be more appropriate for outdoor patio furniture as opposed to fine dining. \n\nwe both had the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan which was good.\n\nmy wife loved the sea bass and described it as the best she's ever had. kudos for me ;)\n\ni unfortunately was disappointed on my long awaited steak. ordered the dry aged <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> good portion size, however it came out lukewarm. i ordered it slightly above medium and some portions were still a little bloody. my waiter was nowhere to be found and after being almost halfway into the meal (was hungry,) he only offered to warm it up which after the fact, the dinner completely lost its appeal. the quality of the steak was good however some portions were not seasoned properly to the point where i had to add some table salt. frankly i regrettably found my meal to be mediocre.\n\non a positive note; the drinks and sides - especially the mushroom saut\\u00e9 was very good. i even liked their <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> as such condiments usually should not be accompanied with fine meat. \n\nafter our meals, we were treated to strawberry shortcake as our anniversary treat which was much appreciated although the waiter basically forgot of our purpose of celebration there and was asking if we wanted our check. \n\nto sum up our experience, the restaurant didn't really provide the high end vibe, quality or service we usually experience at other steakhouses such as mastros, ruths or even fogo. too bad because we live in la and were anxious to dine again at the cut location in beverly.",

            "wow!! i am officially a fan of this restaurant!! a week after going there, i'm having major cravings of all the food i tried there. if funds were not an issue, i would eat here every week.\n\nthe place itself was nice, chic, a little upscale but not too stuffy. i liked the decor though it was a little dim (i like to see exactly what i'm eating!) we got a few complimentary treats - first, 3 little cheddar cheese cracker things ( one for each of us.) they were good but it was kind weird because they were so small and kind of tasted like those little goldfish crackers. there was also a bunch of these long, skinny, crunchy breadsticks. they were ok.  we were also able to choose from different breads that they had. i chose the pretzel bread and the focaccacia. they were both really good but the pretzel was especially good with this spicy horseradish mustard sauce they had. it might have been a wasabi mustard. i don't remember but i know that it was very good!!!\n\nthe menu was a little intimidating, as i am not exactly a steak connoisseur. our server tried to explain the menu and how they cooked the steak but i had no idea what he was talking about and i was also not really paying attention. we opted out on the appetizers to keep our bill down but regretted that when we found out our steaks would take 45 minutes before they were ready. i decided on the usda prime, black angus beef 12 oz. <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> from creekstone farms in arkansas city, kansas - aged 28 days ($58)  with chimichurri sauce on the side, which was a couple bucks. my boyfriend ordered the ny sirloin - 8 oz. american wagyu / angus \"kobe style\" beef from snake river farms, idaho ($85) and his brother ordered the australian 100% wagyu beef from oakleigh ranch, alexandria, nsw. 6 oz <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> ($145.) we also got 3 sides - <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> ($12) <mark>Hand Cut French Fries with Herbs</mark> ($12) and cavatappi pasta \"mac & cheese\" - quebec cheddar ($21).\n\nso here's the breakdown - my 12 oz black angus beef <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> dominated my boyfriend and his brother's steaks. it was massive. so if you are super hungry, that would be a great option. i ended up giving a lot of it to them bc i couldn't finish it. anyway, i ordered a medium- well and i should have paid attention to the server because it came out more done than i would have liked. i later learned that all the steaks sit an extra 10 minutes which makes it a little more done. i should have had it done medium <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark>. so it came out pretty firm but it was still absolutely delicious!! there was so much flavor in this steak that i didn't need the chimichurri sauce at all. the flavor from the steak overpowered the chimi sauce!!\n i didn't taste my boyfriends american wagyu ny sirloin but he said it was very good and he was happy with his choice. now the best thing on our table was the australian 100% wagyu beef <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>.  i was very lucky that my future brother in law shared his steak with me. it was honestly one of the best things i've ever tasted in my life!! my mouth is watering thinking about this steak. i've never had wagyu beef before but after tasting it, it makes any other steak seem so average!  wow - literally, i cannot even describe this steak. it was so rich and buttery. it really just melted in your mouth. i'm going to make a plan to go back and order this buttery goodness to myself  in the near future.\n\nand now the sides. the fries were ok. pretty good but we barely ate them so next time we won't be getting those. the mac and cheese was delicious!! it came out way too hot and burnt your tongue but it was very very good so i didn't care. lol. the <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> was phenomenal. it's in my top list of best mashed potatoes ever next to old homestead's garlic mashed.  \n\nso yeah, i would definitely recommend this place to anyone that loves a good steak!! it was a little pricey (with a couple glasses of wine and soda, tax, tip and all it came out to well over $500 for 3 of us.)  it was worth every penny!!!", 
            "we came here in a group of 5 for my boyfriend's birthday dinner.  the cocktail menu was featured on an ipad, which was a very cool concept.  i ordered the \"lots of love\" cocktail, which was a good mix of sweet and sour.  we ordered the american wagyu porterhouse for two ($190) with <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> and <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>.  as for sides, we ordered the <mark>Hand Cut French Fries with Herbs</mark>, creamed spinach, and the mac and cheese.  the house bread served at the beginning is delicious, especially the pretzel bread with the butter.\n\nwe were told it would be 15-20 minutes for our steaks to arrive, but it took about 45+ minutes.  the servers cut the steaks for us, and even served our sides to us.  i must have had really high expectations because i thought the steak was only mediocre.  the sides, especially the mac and cheese and <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark>, were excellent though.\n\noverall, i thought cut was just another average steakhouse.  there was nothing really \"special\" that stood out from it.  i've experienced better at stk and sw in vegas.  although the service was consistent, (they constantly picked up our plates and refilled our waters) minus waiting longer than told for our food, i'd definitely look into other options next time i'm in vegas.",

            "wow this place is awesome! i came here for an anniversary dinner with the bf on a wed night. we had reservations at 7pm, but even though we got there early, we were still seated right away in a cozy little booth. the decor is modern with lots of browns and dimmed lights and the vibe just felt cool haha...we were probably the youngest diners in the restaurant but for a wednesday night, the place was pretty packed.\n\nour server, carlos was attentive, efficient, and super friendly. he was able to describe the meats and wines to us and offered great recommendations. after much deliberation, we skipped the starters (since they do give you a good amount of bread) and went straight for the meat! i opted for the american wagyu filet ($80) and it was delicious! it was cooked perfectly medium rare and yes it was 'charred', but nothing extreme and the meat didn't taste burnt or anything like that. lots of yelpers complained about the saltiness of the meat, but i thought the seasoning was just right...in fact, they served my steak with a side of extra salt just in case i needed more haha. our side dishes of <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> and <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> were just right to compliment the steak. in addition to the awesome food, the service was impeccable, our wine and water glasses were always filled and i swear just as we had finished up our meal, our plates were cleared in an instant. we were checked up on and i never felt like i was rushed. another plus was our complementary dessert. the words \"happy anniversary\" were spelled out in chocolate and served alongside 4 different crackers/cookies...it was quite a pleasant surprise since i wasnt expecting anything like that. overall this was a sensational dining experience! everything was spot on and i'll definitely have to save my money for my next visit to cut haha", 
            "pros: taste of <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark> (the japanese wagyu 2 oz. specifically), cool decor, really nice server named carlos\ncons: none?\n\ni went here with kristin c. for our 2 year anniversary dinner last week and i was definitely impressed. the decor was really nice in here.  it had a modern feel. the lights were dimmed which created a very relaxing and intimate setting. perfect for a romantic dinner. we got a nice booth and a really attentive server named carlos.\n\ndecor is nice and all, but we all know the food is really what matters.  after we ordered, another waiter came around with a platter of different breads. i got one wheat bread and one pretzel type bread. apparently, the pretzel bread is their specialty. i could definitely see why. it was soft and delicious.\n\nfor my main course, i ordered the \"a tasting of <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark>\" ($140). it comes with different types of <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark>:\n\n- japanese wagyu from saga prefecture 2 oz\n- american \"kobe style\" from snake river farms 4 oz\n- u.s.d.a. prime dry age from nebraska 4 oz\n\nall 3 steaks were really tasty. definitely, some of the best steaks i've had in my life. however, the best out of the 3 was definitely the japanese wagyu. so freaking good. it was nice and tender. my steak knife cut through it like butter. i can see why they only give 2 oz. too. two reasons: 1) its the pricest per ounce and 2) i think since it's sooo rich and tender, if you get too much, it might be too much of a good thing.\n\nwe also got <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> and mushrooms as sides and they were good too. but seriously, the steaks made my night.  hanging out with kristin c. was cool too i guess :)\n\noverall, this place is great for special occasions. i might just have to go to cut in la just to get my japanese wagyu fix.",

            "service is excellent although i don't require that level of attention (i personally find it to be uncomfortable... so much ass kissing that they might as well wipe it while they're at it, but major ego boost for those that like the superattentive, major ass kissing level of service).  as for the food, the steak is ok relative to its peers (morton's, ruth's chris, etc, etc....), the <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> tasted muuuuuchhhh better, and the cheese breadsticks were probably the best!  chocolate souffle was also so so (perhaps it's because i am comparing to one i've had at the phoenician resort in phoenix and have yet been able to try another one just as good).  overall, it's a nice and convenient place to have good steak if you happen to stay at venetian/palazzo at vegas, but i definitely would not brave traffic to go to a cut in la",

            "i have to start off this review by saying that my fiance and i were in complete euphoria during and after dinner here.  this place is pretty damn sleek. we were helped by three servers.  our main server took our order and educated us on the different kinds of meat.  another server dished out little nibbleys throughout the meal.  and then the third server brought our meals out and even dished out our sides onto our plates.  nothing but the best when it comes to service.  it would only make sense since you are dropping bucco bucks.  \n\nnow onto the meat.  the main waiter makes a presentation on the different cuts of meat as well as describes the texture of said meats.  i ordered the 14oz nebraska corn fed ny strip steak.  i made it to order this piece in particular because my fiance is a nebraska boy.  as for him, he ordered the 10oz american wagyu.  and to company our steaks we ordered <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>.  the steaks were unbelievable to the point where we pretty much forgot about the <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>.  it was that serious!  if you are looking for impeccable service and food, cut is your place.", 
            "the hottie and i have been meaning to try cut for awhile.  we finally went on our last trip to vegas.  based upon the reviews we started with the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan.  it was simply one of the best dishes i've ever had anywhere.  then, we decided to get the porterhouse steak for two.  caveat.... the waiter told us that we are supposed to order the steak one notch rarer than we normally would like it because they let the steak sit for 10 minutes after its done so it will cook a bit more.  since the hottie and i are both medium rare people, we ordered the porterhouse rare.  it looked and smelled amazing when the steak finally came to the table!  truthfully, i thought the steak was kinda in between rare and medium rare.  but the <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> portion may have been the best <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> i've had.  so tender, so juicy, with a flavorful crisp on the outside.  yum!  the <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> portion was also very good although a bit too rare for me.  we also ordered three sides... creamed spinach, <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>, <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>.  i thought they were all ok but nothing to write home about.  all in all, a top notch meal.", 
            "visited this wolfgang puck restaurant in january of 2010. three of us in the party. made reservations a week before on opentable.com. we were on time and greated by the hostess when we walked in. restaurant and lounge was full. it was ces week so vegas is usually jammed that week. the hostess originally tried to seat us in the lounge. i was like \"nah\". moved promptly to a nice table in the back of the dining room near the private dining room (which was full with employees from one of the companies at ces). kind of off to the side it was nice and quiet so i could talk to my parents. the table was off balance and every time we tapped it, it would tilt. one of the servers fixed that quick with a folded cocktail napkin right after i pointed it out. good. \n\nfinally unto the meal. my parents do not drink so i rarely do when dining with them. no problems. a round of diet cokes for all. typical bar soda in a high end restaurant. there were a few different servers. everyone works together. the main server brought out a tray to show of the differences in the marbling meat. from kobe beef to wagyu and the dry aged. \n\nsome breadsticks on the table were ok. the bread is awesome. pretzel bread with the different mustard's they put on the table are excellent. they served 4 other types of bread too. all fresh and flavorful. my dad loves his bread. so we had the bread guy come back and fill our plates 3 times throughout the meal. for an app we all split the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>. very tender and cooked well. enough for two not for three. \n\nthen for the steak action. i know my steaks. my first job, a week after i turned 16, was in an old school meat market. all through high school and college i worked in numerous meat departments of retail establishments. so with that said i obviously had to get the <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark> tasting. three portions, three types of cow. at the time, cut had legit a9 kobe beef from japan on the menu. they gave you 2oz. awesome! melt in your mouth. crazy flavor i have never tasted before in beef. 2nd portion was 4oz of american wagyu beef. totally different. a little more beef flavor. the last, was the 4oz portion of dry aged prime corn fed sirloin. again different in flavor and texture. most beef like and recognizable.  still a mighty fine steak. seasoned well with some s&p (salt and pepper). that's all you need for a high end steak like these. i ordered these medium. cooked fine. finished hot. some different <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> were served along side. i tried them each but the steaks did not need them.\n\nmom got a 21 day aged 8oz filet. def looked bigger. she likes it \"mooing\". she did not finish it so i took control of the situation. dad got a strip steak. not sure on the size or aging. \n\nin a nice steakhouse sides are a la carte. no prob. served family style works. we got <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>, creamed spinach with an egg on top ( which was broken and mixed in upon serving), and the <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>. everything was served at once, with multiple servers all explaining everything from the types of steaks we ordered, the sauces, and the sides. they served the sides on our plates and we enjoyed. it was steakhouse overload for me. i freaked out and sent all the staff away from me. \n\nwe were all stuffed from all the food. we did not have dessert. next time. thanks to my dad for picking up the tab, as he always does.", 
            "i utilize yelp pretty often but have been too lazy to write my own reviews. it is time i give back to the yelp community, and there is no better place to start than with this wonderful establishment.\n\ncut opened their doors 30 minutes early to ensure we caught our show, and it only got better.\n\nour very knowledgeable waiter rolled out a raw selection of available meats, masterfully describing each cut.\n\nsteaks ordered: filet, porterhouse, and rib-eye (all usda prime, none wagyu). each cut was perfectly prepared and tasted excellent. as for a comparison, i can't unequivocally say the steak quality was better than mastros, but it was definitely no worse.\n\nsides ordered: <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>, <mark>Soft Polenta with Parmesan</mark>, and quebec cheddar mac n cheese. polenta was the best, but still pretty ordinary, and the mac n cheese was the worst (canada sucks, eh?)\n\nwe paired our food with the house cab, which went perfectly.\n\nthe best part of the meal was the extraordinary service. our waiter was very attentive without being overbearing. he also engaged us in relevant conversation without being awkward (pre and post meal).\n\noverall, this culinary experience was well worth the money. in fact, i would have paid substantially more and still felt good about it.", 
            "came here for the final night of my vacation in vegas.  my friend is a huge steak person as i am not.  but i did inquire a little around town and found out there are pretty much 3 steak houses to visit on the strip - cut @ palazzo, craftsteak @ mgm and surprise! steak house @ circus circus.  originally i booked my reservation @ craftsteak considering we had a 9:30pm ka show, but after reading a bit more reviews and have been @ craftsteak, i decided we should try out cut.  (switch @ encore which is where we were staying was also considered, but after seeing the reviews we passed, i still would like to try it next time)\n\nthe four star rating is for the overall dining experience.  i would say the ambiance and service @ cut deserves a full 5 star.  our waitress definitely knew her stuff.  the restaurant is very nicely appointed, dark decorations but doesn't feel too uptight like the old steak houses in ny.  it has a nice modern feel to it.  we got seated by the door in a very comfortable booth area.  waitress came by and explained everything on the menu including the wine/drinks which came on an ipad.  she was the reason why i feel this restaurant deserved the outrageous bill that came at the end (more on that later).\n\nbeing a steak house, the main thing is the meat itself.  and this restaurant has some of the best selections.  the shining star is australian and american waygus/kobe.  basically skip all the usda crap and go straight to those selections, you would not regret it.  you do indeed pay for what you get, my friend ordered a 6oz australian waygu ny strip while i had the 6oz american waygu <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark>.  6oz may seem like a small size, but trust me you would not need more, i could not finish 1/2 of mine.  the australian waygu definitely was the most buttery steak i have ever tasted, every bite feels like you are going to pass out from just biting into it.\n\nall of the side items are a-la-carte, and they add to your bill exponentially.  the best is definitely the wild mushroom add on.  we also ordered a few other items - cauliflower (definitely recommended, yum!), creamed spinach with poached eggs (i wasn't a huge fan) and <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> (pretty good mashed potatoes but nothing to write home about)  we finished the meal with a banana cream pie/ice cream rendition, it was good, but not exceptional.  it could be however at that point i was pretty much passed out for a food coma.  the food was tiny in amount but felt so very rich that i couldn't take another bite.  i also felt that the sauces (we had chimi churri and wasabi) were too salty since the steaks were already flavored with fleur-de-sel (which they also brought to the table, a very nice touch).  it was just too much of a good thing in this case i think.  the food was simply too rich for my taste, which is one of the reasons i docked 1 star from this otherwise amazing establishment.\n\nthe other reason i took off 1 star is the price.  i have been to some outlandishly expensive restaurants, but this place is not french laundry :)  the bill for 2 came out to be around $480 (including tip), with just 1 glass of wine.  was the steak good?  absolutely.  was it $480 good?  that one i have to think for a bit and i think the answer is probably no.  so if you do decide to go, be choosy on the side items and add-ons you wish to have, because they do add up very quickly.  also ask the waitress for how the sides accompany the overall palette, i have a feeling if i do ever go back again, i will be choosing something that's lighter so it can offset the richness of the other parts of the plate.\n\nin summary, to finish off a very long review, i would come here if you are a steak fanatic and have a bit of money to drop.  it's like everything in vegas, you can do it on the cheap or outlandishly over the top.  you can guess how this one fits :)", 
            "came here for a bachelor party dinner and our experience was generally positive! this place does things a little backwards it seems. or i would say the deficiencies are in areas you would not think they would be in.  for instance they took our reservation for 16 and then when we showed up said that we had to sit at two different tables.. which the bachelor was not happy about... then our table was a round table and it was so rickety. if anyone touched it, it would shake violently. they gave us bread and after we finished eating the bread they decided to bring out the sauce to dip the bread???? and when we asked for more of the pretzel sticks to eat they never brought them out. after 3 separate attempts of asking for them and them apologizing they still never ever brought them???\n\nthe little easy things were all wrong, that's what surprised me with this place.\n\nwhat about the food? it was amazing!!!! i had the 16oz bone in <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> at the waiters suggestion and it was amazing. cooked perfectly, soft and tender and had an amazing flavor. i tried the australian waygu kobe beef that the bachelor ordered and it was unreal. it was so tasty.  the mac and cheese, fingerling potatoes, mashed <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> and corn niblets were top notch! i had a 2008 cabernet sauvignon and it was very tasty as well. i spent about $110 after tax and tip and it was well worth it.\n\nnow if they can only get the simple easy details right... like not having a rickety old table in a high end dining establishment.", 
            "as always, exceptional service and exceptional food.  i just need to remember to ask for; fine grind and less pepper on my ny rather than course grind, heavy pepper.  it burns and me no like...so i have to scrap it off....the <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> is so silky smooth and sweet...makes me feel in love....the mushrooms are awesome too.  i love their chimichurri. \n\nthe dessert we love time and time again is the banana cream pie....omg! orgasmic....", 
            "full disclosure: i have had a massive crush on wolfgang puck since i was little - something about the food and that adorable accent - so i was massively excited to try this place.\n\nwe each ordered a salad to start, and i had the fresh burrata cheese with prosciutto di parma, apples & black mission figs with micro arugula. i have had innumerable similar variations to this - prosciutto and melon, mozzarella and prosciutto, etc... but this was the single best version i have ever had. fresh, salty, sweet perfection.\n\nmy husband had the heirloom tomato salad with humboldt fog goat cheese, white anchovies, and tuscan olive oil which he seemed happy with. i wasn't paying much attention, frankly, as i was absorbed in soft burrata goodness.\n\nwe both ordered the american wagyu <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> - which was fantastic - along with sides of luscious <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>, and creamed spinach with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> (cut in by the server tableside). jasper ordered a <mark>Armagnac & Green Peppercorn</mark> sauce that he never ended up using because the steak was so flavorful. i had some <mark>Creamy Horseradish</mark> sauce that was divine. next time (and there will be a next time) i'd like to top my steak with a bit of <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> - yum.\n\ni'm pretty sure that we had chocolate souffle for dessert, but i can't really remember.  that steak was just so darn good!", 
            "wow!! i am officially a fan of this restaurant!! a week after going there, i'm having major cravings of all the food i tried there. if funds were not an issue, i would eat here every week.\n\nthe place itself was nice, chic, a little upscale but not too stuffy. i liked the decor though it was a little dim (i like to see exactly what i'm eating!) we got a few complimentary treats - first, 3 little cheddar cheese cracker things ( one for each of us.) they were good but it was kind weird because they were so small and kind of tasted like those little goldfish crackers. there was also a bunch of these long, skinny, crunchy breadsticks. they were ok.  we were also able to choose from different breads that they had. i chose the pretzel bread and the focaccacia. they were both really good but the pretzel was especially good with this spicy horseradish mustard sauce they had. it might have been a wasabi mustard. i don't remember but i know that it was very good!!!\n\nthe menu was a little intimidating, as i am not exactly a steak connoisseur. our server tried to explain the menu and how they cooked the steak but i had no idea what he was talking about and i was also not really paying attention. we opted out on the appetizers to keep our bill down but regretted that when we found out our steaks would take 45 minutes before they were ready. i decided on the usda prime, black angus beef 12 oz. <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> from creekstone farms in arkansas city, kansas - aged 28 days ($58)  with chimichurri sauce on the side, which was a couple bucks. my boyfriend ordered the ny sirloin - 8 oz. american wagyu / angus \"kobe style\" beef from snake river farms, idaho ($85) and his brother ordered the australian 100% wagyu beef from oakleigh ranch, alexandria, nsw. 6 oz <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> ($145.) we also got 3 sides - <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> ($12) <mark>Hand Cut French Fries with Herbs</mark> ($12) and cavatappi pasta \"mac & cheese\" - quebec cheddar ($21).\n\nso here's the breakdown - my 12 oz black angus beef <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> dominated my boyfriend and his brother's steaks. it was massive. so if you are super hungry, that would be a great option. i ended up giving a lot of it to them bc i couldn't finish it. anyway, i ordered a medium- well and i should have paid attention to the server because it came out more done than i would have liked. i later learned that all the steaks sit an extra 10 minutes which makes it a little more done. i should have had it done medium <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark>. so it came out pretty firm but it was still absolutely delicious!! there was so much flavor in this steak that i didn't need the chimichurri sauce at all. the flavor from the steak overpowered the chimi sauce!!\n i didn't taste my boyfriends american wagyu ny sirloin but he said it was very good and he was happy with his choice. now the best thing on our table was the australian 100% wagyu beef <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>.  i was very lucky that my future brother in law shared his steak with me. it was honestly one of the best things i've ever tasted in my life!! my mouth is watering thinking about this steak. i've never had wagyu beef before but after tasting it, it makes any other steak seem so average!  wow - literally, i cannot even describe this steak. it was so rich and buttery. it really just melted in your mouth. i'm going to make a plan to go back and order this buttery goodness to myself  in the near future.\n\nand now the sides. the fries were ok. pretty good but we barely ate them so next time we won't be getting those. the mac and cheese was delicious!! it came out way too hot and burnt your tongue but it was very very good so i didn't care. lol. the <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> was phenomenal. it's in my top list of best mashed potatoes ever next to old homestead's garlic mashed.  \n\nso yeah, i would definitely recommend this place to anyone that loves a good steak!! it was a little pricey (with a couple glasses of wine and soda, tax, tip and all it came out to well over $500 for 3 of us.)  it was worth every penny!!!", 
            "excellent service!!!\n\nhad a 6:30pm reservations for christmas eve and was placed at the best seat in the house. we overlook the entire dining area, had a table for 6, for us two, in an area with huge dining table and lounge-y corner... love it!!\n\nthe waiters are super helpful and  knowledgeable about the menu. very good at explaining the meat cuts and were very attentive... definitely one of the best service we have had in a very long time!\n\nfor food, we ordered the kobe beef sashimi, <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark>, my bf had the steak tasting and i had the american wagyu mignon... and to top off we had <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> and <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> as side... \n\neverything was wow, the <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> had avocado on top which really works well and kobe sashimi.. yum!!!.... the steaks were really good, melts and yummy.....except the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> makes the steak a little too greasy (personal choice, shouldn't have gotten it! but that's my thought).... lastly we got the banana creme pie... never had it, but loved it... we got 1 to share, should have really gotten 2!! haha.... \n\nwish wolfgang opens up cut in nyc!!! would love to make another visit!!", 
            "oh las vegas, the city of do-whatever-you-want. we were hungry by 5:30 so we picked up a dinner reservation around that time.\n\nthe service was excellent. we asked for the sommelier to help us pair wines with our food. she was incredibly helpful and mindful of our requests and tastes. we'd see her a couple times before the night was over; she poured our bottle and also later on when we asked for her help again with dessert wines.\n\nthe food was amazing. our first course was the tuna \"toro\" tartare with spicy crisps. it seemed somewhat of a waste to take delicious toro, the most sumptuous and fattiest part of tuna, and slicing it into little bits rather than eat it 'pure' with a tinge of soy sauce and wasabi. but it was worth it! \n\nas for the steaks, we elected to try the tasting plate with three different types of the same cut. the fats melted perfectly and they all had great flavor, distinctive from each other.\n\nthe sides, <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> and honeyed root vegatables, were phenomenal.\n\nfor dessert, my date and i came to an impasse. a delicious impasse. he got the chocolate souffle and i had the banana cream pie. the pie tasted like air, incredibly yummy tasting air. it was so light! \n\nall in all, the experience at cut was really great. what made it was the staff. throughout the night, we had a few different people other than our server check in with us. we had the opportunity to chat with them too. i always appreciate that they take the time to do that.", 
            "what we ordered: \n1. kobe steak <mark>American Wagyu Beef Sashimi, Spicy Radishes</mark> - amazing dish, the highlight of the dinner! the meat was so buttery and the delicate asian flavors of the sauce was a perfect pairing.\n \n2. <mark><mark>Bone Marrow</mark> Flan, Mushroom Marmalade, Parsley Salad</mark> - very good but did not have that intense marrow flavor that i like. i also did not like the accompanying <mark><mark>Bone Marrow</mark> Flan, Mushroom Marmalade, Parsley Salad</mark> as it overpowered the flan. however when eaten by itself the parsley was a good palate cleanser. \n\n3. <mark>Warm Asparagus</mark>, poached <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>, warm bacon vinaigrette - nice salad very good flavor. hard to mess up a dish with those ingredients.\n\n4. nebraska corn fed <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> - not a very thick steak, which i always prefer. the crust was overpowering due to the amount of char. way too much char in my opinion.\n\n5. true japanese 100% wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> - thicker than the nebraska <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> but served in two pieces which i thought was odd. the meat was heavily marbled and very tender. the wagyu steak did not have a very meaty flavor, more relaxed and clean. again though, the charing on the crust proved too much. \n\n6. <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> - very good, recommended. creamy and buttery. \n\nthe service was excellent and the ambiance is very nice. we had a very large and comfortable booth. our sever was very professional and his support staff was very attentive. overall, a good experience but the prices are very high, be prepared to spend. the steaks were too heavily charred for me. almost ruined the high quality meat imho.", 
            "an absolute divine dining experience that encompasses excellent meats and even better service.  we had no problem booking a party of twelve.  there were probably five servers assigned to just our party alone who made sure our wines were never empty and that everything way tip top at our table.  they showcased their prime cuts of meat in raw form and helped guide us to informed decisions based on our preference for flavor.  i had a bone in grass fed ny strip (20oz) that was cooked to perfection.  i specifically requested no sauce, with a dash of salt and pepper since i am a meat elitist, and i had no problem finishing the whole steak.  i loved their sauces, but most seemed to overpower the terrific flavor of the meats, so i would recommend not using the sauces, especially if you are opting for a special cut.  as for sides, they tasted pretty standard in comparison to other steakhouses.  i would recommend the <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> and the spinach.  they also have an extensive wine cellar and you can definitely have some great pairings.\n\nprotip:  cut is arguably one of the top steak houses on the strip.", 
            "my first ever celebrity chef experience, and what an insane experience it was. i honestly could not have been any more excited.\n\nwalking in the space was very contemporary. with some dim lighting and a upscale feel, you know you aren't on a college campus anymore. \n\nlets walk through the list:\n\nfood: the steak was amazing!! we ordered a side of mashed <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> and mac & cheese with our steaks. i didn't get the wagu even though they made it sound like a godlike cow. i went for the u.s.d.a. nebraska cornfed cut with an argentinian chimichurri. the steak was perfectly cooked and just busted with flavor in my mouth. the mashed potato was very light and smooth, while the mac & cheese was very rich. all of which served with mounds of bread and parmesean encrusted sticks\n\nservice: this is what set cut apart frmo anything i've experienced. the service was so on point i honestly thought they had to serve in the military before they could be considered for a position here. everything they said was articulated very well, and my glass was never even half empty - always with cold water etc. \n\nthe most impressive part was the serving of our food and at the end of our main course. they came around with 1 server per 2 people and served the entire table with our food and sides in a span of about 15 seconds - ridiculous. \n\nthen, as soon as the last person's fork hit the deck on their meal, they immediately asked if we were finished and cleaned out the whole table with multiple servers in about 5 seconds. i honestly couldn't believe it, and it was a spectacle to see. very personal service and much appreciated - worthy of mr. wolfgang puck for sure.\n\nall in all, i would give this place more than 5 stars if i could. shoot, i could give it 5 stars just for the service, thats how awesome the experience was. i cannot wait to come again!", 
            "we experienced cut on new years eve after our friends' wedding earlier in the day.   our reservation for 7 was for 7:30p but when i stopped in at the restaurant to check in at 6:30, i was told that our table was ready anytime we were.  good thing, as this was quite the leisurely meal, we soon found out. \n\nwe were seated at the farthest table in the corner of the room. the seating arrangement worked nicely, although i nearly took out a waiter and a patron as the hostess attempted to make conversation over her shoulder with me, while whisking us through the restaurant.  \n\nour servers introduced themselves to us and asked about drinks.   we requested a wine list and started to peruse the menu.  shortly thereafter, we received the explanation of the beefs cuts and what we could expect to taste, as well as how their meats were prepared.  this should have been my first clue for my own meal.  \n\nafter what seemed like an eternity(nearly a half hour), our waiter returned to collect drink orders.  3 glasses of red wine (2 cab, 1 pinot), a beer, and 3 waters.   we waited 10-15 minutes for those to arrive, and then went about ordering our food.  once ordered, we received breads - oooooh so delicious(i'm sure you've read about them here on other reviews)!   breadsticks on the table proved to be messy to eat, as parmesan flaked everywhere.    \n\nwe ordered a few appetizers including the beet salad, <mark>Pink Lady & Fuji Apple Salad</mark>, and <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark> salad, <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, and the maryland blue crab & <mark>Maryland Blue Crab & Carolina Shrimp 'Louis' Cocktail</mark>.   each were delicious and stood soundly with excellent flavor and texture. \n\nour group ordered all different cuts of beef, including the prime porthouse for 2, petit cut filet, and more.  for 7 people, we also ordered 4 side dishes - 2 <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> and 2 mac & cheese. \n\nthis is where things started to fail.  \n\nthe meals were served to the wrong diners, to start.  once the first plate was incorrectly set down, the rest of the team of servers failed.. including one server who set down my \"pork\" in front of me, which was not pork, but bone in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>.   what??  ugh.   from there, there was some swapping of plates and a quick discussion of what went where.  chaos. \n\nthe sides were then served to each diner.  i'm not certain about you, but i like more than a tablespoon of potatoes when i'm served a 20oz <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>.    that's all that was available, though, so we made do.  the potatoes tasted delicious, as did the mac & cheese, which was stringy and difficult for the waiter to serve. \n\nthe kitchen seems to have a problem cooking their meat to the correct temperature.  the petit filet my friend ordered medium, was rare in the middle. i know this is an easy thing to have happen to filet.. but this is cut.  a $52 piece of meat should be prepared correctly!   \n\nmy <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>? wow.. very sad.  i had to physically saw through the char on the steak to get a piece that was not hard and crusted over, and overseasoned.   i'm not a fan of charred meat to begin with but a light char on this piece would have been appropriate.   i was sad to have to leave hunks of  meat behind because they were too tough to even cut through, despite having paid $64. \n\nthe porterhouse for two, for the bride and groom, was cooked inconsistently as well, even though it was ordered medium... one side was rare and the other medium/medium-well.\n\nwith three diners only drinking water, one would think that the servers would be attentive to their glasses and watch for empty.  heck, we've seen better service at applebees when it comes to water.  my husband is a stickler for having a drink at all times, and the service here was an epic fail in that department.  it was so random, the servers would come by, fill up one water glass and neglect two others on the table.  i expected that they ran out of water, but no.. they just moved on to another table and poured more water for another patron.  what the heck?\n\nby the end of our meal, we'd lost a server completely (hadn't seen him in quite a while), and the other, more jovial one, was notified that we were disappointed that they couldn't keep glasses filled, and that the service was lacking.  \ni've eaten at numerous high end places in my day.. this is not one we'll be returning to, sadly.  i have found other steakhouses in vegas to be as comparably priced with excellent cuts of meat and far better service. \n\nwe were seated at our table at 6:30p.  we finally left around 9:30p.  while i'm glad they didn't rush us through, i can now see why they didn't have a reason to.", 
            "before cut the only vegas steak places i had been to were carne vino (amzing) and envy (terrible). i came to vegas to interview for a job and the guy who recruited me took me to cut for dinner. it was very, very good.\n\ni ordered two different bourbon drinks- i think both had ginger- they don't appear to be on the menu anymore but one was similar to the samurai they serve now. both were delicious. \n\ni got a <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> appetizer- it came with a raspberry sauce on the pork that was incredible- one of the best <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> dishes i have ever had. \n\ni alwyas get bone in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> and potato side when i go to a new steak place for comparison purposes. the steak here didn't have as much of a crust as i would like but it was seasoned well and the meat was very well cooked. the <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> was smooth, not lumpy, seasoned well. \n\nfor desert they brought us free baked alaska because they \"like to take care of thier locals\"- i wasn't a local yet but with food like this i was well on my way to becoming one. it was excellent- baked alaska is a personal favorite of mine and this one was very well done. \n\nlet me say one other thing- the bread. bread can be a good way to distinguish good restaurants from great and cut definately nails it. they have a few different types that seem to rotate from what i can tell (pretzel is one of the best) and they bring it around on a cart. you can get whatever you want, as much as you want. this is good- it avoids fights to the death over the last <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> bread a la gordon ramsay steak. \n\ni have since been back 3-4 times and enjoyed it thoroughly every time. \n\n\na general note on vegas steak - some of the negative reviews of cut are just ludicrous. they didn't have a1? well guess what, you are gonna get a1 almost nowhere when it comes to fine dining. the steak came by itself on a plate without any circles painted on the plate or sliced up vegetables constructed like legos into an art piece? its a steak house. seriously, if you have no idea where you are going its not really fair to post a negative review that boils down to \"this place wasn't the perfect hybrid of sizzler and alinea i was hoping for\". steak places in vegas are producing a very specific product to compete with a very specific set of restaurants. if you want a cheaper place with a1 why are you going to cut? similarly if you care about plating why are you going to a steak restaurant? use your brain.", 
            "finally, a modern streak house thanks to mr. puck. make sure to make a reservation since seating is limited. eating at wolfgang restaurants can be cliche as far as what's expected, but cut is mind blowing for endless reasons. the service was impeccable since brian, my waiter really worked and expressed his efforts. although i felt bad since he was seating, he really did try his best. everyone was extremely attentive. \n\nthe ambiance is very dark/intimate but i also felt a modern office type of vibe. i thought it was rather tacky that there were large framed portfolio head shots around the restaurant of actors such as brad pitt. really threw me off since the concept of the restaurant did not mesh well with those portraits. who cares ? \n\nthe bar area is very tight, it was too small for my liking. \n\nthe food is ultimately what one should care about. be warned to throw them benjamin's for a quick sensation in that mouth that is worth it. as soon as you are, like all wolf gang establishments, you are greeted with an assortment of breads. \n\nlooking at the menu may seem daunting but don't stress out, just order something that won't surprise you. there are many cuts of meat that are offered but it would be best to order the waygu. it's hard to describe through words but wow, it was very tender. it was also a generous cut. \n\nsadly, i was not a fan of paying $2.00 for dressing up the meat aka you get to choose from the following...\n\n<mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark>       \n<mark>Wasabi-Yuzu Kosho Butter</mark>       \n<mark>Shallot-Red Wine Bordelaise</mark>       \narmagnac & <mark>Armagnac & Green Peppercorn</mark>       \n<mark>Argentinean Chimichurri</mark>       \n<mark>Creamy Horseradish</mark>       \nb\\u00e9arnaise  \n\ni was not trying to f up my order by exploring different sauces so i was smart enough to pick something i am familiar with which was the chimichurri. it went perfectly with the waygu. if you are on a budget, the u.s.d.a. prime, \"double r ranch\", loomis, washington, corn fed, aged 28 days <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark> 12 oz is another good option. \n\nthe side options were not that impressive, as far as the options go. i couldn't go wrong by ordering the <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>. yes, this intact did melt in my mouth. very rich and creamy. \n\ni also recommend the  <mark>Pan Roasted Stonington Maine Lobster</mark>, maryland blue crab & carolina shrimp \"louis\" cocktail, spicy tomato-horseradish. the combinations of this palter worked really well and the presentation was very impressive. this actually takes a long time for preparation which you will understand why after that first sip. \n\ni don't know if i would return here just because there are too many other restaurant's to experience. i have not a single complaint.", 
            "came here with the bf and a friend. this place is good, but i think falls a little short of the 4 stars. \n\nthe pretzel bread they offer is awesome. i like dipping it in the mustard offerings. i also like the onion foccacia bread. i like that they come around with a bread plate to give you as much as you like of any of the breads. most places give you a basket, and it's never enough of the one bread you like and too much of the breads you don't like. \n\nthe friend and i got the american wagyu center cut <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> medium rare. the flavor is incomparable. my bf got the 12 oz omaha <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, which was also very delicious. the omaha was more butter, but the flavor of the wagyu was bolder. we got the sides of the <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> and <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>. the mushrooms had shishito peppers in them that we all felt didn't really complement the flavors of the mushrooms. the mushrooms on their own were good though. the <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> was decent. \n\nservice is stellar here though. they don't miss a beat at all. \n\noverall, i was happy we came, and i ate a lot of steak! :)", 
            "i did not think that this restaurant was anything special. far from it. i was expecting an amazing cut of steak that was seasoned to perfection and could be cut with a butter knife. boy was i wrong....\n\ni will say that the atmosphere is nice, but, i did not like that each place setting was resting on a place mat that looked like it belonged at an outdoor patio table. the knives were also fairly dull, it was very hard to cut my steak with it. \n\ni ordered the nebraska <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> strip 14oz as medium rare ($57), when it arrived along with our sides (man and cheese, <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>, and seasoned asparagus) i was disappointed. the steak was bland with little to no seasoning. i had to coat it with some sea salt, cracked pepper, and a little butter. \n\nthe asparagus was not tender enough and lacked any real flavors. i was in shock when the bill arrived and i noticed that 7 stalks of asparagus cost $21!! the mac and cheese was nothing to write home about either, it was $19 for a decent sized portion. the <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> was bland, it literally tasted like mucky potato and cost $12. \n\ni know we were going with the expectation of spending a lot of money, but for the money i was hoping to be blown away. i still believe that a place like longhorn steakhouse or texas roadhouse had better tasting steak.\n\nif you are looking to spend and arm and a leg for sub-par food, then i would suggest going to cut.", 
            "another amazing steakhouse. the restaurant is beautiful and the food is very tasty. always enjoying a bottle of wine with dinner, the corkage fee is not ridiculous. it was nice to see a steakhouse with such an amazing selection of dry aged beef; which you cannot find everywhere. my wife and i shared the 21 day aged porterhouse steak. delicious, delicious. shared <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> and <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>. could not be more satisfied. we are going back to vegas for labor day and will most likely be going back if we can at least for desert. stop in for a good time.", 
            "six months ago, i proclaimed del frisco's as the best steakhouse in las vegas. that may very well still hold true; however, the best steak goes to cut. hey, there's precedence of the mvp going to the losing team: jerry west in 1969 in the nba finals, chuck howley in 1971 in super bowl v (and now cut).\n\nthe steak here is unlike any i've tried. it is a triple-threat, five-tool star player as they would say in the sports world. while there were several cuts, ages, and locations to choose from, i went with one of their more popular ones, the 14 oz ny sirloin aged 35 days from nebraska. the aspect that makes this steak so magical is the crust. oh, my god, dat crust! it was so crispy and charred on the outside with great seasonings while maintaining the perfect medium-rare on the inside. you can have additional sauces and toppings, but plain is all you need for flavor. \n\nservice was excellent as would be expected from a wolfgang puck restaurant. we added on a couple of classic steak sides including the creamed spinach with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> and <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> to round out our meal. the addition of the <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> was a nice touch to an already delicious side dish. bonus points for the complimentary puff pastry and small bite desserts to end our meal. i've been wanting to try this steakhouse for a couple of years now, but reservations were tough to come by, but we finally managed to snag one this friday at 10:30 pm so book them early.",

            "i think the hype for this restaurant dampened my experience. the interior was nice, very roomy, love the decor, simple yet classy. and the service was excellent, the server was very charming :-) so one star for that. they have a wide selection of wine and drinks. but for the price of over $100 a person, the <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> ($61) was a lil overcooked, and the <mark>Caramelized Onions</mark> contained too much honey, making it for a overpowering sweetened flavor. i ordered the true japanese wagyu beef from kagoshima ($160) and although i know that it is suppose to be so fatty and that's why people enjoy it, i personally felt that it was way too fatty towards the end, and couldn't finish it because it upset my stomach. i don't really know how anyone can finish a whole one to themselves. i guess it would've tasted better if it was shared where everyone takes only a bite or two . the lamb chop ($48) was waaaayyy too overcooked, but yet we saw many tables ordering it. although i don't particularly enjoy flan, everyone seemed to have thoroughly enjoyed the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan with mushroom marmalade and parseley salad. most of the sides with your entree is about $12-13 each side, the <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>, <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>, sweet <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>, french fries, <mark>Soft Polenta with Parmesan</mark>, creamed spinach with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>...etc were good but i felt that it was nothing special.   their garlic bread appetizer and tuna tartar was delicious but not worth $24 a plate. the shrimp  in the <mark>Maryland Blue Crab & Carolina Shrimp 'Louis' Cocktail</mark> was not fresh and i've had better garlic fries at gordan biersh.the one appetizer we ordered 3 plates of, one after another, because it was sooo amazing was the kobe steak sashimi (definitely worth $22 a plate, and i suggest this is a must try! but for those that don't like eating raw meat, trust... it'll change your whole view on it) - overall great experience, but i just feel that it is nothing special especially for how costly it is- and too much hype.", 
            "went with a party of 7 on a monday night.  service was outstanding..it felt like we had 2 waiters per person!  i sat on the end so i got to see the waiters serve wine, prepare someone's lobster from shell to plate, refill voss sparkling and still water, etc...\namuse: cheese puffs...nothing special.\ncocktail: can't remember the name, but it was citron, sweet n sour, limoncello and amaretto..with a cinnamon-rimmed glass...soo good\nwine: bottle of red, yummy- not sure what is was because it was picked out before i arrived, went well with beef of course\nbreads: choice of pretzel, onion focaccia, pumpernickel, and sourdough. i went with pretzel - very soft and yummy, but not warm.\nappetizer: <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark>...super delicious reddest tuna i have seen, covered in beautiful avocado slices and masago, with 4 corners of plate covered with baby sliced radishes and cucumbers, ginger, wasabi, and kaiware sprouts + togarashi toasts\nentree: the disappointment of the evening.  i ordered the 8-hour slow-cooked kobe beef short ribs \"indian style\" - served on pureed mint \"raita\" and corn puree.  the curry sauce was wayyyyy too strong...ruined the meat flavor and made it hard to stomach.  the meat was cooked well but really, i could barely touch it.  i know it is a steakhouse so i probably should have gotten a steak, but my stomach didn't agree with that idea so i went with something easier to chew :)\nsides: i picked out the <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> and shisito peppers which i thought were amazing.  i also really liked the cavatappi mac n cheese, and the <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>.  didn't try the fries.  the sauteed spinach and polenta were tasteless.\ndessert: ice cream sandwich with cherry coke float (i only tried the float) and bruleed banana cream pie (i had some banana with chocolate caviar crisp things, that much of it was tasty).\nthe servers brought out more little rectangular bars that i had no room for, but one was \"upscale snickers,\" key lime pie, and chocolate fudge.\nservice: very thorough.  intimidating when sides came out as each side had a waiter bombarding each person at the table with \"do you want some of this?\"  water was refilled asap, and all of the servers knew who had sparkling and who had still.  when cocktails were finished, the glasses were removed quickly.  servers were friendly, information on each steak was provided before we ordered, and the waiters made sure we knew what sides were ordered when it was our turn so we could get something else for the table.\nother: the other person who ordered short ribs didn't like them either.  the lady who ordered lobster said it took so long for the server to take it from shell to plate that it was very cold.  also, they delivered 4 types of mustard and did not explain who or what they were for, but charged for other sauces.\nsummary: i would return as everything but my entree was flavorful and the service was decent.  the drinks were great too.  i would probably work out for 8 hours and fast so i could fit a steak in, but at least my kobe was tender - if it was just in the mint and corn purees and without the curry i bet it would have been simple and fantastic.", 
            "to start, most the negative reviews i've read on here are written by people who don't know about high-quality steak. it's supposed to be marbled with fat -- that's where you get the flavor. and it's supposed to be charred dark on the outside -- it's not burnt but quickly charred to keep the flavor & juiciness in. \n\nthat said, our meal at cut was one of the best dining experiences we've had in a very long time, if not ever.\n\nfirst, we got a great big booth, just the 2 of us, and the atmosphere is very nice -- modern, hip -- even the music is classic rock. i love the little pedestal sinks in the bathroom, and he loved the dining room chandeliers.\n\na breadstick basket with cheese sticks arrived -- delicious -- followed by the best gougeres (cheese puffs) i've ever had. they were made of/in puff pastry, which is unusual, & so good. then, after we ordered, the bread tray with fantastic pretzel bread & focaccia, which we devoured, knowing damn well the meal would be filling. and, oh, it was.\n\nhe had the <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> with avocado on top -- a healthy & delicious portion of both. i had thinly slices asparagus on brioche with a soft-boiled egg & bacon vinagrette on top -- oh my god, it was amazing. i absolutely devoured it. all the flavors came together and made for orgasmically explosive bites.\n\nthen his dry-aged 16-oz bone-in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> & my <mark>Double Thick Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark>. both were thick, juicy, moist, cooked just right, and fantastic. our <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark> on the side were a bit superfluous, but, dipped in panko, we had to eat them cautiously so as not to fill up on such deliciousness. \n\nsomehow, we made room for dessert, and good thing. best chocolate souffle i've ever had -- served in its own little sauce pan. his apricot/blackberry crumble, with a shortbread crumble, wasn't so bad either. :)\n\nas for service, it was perfect. it was timed just right so that we got our appetizers pretty quickly but had some time to digest before dinner. the servers were all attentive, and there were many of them, and the presentation was fantastic, very old-world steakhouse elegant with tableside presentation, dishes all served simultaneously, and everything presented just right. he also loved his martini with blue-cheese-stuffed olives. both our wines were great. a little pricey by the glass, but that was no surprise.\n\nwe were a little hesitant to try cut because a) it's not so cheap, and b) wolfgang puck has spread himself a bit thin over the last 10+ years, and some restaurants have suffered because of it.\n\ncut is not one of those restaurants.", 
            "there's a couple of things to mention first: \n1.  i don't tend to like wolfgang puck restaurants - at least not since dining at spago in the mid 90s.  he puts his name on a lot and i don't know that he pays attention to any of his endeavors.\n2.  we can be food snobs - we live in san francisco and visit vegas frequently.  we have dined in many fine restaurants over time.  we always have high expectations in restaurants where the per head bill is over $100.\n\nso what was our verdict?  while we had very high expectations, we were not prepared to be totally blown away, which is what happened.\n\nit really was a perfect evening.  the service, which is done in teams without anyone missing a beat, was incredibly attentive but not intrusive.  the food was superlative.  the atmosphere was hip, modern and pleasant.  \n\nto start, don't fill up on the bread - and there's lots of it - from parmesan covered breadsticks, to cheese in puff pastry, to the bread basket with pretzels, breads and foccacia, you can make a meal of the bread.\n\nthe food was also not as expected.  it's hard to put inventive twists on normal dishes, but they managed to do so.  the <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> had unique flavors, came with great toast crisps and wasabi aoili.  it also had beautiful slices of avocado on top and presented as a perfect terrine.  normally portions for appetizers, particularly raw tuna, are very small - this was not.  and the taste was outstanding.  i had <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> the previous night at another great restaurant and it didn't compare.\n\nthe asparagus salad was so nicely presented it was almost a shame to cut into it.  each of the very thin, tender asparagus spears were perfectly lined up on a piece of brioche with a perfectly cooked poached egg gently placed on top.  \n\ni had the dry aged nebraska <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> (boneless) 16 oz.  it was a beautiful piece of meat, perfectly char grilled medium rare and with very little fat.  it was juicy, tender and perfect.  my wife had the korobuta <mark>Double Thick Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark>.  korobuta pork is the kobe beef of pork.  it was also moist, juicy and tasted great.  our sides?  fingerling potatoes with bacon confit and <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>.  both of them were perfect, but the <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark> were phenomenal.  \n\nnow my wife is a chocolate snob - she has very high standards for chocolate desserts.  she was driven to orgasmic delight by the chocolate souffle.  i, who don't like chocolate all that much, thought it was great too.\n\ni had trouble deciding between the lemon filled doughnuts and peach/blackberry crumble with 50 bean vanilla ice cream.  the waitress steered me towards the crumble and it was wonderful... they bring it out in a hot metal baking dish and spoon it into a bowl at the table.\n\nwe found out why the waitress steered me away from the doughnuts... it was my birthday and they brought me out a birthday dessert sampler which had, among other things, a lemon custard filled doughnut... the waitress was great about not spoiling the surprise and allowing me to enjoy both desserts i wanted.  \n\nso some final thoughts: \n1.  don't go if you aren't prepared for a very expensive evening - it's not cheap.  if the price tag will ruin your experience then this isn't the place for you.\n2.  the wait staff was excellent.  we were never steered to the most expensive items, she listened to what we told her our tastes were and made recommendations based on that.\n3.  if you have a martini, the <mark>Point Reyes Blue Cheese</mark> stuffed olives are incredible.\n4.  there is a big difference between wet aged, dry aged and kobe beef.  they explained very well all the differences and will help guide you to a great experience if you let them.  let them know your preferences in seasoning as well as in flavor and cooking style.  they really will try to do it your way...\n5.  a la carte is what every steakhouse does.  as annoying as it is, cut isn't the only one to do it.  if a la carte will bother you, then this may not be the place for you.  \n6.  this is both a great place for a romantic dinner and a great place for a group get together.  \n7.  this is a great place to just go and enjoy a fine meal and let the troubles of the world (and the losses at the tables) melt away.  go and enjoy!", 
            "i was really excited to try this place as i had heard a lot of great things about it.  i went with a group of nine hungry people and tasted the following items on the menu:\n\n- <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan\n- bite of the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> dumpling in ox tail bouillon\n- kobe <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> w/<mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> on the side\n- mac n cheese\n- <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>\n- creamed spinach\n- saut\\u00e9ed spinach\n- caramelized corn\n\nunfortunately i was less then impressed.  the place was swanky as expected and the service was right on point (except one huge thing that happened which i'll mention in a bit) but the food was sub par.  i liked the decor but the only thing was that it was difficult to get into and out of the seats as the chairs were heavy and hard to maneuver around...not a big deal though.  i was most disappointed by the food and service.  let's say i wouldn't recommend this restaurant out of all of the other restaurants on the strip.  \n\nthey first served three or four different types of breads while waiting for our appetizers.  i tried their pretzel and onion bread which was so delicious and warm.  i started off with the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan served with toasted bread which was tasty.  i also had a bite of the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> dumpling which was good too.  then the steaks came out and it was a disaster!  one of the most important things about the preparation of any type of meat is temperature, as we all know, especially at a steakhouse and let me tell you, it was a complete wreck.  i had ordered a medium-rare steak and it literally came out medium-well while my friends who ordered medium steaks came out borderline rare.  after trying to suck it up and eat my well-done steak, my friends told me i should really tell the server.  i finally got myself to tell him (i don't ever send food back to the kitchen...i feel so bad) but he told me that my steak was medium-rare like i didn't know what i was talking about.  it was pretty ridiculous because it was no joke, wayyy overdone.  i didn't push it and ended up trading steaks with my friend who ordered a medium and got a borderline rare steak.  on top of that, i didn't think the steak was flavorful enough and there was nothing special about their <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark>...to me it was like bbq sauce.  with that said, i would like to note that other than the steak incident which was terribly handled, the service was great.\n\nas for the sides, their mac n cheese, creamed spinach and corn were very tasty while the <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark> were not so great (but then again they're just <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>) and sauteed spinach was bland.\n\ni would like to mention that a lot of people did enjoy their food so it may have just been the temperature of my steak and how they were unwilling to do anything about it when it was obviously well overdone but come on, we're at a steakhouse right?!?!  and honestly, i've tasted way better steak...i really wanted to like this restaurant but it failed in my books.", 
            "okay, i love love love steak and i don't mind paying an arm and a leg for it when it tastes amazing... unfortunately this place \"cut\" did not deliver. the only positive i have to say about this restaurant is that the service was impeccable but when you're spending $70-$150 for a steak it should be. this list of con's is many: wayyyy over priced for what you get, ugly strange d\\u00e9cor, uncomfortable chairs (that look like lawn furniture), small tasteless side dishes, crappy overpriced salads and appetizers, and charred overcooked steaks (which should be a crime).\n\nmy biggest complaint? their steak... come on people, this is a freaking steakhouse! you've got to be able to get at least the steak right!!! i ordered my steak (<mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>) medium, you know, so there is some pink in the middle? apparently the chef didn't get the memo because my steak came out as black as coal, charred to a crisp, and well done for sure. literally... i had to use the knife like a saw to cut through the steak, certainly not melt in your mouth like they advertise. once you cut into it the steak was dry and chewy... i am not stretching when i say i have had better steak at outback! several other people at the table commented on how hard it was to cut their steaks, how black and charred their steaks were, and how hard they were to chew. \n\ni also ordered a crab salad with my meal which was $30 bucks and tasted really bad... the crab was good but everything else they mixed with it including this mushy cheese mixture was horrible. i picked out the crab and left everything else. other people in my party ordered the asparagus <mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark>, the heirloom <mark>Pink Lady & Fuji Apple Salad</mark>, and the <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark> avocado salad as appetizers and said they were just ho-hum. \n\nthe side dishes are ridiculous, they are supposed to serve 3 but really only serve 1 and are expensive... we had to order 8 side dishes for 10 people and we only got a few bites each. their potatoes were watery and not very appealing, their mac-and-cheese was okay but i don't think it was any better than kraft's mac and cheese, and their <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark> were blah... they should call them flavorless onion strings! \n\ni realize this review has been quite harsh but come on wolfgang, we expect more from you! when you are spending $200+ per person the meal should be truly amazing and not a charred small portioned mess!\n\nthink twice about going here... there are so many other amazing steakhouses in vegas that far surpass this one.", 
            "the hottie and i have been meaning to try cut for awhile.  we finally went on our last trip to vegas.  based upon the reviews we started with the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan.  it was simply one of the best dishes i've ever had anywhere.  then, we decided to get the porterhouse steak for two.  caveat.... the waiter told us that we are supposed to order the steak one notch rarer than we normally would like it because they let the steak sit for 10 minutes after its done so it will cook a bit more.  since the hottie and i are both medium rare people, we ordered the porterhouse rare.  it looked and smelled amazing when the steak finally came to the table!  truthfully, i thought the steak was kinda in between rare and medium rare.  but the <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> portion may have been the best <mark>Petit Cut <mark>Filet Mignon 6 Oz</mark> 8 Oz</mark> i've had.  so tender, so juicy, with a flavorful crisp on the outside.  yum!  the <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> portion was also very good although a bit too rare for me.  we also ordered three sides... creamed spinach, <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>, <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>.  i thought they were all ok but nothing to write home about.  all in all, a top notch meal.", 
            "my friend wanted to have one really nice dinner for his vegas bday weekend.  we all love steak, so we decided to make reservations at cut.  i had just dined at alexander's( http://www.yelp.com/biz/alexanders-steakhouse-cupertino#hrid:zgok0ixxx8fog1fdfdmgka/src:self ) a few weeks prior and loved it, so i had super high expectations for cut.  we had a party of eight, so we called in for reservations ahead of time. \n\nservice here is definitely outstanding.  there were so many servers waiting on us, i couldn't keep track.  our water glasses were always full, and your napkin would always be folded if you got out of your seat.  our waiter brought out a platter to display the different cuts of wagyu beef....kobe vs. american...so we could see the different marbling.    \n\nfor my first course, i ordered the <mark>Roasted Weiser Farms Baby Beets</mark>, humboldt fog goat cheese, pistachio, citrus, micro basil,  & mint.  i originally was going to get the usda prime <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark>, but it was only $20 more for the american wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>....i was sold.  i added the <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> to top off my lovely piece of steak.  our table also ordered saut\\u00e9ed baby spinach, <mark>Soft Polenta with Parmesan</mark> and <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>.\n\nmy beet appetizer had a very nice presentation.  it was very colorful, and all of the ingredients complimented each other very well.  all of our sides were very tasty.  the polenta was nice and creamy, <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark> were crispy, and the spinach added the \"healthy\" factor to our meal.\n\nthey prepare the steaks over a hard wood and charcoal grill and then finish them off in a broiler.  my steak was cooked to a nice medium rare, and it melted in my mouth.  the steak had great flavor, but i didn't really care much for the charred flavor from the broiler.  the <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> i added went well with my steak and kept it moist from the sauce.  i wasn't able to finish my steak and gave it to my friends who had the usda prime <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>.  they were amazed and could totally tell the difference from the wagyu.\n\nthe only disappointment i had here was that they didn't have foie gras as an add on to your steak.  i was spoiled by alexander's, and left the restaurant craving that melt in your mouth foie gras.  i was so expecting a 5 star dinner here, but i just couldn't give it to them.  please add foie gras to the menu!",

            "visited this wolfgang puck restaurant in january of 2010. three of us in the party. made reservations a week before on opentable.com. we were on time and greated by the hostess when we walked in. restaurant and lounge was full. it was ces week so vegas is usually jammed that week. the hostess originally tried to seat us in the lounge. i was like \"nah\". moved promptly to a nice table in the back of the dining room near the private dining room (which was full with employees from one of the companies at ces). kind of off to the side it was nice and quiet so i could talk to my parents. the table was off balance and every time we tapped it, it would tilt. one of the servers fixed that quick with a folded cocktail napkin right after i pointed it out. good. \n\nfinally unto the meal. my parents do not drink so i rarely do when dining with them. no problems. a round of diet cokes for all. typical bar soda in a high end restaurant. there were a few different servers. everyone works together. the main server brought out a tray to show of the differences in the marbling meat. from kobe beef to wagyu and the dry aged. \n\nsome breadsticks on the table were ok. the bread is awesome. pretzel bread with the different mustard's they put on the table are excellent. they served 4 other types of bread too. all fresh and flavorful. my dad loves his bread. so we had the bread guy come back and fill our plates 3 times throughout the meal. for an app we all split the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>. very tender and cooked well. enough for two not for three. \n\nthen for the steak action. i know my steaks. my first job, a week after i turned 16, was in an old school meat market. all through high school and college i worked in numerous meat departments of retail establishments. so with that said i obviously had to get the <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark> tasting. three portions, three types of cow. at the time, cut had legit a9 kobe beef from japan on the menu. they gave you 2oz. awesome! melt in your mouth. crazy flavor i have never tasted before in beef. 2nd portion was 4oz of american wagyu beef. totally different. a little more beef flavor. the last, was the 4oz portion of dry aged prime corn fed sirloin. again different in flavor and texture. most beef like and recognizable.  still a mighty fine steak. seasoned well with some s&p (salt and pepper). that's all you need for a high end steak like these. i ordered these medium. cooked fine. finished hot. some different <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> were served along side. i tried them each but the steaks did not need them.\n\nmom got a 21 day aged 8oz filet. def looked bigger. she likes it \"mooing\". she did not finish it so i took control of the situation. dad got a strip steak. not sure on the size or aging. \n\nin a nice steakhouse sides are a la carte. no prob. served family style works. we got <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>, creamed spinach with an egg on top ( which was broken and mixed in upon serving), and the <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>. everything was served at once, with multiple servers all explaining everything from the types of steaks we ordered, the sauces, and the sides. they served the sides on our plates and we enjoyed. it was steakhouse overload for me. i freaked out and sent all the staff away from me. \n\nwe were all stuffed from all the food. we did not have dessert. next time. thanks to my dad for picking up the tab, as he always does.", 
            "i have been waiting to try this place and finally got to go with a group of friends in las vegas. the decor and service is what you would expect from a restaurant of this caliber...top notch. there was a beat that was missed by the staff and everything was perfect. with regard to the food, i had expected a little more. \n\nwe started with the <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> and a special of blue crab claws. the tartare was excellent however there was really no wow factor and nothing that set it apart from something you would find at any other restaurant. the crab was just that...crab claws. basically a bowl with some crab claws...they weren't even pre-cracked. as much as i love going through cracking shell fish, this wasn't the restaurant i was planning on doing it in and again i had hoped for something more than simply claws. \n\nnext up were the sides (i'll save the steak for last). we each picked something and got the french fries, <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>, swiss chard and autumn root veggies. the chard and the root veggies were good but the fries and rings were completely disappointing. easily something we all took a taste off and could have been happy not having any more of. again nothing special here and no wow factor. \n\nfinally the steak. i ended up with the bone in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> from illinois...rare. this was a fantastic piece of meat. my only complaint here was that they went a little heavy on the seasoning. \n\nthe wine list was incredible. i didnt want to hold the table up as i picked a bottle but i honestly could have read through it for a good 30 minutes. i stayed in the sub $100 range for a bottle and was able to pick an excellent one...but beware as there is little choice in that category. \n\nif i go back i would stay out of the appetizer and side sections and just focus on the meat...and ask them to go light with the seasoning.", 
            "we came here to celebrate my 30th birthday during our vegas trip.\n\nthe place really is beautiful and the service is impeccable, although our main server was a bit stuffy.  the pretzel roll was amazing and we asked for more of those.  husby and i shared the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, which was succulent and porky.  the maple gave it a bit of sweetness to cut the fattiness.\n\ni also ordered the 9 oz wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> with <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> and creamed spinach.  it was very rich and had an incredibly smooth texture.  the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> probably was a bit too much for the wagyu, to be honest.  the <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark> were thin and crispy, while the spinach was decent.  i tried husby's bone-in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> but it was not cooked medium-rare and it was a bit tough.  i would have expected a much better cut of meat for the price.  the wine was also marked up way too much and i didn't receive the wine i ordered.  however, the wine i did try was not impressive.\n\nfor my birthday, i received a free half baked alaska dessert and thought it was terrible.  i cannot imagine that particular dish is famous because it tasted very bland.\n\noverall, i'm not sure it was worth the price but it was a lovely experience.", 
            "came here for a birthday dinner celebration.  no doubt the steaks are prime quality.  could have been seasoned a little bit better for my taste.  the extra $2 for sauces is a little tacky for a high end restaurant.  honestly, the sides are mediocre except for the <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>. best i ever had!  i believe the side dishes at maestro's are tops.  desserts were average; had the chocolate souffle and banana cream pie.  service very snooty; you pay $1450 for dinner, i expect some rapport with the customer.  for the money, i think you can do better at other steakhouses eg maestros.", 
            "some friends  and i were in vegas last weekend for julie v. birthday. we all decided to dine at cut to celebrate! cut was a great experience. probably one of the best steaks i have ever eaten.\n\nupon arrival we were quickly seated. we have a reservation for 9. the service was great. they are very attentive and helpful. they even took the time to bring out some of their wagyu steaks for use to see prior to ordering. they are helpful in explaining the differences in the meat quality.\n\nthe food was great. i ordered the american wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, which is a hybrid between american angus beef and wagyu cattle. the was one minor problem in that some of our steaks were cooked over. we all ordered medium rare and a few came out closer to medium. however our server quickly replaced our steaks with new ones. and to be honest the overcooked steak still tasted great. i seriously contemplated just eating the steak. but ultimately decide to ask for a new one, considering it cost $90. when the replacement came the meat was just delicious! \n\nwe also ordered a large selection of sides, which are served family style. i loved the spinach and the <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>. the only side dish nobody really liked was the potato tarte tatin. it was a bit on the salty side.\n\noverall great experience. i look forward to dining at cut in the future. in terms of meat quality, it far surpasses anything i have had. in the future i really want to try their 100% wagyu steak.", 
            "best steak i've ever eaten is the petite cut tiler mignon at cut! the meat just melts in your mouth. sides i tried:\n\n-- roasted baby beet salad\n-- <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>\n-- creamed spinach\n-- mac and cheese\n\ni highly recommend all of these! my mouth is watering just thinking about all the delicious food.", 
            "restaurant was beautiful and staff was nice. service was good too they were very attentive. the food i thought was ok. if i could i'd  give them 3.5 stars. i had the wagyu center <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> med-rare and it was presented rare. i asked it to be refired and it came back better but rare.  granted was a thick cut but it's a expensive steak joint so it should be perfect. also the use a 5 spice rub on their steaks that i did not like at all. the waiter did mention this upon ordering, so i thought try it. i am picky when it comes to steak and am weary of steak rubs on prime/ wagyu steaks. sides were pretty good we had the <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark> and mac n cheese. sides were plenty for 2-3 people. they get the extra half star for the dessert. i had the berry cobbler...delish! overall it was good but prob would not go back.", 
            "a cut above the rest. \n\nimpressions:\ni was fortunate enough to have some spare time in vegas during a bachelor party to take a break from debauchery and get my steak fix here.  every time i step into cut  the culture of the restaurant is prevalent in each one of it's staff members. you will receive prompt  and very cordial service from the beautiful hostess staff.  the wait staff is extremely knowledgeable in their menu and their confidence in their preferences is much appreciated.  they really listen to what you desire to feast on, and will work with you to find what's best for that occasion.\n\nthe meal:\n\nbreads-  i tried two of the many breads they had to offer, the focaccia was a bit to soggy for my liking so i only took a bite and placed it aside, but the pretzel bread bites they offer are pretty amazing.  you know the feeling you get when you spend 10 dollars on a pretzel at a ballgame and you feel like you are chewing on a rope?  eating this pretzel at cut will make you regret eating any other pretzel rendition of any type in your life.  if pretzels were like highlanders and there could only be one, this would be it!\n\nsides- <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>-being from texas i love all things fried, the <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark> were good but i was hoping the cut of the onion would have been bigger.  the presentation was beautiful as they stacked the <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark> on top of each other about 8 inches into the air.  the tempura fry worked well with the onions as the batter was light and the salt was melted into them. nothing to go crazy over here.\n\nbrocellini- typically i order some sort of a grilled asparagus variation to accompany my steak into my stomach but i wanted to change it up and try something different.  the brocellini was sauteed and came with a few sun dried tomatoes and it had a mild vinaigrette drizzled on top to  cut some of the sharpness of the vegetable.   it looked as good as it tasted.\n\nthe main event- i selected the 20oz. aged bone in rib-eye and it did not disappoint, this is my go to choice for steak due to the good fat content this cut has.  if you like your steaks on the rare side be wary because this cut will be extremely rare more towards the bone due to the nature of the cut.  i was recommended to get the steak cooked at a medium rare and it was fantastic.  the steak was seared perfectly on both sides and it was cooked consistently throughout. i got the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> as a compliment to the steak and they give you an ample amount, using it as spread accented each bite perfectly.\n\ndo yourself a favor and the next time you are in the city of sin, get yourself a piece of heaven at cut.",

            "came here w/ a party of 5 for a birthday celebration.\n\n5 stars for service, 2.5 stars for food.  i don't know if the restaurant mis-executed but our steaks were generally over-cooked.  my steak in particular was very over-cooked.\n\nbone-in rib-eye, illinois aged 21 days 20 oz ($64) - below average, 2.5/5 -  they over-cooked my steak. i ordered medium-rare and the steak came out medium to borderline well.  the insides were dry and it was not tender.  the exterior seared portions were charcoal-black and very crunchy.  again, i don't know if they mis-executed my order but i was pretty disappointed w/ my steak.  this is also a small nitpick - i also prefer the steak came out hotter; i know you are supposed to let steaks sit for 5 minutes before serving but my steak was very slightly colder than i enjoy.\n\n\"white-corn\" salad (special) $20 - average 3/5. the salad \"leaves\" are replaced w/ corn (so it's like you are eating a bowl of corn).  topped w/ baby tomatoes, goat cheese, and a type of mayonnaise-cream mixed w/ the corn.  it tasted okay.  i think they used too much mayonnaise/cream 'cause it tasted too creamy.  \n\n-the sides are served family style so we ordered a few items; potato tarte tatin $19 (pretty good), mac & cheese $12 (excellent), yukon gold potato $12 (average), <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark> $12 (below average). as such, i'd recommend the potato tarte tatin & the mac & cheese.  everything else was average.\n\n-free parmesan bread sticks.  also taste average but presentation is beautiful.\n-free cheese-puffs bread.  taste average but beautiful presentation.\n-free-  4 types of bread (cheesy bread, pretzel, wheat and another i can't remember) .  most of them are standard/average, but again, presentation is beautiful.  the pretzel was pretty good tho.\n-the steaks also come w/ 4 types of dipping sauces (mustard, hollandaise, french mustard, and another i can't recall).  i typically don't use dipping sauces w/ my steaks but it's an option if you fancy.\n\nservice is great, 5/5.  ambiance is very modern & nice.\n\ntips:\n-corkage $50", 
            "i have to admit, i have always chosen carnevino as my steakhouse in the palazzo, but i was unable to get a reservation at a reasonable time, and given the recommendation, i decided to check out cut.\n\nthey were very nice and understanding about the fact i was eating for one, even offering a magazine. i was happy to just enjoy my food, though. i enjoy a glass of wine, but i don't consider myself a connoisseur, so when i started with a $13 glass of wine, i was very happy to not get the upsell you often do at restaurants of this quality.\n\ni started off with the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan and was absolutely stunned. i would say it was the best appetizer i have ever had, anywhere. for dinner, i had the 8oz filet (medium rare, of course) and the <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>. my one complaint is that the <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark> were pretty flimsy in comparison.. i didn't expect large ones, but they were basically onion straws, and it was a strange consistency as a result. however, the taste was outstanding.\n\ni loved that the steak came with different mustards. it seems silly until you try it, but it really reflects on wolfgang's austrian heritage, and they actually added a ton. \n\ni'm not normally a dessert person, but they had a pumpkin and apple beignet that i couldn't pass up. i'm glad i didn't, it was cooked perfectly, warm and just  decadent.\n\nthe servers worked great in a team and were so friendly. they didn't try to sell me on anything i wasn't interested in, but every time i needed a recommendation, they were available. that's awesome.\n\noverall, i would say it was on the level of carnevino and would make my decision difficult next time, but thankfully i can hit both.", 
            "hands down the best culinary experience of my life.\n\ni know i've reviewed a couple of steakhouses, but this place is by far one of the best meals i've had. my fiancee and i were super excited to come here for his birthday dinner, since we're both such steak lovers. \n\nwe were seated the minute we arrived, which was amazing, because typically steakhouses make you wait 10 minutes past your reservation time (i never understood why). immediately, we had our waiter and another server take care of our utensils and water glasses; i can honestly go on and on about how impeccable the service was at this place. they really have all of the fine details down when it comes to customer service, which added to the amazing experience. \n\nwe both started off with caesar salad, which wasn't on the menu, but our waitress was more than happy to have the salads prepared for us. the salad was prepared on <mark>Butter Lettuce</mark>, and topped with amazing shavings of parmesan cheese, creamy caesar dressing, and anchovies. you could really taste the quality of the ingredients used. the salad also came with two bruschettas topped with what tasted like garlic aioli, fresh cherry tomatoes, and basil. very delicious! we were also served different types of bread, four different kinds to choose from to be exact, and you could ask for as many as you wanted. \n\nfor the main dishes, we ordered the 35 day aged <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark>, 21 day aged bone in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, cavatappi pasta \"mac & cheese\", and <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark> (no,we couldn't finish it). wow. best steak ever. i definitely couldn't finish it all, but i did save some room for the delicious mac and cheese (i highly recommend ordering this side dish!). i'm not a fan of <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>, but i absolutely loved these <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>. the batter was very light and super crisp, which you don't typically find with <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>. \n\nsince it was my fiancee's birthday, the restaurant provided banana cream pie for dessert. the dish was accompanied with creme brulee, chocolate sauce, and roasted banana gelato; it was rich but super light at the same time.\n\ni highly recommend this restaurant for a special date night or celebration. you will not be disappointed.", 
            "i know, i'm super late to the vegas steakhouse party, but to my bf's delight, we've been making up for lost time this year. on this last trip, we tried wolfgang puck's cut in the palazzo. \n\nservice in the lounge area was, to use a word popularized by beyonc\\u00e9, flawless. perfectly smooth symphony of waiters tending to our party of two. \n\nfoods: \n-- breads: pretzel roll was decedent with their rosemary butter, onion focaccia was all flavor without being dense, yummy, long cheesy breadsticks, & sharply-flavored cheese breads. \n-- <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> appetizer: the meaty parts were excellent (i don't eat the fatty parts) \n-- lobster, crab, <mark>Maryland Blue Crab & Carolina Shrimp 'Louis' Cocktail</mark> tower: way too much going on; simple mounds of undressed, fresh seafood would have been better than throwing the lot together with avocado, sauces, savory pudding, etc., \n-- bone-in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, (aged 21 days) for him: generous 20 oz., cooked perfectly medium-rare, nicely grilled.\n-- petite filet (8 oz) for me: cooked perfectly on the inside, a little more charred on the outside than i would've like \n-- sauces ($2 each): <mark>House Made Steak Sauce</mark> was quite sweet, peppercorn was delicious. a variety of mustards were brought out for our steaks, an austrian tradition. the violet mustard, which had a hint of a wine taste, especially brought out amazing flavors when added to our steaks. \n-- sides: <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark> (holy shit, these are good) & mashed potatoes (creamy/buttery)\n-- desserts: banana cream pie (only so-so) & baked alaska (he really enjoyed the meringue.) \n\nprice of our food coma (not including tip): $240.", 
            "great modern steakhouse. it feels chic and not like a traditional steakhouse but it does't lose focus on what makes a great steakhouse great -- the steak!\n\nthe parmesan bread sticks are amazing (free). the dry aged ny sirloin is excellent and they cooked it perfectly medium rare -- highly recommend it. they got the perfect sear on top too. they don't have real kobe beef here but the wagyu they did serve was quite flavorful. the cream spinach was great though portion was pretty small. the <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark> were okay. you won't leave hungry here at least.\n\nthey do a great job with the overall experience though. they come out and show you the top cuts of meat and explain it to you. they also do a great job pouring the bottle and decanting it while explaining what to look for. the ipad drinks menu was a little weird cause it was so bright compared to the rest of the place and menus. \n\ni think it was a great spot. not exactly cheap but that's what you expect at a steakhouse.", 
            "cut was one of the best, if not the best steakhouse experience i've ever had.\n\nthe first thing i noticed was a very nice decor - somewhat minimalist, but a bit trendier i'd say than the traidtional wood panelled steakhouse, but not in that i'n your face' all style, no substance way. i think id say very classy. the area was a dimly lit (but not overly so) open space with relatively high ceilings and good spacing between tables. also, for those gentleman hoping to impress a lady friend, the pictures on the wall of brad pitt and denzel washington (depending on your gal's preferences) combined with the wine selection should help your cause. cut is good for various purposes - for example, in the room i was seated, there was a large table of friends (10-12 of mixed gender), a date (me, haha, look at me, right?), and a table of about 4 elegant, but young looking grandmas (love seeing a bunch of grandmas out to devour steaks!). \n\nservice was friendly, attentive and considerate. they start with the ipad wine and drink selection, which is great for two reasons: (1) the date looks at me like i'm classy trying to pair the correct grape and vintage for the type of steak we are getting, while i am actually just sorting from lowest to highest price and obviously going for the cheapest bottle they had (see above, the whole brad pitt thing, fine wine is no longer needed).  (2) i can obviously check to see if clash of clans is also on the ipad so i can make sure my village isn't being raided while i go out for dinner. one thing i will note on the service, i get they are trying to educate the consumer, but the meat cart ala mortons 1998 is really not needed. but who am i to tell mr. puck how to run a restaurant - he did afterall, have a guest appearance on the show las vegas in ohhh 2005, which really upset me that they never finished it a made a season 7.  \n\nanyway, the menu was very interesting, and i kinda liked the different categories of steak. for appetizer we went wtih the crab/shrimp/avocado thing, which was one of the best appetizers i've ever had in  my life.  i would say def give it a try. also the bread selection and butter was excellent.\n\nso on to the steak - we went with the weygu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, and i had the wegyu sirloin sampler, medium rare.  both were cooked perfectly and were some of the best steaks i've ever had.  also, i love when you get a plate with a hunk of meat on it (in my case, 3 lil guys), and not a whole bunch of garnishes and silliness which is an attempt to mask the fact you aren't getting a good steak. so you can order sauces on the side (mine came with sauces), and the sauces were all really good - for the bread and the <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark> (which were very good by the way, not too greasy). because, while i am not going to judge, these weren't really the kind of steaks to put sauce on. the otherside we ordered was creamed spinanch - also excellent.\n\ni had the mango gelatto white cake thingy for dessert, which was just ok - i don't know if it was the dish, or just my palate, but figured id try a dessert anyway.\n\nlastly, the price - $$$$, as you probably already know.  it's very expensive, but in my opinion, well worth it for a special occassion. maybe i'll have good luck at the slot machines and be able to splurge for it again, but until that time, i guess i'll be choosing between denny's and the outback on the strip.", 
            "soooooo disappointed! overrated, lacking good management and service, hit and miss food. i have been here about 2 years ago and sat at the bar and remember the service and food was great.  saturday march 21st after a rough day at the sports books, i recommeded this place to two friends of mine as our annual steakhouse. had a drink at the bar prior to our table being ready. this was a sign.  barely acknowledged, and 2 of the 3 drinks were incorrect. 10 minutes after initial order we had drinks in hand. sat at our table about 10:30pm. the gentleman that proceeded take our water and wine order was great and we had our wine our without a hitch. waitress came by a few minutes later to tell us about the wagyu. personal preference is wagyu is better cut and cooked sliced or cubed so i proceeded to order the bone-in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>. my friends ordered the sirloin and strip i believe. we ordered 3 sides to split. here is where it goes downhill fast. gentleman that initially helped us comes by 10 minutes after we ordered to tell us they are out of the mac and cheese. ok, dissapointing and curious why the waitress didnt tell us and it took 10 minutes but still anxious for some good steaks coming. almost done with the wine, we noticed its been 40 minutes we noticed the waitress has not come back by the table. the initial gentleman came by once to top off our wine. so i called him over again and asked about our food. he goes to check on it comes back and says he told the waitress and manager of our wait. i would expect either the waitress or manager to come by so i ask him to have them come by our table to express our concern.  the waitress comes by and she says that she placed the order in the kitchen at 10:57, its now 11:40pm. she says that the food will be out in about 8-10 minutes.  ok, someone slipped up or they are backed up, happens. but the restaurant is only about half full for the last 30 minutes. ok consensus now is that the service is not on par with a good steakhouse but a simple diner. interesting enought the steaks come out about 3 minutes later, the apps a full minute afterwards. still optimistic i cut into my steak and wow! overcooked, dry and room temperature. two bites and i asked the gentleman helper to get the manager asap. (never saw the waitress again). of the other two steaks one was average at best and the other was very below average. my friends are starving and decided to eat their steak, i could not eat more than two bites. here is the most frustrating part. generally good restaurant and pricey, so figure this was a total fluke and the manager would be completely empathetic. no! he came over and just the expression is that he was annoyed that he was present. his initial comment was  \"how can i help you\". i told him the whole story and his response was \"i will take that into consideration for next time, what would you like me to do know?\". i could not belive the smug attitude and told him to please take away my steak. he did no remorse, of course they didnt charge me for my steak but he didnt even assure me that he would not (i wanted to see if they would try so didnt say anything). he simply proceeded to leave.  i didnt want anything more, but expected from this type of establishment to be offered a free coffee!?! well again the gentleman helper came by 10 minutes later when we were all done and offered me an espresso. my feeling is this place is overrated, turn and burn.  use their name and location to get people in and dont care if you come back. the service is on par with a diner at best, not a steahkouse. by the way all the sides (fries, cream spinach, <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>) were terrible as well. -ken",

            "this thanksgiving season, i have much to be thankful for.  sadly, my 11/22 anniversary celebration at cut steakhouse is not on that list.  to begin, despite a reservation made one month earlier, and verbal/telephone confirmation with hostess 2 days prior to my arrival at palazzo, we waited well past our reservation time, while a table was setup, way in the back of the restaurant.  i realize  this group of asians bear no resemblance to daniel craig nor giselle bundchen, but our dollar bills are still honored just the same by us treasury.  \n\nour waiter, richard, was condescending and unhelpful, with comments such as \"for those of you who have never had usda prime meat before\", to \"that's all you are having?\".  i wonder where/how rich acquired such superb profiling skills so as to allow him to so quickly form such conclusion within minutes of meeting our group, or if such comments are designed to \"upsell\".  or did he assume we are all vegans, judging from our group's lithe physique?  haha.  either case, i personally find it deeply offensive.\n\nlastly, my $140 10oz american wagyu (4 oz prime, 4 oz wagyu, 2 oz kobe) was definitely not usda prime a5 so loudly proclaimed by our waiter.  the prime was chewy.  the wagyu was full of veins.  the 2 oz kobe was the only tasty item on my selection.  (caesar and <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark> were quite good though).\n\nin summary, other than being assigned a terrible table despite 30 days advance reservation; dealing with a condescending waiter; and eating mediocre steak for an exorbitant price, i thought the lighting was exceptionally romantic!   \n\nbottom line, i have had better.  very disappointed!"

            "i think the hype for this restaurant dampened my experience. the interior was nice, very roomy, love the decor, simple yet classy. and the service was excellent, the server was very charming :-) so one star for that. they have a wide selection of wine and drinks. but for the price of over $100 a person, the <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> ($61) was a lil overcooked, and the <mark>Caramelized Onions</mark> contained too much honey, making it for a overpowering sweetened flavor. i ordered the true japanese wagyu beef from kagoshima ($160) and although i know that it is suppose to be so fatty and that's why people enjoy it, i personally felt that it was way too fatty towards the end, and couldn't finish it because it upset my stomach. i don't really know how anyone can finish a whole one to themselves. i guess it would've tasted better if it was shared where everyone takes only a bite or two . the lamb chop ($48) was waaaayyy too overcooked, but yet we saw many tables ordering it. although i don't particularly enjoy flan, everyone seemed to have thoroughly enjoyed the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan with mushroom marmalade and parseley salad. most of the sides with your entree is about $12-13 each side, the <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>, <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>, sweet <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>, french fries, <mark>Soft Polenta with Parmesan</mark>, creamed spinach with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>...etc were good but i felt that it was nothing special.   their garlic bread appetizer and tuna tartar was delicious but not worth $24 a plate. the shrimp  in the <mark>Maryland Blue Crab & Carolina Shrimp 'Louis' Cocktail</mark> was not fresh and i've had better garlic fries at gordan biersh.the one appetizer we ordered 3 plates of, one after another, because it was sooo amazing was the kobe steak sashimi (definitely worth $22 a plate, and i suggest this is a must try! but for those that don't like eating raw meat, trust... it'll change your whole view on it) - overall great experience, but i just feel that it is nothing special especially for how costly it is- and too much hype.",

            "my friend wanted to have one really nice dinner for his vegas bday weekend.  we all love steak, so we decided to make reservations at cut.  i had just dined at alexander's( http://www.yelp.com/biz/alexanders-steakhouse-cupertino#hrid:zgok0ixxx8fog1fdfdmgka/src:self ) a few weeks prior and loved it, so i had super high expectations for cut.  we had a party of eight, so we called in for reservations ahead of time. \n\nservice here is definitely outstanding.  there were so many servers waiting on us, i couldn't keep track.  our water glasses were always full, and your napkin would always be folded if you got out of your seat.  our waiter brought out a platter to display the different cuts of wagyu beef....kobe vs. american...so we could see the different marbling.    \n\nfor my first course, i ordered the <mark>Roasted Weiser Farms Baby Beets</mark>, humboldt fog goat cheese, pistachio, citrus, micro basil,  & mint.  i originally was going to get the usda prime <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark>, but it was only $20 more for the american wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>....i was sold.  i added the <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> to top off my lovely piece of steak.  our table also ordered saut\\u00e9ed baby spinach, <mark>Soft Polenta with Parmesan</mark> and <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark>.\n\nmy beet appetizer had a very nice presentation.  it was very colorful, and all of the ingredients complimented each other very well.  all of our sides were very tasty.  the polenta was nice and creamy, <mark>Tempura Onion Rings</mark> were crispy, and the spinach added the \"healthy\" factor to our meal.\n\nthey prepare the steaks over a hard wood and charcoal grill and then finish them off in a broiler.  my steak was cooked to a nice medium rare, and it melted in my mouth.  the steak had great flavor, but i didn't really care much for the charred flavor from the broiler.  the <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark> i added went well with my steak and kept it moist from the sauce.  i wasn't able to finish my steak and gave it to my friends who had the usda prime <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>.  they were amazed and could totally tell the difference from the wagyu.\n\nthe only disappointment i had here was that they didn't have foie gras as an add on to your steak.  i was spoiled by alexander's, and left the restaurant craving that melt in your mouth foie gras.  i was so expecting a 5 star dinner here, but i just couldn't give it to them.  please add foie gras to the menu!", 
            "i utilize yelp pretty often but have been too lazy to write my own reviews. it is time i give back to the yelp community, and there is no better place to start than with this wonderful establishment.\n\ncut opened their doors 30 minutes early to ensure we caught our show, and it only got better.\n\nour very knowledgeable waiter rolled out a raw selection of available meats, masterfully describing each cut.\n\nsteaks ordered: filet, porterhouse, and rib-eye (all usda prime, none wagyu). each cut was perfectly prepared and tasted excellent. as for a comparison, i can't unequivocally say the steak quality was better than mastros, but it was definitely no worse.\n\nsides ordered: <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>, <mark>Soft Polenta with Parmesan</mark>, and quebec cheddar mac n cheese. polenta was the best, but still pretty ordinary, and the mac n cheese was the worst (canada sucks, eh?)\n\nwe paired our food with the house cab, which went perfectly.\n\nthe best part of the meal was the extraordinary service. our waiter was very attentive without being overbearing. he also engaged us in relevant conversation without being awkward (pre and post meal).\n\noverall, this culinary experience was well worth the money. in fact, i would have paid substantially more and still felt good about it.",

            "seriously too bad that bf and i both felt nauseous at dinner but the things we did taste were delish!  every freakin person here is so darn nice and friendly - and considering how trendy this place is i was kind of expecting snooty service.  the food was really good - <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, oxtail bouillon, bone-in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>, cream of <mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark> and the handcut fries.  the oxtail bouilon was the standout dish for me...there were bits of <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> floating around!  and the bar menu looks tasty too, hopefully i win lots of money in vegas next time and can give this place another go!", 
            "i made my bf make a reservation about a month before our trip to vegas.  we studied the menu quite awhile beforehand.  it's important to carefully consider what to eat if you're going to spend a few benjamins!  we started with the maryland blue crab and <mark>Pan Roasted Stonington Maine Lobster</mark> \"louis\" cocktail.  this was surprisingly fresh.  you can taste each of the crab or lobster when separating them into their own bite, but taking in a little bit of seafood, avocado, microgreens and tomato - everything just melds together.  i would have never guessed that the extra creamy bottom layer was panna cotta.  i wasn't into the ultra thin parmesan breadsticks or gougers (too much cheese), but was a bit more enticed by the bread selection.  i choose the onion focaccia, which was a bit salty and super soft, but the onions were sweetly caramelized.  i stay away from pretzels in general, but tried a bite of my bf's roll - best pretzel ever.  also there's no salt on it.  the menu online offered a bone in filet, but was not currently on the menu.  after having more than a few prime filets in the past couple years, i decided to take it to the next level with an american wagyu filet and topped it off with <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark>.  absolutely the most tender meat that has ever melted in my mouth to date.  my bf had the dry aged <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> topped with <mark>Bone Marrow</mark>.  the marrow pieces had a fascinating shape and texture, looking like gnocchi but bursting like gelatinous blobs.  we shared the creamed spinach with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>.  the egg adds quite a bit of extra richness.  splitting the appetizer and sharing one side gave us just enough room for dessert.  the carmelized banana cream pie with valrhona pearls was a delight.  the pearls were like little crunches with a layer inside the slice and scattered on the plate.  there was also a scoop of roasted banana ice cream for cooler contrast.  with the bill arrived yet more sweets of a piece of incredibly rich truffle-like chocolate and not as sweet, chewy cashew caramel.  overall, an amazing meal.\n\nservice was very good, but not perfect.  the d\\u00e9cor is way modern.  i'm not sure i like the swivel chairs with mesh bottoms.  also i wore a super short skirt, so i felt a bit self-conscious.  not to mention the mirrors all around, although they let me see what was happening all around without having to swivel.  now i gotta go downgrade some of my other steakhouse reviews...",

            "many restaurants tout fusion sensibilities, but puck's concept truly blends influences from his native austria, france, japan, america and elsewhere. almost painfully serious about beef, servers here bring out a platter of raw kobe and wagyu cuts before you order, to show the differences in the meat. \n\nyour taste buds may not be as sensitive as your eyes, though: we actually preferred the 21 day wet-aged illinois prime bone-in <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> to the american wagyu/angus <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark>. cut's ample offerings also include several 35 day dry aged nebraska prime as well as true japanese waygu (kobe) choices (all are grilled over hard wood & charcoal then finished under the broiler). \n\nin fact, cut's menu seems overly eager to please (or overwhelm) with an excess of options in starters (12 the night we visited), side dishes (13), desserts (7) and even sauces (8), though many were excellent, including the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>, <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> \"sandwiches\" with wasabi aoli and bar menu's knishes and kobe sliders; and <mark>Wasabi-Yuzu Kosho Butter</mark> and <mark>Cognac & Whole Grain Mustard</mark> were both remarkable. but the creamed spinach topped with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> was almost too rich and the potato tart tatin was mostly just big and bland. the deconstructed nectarine and plum crumble, served with a house-made \"50 bean\" vanilla ice cream was nice, but far too big a portion to end such a meal.\n \na nice selection of original and classic cocktails, but their wine list is a bit pretentious and overpriced ($15 for a glass of argentinian malbec? really? i'd pay that much for a magnum of it in the store)\n\nin short, cut has one of my favorite lounges on the strip (sexy, sleek, just dark enough, fitting for either romance or business rendevous), some fantastic appetizers, and a great cocktail menu. cut has one of my least favorite dining rooms on the strip (like an 80s office, stiff and steely), and good meat--but not quite as good as their orgiastic presentation lends you to expect. i didn't dislike it, but was not wowed as much as i have been at craftsteak, carnevino, and even boa, all in the same price range. \n\np.s. at these prices, you can afford to make the sauces complimentary.",

            "this place is what happens when god makes a steak house!!!  seriously, it's restaurants like these that keep me from turning vegetarian.  i went here as part of my boys bachelor party.  let me start with the dinning environment:  very clean with a slight industrial feel.  the swivel chairs were a very nice change from the clunky wooden chairs you see in most places.  it also helps to get my fat ass in and out of the table a lot easier.  trust me.... after this meal.. you kinda wanna roll back to your room for a cigarette.\n\nappetizers:  <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan, kobe sashimi, and <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>. \n all on point~!!!  the <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan was so rich and buttery.  it literally makes your eyes roll back as you take a bite of it off the small crestini.  the kobe sashimi was fresh and light.  the beef was velvety dressed with only a little olive oil and capers.  this is a must try.  and then came the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>.  sweet.... savory... rich... flavorful.... wow....\n\nsides:  creamed spinach and roasted potatoes.   \nlet me preface by saying... i am not a fan of creamed spinach in any variation.  so to me, this dish was bound for failure.  the spinach was topped with a <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> that was mixed in table-side and served to us.  the rest of my table loved it.  i was not a big fan.  no slight to the chef... just personal preference.  it was good, but not my cup of tea.  the potatoes however were great!  roasted simply with some onions and garlic.  sometimes good technique and simplicity just win out.  and this side was a prime example of that.\n\nmain: american wagyu <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> steak\nif you go to a restaurant like this, you dont order the chicken.  you shell out the money and get the best that they offer.  the american wagyu choices were organic beef from idaho, i believe.  the moment my knife touched the soft medium rare beef, i was sure that my knife and fork were the luckiest utensils in the world.  they were the first to make love to that meat.  i have never in my life tasted beef of this magnitude.  the flavor was so unique and undoubtedly unforgettable.  the beef melted in my mouth as i could not believe something that was only rubbed in salt and pepper, had this much flavor.  like i said before, if you come here.  go for the american wagyu.  pricey?  yes.  absolutely worth it?  hell f***ing yes~!!!\n\nwine:  malbec.\nran the decision by the sommelier and she said that was a great choice.  great wine with the meal.  soft flavors, smooth finish, not too much bite.  the wine was a hit with the table.  but at this point.... everything was a hit from this place.  \n\ncongrats alex!  hope you enjoyed your last meal~!!!",

            "one of the best steaks that i have ever had. the service here is also top notch. the prices were comparable to a chain like morton's but i felt like the service was a notch better at cut. all of the waitstaff is very attentive and well trained such as asking if it is ok for them to cut the <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> that was on top of the asparagus appetizer. there was refilled water and wine before you could barely get through half of the glass. the staff earns every dollar of the gratuity here.\n\nfor an appetizer i ordered the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark>. honestly, if they could have just loaded me up on that i would have been satisfied. it was very tender and flavorful. others in my party ordered the tuna tartar and the <mark>Warm Asparagus</mark>. if you're a sushi fan then the tartar is for you. the asparagus dish was different than i expected but very tasty.\n\nmy main course was the 12oz <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> cooked medium-rare. the steak rub used is a tad on the salty side but the tenderness and steak flavor is out of this world. for sides the table ordered the pureed potatoes and the creamed spinach w/ <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>. the all star here was the spinach. i liked the texture the <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> gave to the creamed spinach. \n\ndessert was banana cream pie. overall a very solid dessert but compared to the rest of the meal it was the weakest. if i go again i will probably get the chocolate souffl\\u00e9 <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark>. \n\nbe sure to make reservations and just relax and enjoy the service. save your allowance and treat yourself to a night at cut.\n\nalso, i was under the impression that one needed to dress up a tad for this place. that was not the case. we spotted at least a couple of people in shorts and a baseball cap. but of course their money spends the same as mine.", 
            "yes i'm a meat lover.  call me a caveman, i just love to eat a big juicy steak.   being in hawaii we are a little limited to steakhouses but i have been to most of them at least once.  morton's, hy's, dk's, ruth chris, and also other with steak like kincaids, shoreside grill, and even ruby tuesdays.  well, you get the jist.   i normally will opt for a <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> whenever possible and then maybe a ny or t-bone.  i like my meat to be juicy and have some fat so i normally don't get a filet.\n\nbeing we were heading out for vegas i wanted to have a date night with my wife and get a good steak.  i asked my friend, who is a seasoned chef.  he lived and worked in vegas for some years after grad-ing from the cia and working at the greenbrier among many other accomplishments both abroad and at home.  i figured he'd be the best person to ask for an honest opinion.  he recommended a few places we could try but said if given the choice we should go to cut.  that sealed it, cut it was.  i checked open table to see if i needed to book way ahead but it seemed like we should be fine booking a day in advanced.  great considering we hardly know where we will be in vegas day to day and hour to hour.  once we were out there and could plan our schedule, we were able to lock down a reservation that would work for us.\n\nwe headed out a little early not know how long it would take me to find the parking garage and not know how far we would have to walk to get from the parking to the restaurant.  cut is in the palazzo hotel.  parking was a breeze.  they had a guard asking where you were going so i guess maybe they restrict the parking to guest and customers.  we found a parking pretty close to the elevators which is amazing for a vegas casino.  needless to say we had some time to explore before going to the restaurant.\n\nwe had a reservation at 9 and got there about 10 minutes early.  they were pretty packed.  they didn't have a regular table open yet but did offer us a table off to the side in the lounge area.  we decided to wait for a regular table, not wanting to miss out on the whole steakhouse experience.  we did go to the bar to kill our 10 minutes.  one think that irritated me at the bar was when i asked the bartender what kind of beer they had he immediately stated that they don't carry anything domestic like bud light or coors.  did i f**king say that's what i wanted??  all he had to do was provide me their drink menu, which is on an ipad for customer use.  snooty bartender,  he should be happy i payed for those drinks with my total bill and didn't have to tip him separate.\n\nonce seated we had the best service.  our waiter was chip and from what we saw, he was probably the head waiter as he was directing most of the other workers as he did his job.  he was very knowledgeable about their menu offerings and offered in-depth descriptions about everything they served.\n\nthe menu was a head turner.  they had so many things that sounded delicious.  one of those places you wished you were with a large party so you could sample more.  we decided on the <mark>Warm Asparagus</mark>, poached <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>, warm bacon vinaigrette on a focaccia bread as our appetizer.  along with that we also got  to pick from their selection of homemade breads and also got a couple or long parmesan coated breadsticks and butter puffs, or something like that.\n\nfor the main dish my wife got the indian spiced kobe beef shortribs which they slow cook for 8 hours.  they were very succulent and rich.  they had a distinct indian flavor but not too overpowering.  it was also not very spicy at all.  the meat was so tender it was almost falling off the bone.  it was actually too much for my wife to finish.\n\nafter chip had explained the different lines of meats they carried i was sure i would need to get their sampler to get the best taste of what they had to offer.  i got their \"tasting of <mark>Bone In <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> Sirloin 20 Oz</mark> sampler\".  it came with a 4oz of snake river farms american \"kobe\" style beef, 4oz usda prime 35 day aged, and a 2oz of blackmore ranch australian wagyu.  it also came with a medley of different sauces and spices i could add to it.  none of which i needed to use.  they season their steaks with sea salt and black pepper.  it was seasoned perfectly so that the saltiness and pepper was not too overpowering and let the flavor of the beef shine through.  it tasted amazing.  and to be able to taste these 3 different lines of beef side by side really made it easy to see and taste the difference in quality.  all being top notch but clearly easy to rank.  might make me come back for more australian wagyu on a future trip.  we also got a side of their mac and cheese that was suggested by the waiter.  talk about rich and creamy, definitely a grown up mac and cheese.\n\nif you ever are in vegas and in search of a great steakhouse.  make sure to put cut on the shortlist.  you definitely won't be disappointed.  happy eats!", 
            "so the bf was in vegas for the first time for his birthday and he picked cut as his expensive steakhouse dinner.  we were not disappointed.  wolfgang puck figured it out with this place.\n\nfirst off, love the atmosphere in here.  clean lines, dark but not too dark lighting, and they had some good tunes going.  mostly classic rock but interspersed with a few more recent rock songs.  i was glad it wasn't boom boom boom techno for once.\n\nwe were immediately seated when we arrived and things started happing in rapid fire succession.  bread was brought to the table.  the waiter took drink orders, recommended wine, and went through the menu.  someone else brought an amuse bouche.  it was a bit overwhelming overload there for a bit but all for a good cause - to get us food and booze!\n\nwe started with the bread.  there were some crispy bread pieces covered in cheese, maybe parmesan?  it was so good we ate all of it.  then we started with the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> with asian spices, sesame orange dressing, and apple compote.  4 pieces of decadent, amazing <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> perfectly offset with sweetness from the apple.  we loved this.  we also tried the shrimp and crab (or was it lobster) cocktail which had a creamy sauce holding it all together.  i'm not much for creamy sauces so that's a personal preference, but it was still very good.\n\nso they bring out the steak cuts and show them to you and explain the differences.  i had already decided in my head on one thing but after hearing about the wagyu steaks from the usa and australia there was only one way to go: the tasting that included 4 oz usda prime aged 35 days steak, 4 oz american wagyu \"kobe style\", and 2 oz australian wagyu.  i just couldn't resist trying each of them against the other and deciding if they were really all that.  we ordered them up medium rare with sides of parmesan polenta and creamed spinach with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>.  the tasting came with sauces for each steak.\nusda prime aged 35 days: really good steak but harder to cut because of the marbling.  i didn't eat all of this one because i wanted to focus on the other 2 cuts.\namerican wagyu: at first, this one was my favorite.  it was buttery smooth with a great flavor.\naustralian wagyu: this one was even more rich and buttery in flavor and soon became my absolute favorite of the three.  i finished all of it.  probably the best steak i have ever had in my life ever...including at my favorite steakhouse in dallas.  next time i believe i'll just fork out the cash for this cut alone.\ncreamed spinach: good, <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> made it different than the usual, but just good, not mind blowing.\npolenta: perfectly cooked, cheesy, great side for the steaks.\n\nfor dessert the bf ordered some sort of table side crumble that came with market fresh peaches and blackberries in it  i don't know what it was called but all i know is that i have never had fruit that fresh and sweet and delicious.  not a single blackberry was sour, the peaches tasted like they came straight off the tree.  it was an amazing dessert.  they also sent out a baked alaska for the bf's b-day gratis and it said \"happy birthday\" written in chocolate on the plate.  fun.\n\nthe price is commensurate with the quality food you are getting which means this shit isn't cheap.  but it is worth it.  i left here stuffed and happy and pleased that the $$$ spent matched the enjoyment had.  give this steak a try, you will not be disappointed.", 
            "i don't even know where to start, other than to say this place was fantastic.\n\nappetizer - steak tartare.  it was fantastic!  also tried the <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark>, which was very very good.\n\ndinner - snake river farms <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> - medium (recommended over med rare by server due to marbling).  #1 steak in my life - no lie.  i tried the armagnac sauce on the side, but just go straight meat.  don't dress it up at all.\n\nsides - mac and cheese, which is their signature - it was very good, but very rich.  <mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark> was great.  also had the potato mash, which was very very good.\n\ndesert - their baked alaska, which was great.\n\ni tried a couple of bottles of my favorite - tignanello.\n\noverall this place is a grip of cash - but if you have a special occasion and want a treat - go here.", 
            "what we ordered: \n1. kobe steak <mark>American Wagyu Beef Sashimi, Spicy Radishes</mark> - amazing dish, the highlight of the dinner! the meat was so buttery and the delicate asian flavors of the sauce was a perfect pairing.\n \n2. <mark><mark>Bone Marrow</mark> Flan, Mushroom Marmalade, Parsley Salad</mark> - very good but did not have that intense marrow flavor that i like. i also did not like the accompanying <mark><mark>Bone Marrow</mark> Flan, Mushroom Marmalade, Parsley Salad</mark> as it overpowered the flan. however when eaten by itself the parsley was a good palate cleanser. \n\n3. <mark>Warm Asparagus</mark>, poached <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>, warm bacon vinaigrette - nice salad very good flavor. hard to mess up a dish with those ingredients.\n\n4. nebraska corn fed <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> - not a very thick steak, which i always prefer. the crust was overpowering due to the amount of char. way too much char in my opinion.\n\n5. true japanese 100% wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> - thicker than the nebraska <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> but served in two pieces which i thought was odd. the meat was heavily marbled and very tender. the wagyu steak did not have a very meaty flavor, more relaxed and clean. again though, the charing on the crust proved too much. \n\n6. <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> - very good, recommended. creamy and buttery. \n\nthe service was excellent and the ambiance is very nice. we had a very large and comfortable booth. our sever was very professional and his support staff was very attentive. overall, a good experience but the prices are very high, be prepared to spend. the steaks were too heavily charred for me. almost ruined the high quality meat imho.", 
            "overrated. \n\ni think i ordered the wrong steak but at $60 a steak, i still expected a good steak. \n\ni read the reviews and i still ordered the bone in since bone in has such good flavor. yes, i understand it wouldn't be the most tender cut of meat, but it was chewy. i have had much better steaks in texas (also corn fed like they highly describe on their menu and by the waiter) than at cut. \n\nthe rest - the sides were ok. i really enjoyed the mac and cheese that gets prepped (stirred) at the table as well as the <mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark>. but the other sides were just ok. \n\nwine/drink: they had a drink menu on an ipad and yes that's impressive but when it's a group of seven (mostly guys - i was the lone girl) it might be smart to give us more than one unit. \n\nthe cheesy bread was amazing - that's the only reason this place got two stars. \n\nservice was great - but expected at a place of this size. \n\nall said and done, i paid two hundred dollars for my meal of a bad steak and ok mac and cheese. \n\nwill not come again.",

            "probably the best steak i have ever had in my entire life. seriously. and i'm not some rube who orders their steak medium well, and thinks ruth's chris is the end all for steaks. what we ordered:\n\nstarters: \n\n- <mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark>, wasabi, ginger, togarashi crisps, tosa soy: \ndelicious, but i wouldn't say a \"must order\"\n\n- <mark>Warm Asparagus</mark>, poached <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>, warm bacon vinaigrette:\nsounds simple, right? well, a guy comes out, breaks the poached eggs for you and pours the warm bacon vinaigrette right there in front of you, so that it hits the asparagus just seconds before it combines and hits your mouth. it was delicious and i would recommend!\n\nentrees:\n\n- american wagyu beef <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> \n\n- true japanese 100% wagyu beef <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> \n\nmy boss and i decided to try the american wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> and the japanese wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark>, cut them in half, and share, so that we could compare the two. as a person who loves rich food, i must say that the japanese wagyu was actually a bit too fatty for me. \nour server had went over the differences of the meats before we ordered, and had indeed told us that the japanese wagyu was fatty, even bringing out various cuts of the raw steaks, showing us how the fat runs through this type of meat, so we weren't unprepared for it. \nmy american wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> was absolute perfection. i ordered it rare plus, as did my boss with his japanese cut. it was rich and perfectly fatty, in my opinion. the japanese cut, being more of a delicacy and more expensive, made sense to me, it just wasn't my preference. i have a friend who loves to eat the pure fat pieces that hang on the sides of meat.  i could see him totally loving the japanese wagyu.\n\nsides:\n\n-mac & cheese:\nphenomenal. i would believe that night it had truffle in it, and it was perfection. definitely an indulgence that you must try\n\n- curry spiced cauliflower:\nreally good, but i don't think the flavor profiles went well with everything else we ordered. \n\nour server was an absolute delight. i can't remember his name, but i think he said that he was originally from southern california. he looked about 30 with short brown hair and really knew what  he was talking about. if he or anyone from the restaurant is reading this, thank you. he made our experience wonderful. he had a great personality. \n\nthe ambiance in the restaurant is very lovely. sitting down, i immediately felt like i was in a high class establishment and would be in for a treat. overall, this was a heavenly experience that i hope i can take part in again someday!", 
            "i came here with my colleagues for a celebration dinner and we all truly loved the meal. cut includes great little touches such as amazing pretzel bread and tasty parmesan cheese sticks before the meal and warm cookies served after dessert. the wine and champagne were delicious and the service was impeccable, but the food really stole the show! \n\ni had the burrata appetizer and it was melt-in-your-mouth creamy and delicious; a fantastic combination of flavors. i also ate about five of the pretzel rolls, which i started to regret once the entrees and sides rolled out. but they were really delicious so i didn't regret it thatttt much.  \n\nfor my meal i ordered the japanese wagyu <mark>Petit Cut <mark>New York 6 Oz</mark> 10 Oz</mark> cut and as the waiters described it was incredibly tender. it does melt in your mouth but i found that sensation was mostly because the meat has so much marbling. i actually preferred my colleague's wagyu <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> because it was less fatty. \n\nwe ordered the following sides:\n--creamed spinach with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>- creamed spinach is my go-to steak side dish and this one did not disappoint\n--cavatappi pasta mac & cheese- easily some of the best mac and cheese i've ever tasted\n--<mark>Soft Polenta with Parmesan</mark>- good but not the best\n\nand desserts, all of which were fantastic:\n--creamsicle baked alaska\n--fuji apple & medjool date crumble\n--valrhona chocolate souffl\\u00e9\n--banana cream pie\n\noverall i'd highly recommend cut for a special night out on the town.", 
            "wow. what can i say that hasn't already been said?\n\nthe space is beautiful and modern.\n\nthe cocktail and wine menu is presented via ipad so you can filter by price/country/grape/etc. i expected a varied wine list, but i was pleasantly surprised by the 2 delicious cocktails we had. very well made and presented with cool huge ice cubes. bonus points for having some inventive mocktails in there!\n\nyou already know the food is delicious. we followed all the yelp recommendations and they are spot on:\n<mark>Big Eye Tuna Tartare</mark> (great, as expected). \n<mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan (a must-try. i was scared to try it, but the waiter talked me into it and i'm so glad he did! it's a custard...a baby step to straight marrow).\npretzel bread (it really is not an exaggeration to say, \"best pretzel roll of your life.\") \nnebraska <mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> (great steak. duh)\n<mark>Double Thick Kurobuta Pork Chop</mark> (this will surprise you - it's so smooth, not chewy, lighter than a steak)\n<mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark> (a unique flavor, love the twist on the steakhouse classic)\nmushrooms & peppers (the surprise of the meal. loved it)\nbaked alaska (very good, but potentially too sweet. not that i didn't eat it of course!)\n\nthe service was great the entire night, and i think that is what really set this experience apart for us. everybody was friendly, offered great recommendations, anticipated every need, but not pushy or intrusive. they really made us feel like vips.\n\nfor all our food, plus cocktails, wine and dessert wines....$350. obviously it's expensive, but seriously worth it for a splurge meal. you could easily conserve by splitting a main (it's a ton of meat, neither of us finished), skipping dessert, and having only one glass of wine each.", 
            "absolutely love this place! food and service is amazing! atmosphere is dim and romantic. \n\nwent two months ago for a special one's birthday and we were treated like royalty! ordered the wagyu sampler that is not on the menu and have to say the american wagyu cut was probably my favorite. also, the <mark>Maple Glazed Pork Belly</mark> appetizer and mac n cheese is to die for! we weren't too crazy about the <mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark>. \n\nwill definitely return for another special occasion ($$$), they earned our repeat business!", 
            "six months ago, i proclaimed del frisco's as the best steakhouse in las vegas. that may very well still hold true; however, the best steak goes to cut. hey, there's precedence of the mvp going to the losing team: jerry west in 1969 in the nba finals, chuck howley in 1971 in super bowl v (and now cut).\n\nthe steak here is unlike any i've tried. it is a triple-threat, five-tool star player as they would say in the sports world. while there were several cuts, ages, and locations to choose from, i went with one of their more popular ones, the 14 oz ny sirloin aged 35 days from nebraska. the aspect that makes this steak so magical is the crust. oh, my god, dat crust! it was so crispy and charred on the outside with great seasonings while maintaining the perfect medium-rare on the inside. you can have additional sauces and toppings, but plain is all you need for flavor. \n\nservice was excellent as would be expected from a wolfgang puck restaurant. we added on a couple of classic steak sides including the creamed spinach with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> and <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark> to round out our meal. the addition of the <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> was a nice touch to an already delicious side dish. bonus points for the complimentary puff pastry and small bite desserts to end our meal. i've been wanting to try this steakhouse for a couple of years now, but reservations were tough to come by, but we finally managed to snag one this friday at 10:30 pm so book them early.", 
            "you can pretty much assume that every las vegas casino has a steakhouse inside. when choosing an appropriate steakhouse for our bachelor party dinner, cut was the place to go because it has everything you want in a first class restaurant. they start you off with five types of complimentary bread (my favorite was the bread sticks). i ordered the 12 oz <mark>Bone In <mark><mark><mark>Rib Eye 8 Oz</mark> Steak 9 Oz</mark> 12 Oz</mark> 18 Oz</mark> medium rare...i couldn't find anything wrong with it except that it was one of the best steaks i've ever had. we split a bunch of sides including the <mark>Hand Cut French Fries with Herbs</mark>, <mark>Yukon Gold Potato Puree</mark>, and creamed spinach with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark>. the creamed spinach was arguably the highlight of the meal!\n\nwhether it's the sexy ambiance, impeccable service, or perfectly cooked steak, cut is sure to be in the discussion for best steakhouses in vegas. the venetian/palazzo is my favorite resort to stay at in vegas, and if i'm not feeling adventurous for food one night, i know i'll always have a perfect meal waiting at cut."

            "okay. i consider myself a lover of all food, someone who has had a taste of everything here and there. and while i think that i've had the best of the best, and the worst of the worst, i must say that after all my years on this earth i feel like i have wasted them all until i ate at cut. \n\ni'm exaggerating, yes. but you know what? one bite of a steak at cut tasted like heaven. here i was, lalala-ing about how i've had so much good food in my life, and then one bite of a petit (haha) ny strip steak made me want to jump out of my seat and sing from the rooftops and fields in europe. laaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!!!\n\ni guess i've been selling myself short... i've never had a dry aged steak before. i never thought steak would taste so good, let alone without soy sauce (filipino thing). it was grilled on some wood grill and then fired in a billion degree oven with all these spices. ahh, yes. and the peppercorn sauce that i got along with it? delightful. heaven in my mouth. the side dishes: fingerling potatoes with bacon confit and caramelized <mark>Fingerling Potatoes, Smokey Bacon, Pearl Onions</mark>, mac n cheese, sauteed spinach, creamed spinach... all very good too. my cousin and i indulged in that yummy <mark>Bone Marrow</mark> flan... all delightfully good. the side dishes may not have been a good idea, as it was a struggle to even finish my steak. but i finished it. if my steak was $55 dollars, all of it better be in my stomach by the end of the night.\n\ni don't exaggerate the greatness of cut... the next night i found myself at a restaurant back home in sf and i pretty much ordered the same thing: steak, sides, etc. once i took a bite and swallowed that piece of meat, i sighed. cut basically ruined steak for me. not that the steak that i was having at the time wasn't good, it's just that it didn't have the same juiciness and tenderness of the previous steak. it made me question my eating habits, the way i choose my food, the way i live my life. ugh, it was so delicious. i need to come back here.", 
            "first i must preface this by saying that my husband came here before and would have given it 5 stars on yelp!  he said it has declined at least 30% since his last visit.\n\nalright, onto my review.... knowing that many celebs frequent the la restaurant, and having heard my husband's review.... i was expecting a delicious sophisticated meal at an expensive restaurant.  it was pricey, but none of the other things i had hoped for.\n\nthe martinis we ordered came with a choice of <mark>Point Reyes Blue Cheese</mark>, jalapeno, or pimento, i chose <mark>Point Reyes Blue Cheese</mark> having had them at a different bar.  the martinis were okay.... but after drinking down the vodka, started to smell like vomit.  not the best way to start my meal.  \n\nthey brought a huge platter of raw meat to our table and began to explain where they were from, etc.  being a carnivore, i was not turned off by the display of dead animal, but i can see how it might be offensive to some.  we opted for the bone-in filet.\n\nthey came by with a tray of fresh breads and we chose the pretzel and pumpernickel which were fabulous, but cold.  i expected this tray of fresh bread to smell like a bakery and for the warm slices to melt in my mouth... not so much. (however the butter, that they said was from france was room temperature and easy to spread!)\n\nthe sides--\ncavatapi mac and cheese was baked with a delicious sharp cheddar, was pure comfort food and worth every calorie.\ncreamed spinach with <mark><mark>Creamed Spinach with Fried Organic Egg</mark></mark> (not sure if the spinach was organic, but they make a point of saying the egg is...) good...not great.... but i love anything with an egg over medium....\nfingerling potatoes with bacon and <mark>Fingerling Potatoes, Smokey Bacon, Pearl Onions</mark> were awesome.  wish i had them now for breakfast.  comfort food, thick chunks of bacon and the <mark>Fingerling Potatoes, Smokey Bacon, Pearl Onions</mark> i could eat for days....\n\noverall service was very efficient but lacked any personality.  they aren't the snobby servers of elite fine dining places, and they aren't the overly helpful staff of.... let's say a casino cafe.  they seem uncomfortable, and in a restaurant that is designed like a dark cafeteria, they need to do something to warm the place up a bit.  the decor was moody and the design pieces well chosen, but i would prefer a little different floor plan for this type of hype.  every diner should feel like a celebrity in a place that charges $60-$185 a steak.\n\nenjoyed the food and atmosphere of craftsteak much more.... but then i guess everyone can have an off day.",

            "we had dinner here for my fiances birthday after heavily debating which of the many steakhouses in vegas to dine at. we are serious foodies, and are certainly not afraid to spend serious bucks on a delicious meal. with that being said, i do believe this is the most i have ever spent on a meal for 2 people. \n\nambiance - 3 stars - \n-different decor than your normal steakhouse. lots of metals/mirrors gave it a bit more of a modern feel leather benches (if you're lucky enough to get a booth) with leather table tops were nice. we thought the decor was a bit \"cold\" due to the usage of sharp edges and more modern materials. \n-the seats in the middle of the restaurant did not seem appealing at all. the chairs looked like something you would sit on in a conference room at your office. \n-it is loud in here. there is not an lot of space, and the use of hard materials   everywhere causes sound to bounce in every direction. they could really use some sound absorbing materials on the ceiling to cut down the noise. we were lucky to be sitting right next to each-other in a booth, because if we weren't we would most likely have been shouting across the table. \n\nservice - 4.5 stars - \n- immediately seated at a nice booth, with reservations. wait staff was attentive. items were brought to the table in a timely manner. steak was carved and plated table-side along with the side dishes. sides were also refilled by the wait staff as they were consumed from the plate, which was a nice touch. \n\nfood - 3 stars - \n- all of the items brought out prior to dinner were quite good. bread sticks, cheese pastries, and the assorted bread tray. we did not get any appetizers as to not spoil the, assumed to be, spectacular cut of beef we would receive for our main course. i would give the \"breads\" an overall 4.5 stars. the focaccia and pretzel roll were both really tasty. the bread sticks were buttery. the pastry was buttery. and of course, the bread was served with butter topped with rosmary and smoked sea salt. \n- main course: 34 oz. wagyu porterhouse for 2. sides: cavatappi pasta mac & cheese, <mark>Cavatappi Pasta 'Mac & Cheese,' Qubec Cheddar</mark>, shaved baby squash, <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark>. \n- <mark>Wild Field Mushrooms</mark>: 5 stars, these were delicious and a great addition to the steak. generously buttered. \n- shaved baby squash: 4 stars. nothing too special about this, but it was a good change of pace from all of the butter used on everything else. fresh & crisp, seasoned lightly. \n- cavatappi pasta mac & cheese, <mark>Cavatappi Pasta 'Mac & Cheese,' Qubec Cheddar</mark>: 3.5 stars. it got old, quick. a good take on mac & cheese. i'm always a fan of mac that uses more elegant cheeses than just yellow cheddar or even american, but this didn't have that \"comfort\" feeling you normally get with mac. after one spoonful it gets old. thick, cheesy, buttery. \n\n- 34 oz. wagyu porterhouse for 2, served medium-rare: 2 stars. this isn't the first time that we have had a wagyu porterhouse at a steakhouse, and we had high expectations. unfortunately they fell very short. even before choosing a restaurant we knew we wanted wagyu. it was served with 5 different sauces. we sampled them, but normally don't take sauce with our steak - as the beef itself should be the star. \n\n after all the build up from the waiter about how the steaks are 100% wagyu, and our past experiences with wagyu and kobe - i was seriously excited. my first impression was that it looked small. i would say we were served something more along the lines of 24-28oz. it was not a \"pretty\" cut of meat, it looked a bit beat up, grizzly, and fatty. when he brought it out my heart sank, and i immediately knew this was not going to be the mouth watering heart melting piece of beef we had set out for. \n\nthe steak had just the right amount of salt/pepper/garlic/onion on the outside. the beef itself, however, did not live up to the hype. the filet portion was extremely tender, and decently flavorful (for filet). the strip portion had around the same flavor quality as the filet, unexpected. the beef did not have that glorious taste you would expect from a fine piece of meat like this, especially for the price. when you're paying triple digits for a steak, you expect it to be superb. the overall flavor profile for the steak was butter. the beef was not rich tasting at all, and was actually quite bland.\n\ndessert - 5 stars - we didn't order anything, but the hotel concierge made note that it was my fiances birthday. they brought out a generous slice of the banana pie which was absolutely amazing. served on a plate with a scoop of ice cream, and happy birthday in chocolate sauce. dessert was probably the best part of the meal.\n\ncost - 4 stars - it's inflated, but it's vegas. \n\nmaybe our taste buds were off that night, or we actually did receive a sub-par cut of beef, i'm not sure. the asst. gm, matt, gave me his card and assured us the next cut of beef we received from them would surpass our expectations. with all the 5 star reviews, i would probably give it another chance."
