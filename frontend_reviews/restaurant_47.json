            "cosmopolitan hotel is absolutely gorgeous. we gamed a little to kill time before our <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> time at 6:00pm. once we got there, it looked a little empty, just around the bar were full. we were seated right away, we had a nice view of the whole restaurant. \n\nwe had two orders of fois gras french toast $22., tuna tartare $18., tuna sashimi $18., half a dozen oyster $18., and <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> salad. \n\nfor <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> we had the sea bass - no good because it's not chilean sea bass. , bone in ribeye - prepared great, seared big eye tuna - tasty, beef short rib - my friend said very tender and good. \n\n<mark>Strawberry Cobbler</mark> $16 - fruity flavor with cr<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> crusted rim \ndirty pearls $17 - vodka & blue cheese stuffed olives. it's different! \nwhite orchid $16. - not a sweet drink, smooth, vodka & slight gin \n\nwe weren't going to have any dessert but was talked into ( in a good way) so we ordered the warm tres leches cake; dulce de leche - coconut sorbet - crispy m<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>. it was so sweet.!!", 
            "love this pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>. i loved the stk franchises in nyc, and was excited to try the one in <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark>. \n\nfood: (5 out of 5 stars) \n-bread - omg the bread is so delicious and the green olive oil dip thing was good!! i feel that other pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> over do the olive taste in the olive oil dip, but this was amazing and so good. the bread was also so tender and soft yet crunchy and warm on the outside. definitely enjoy your bread!!!\n-steak loin strip - so tender and juicy and delicious!!! omg this was amazing.\n-mac n cheese - omg i love their mac n cheese. get it!!! definitely worth it. \n-parmesan truffle fries - these are not like your typical fries. they're short and chunky, but they bring them out and it has just the right amount of parmesan topping (some pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> over due the parmesan). its super warm and crunchy on the outside while warm on the inside. \n\ndrinks (5 out of 5)\n-<mark>Strawberry Cobbler</mark> graham cr<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> drink - if you're a girl, and u dont like the taste of alcohol and like sweet drinks, definitely get this!!! this was one of the better drinks i've drank in my life from a restaurant pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>. \n-j<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> and coke - super strong. they definitely give you your j<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> for your monies.\n-stk orgy shot - $15/shot or something like that, but it was good. esp for a girl who doesn't like the taste of alcohol. if you're here celebrating a special event and you're with a girl who can't take regular shots, definitely order this one!\n\natmosphere (4 out of 5)\ni liked the atmosphere, but the one draw b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> was that the music was a lil loud. they were playing up to date music and nice remixes / mashups, which is nice. i'm not complaining about the music selection at all!! but the volume could have been turned down, especially for a sunday night <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>. \nthe waiters were incredibly social and super chill. they were having the time of their lives while serving us and dancing around and clapping while on the job. \n\nperfect pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> to go for a pre-clubbing pre-outing atmosphere. if youre going to marquee,  or a similar club , this is the perfect pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> for a pre-game <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> and drinks.  also recommended if you're looking for a non-buffet, nice sit down restaurant to celebrate a special occasion with good music and good food (as long as you don't mind the volume)", 
            "not super impressed by this fancy steak house.  i did like the ambience and the music made it very vegas-like, but the food itself wasn't that great.  the steak was too charred for my taste, so it felt over-powering and i couldn't really enjoy the tenderness or quality of the beef.  i was at flemings a few weeks earlier and <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> enjoyed their steak a lot more.  \n\ni came with a large group and we tried pr<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> all the appetizers and sides.  the favorites of the night were the beef tartare, pork belly, and mac & cheese.  everything else was bleh.  i didn't come to the steakhouse to eat sides and appetizers though, so the steak was the biggest let down.  <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> are pretty strong.  i had a <mark>Strawberry Cobbler</mark>, which is very martini like and definitely left me buzzed at the end of <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>!  the restaurant is really pretty though and the service was great.", 
            "pretty good! my steak was great, so was the m<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> and <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> pud<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>. the bread looked amazing but <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> it wasn't that great... the drinks were super expensive, tried the <mark>Strawberry Cobbler</mark>- it was good, and something else that was more orangey and had prosecco in it, and it was tiny. i don't think this pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> was as good as, say mastros... but it was good. a bit overpriced, nice atmosphere. kinda loud, but the music was fun. the sweet potato donuts were good as well!", 
            "the atmosphere is fun. they played great music that made me want to dance like i used to at frat parties.\n\nthe free blue cheese. read with chive olive oil was amazing. i could have eaten just the bread and been happy!\n\ni had the <mark>Strawberry Cobbler</mark> martini - delicious. loved the fresh strawberries and graham cr<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> crust. \n\ni had a small filet. it was fine, but nothing too special. it was cooked more in the middle than the outside?!\n\nthe sides were delicious. we had the mac and cheese and potato au gratin. both were fantastic."

            "we had one of the most fun <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> experiences here last saturday night.  we were celebrating my friend's b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> and <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> at stk just kept the party going for us.\n\nstk is definitely not a quiet steakhouse.  it is a straight up party!  we waited in the bar area while our table for 7 was getting set up.  we had <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> drinks and within 3 tr<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> i was in love with the dj.  yes, a dj, spinning in a round booth sm<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> dab in the middle of the restaurant.  \n\nafter about 10 minutes a hostess seated us at our booth.  not long after our waiter martin came by.  when martin was explaining the days specials i literally stopped him as jay z starting pumping through the speakers and i belted out to him while waving my hands up and down... \"turn my music hi-hi-hi-hi-gher!!\"  it was epic... but you had to be there!  we all had <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> and proceeded to order.\n\nsome of the tasty craft cocktails we had throughout our meal were the <mark>Cucumber Stiletto</mark>, the lemoncello & raspberry martini, <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> with hibiscus flower in it, and iced te<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>.\n\na wonderful warm bread was brought out to the table.  it was soft and warm and yummo.  it had a light dipping sauce with it. soon after our starters came out.  the heirloom tomato and burrata with pesto was good and i was very surprised at how good <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> and avocado salad was.  i was not even thinking of ordering it but i'm glad we did.  it was reminiscent of a spring roll almost.  it was fresh and wonderful.  i wish we got two.\n\nour main courses came out and mine was <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> favorite.  i got the short rib and it was lovely.  there were <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> orders of the sea bass,  a filet, and the tuna tartar.  \n\ni love sides... see my \"last meal\" in the about me section.   stk's side dishes were delicious.  we sha<mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> pud<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>, mushroom pot pie, the fries, green beans, and mac n cheese. \n\nwe had a really fun experience here, somewhere along the ride, \"shots!\" was played by the dj and servers were coming out with trays full of shots of alcohol and handed them out to our table among others.  there was also an older white guy that was getting down on <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark>.  he literally hoped up on his booth and table and was rocking out to \"play that funky music\"\n\nsuper fun, super pricey, but it's vegas baby.... \"you're so money and you don't even know it!\"", 
            "i expected so much more from this restaurant. \nwe had an early reservation before a show, seated promptly ( pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> was empty at 6 on a friday). started with <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> <mark>Cucumber Stiletto</mark> cocktail, very good. moved on to several dishes beginning ( party of 4) with:\ntruffle fries - oily, poorly seasoned\nbeef carp<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> - sooo good, great flavor\ntartare - fresh, great presentation\nbeet salad - big hit, beets w: gorgonzola, super fresh and tasty.\nlobster cocktail - tinie, tiny.. claw portion with small bits of lobster in tomato broth = absolute waste of money.\nfor our entrees we had 2 steaks, risotto, seared ahi, side spin<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> and mac n cheese.\nall of the entrees were good, not mind blowing or memorable - just good. the mac n cheese should be removed from the menu - horrible. the spin<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> was boring, flavorless. \nthe only spark during this experience was our server - she was awesome. \ni definitely won't return, having sampled several items and only appreciating 2 ( beet , carp<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>) of them... it's not enough to bring me b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>.", 
            "i went here for my birthday <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> last week and had the best time. my birthday fell on a monday, which is a special night at stk as they host a dj and really get the party going. they keep the lighting low, music loud and energy high, making it the perfect pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> to get the party started!\n\ni started with the <mark>Cucumber Stiletto</mark> which was crisp and refreshing. we started the meal with the pear & endive salad, tuna tartare, and a buffalo mozzarell<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> over bread (which they made special for us since we had a vegetarian <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> with us that evening). all appitizer dishes exceeded my expectations. i'm not really a fish eater, but i tried the tuna tartare, and loved it!. for the main dishes, my group shared the vegetarian risotto, sea bass over mushroom risotto and loin strip steak. for sides, we got <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> pud<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>, mashed potatoes, and green beans. everything was excellent. at the end of the meal they came out with <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e with happy birthday written on the dish. i loved every minute at stk and i plan to come b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> the next time i'm in vegas.",

            "ah stk the pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> to be seen and to mingle. as soon as you walk into this restaurant you notice all the beautiful people, loud music, and dim atmosphere. the hostess sits you in round booths that are so close to your neighbor by the end of the night you might have new friends. you order a round of their signature cocktails and soak in the glitz and the glam. but is it worth all the hype and the $$$? \n\nservice - our waitress was awesome. she was very detailed when going over the menu (maybe a little too much) and was more than obliged to offer her recommendations. she was on top of her game and provided excellent service to our table. i was a little intimidated by the bussers as they were like vultures as soon as you finished a dish. they also swooped in to fold the napkin on the table everytime my date got up from the table. side note: just make sure to say you ordered sparkling water so they don't pour regular tap water when they see your glass almost empty. tap & sparkling do not mix well.\n\nfood - within minutes of being sat down, you are greeted with <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> parmesan garlic roll and it's dipping oil, which i can't remember what it was off the top of my head. the roll wasn't bad. \n\nwe order our cocktails and appetizers - tuna tartare & foie gras french toast. phenomenal! both were so refreshing and hit that palate perfectly. the tuna tartare was fresh with diced jalapenos, onions and lime in a t<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> shell with a avocado puree and chili oil. the foie gras french toast was balanced excellently. the toast in a sherry reduction and the foie gras perfectly cooked, sprinkled with powdered sugar and served with a po<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> apple made happy time in my mouth! i highly recommend these two apps. \n\nwe then ordered a medium rare bone-in fillet with a side of parmesan truffle fries, mac & cheese, mushroom pot pie and steamed alaskan crab legs. the fries were not like the usual shoestring fries you find around town, they were more like steak potato blocks, not bad if i say so myself. the mushroom pot pie is good for mushroom fiends. they bring it out as a pot pie and cut the top off and dump the filling on a plate for you. the alaskan crab legs were nicely plump and sweet, oh how i miss the northwest! \n\nnow for the main entree- for being a steakhouse i was disappointed that their steak did not live up to the hype. it was cooked perfectly but had no flavor! a little salt & pepper would have made it one of the top steaks in town. maybe the reason it's so bland is because they do give you an option to add a topping or sauce to your steak. however, i'm a purist and great steak doesn't need anything fancy on it if seasoned right. the waitress brought us their steak sauces to try and honestly i wasn't impressed by them. the flavor was so bland. the mushroom & peppercorn sauce was probably the better of the 4 but it still l<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> flavor. word of advice don't order the mac & cheese, no flavor whatsoever. i couldn't tell you if it was suppose to be a truffle mac & cheese or just a white mac & cheese (best mac & cheese: stripsteak's truffle mac & cheese). \n\nwait still not done! we had to top off the night with dessert to have the whole stk experience. we ordered a molten chocolate cake and the famous bread pud<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>. if you have a sweet tooth, these two desserts will rock your world. i did like the bread pud<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> but it was a little too sweet for me as it was drenched in <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> syrup. <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> crunch addition to the bread pud<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> was quite interesting. \n\nwhen all was said and done, we got are bill and walked away stuffed. we easily spent over $200 for the 2 of us but we also wanted to have the full stk experience. overall, <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> to be if you don't mind the loudness, dark lighting and have <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> hours to kill...our <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> lasted over 2 hours. \n\nside notes:  the timing between apps and entrees seemed so spread out. i feel like we waited 15-20 for our entree to come out, could be a bad thing if you're starving. the steak was a disappointment but willing to try it again or try something else. be prepared to wait in line to use the restroom as there is only one stall per gender. make reservations as it can get crowded.",

            "my first experience with stk was at the nyc location, and i was hardly surprised when they decided to bring an stk to my current digs in <mark>Malbec, Terrazas De Los Andes Altos Del Plata, AR 13</mark> -- <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> that has its fair share of trendy restaurants that l<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> culinary inspiration. suffices to say i was less than shocked when i heard <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> hotel in las vegas would also feature an stk restaurant. \n\nmy experiences at all three locations have been markedly different. the nyc location boasted good food and <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> atmosphere in the meatp<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> district (an area which wasn't hurting for culinary hot-spots at the time) and was able to deliver consistently, even in its nascent stages (i moved out of nyc shortly after it opened so i wasn't able to see how the restaurant fared in the later stages of its existence). while the steaks left something to be desired, the restaurant was trendy and the overall experience was fun. i'll unabashedly add that, hands down, the best steaks still come from texas. \n\nwhen the <mark>Malbec, Terrazas De Los Andes Altos Del Plata, AR 13</mark> restaurant opened, i was happy to see that same ambiance maintained, but unfortunately, the food was inconsistent at best (definitely nothing to write home about) and it's \"tren<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>\" quickly declined within its first year. stk la's biggest redeeming quality was (and still is) its proximity to other la nightlife hotspots, and the location is enough to get me there with a group of friends for some cocktails and light appetizers to kick the night off. \n\nfast forward to 2011 and the latest trendy hotel in vegas, <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark>, now boasts its very own stk. a group of us made up of my closest friends from texas, new york and california were staying at the hotel for the weekend to celebrate my birthday, so we decided to check out stk. i tried making a resie through the hotel but, annoyingly, the restaurant handles its own reservations and my call was promptly directed to their hostess. getting a reservation was easy enough -- i called 4 days in advance of our arrival -- and we figured 9:30pm would be a good time to eat before an insanely late night of dancing. our group of 4 arrived on time and the hostess informed us that the wait would be half an hour...with a reservation. disgruntled, but determined not to let the unfortunate news spoil our mood, we proceeded to the bar to have some very expensive, very plain drinks -- if you are price-sensitive and like to imbibe, then this is not the restaurant for you. \n\n45 minutes later, we were seated and starving. this is when things got exponentially better. our servers were incredibly fun, enthusiastic and attentive. throughout the entire meal, our waitress helped us by making great recommendations, taking photos of us to help commemorate the trip, and showering us with an endless supply of complimentary birthday shots as well as <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> dessert plate, replete with delectable bite-sized cake and ice-cream lollipops. crisis averted. be sure to request raquel m. as your server -- raquel and her fellow cohorts will make sure you have a blast. the restaurant manager even let us explore the kitchen, meet <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark>, observe the plating ritual and peruse all the fresh ingredients. the kitchen was very clean and well managed and the staff was very friendly. \n\nthe giant seafood platter we ordered was thoroughly enjoyed by everyone but me (i'm picky, obvi) --  the king crab was a little soggy for my taste and the oysters left me underwhelmed -- and the steaks were <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> better than the ones i had at the nyc and la locations. i ordered the ribeye medium rare and <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> and flavor were excellent. still not on par with texas steaks, but as far as the stk chain goes, i really enjoyed my meal.\n\nnet/net, while the steaks at stk restaurants are not my favorite, the ambiance is usually pretty fun and the staff at the las vegas location absolutely made this experience worthwhile. if you are staying at <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> and/or looking for a fun/trendy pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> to eat before you head to marquee, this is the pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> to go.",

            "our party of 9 ate here last saturday in celebration of my 30th birthday. we had a 7 p.m. reservation and were seated within minutes of our arrival. we had <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> booth that comfortably fit our large party. as others have mentioned, the music is very loud but i didn't feel it overpowered our conversation and we all enjoyed the ambiance - it is vegas after all! our waiter was attentive and mentioned at the beginning of our service that the bar was b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> up and it might be awhile until we get our drinks. no big <mark>Malbec, Terrazas De Los Andes Altos Del Plata, AR 13</mark>. we pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> our orders - salads as starters and various cuts of steaks for e<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> member of the party. one of our favorite parts of the meal was the table bread and whatever the ridiculously magical green dipping sauce was that came with it - yum! my husband and i shared a blue cheese wedge salad - good, but nothing to write home about. for my entree, i ordered the 10 oz. filet with truffle butter on top. the steak was good, but i have eaten at enough wonderful steak restaurants to know that i have definitely had better. i'm also not sure the truffle butter was worth an additional $12. we also ordered a few sides for the table - our party seemed to enjoy the truffle fries and lobster mashed potatoes.\n\nthe meal itself was fine, albeit not impressive, but at least we were enjoying ourselves. this is when things took a turn for the worse. we had paid the well over $1,000 bill and ordered one additional round of drinks to savor the last few minutes of my birthday celebration. at this point, we had been at the table for a reasonable amount of time to feed 9 people, and like i had mentioned earlier, the only holdup was waiting for our drinks to come from the bar. as we were still enjoying the last sips of our drinks, the waiter came over the our table, leaned down to me (who he knew was the birthday girl) and my sister-in-law, and bluntly said \"i'm gonna need your table\". we seriously could not believe our ears. i've never in my life experienced such unprofessional behavior, especially after just spen<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> a significant amount of money on an already sub par meal. if we had been lingering at the table too long, i could maybe understand - i get that you are a busy restaurant and it was a saturday night. but we had literally just paid the bill and had every right to still be at the table at the time he said this. maybe a better way to appro<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> the situation would have been to ask politely if we wouldn't mind moving to the bar. i am incredibly disappointed that we came here for my birthday <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>, and it will be a night to remember for all the wrong reasons. it is their responsibility to schedule their reservations with a reasonable amount of time for people to enjoy their meals and <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> they are with. i made this reservation well over a month in advance, and this was totally un<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>. because of this, i am never eating here again and will make sure others know that this is how they treat their guests.",

(when a friend ordered a glass of wine)\n- nobody's ordering anything (when a friend ordered a salad first, and he asked whether he should bring it out first, and she asked whether others were getting starters)\n- other outwardly aggressive stuff, like when two friends said they were splitting one of the larger steaks\n\nhe also pushed doing bottle service immediately without even asking if we were interested, and kept trying to push us to order more. again, we all had tabs of about $60+, on which he automatically got 20%. sorry that we don't want to e<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> get 20 oz. filets before hea<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> out for the night in tight las vegas club apparel??? looking b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>, perhaps the guaranteed gratuity meant there was no incentive for good service.\n\nthe food was delicious. we had several veggies, all fresh but nothing spect<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>; the m<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> which is highly touted and good, but again not the best i've had; steaks which even the most elite foodies in our group said were the best they've had, and the waygu sliders which were mind-blowing. no one got the signature cocktails, as they were all coated in candy and $18 apiece, which is absurd for a non-artisinal bar cocktail. i've had drinks at grant <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>'s aviary for less than that.\n\nwe left without complaining as we had to physically rush to make sure the rest of our night's plans weren't messed up.\n\nwould go b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> as the food definitely warranted a second shot, but i'd be weary.",

(4 of 5) $48 - tasty and juicy. nice cut and cooked perfectly to medium rare. no complaints, but at the end, the rib steak was tastier because of the fat content.\n* bone-in rib steak 20 oz. (4 of 5) $49 - tasty and the bone was so small, it was almost like boneless. this was tasty and juicy.   \n* add on topping foie gras (5 of 5) $15 - what a bang for the buck! this is probably <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> add on foie gras price ever and it was a huge piece. delicious!!!\n* add on side raw horseradish $2 - we were slightly disappointed that the menu asked for $2 for raw horseradish. nonetheless, we had to order it. \n\noverall, the pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> was nice, food was good, and staff was very helpful.",

            "i've found my new favorite steakhouse in vegas!  \n\ni made reservations way in advance for a friend's b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> party.  we came on a saturday night at 7:30pm, and were seated pretty quickly.  our servers were awesome!  everyone was super nice!  i had bought a round of shots for the table, and our server came b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> with a 2nd round on him!  \n\nall of us ordered some form of steak, and we thoroughly enjoyed every last bite.  i topped my fillet with foie gras and it was heaven!  i'm still very upset that ca banned it!  we ordered sides to share: creamed spinahc, parmesan truffle fries, mac & cheese, mushroom pot pie and the special trio of mac & cheese.  oh, and i can't forget about their bread!  it was topped with melted blue cheese, and we ate it all!  either we're a bunch of pigs or all the food was delicious because there was nothing left.\n\nanother reason we loved the restaurant was the music.  the dj was spinning hip hop and he had us dancing in our seats.  even the table next to us was having a great time and danced as they got up to walk around!  it does get pretty loud in the restaurant, so don't go there expecting to have a quiet, romantic <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>. \n\nthe only one bad thing i could even think of for stk was the single stall for the bathrooms.  not very convenient.  but everything else was superb!", 
            "i've been to this stk at least 4 times and they always deliver a great experience!  compared to the one in <mark>Malbec, Terrazas De Los Andes Altos Del Plata, AR 13</mark>, the vegas stk seems to win in every category.  for starters, the d\\u00e9cor is very sleek and modern but still intimate and perfect for any occasion.  we started at the bar and ordered <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> before getting seated.  there were 8 of us so there wasn't much room considering this is more of a sit down restaurant versus a bar to hang at.  shortly after our drinks arrived we were sat in the upper booths but still had a perfect view of the whole restaurant.  as usually the wait staff is immediately on top of things and comes by to introduce themselves and talk about the specials.  we ordered another round of drinks as well as a few bottles of wine to go with our much anticipated steaks!  this is a very high end restaurant so you need to expect to spend some cash; however i wasn't thoroughly impressed with what they delivered for wines in the $100-$200 price range.  it's more our fault since we were looking to save a few bucks since we just spent nearly $10k in bottle service over the la<mark>Zinfandel, St. Francis, Sonoma, CA 12</mark> days.  anyway, for a starter we all ordered the tuna tartar and i must say it's probably the best out there.  that is a seriously bold statement coming from a guy who lives in la and has sushi joints at nearly every corner.  but seriously this is beyond delicious!   the tuna was very fresh and of the highest quality.  it wasn't a huge portion but they served it on some sort of <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> wonton cripes and dressed it with oil and an avocado sauce.  the mixture of the avocado and sweetness of the wonton was unbelievable when eaten with the tuna.  also, by ad<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> the sugar to the wonton it kept the shell together so it didn't fall apart like most in tartar dishes.  next came the steaks and the sides and as always the meat was of the highest quality.  although everything was amazingly delicious, i did learn one valuable lesson about steaks.  since we were on our way to another club i didn't want to over stuff myself so i ordered the petite filet; <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> of the other guys ordered the medium size or larger.  we ordered them medium rare but i noticed mine was cooked more through than the others.  the lesson is, always go with the larger even if you don't plan on eating it so <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> can stay cooler while charring the outside.  anyway, it was still very good but just a small thing to point out.  a few of the other guys went with the porter house and it was just perfect.  for sides we had the mash potatoes, mac and cheese, cream spin<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> and some garlic potato wedges.  for me the mac and cheese was just beyond amazing!  crispy on the outer edge and creamy on the inside.  the spin<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> and the potatoes were a little under salted for me but i think they do it so you catch more of the steaks flavor versus having too rich of a side.  to finish things off we all ordered a double espresso, a lemon cello and <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> chocolate peanut butter bars.    the whole experience was extremely top notch from start to finish and that is why i go to stk every time i'm in vegas.",

(more hardcore carnivores may probably opt for a larger cut, but 7 oz was just right for me.)  \n\n** broccolini.  an i<mark>Malbec, Terrazas De Los Andes Altos Del Plata, AR 13</mark> side dish, since it was excellently cooked, and provided a nice crunch to contrast with the filet.\n\n** sweet potato donuts.  you might not think of stk as a dessert destination, but these divine donuts might change your mind.  sweet potato made for an unusual twist on <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> donut, and a gooey and decadent pecan glaze brought it all together.  heaven!\n\nservice was outstan<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>.  pretty much everyone on the staff looks like a model, with sex appeal dripping out of every pore -- but don't expect \"vanderpump rules\"-style drama or catty behavior.  quite <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> -- the staff at stk are 100% professional and courteous, and quite friendly.  the p<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> of the dishes was nice and steady, and we were never felt rushed or pressured to leave, even as we lingered over glasses of wine for maybe ~30 min after we had paid our tab.\n\ni was definitely impressed by stk.  the whole experience was prfct.",

            "such a nice surprise for my birthday trip to vegas.  i wanted somewhere fun, good, and not too expensive to have a birthday <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> and this was perfect.\n\nparking: it's located in cosmo, on the 3rd floor.  if you park in self-parking you have to walk kind of far because it's located near the lobby.\n\natmosphere: the inside is dark and trendy.  with hanging ball lights and cool fixtures.  i made reservations for 6pm because we had to get to <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> early and it was slightly crowded, but i'm sure it gets more crowded later on at night.  it was perfect for a fancy birthday <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>.  we got a half booth half table with 3 people sitting on chairs.  for attire i could see you getting away with a nice skirt and top, fancy top and jeans or dress.  you can't be overdressed here.\n\ni heard the music was super loud and fun, which makes the <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> experience better but at 6pm the music was kind of soft and more old school.  i think as the night went on it got louder and they were slowly making their way into the 90s but we didn't stay long enough to experience it.  \n\nfood: \n\nsteak - their cheapest steak is like $39 and they have a lot of other options but if you don't like steak i wouldn't come here.  my suggestion is to share the steak with someone else because it is pretty big and expensive.  my boyfriend and i shared the bone in rib steak (basically the rib eye) and it was plenty for both of us.  the steak itself doesn't come with anything so it's recommended you get sides ($12 e<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>!) we got 4 to share among the 8 of us and it was plenty.  beware though because we got the truffle mac n cheese and that was more than $12.  you can get \"toppings\" on top of your steak but it's not needed.  the steak itself is very flavorful and tasty without anything.\n\nsides -\ntruffle mac n cheese - the mac was the round short pastas usually in m<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> salad and i really liked that.  a good crust on the top with a yummy truffle flavor and pretty creamy mac n cheese.\n\ntruffle parmesan fries - they are thickly cut and are more like potato rectangles than fries.  they are st<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> like jenga and have parmesan and truffle oil on them. they were a little too potato-y and thick for my liking but everyone at the table loved them.\n\nmushroom pot pie - a weird side but it was literally a pot pie with mushrooms, onions and <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> sauce inside.  it tasted like truffle but i don't even know if it had truffle.  the top is a light crust, which wasn't that flaky and pretty thin.\n\nbok choy - weird for a steak pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> but it was kinda spicy.  very flavorful though with lots of soy sauce and garlic.  not bad <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> for some greens.\n\noverall very impressed with stk.  i thought it would be more for the atmosphere but the food was really good! they even brought me out this chocolate cake/mousse for my birthday with <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> :)",

one complaint is they used a maraschino cherry (i.e., bright red) vs. a gourmet cocktail cherry.  that would have made <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> perfection in a glass.\n\nvodka martini up w/ splash of st. germain - perfection in a glass; a signature of mine, i've found a lot of pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> over-do the st. germain so it's too sweet and not to my liking.  this pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> nailed it (twice - oops!).\n\nglass of \"justin\" cabernet savignon to pair with the steak ($4) - we'd tried a bottle of justin red blend previously (retails around $40-50 a bottle), so we decided to try out <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark>.  we were not disappointed, and it paired very nicely with the filet.\n\noverall: \n\nfantastic <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> experience.  an experience indeed.  will definitely be b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>;

            "features:\n-we came here in a group of 7 people and got seated within 20 minutes.  we were all really excited for this restaurant even though we have one in la.  we ordered several sides that were flavored really well.  the first was <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> yukon potatoes, this was good, not too dry.  my favorite was the sweet corn pud<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>.  this was really flavorful and like the name says, sweet.  the mac and cheese was okay, this was nothing original so i would not recommend this really.  the mushroom pot pie was scrumptious, all my friends really liked it.  enough to order a second one at least. \n-i had the medium filet which i wanted medium cooked and boy was this juicy and appetizing.  there's a reason why this pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> is known for their steaks!  i don't think any other pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> can make their steaks better than stk.  \n-at the end of the meal, we e<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> had an expresso shot.  let me say this, their expresso kept me up all night!  lol!  this was a great <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> experience, so hope you get to enjoy this pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>!\n\nimprovement:\n-it took a little less than 20 minutes to seat up but preferably, since we made reservations, we wanted to be seated right away.\n\ntips:\n-the bread they give you was delicious and soft, it came in this green dipping sauce that was really good.  make sure to have a little of that before your big meal!\n-the portions of the steaks were sized depen<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> on what size you order but we shared a medium between two people and we were stuffed.", 
            "love, love, love this pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>! i've heard so many great things about stk, but at first, i have to admit that i was a little bit hesitant to try it. over here in la, we have so many eateries and when we want a good steak and service, we always resort to ruth chris's. \n\nmy boyfriend and i made reservations to celebrate our 4 year anniversary. when i called the restaurant, i never told the hostess that we were celebrating anything and the next available reservation she had available was at 11:15. ofcourse, it being a friday night and in vegas, we figured we could do a little bit of gambling at <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> before having <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>. we arrived at the restaurant around 11 and instantly, we loved the vibe of the restaurant and the beautiful decor. normally, the bf and i would want a nice, quiet environment   for <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> since we're in our early 30s (yes, we're old!), but we figured, why not since we're in vegas. the restaurant was busy, but filled with good music. we decided to grab a drink at the bar while waiting. i've been to vegas many times and usually, it takes a while for a male to order a drink. the kind bartender instantly noticed my boyfriend and helped us out. customer service is one of the biggest things we value when we go out to eat and if a pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> doesn't have good customer service, we usually aren't returning customers.  \n\nthe hostess sat us to our table and asked us if we were celebrating anything. we just responded that we were in vegas for a wed<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>, but we decided to kill 2 birds with 1 stone and also celebrate our anniversary since we haven't been out in a while. our server was named luis <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> us immediately and served us some of their delicious and buttery bread. he explained to us the menu and also the sauces that we can add-on to our steak, if we wanted. i ordered the rib-eye, medium rare and the bf ordered the same thing. as sides, we ordered the broccolini and the mac and cheese. \n\n our food came out on time but i noticed that my steak was cooked more on the medium well as i cut into it. i normally don't like to complain, and i wasn't going to, but our waiter luis noticed that our steaks weren't what we had ordered and wanted to make things right. he took b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> our steaks and had new ones made. while our steaks were being made, the bf and i just sn<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> on the broccolini since we were starving. as soon as luis brought b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> our new steaks, he brought out some new sides because he wanted our sides to be warm for our steaks. he kindly apologized about the food and also brought us some shots.\n\nour steaks and our sides were absolutely delicious! the mac and cheese was creamy, the broccolini had a nice parmesan garlic flavor to it, and our steaks were cooked to perfection. i added a side of chimichurri sauce and that made my steak even more heavenly. as soon as we finished our meal, luis found out from the hostess that we were celebrating an anniversary, and brought us <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> dessert! the desserts consisted of a warm apple crisp and <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> cheesecake. both desserts were scrumptious and after eating there, i was afraid the zipper on my desk would rip! lol. we ended up also chatting with another worker named chris who gave us some recommendations on things to do that were nearby. he also explained how he enjoyed working at stk because of how the staff feels like a family since they also hang out after work. \n\nluis and chris, you guys are amazing! one of you told us that anyone who comes in is treated like vip at stk, and i truly believe it. the food and <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> service is why we will be returning to eat there in the future, every time we make a trip out to vegas. thank you for making our 4 year anniversary very memorable for the both of us!", 
            "we came at a perfect time, when the noise level was at an appropriate level. from everything that i've read and heard, the loud head-poun<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> music can be a turn off for those who yearn for a romantic candle-lit <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>, where you can <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> hear e<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> other conversate and not just pretend to be. so my tip for you would be book your reservation at a really early time, our was for 5:30pm. \n\ni requested a booth so that we could have more seating and arm room. my request was readily <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> for. our server was really sweet and genuine. i had to wait for <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> for over 30min even though the pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> was not quite p<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> yet, but i guess they had to go get a watermelon so she told me <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> would be on the house.\n\nwe started off with the beef carp<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> w/ pesto angel hair, fried lobster tail and crab salad w/ honeydew and grapefruit. everything was delish, and balanced e<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> other very nicely. \n\nthe hub<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> the porterhouse and i ended up w/ the bone-in-filet topped w/ foie gras. sides were truffle parmesan fries, brocollini and corn pud<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>. our steaks were cooked to perfection, but the stk sauce that we chose didn't complement it very well. i wished our steak was seasoned just a bit more, so that no sauce was needed. after our request for a1 came, it made everything so much better!! <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> pud<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> had too much fillers and not enough corn so i would skip out on that next time. i loved my thick cut truffle fries, but it was way too pungent tasting for the hubs. \n\nas for dessert, we just had to get the sweet potato donuts! we were so full, but luckily the donuts were light and airy. we had an enjoyable evening, but i'm not sure if we would be b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> w/ all the many vegas options there is that we have yet to try.", 
            "considering we were guests of cosmopolitan, i was excited to learn stk was in the hotel.  i've been to other locations in dc and nyc.. but the rest of my party first time. \n\nlong story short, the hostess made every attempt on getting us to leave. our reservation which was made 2 weeks prior wasn't honored, we were shuffled around the <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> area because the hostess confused two groups, one of 4 other of 5 (our group and the other only had one thing in common). they seat us at a bar table. this was my best friends 40th birthday, which i noted on the reservation... i've sat at the bar for many years with 40 years plus on this earth, i couldn't stand for it!!  \n\nafter my complaint, they then seat us in the b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> by the kitchen. the waiter was witty so we decided to stay... we order, receive our food - all of it was cold and had to be sent b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> (at this point we hoped for the best, but really should've left). it was so bad that one person in the party just opted not to eat. (very sad f<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>)\n\nthe waiter was great (sorry didn't catch his name) ...we really appreciated him for making up for the hostesses many attempts on trying to get us to leave. it's unfortunate this happened because i raved to my friends on how much i loved this pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>... :(", 
            "well you're in vegas, and you want some steak.  i hope you just hit a hot roll at <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> table, cause you'll need it <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> at this pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>.  don't get me wrong, the steaks are great, but you def pay for what you get.  plus there's a dj with an attr<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> atmosphere (people, aka female people), so you'll get the full vegas experience.\n\ni would skip the seafood tower, and just focus on the meat and load up (share) some sides.  the seafood tower is grand and looks cool among other tables, but the value just isn't there.  especially if e<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> oyster or claw works out to be like $20 a piece.  the sauce that it comes with are really awesome though.  so maybe you can just get some bowls of that!", 
            "like mastros, stk is a part of the new wave of modern steakhouses - loud rock music, tattooed wait staff, dim lighting, etc. it's more like a nightclub that serves excellent cuisine. \n\nbut enough about the decor...\n\nwe were a party of 8 and literally everything was delicious. <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark>... the steaks... the sides... the dessert.... all of it was well worth every penny. the parmesan fries and corn pud<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> were highlights as was the peppercorn crusting on the meats. i had the filet which was cooked perfectly. plus they do bone-in as an option. \n\nnow stk isn't cheap. in f<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> it's a tad overpriced relative to portion size. plus the appetizers were not as exceptional as the rest of the meal. but... i can say this pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> is definitely one of the top steakhouses i've eaten in.",

            "i came to las vegas for a business conference and one of my managers recommended this restaurant. it is everything you think of when you watch tv shows like \"sex and <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark>!\" it is modern, hip, refined, elegant and caters to the uppity 30 to 50 year old crowd. \n\neveryone from the restaurant staff to customers were dressed to impress. i felt like i was in that movie \"oceans 11\" with george clooney..\n\ni came with a party of 5 and we ordered several different steaks and side dishes, as well as wine and dessert.\n\nappetizers:\n\nthey give you this baked loaf of bread with parmesan and garlic sprinkled over the top. it comes with a dipping sauce of herb infused butter oil. it is really a tasty treat.\n\n\nsalad: they have a great salad that comes with goat cheese, greens and balsamic vinegar drizzled over it. it is kind of a small salad, but it is quite tasty.\n\n\nentrees:\n\ni ordered the 14 ounce filet steak that is cooked on the bone. my waiter recommended that its better to get the steak that is cooked on the bone, because the meat is more flavorful and juicy. when they serve the meat, it is deboned, and it is was very good. i ordered it medium and it came out and was super tender, but still dense and so it felt like a real steak and not just soft. it was very tasty and you can order a few sides with your meal.\n\nmy colleagues also ordered different steaks and they all enjoyed their various entrees. \n\nwe ordered several different sides and i would rate them as the following:\n\ncreamy corn:  this was herb infused corn with creamy goodness. it had the texture of mashed potatoes, but it was a very robu<mark>Zinfandel, St. Francis, Sonoma, CA 12</mark> flavor.\n\njalapeno cheese grits:   green jalapeno pureed with melted cheese and infused into the grits. it had a spicy kick and it was pretty good.\n\nmushroom pot pie:    this is a great dish to order on the side. its basically mushrooms saut\\u00e9ed with caramelized onions and cream sauce in a little pot pie. i enjoyed scooping out the mushrooms and drizzling them over my steak. the flavor combination was intense.\n\n\nthe wine list is pretty good and we ordered a bottle of pinot noir. i forgot which one, but the waiter said its very popular and you should buy this in a full bottle.\n\n\ndessert:   they have a pist<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> and strawberry cake that is baked on an almond and marzipan coated crust. it is served with whipped cream and drizzled with strawberry sauce and its amazing! it is very light and not too heavy and a great way to end your meal.\n\n\nthis is a pricy restaurant, but its worth visiting when you are in vegas for a special <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> or night out with friends. one of the better steakhouses in las vegas!",

            "my party of 4 came here for <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> and was greeted by great service. our server was friendly, and attended to our food complaints professionally.\n\nbread with blue cheese sauce and chive olive oil - this was rather adventurous and i really enjoyed it since i'm a fan of blue cheese. unfortunately, my friends didnt enjoy it quite as much :( to e<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> its own!\n\nbeef tartare with bl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> truffle, sliced radish, soy caramel - love how the fragrance of the bl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> truffle brought out the freshness of the beef. the potato chip was also very fresh. really enjoyed this.\n\npork belly with soy glaze, pickled radish and ginger - the first time this was served, the pork belly was over cooked so much that it was tough and chewy. not great. had to send this b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>. the second time was much better and more well seasoned, though still a little too tough for my liking. i'd give this a pass.\n\nlil brgs (wagyu sliders) - super good!! we didnt add truffles or foie gras, but if i had <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> to do this again, i'd definitely try ad<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> both!\n\nmedium sirloin steak - the best steak of the night. steak was beautifully cooked, soft, easily cut, and had a layer of fats making the steak not too dry. definitely recommended.\n\nmedium filet with foie gras topping - steak was slightly too dry for my liking, but foie gras was beautifully cooked. \n\nmedium rare filet medallion - the first time this was served, the beef was way overcooked. it was so cooked that it tasted overly-charred, and the beef was definitely past medium rare. we had this sent b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> and the beef was perfectly cooked the second time round. recommended!\n\nsides:\nmushroom pot pie - this was yummy, but way too salty. there is no way the pot pie can be this salty. we contemplated sen<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> this b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> too, but by then have given up on having our food sent b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> so we just ate it anyway.\n\ntruffle fries - omg so good. must order. freshly cut potato with truffles. can't go wrong.\n\nmac and cheese - decent but ok to pass.\n\nthe bill came up to be about $330 before tips, inclu<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> a bottle of <mark>Riesling, Anew, Columbia Valley, WA 12</mark> is pretty ok. ambience was nice with great music. \n\n4 stars for food (after they finally got it right), but unfortunately having to send food b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> twice is un<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> for a fine <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> restaurant, hence -1 star. thankfully, the waiter handled it professionally and made sure we were very satisfied with our food."

            "updated review: (marked down to 3 stars).\n\nwe had such a great experience here during the grand opening that we decided to go b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> a week later with a friend visiting from out of town.  the experience was not as great.  here is the low down:\n\nhost staff:  clueless.\nwe made reservations a few days in advance and asked to sit with our server from our first visit.  on the night of our <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> we arrived 20 minutes early to see plenty of open tables but the hostess was absolutely clueless on what to do with us.  uh, seat us maybe?  we gave her a break and decided to sit in the lounge for a drink while she sorted it out but after 30 minutes (10 minutes after our reservation) we never got appro<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> about our table (except for the wrong name - \"are you mr. kluss\"?) and so we had to go b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> up to the stand to find out what was going on with the <mark>Malbec, Terrazas De Los Andes Altos Del Plata, AR 13</mark>.  the hostess seemed like she was making an excuse up (similar to lost homework judging from her age) as to why our table still wasn't ready and so we ended up having to talk to another hostess to get it right.  when they finally went to sit us down it wasn't in the servers area we had twice requested (once during our reservation a week before and once when we arrived).  when we let her know of the mistake the hostess seating us (a different one) made some rude remark about how 'messed up' things were here and sat us down in the section we requested.  not a good tee-off to a $260 <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> for 3.\n\n<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>: too slow and with mistakes.\nthe best part of <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> was the demeanor from or original server.  she was a real pro and as cool as we remembered the first time but seemed to be hamstrung by the slow kitchen service and a few lapses in attention to detail from there - missing or slow items she had to notice and then retrieve.  i'm no stranger to fine <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> and a slow p<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> is nice but it took a good 40 minutes just to get our apps - thats too long.  overall the food was just \"okay\" for as long as we waited and for the price.  i've been much more impressed at half a dozen other steakhouses in town (the palm @ caesars, capital grill, ruths chris's, del friscos, flemings etc).  really surprised too that <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> were made so inconsistently (in taste) because how complicated is <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>?  it was so left to right that we had to keep saying something to the point that the server felt bad enough to finally bring us an extra (right) one for free.\n\nsummary:\nlike the other reviewer our trouble started with the front host staff and unfortunately continued with slow service.  as native las vegans we like <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> a lot as far as hotels go and may give stk another shot after we've tried the other restaurants at the hotel first.  the layout is great, the decor, the music and the overall vibe are solid too but as far as service goes and food that blows you away goes - maybe they just have opening week issues.\n\ncaveat emptor.", 
            "hostess and wait staff were perfectly <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>, although it was a monday night and i guess they weren't super busy. our party of 5 showed up without a reservation around 7, 730pm and were seated within 10 minutes. our drinks from the bar hadn't even arrived so they were brought to our booth. \n\nambience was great, a dj was spinning some excellent tunes (think bennie and the jetts) - although music was a bit loud for conversation.\n\ni had the 10 oz. filet and my friend had the organic chicken. i loved <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> on my steak. the steak was tender and flavorful despite the f<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> that i opted out of any additional toppings/sauce for my steak (i'm a purist). <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> was very soft and moist, although the portion was very small.\n\nwe shared sides:\n-mac and cheese (standard, nothing special. i consider myself a mac  n cheese connoisseur and i like a good crispy crust with cheesy al dente pasta but this was more <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> white concoction that i wasn't in love with)\n-parmesan truffle fries (not shoe string but more like perfectly rectangular steak fries, st<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> kinda like jenga. pretty good but again, nothing to die for)\n-roasted carrots (baby yellow and orange market carrots - delicious, tender, flavorful)\n-mushroom pot pie (presentation was great. they bring it out in it's little pot, cut around the top of <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> and dump the dish out upside down onto another plate. presentation was better than the flavor - basically different mushrooms in <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> sauce, but still fun.)\n\n overall: my steak did it for me. i'd go b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>.",

            "food was pretty good, could have been better...\n\nservice was fast and sharp thought it better be due to that they had too many staff members who were just stan<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> around. \n\nmusic was too loud where u have to almost yell to talk and the music selection was ju<mark>Zinfandel, St. Francis, Sonoma, CA 12</mark>...\n\none thing i love was the hostess... totaly hottie , i would go b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> jus tto see her",

(btw, there is a big fr<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> knob for the volume. turn it counter-clockwise)\n\n\nlike many of the reviews on here, i was hoping for awesome and i got moments of cool with whole smattering of  average. i have eaten at 90% of the steakhouses here in town and i have a pretty good feel for what is hip and cool. \n\nambiance-\nthe music is way to fr<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> loud. it's bad form to have to yell at my wife who is 3 feet away from me during <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>.  i have 6000 watt home theater with 4 18 inch subs so i'm not in the \"if it's too loud your too old club\".  \n\nbut for an upscale steakhouse in an amazing casino it's just amateurish. i get concepts and this one just sucks. \n\nnor is this the pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> to bring clients to discuss business. it is however a good pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> to bring inlaws because you won't be able to hear them.\n\nannoyance f<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> minus 2 stars\n\nfood-\nwe asked for a heavy peppercorn rub on our steaks so much so that the steaks would be \"ruined\" with pepper. they brought our steaks cooked perfectly to temp and with a thick coating of peppercorns.  perfect! i had the stk bold sauce and my wifey had <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> horseradish. my sauce was good if not a bit too sweet and the horseradish cream sauce was blah. \n\nwe had the truffle fries (loved), asparagus (good as it can be) and mac and cheese(eh, cheesier and more crunch please)\n\nif i had to find fault it would be that food came out a bit too quick. it was about 5 or so minutes after the apps were completed. \n\noverall n9ne, botero and brand have a better product. \n\nminus .5 stars\n\n\nstaff- \nthe foh girls were cute, dressed well and very friendly.  no complaints here. \nbar staff was interesting- my bartender told me her signature drink was <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> and basil martini. she said was it amazing and i asked, is she so sure that she will buy it if i don't like it? she said no.  fair enough, except the bartender next to her had a group of folks come in. couldn't tell if they were friends or business but there were 8 of them in the group and he proceeded to make them all drinks and then tell the group that the whole round was on them.  hmmm....\ni joked to my girl if i could be part of their group. she didn't get it. oh and <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> martini at union is way better. \n\nour waiter was awesome as was the buss staff.  he was polite, fun and knowledgeable about the menu.  \n\n\ni probably won't be b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> as i'd rather go to n9ne or botero for the same price and not have to <mark>Malbec, Terrazas De Los Andes Altos Del Plata, AR 13</mark> with the fr<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> music. plus n9ne has <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> vibe that is way more  my liking than \"steak at the roxbury\" feel of stk.", 
            "ah stk the pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> to be seen and to mingle. as soon as you walk into this restaurant you notice all the beautiful people, loud music, and dim atmosphere. the hostess sits you in round booths that are so close to your neighbor by the end of the night you might have new friends. you order a round of their signature cocktails and soak in the glitz and the glam. but is it worth all the hype and the $$$? \n\nservice - our waitress was awesome. she was very detailed when going over the menu (maybe a little too much) and was more than obliged to offer her recommendations. she was on top of her game and provided excellent service to our table. i was a little intimidated by the bussers as they were like vultures as soon as you finished a dish. they also swooped in to fold the napkin on the table everytime my date got up from the table. side note: just make sure to say you ordered sparkling water so they don't pour regular tap water when they see your glass almost empty. tap & sparkling do not mix well.\n\nfood - within minutes of being sat down, you are greeted with <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> parmesan garlic roll and it's dipping oil, which i can't remember what it was off the top of my head. the roll wasn't bad. \n\nwe order our cocktails and appetizers - tuna tartare & foie gras french toast. phenomenal! both were so refreshing and hit that palate perfectly. the tuna tartare was fresh with diced jalapenos, onions and lime in a t<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> shell with a avocado puree and chili oil. the foie gras french toast was balanced excellently. the toast in a sherry reduction and the foie gras perfectly cooked, sprinkled with powdered sugar and served with a po<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> apple made happy time in my mouth! i highly recommend these two apps. \n\nwe then ordered a medium rare bone-in fillet with a side of parmesan truffle fries, mac & cheese, mushroom pot pie and steamed alaskan crab legs. the fries were not like the usual shoestring fries you find around town, they were more like steak potato blocks, not bad if i say so myself. the mushroom pot pie is good for mushroom fiends. they bring it out as a pot pie and cut the top off and dump the filling on a plate for you. the alaskan crab legs were nicely plump and sweet, oh how i miss the northwest! \n\nnow for the main entree- for being a steakhouse i was disappointed that their steak did not live up to the hype. it was cooked perfectly but had no flavor! a little salt & pepper would have made it one of the top steaks in town. maybe the reason it's so bland is because they do give you an option to add a topping or sauce to your steak. however, i'm a purist and great steak doesn't need anything fancy on it if seasoned right. the waitress brought us their steak sauces to try and honestly i wasn't impressed by them. the flavor was so bland. the mushroom & peppercorn sauce was probably the better of the 4 but it still l<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> flavor. word of advice don't order the mac & cheese, no flavor whatsoever. i couldn't tell you if it was suppose to be a truffle mac & cheese or just a white mac & cheese (best mac & cheese: stripsteak's truffle mac & cheese). \n\nwait still not done! we had to top off the night with dessert to have the whole stk experience. we ordered a molten chocolate cake and the famous bread pud<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>. if you have a sweet tooth, these two desserts will rock your world. i did like the bread pud<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> but it was a little too sweet for me as it was drenched in <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> syrup. <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> crunch addition to the bread pud<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> was quite interesting. \n\nwhen all was said and done, we got are bill and walked away stuffed. we easily spent over $200 for the 2 of us but we also wanted to have the full stk experience. overall, <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> to be if you don't mind the loudness, dark lighting and have <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> hours to kill...our <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> lasted over 2 hours. \n\nside notes:  the timing between apps and entrees seemed so spread out. i feel like we waited 15-20 for our entree to come out, could be a bad thing if you're starving. the steak was a disappointment but willing to try it again or try something else. be prepared to wait in line to use the restroom as there is only one stall per gender. make reservations as it can get crowded.",

(i was wondering why they didn't give us steak knives)  our water glasses were constantly refilled, and the wine selection was overwhelming. (in a good way)  we also enjoyed <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> lollipop desserts.  the ambience was hip, and the music selection was good.

(chandelier bar) i guess when you are this popular you don't care about this. but the novelty always wears off! not sure if i would go b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>. i did enjoy the music and people watching. i don't like being asked to move before i'm ready. we were on <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> which normally gets better service too. so not sure if it would have been different otherwise.",

            "our party of 9 ate here last saturday in celebration of my 30th birthday. we had a 7 p.m. reservation and were seated within minutes of our arrival. we had <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> booth that comfortably fit our large party. as others have mentioned, the music is very loud but i didn't feel it overpowered our conversation and we all enjoyed the ambiance - it is vegas after all! our waiter was attentive and mentioned at the beginning of our service that the bar was b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> up and it might be awhile until we get our drinks. no big <mark>Malbec, Terrazas De Los Andes Altos Del Plata, AR 13</mark>. we pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> our orders - salads as starters and various cuts of steaks for e<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> member of the party. one of our favorite parts of the meal was the table bread and whatever the ridiculously magical green dipping sauce was that came with it - yum! my husband and i shared a blue cheese wedge salad - good, but nothing to write home about. for my entree, i ordered the 10 oz. filet with truffle butter on top. the steak was good, but i have eaten at enough wonderful steak restaurants to know that i have definitely had better. i'm also not sure the truffle butter was worth an additional $12. we also ordered a few sides for the table - our party seemed to enjoy the truffle fries and lobster mashed potatoes.\n\nthe meal itself was fine, albeit not impressive, but at least we were enjoying ourselves. this is when things took a turn for the worse. we had paid the well over $1,000 bill and ordered one additional round of drinks to savor the last few minutes of my birthday celebration. at this point, we had been at the table for a reasonable amount of time to feed 9 people, and like i had mentioned earlier, the only holdup was waiting for our drinks to come from the bar. as we were still enjoying the last sips of our drinks, the waiter came over the our table, leaned down to me (who he knew was the birthday girl) and my sister-in-law, and bluntly said \"i'm gonna need your table\". we seriously could not believe our ears. i've never in my life experienced such unprofessional behavior, especially after just spen<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> a significant amount of money on an already sub par meal. if we had been lingering at the table too long, i could maybe understand - i get that you are a busy restaurant and it was a saturday night. but we had literally just paid the bill and had every right to still be at the table at the time he said this. maybe a better way to appro<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> the situation would have been to ask politely if we wouldn't mind moving to the bar. i am incredibly disappointed that we came here for my birthday <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>, and it will be a night to remember for all the wrong reasons. it is their responsibility to schedule their reservations with a reasonable amount of time for people to enjoy their meals and <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> they are with. i made this reservation well over a month in advance, and this was totally un<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>. because of this, i am never eating here again and will make sure others know that this is how they treat their guests.",

(when a friend ordered a glass of wine)\n- nobody's ordering anything (when a friend ordered a salad first, and he asked whether he should bring it out first, and she asked whether others were getting starters)\n- other outwardly aggressive stuff, like when two friends said they were splitting one of the larger steaks\n\nhe also pushed doing bottle service immediately without even asking if we were interested, and kept trying to push us to order more. again, we all had tabs of about $60+, on which he automatically got 20%. sorry that we don't want to e<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> get 20 oz. filets before hea<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> out for the night in tight las vegas club apparel??? looking b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>, perhaps the guaranteed gratuity meant there was no incentive for good service.\n\nthe food was delicious. we had several veggies, all fresh but nothing spect<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>; the m<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> which is highly touted and good, but again not the best i've had; steaks which even the most elite foodies in our group said were the best they've had, and the waygu sliders which were mind-blowing. no one got the signature cocktails, as they were all coated in candy and $18 apiece, which is absurd for a non-artisinal bar cocktail. i've had drinks at grant <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>'s aviary for less than that.\n\nwe left without complaining as we had to physically rush to make sure the rest of our night's plans weren't messed up.\n\nwould go b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> as the food definitely warranted a second shot, but i'd be weary.",

(4 of 5) $48 - tasty and juicy. nice cut and cooked perfectly to medium rare. no complaints, but at the end, the rib steak was tastier because of the fat content.\n* bone-in rib steak 20 oz. (4 of 5) $49 - tasty and the bone was so small, it was almost like boneless. this was tasty and juicy.   \n* add on topping foie gras (5 of 5) $15 - what a bang for the buck! this is probably <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> add on foie gras price ever and it was a huge piece. delicious!!!\n* add on side raw horseradish $2 - we were slightly disappointed that the menu asked for $2 for raw horseradish. nonetheless, we had to order it. \n\noverall, the pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> was nice, food was good, and staff was very helpful.",

            "it's an upscale steakhouse that conveniently located in the heart of things - so you can grab you <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> here and be close to all the nightlife events right after.  you pass <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark>'s chandalier bar before you hit the entrance to stk so it sets up just the right mood.  the interior and atmophere is what i expect from an upscale vegas restaurant.  it has unique decor, feels open, and has <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> vibe to it.  \n\nwe got seated to our table as soon as we got there for our reservation (which doesn't always happen).  the waiter was also very patient and helpful in getting our drink order - not the easier task when a group of 8 girls is trying to decide which fruity drink to get. haha.  the drinks were all fantastic, but i've never really had any complaints about drinks that i've gotten from vegas.  the food, on the other hand, was a hit or miss.  here's what we got: \n\nbread for the table:  o.m.g!  i'm sure all the other yelpers have commented on how amazing this bread is.  it even looks amazing - coming out in the shape of a muffin glazed with deliciousness with a green side dipping sauce that takes you b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> for a moment because it's green.  when you get over the awe and <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> dig in to eat it, it just melts in your mouth - one of those crispy and buttery on the outside, and soft on the inside.  and that dipping sauce!!!  \n\nfoie gras appetizer: i indulged with foie gras ever since california banned it (not necessarily banned it completely, but it might as well have been with the restrictions).  i ordered both the appetizer and the side to go on top of my steak.  the foie gras was excellent - cooked perfectly - tender - juicy - fatty!  unfortunately it was paired with a sweet element - i can't even remember what it was (applesauce, berries? no clue) - all i remember was that it did not compliment well.  i separated the two and only focused on the foie gras.  \n\nfilet mignon with foie gras: have already commented on the awesomeness of the foie gras and it didn't disappoint.  however, the piece that came with the entree was much smaller than the appetizer.  if i could go b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>, i'd order two appetizer ones, and save one to eat with the steak.  unfortunately again, the filet mignon was overcooked and chewy.  yes, you read right, chewy!  filet mignon!  i was very disappointed.  stk is a steakhouse and their steak was <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> the only thing i would not get again.  maybe they were having an off night or an off-piece, but how do you mess up such a fine cut like filet!?!  \n\nmushroom pot pie:  this side dish was the highlight of our side dishes - a must get!  it's <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> of probably 4-5 different mushroom type, baked under some dough to soak in all the delicious sauce.  it was one of those unique dishes that are not offered in many pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>, but tastes super awesome!  \n\nif you have a big group and are celebrating an event, this pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> is a good option.  be prepared to pay some big bucks (but hey, you're in vegas!).",

(luckily our company paid for it.)  to me, it wasn't worth  $225 per person, probably more like $150-$175 range.  but, then again, we did drink quite a bit.  \n\nalso, i have to say that the service was top-notch.  they had 1 main waiter and 2 other people taking care of us.  they did a great job.\n\none other semi-annoying thing was that they only have 1 single restroom for men and women.  2 stalls for the entire restaurant.  this seems absurd to me.  as i said at the start, they told us it was a quiet night for the pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>...  but, there was still a line every time i had to use the restroom (which was quite often as we were \"indulging\").  i can't imagine the lines on a weekend.",

(and i mean seriously beg).  we were sweet and nice and completely reasonable, leaving a 25% tip for our servers (we had to ask them to beg too).  note to the thursday night dj:  when one of your patrons has the entire upper floor clapping and cheering to her dance routines, play what she wants to hear because it's not about you.  unfortunately, our group won't be b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> on a thursday night again.",

            "i'm generally not a steak person.  i have been to some nice steakhouses but i ju<mark>Zinfandel, St. Francis, Sonoma, CA 12</mark>'t manage to really get into it.  as such, stk was never high on my list of pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> to eat in vegas.  i ended up going for a business <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> and was generally pleased, even for my steak-averse palate.\n\npros\n*the appetizers were amazing.  hands down.  everything we ordered was fantastic and they <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> gave us the appropriate number of items based on the people at the table (might have been coincidence but i'll give them the point)\n*the music selection was late 90's and early 2000's that reminded me of days gone by.  it was not what you normally hear at <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> or a restaurant so it was a fun change of p<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>\n*the drinks were fantastic and we were always asked about a fresh one before our glasses were empty\n*the steak!  i know!  i said it.  it was a pretty good steak.  i only had a few bites of someone else's but it was <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> opposite of where my mind goes when i think about steak.\n\nso far this review has been high-fives and kudos.  but that two star rating up there, that wasn't a mistake.  every cloud has its silver lining, and at stk there were plenty of dark clouds to go with those small positive notes.\n\ncons\n*the volume of the music is insane.  it started out manageable but we were basically shouting at e<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> other by the time we left\n*the drink i ordered was $18, and that seemed to be about average\n*the sides were hit or miss.  asparagus was cold but the truffle fries were like pillows of potatoey goodness.  the gratin was basically raw potatoes but the mushroom pot pie was flavorful, hot, and exotic tasting\n*the service.  our waiter was great.  friendly, outgoing, ready to make recommendations.  unfortunately, after he took our order he was gone and never to be seen again.  instead we ended up with a loitering busser.  \n\nas i mentioned earlier, this was a business <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>.  we were there to eat, of course, but we were also talking and enjoying our evening.  i guess we took too long to finish our appetizers because the server asked us no less than three times if he could clear anything away.  every time we said no and he just slipped to the si<mark>Malbec, Terrazas De Los Andes Altos Del Plata, AR 13</mark> waited there.  it was like he was counting mississippi's in his head until he could ask us again.\n\nso we've finished our entrees.  we ordered a shared dessert and coffee.  we're win<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> our evening down when the manager comes over to the table.  i assumed that he was there to just say thank you since i'm sure our bill was near the $1000 mark for the evening.  turns out he was basically kicking us out of our seat.  he said the restaurant was at cap<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> and he wanted to buy us a drink at the bar so we could free up the table.\n\ni'm sure there are people in vegas who wish that their restaurants could be so full at 8pm on a weeknight that they are at cap<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>, but i can't tolerate being rushed from our table just because other people want to sit down.  i've waited at restaurants for over an hour because people weren't getting up and leaving, and that's just the way it goes.  if you dont like the wait time you go elsewhere.  it was really poor form that the manager asked us to v<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> the table (after <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> had been paid, mind you).\n\noverall i am disappointed with stk.  i went into the experience expecting stellar service and mediocre food.  turns out the food was the surprise winner and the service was just leaving much to be desired.", 
            "my friends and i came here for a b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> party of six. i ordered the 10 oz filet (cooked perfectly, just the way i wanted, medium and juicy) and parmesan truffle fries (the best truffle fries i've tasted and cut thick, just the way i love my fries cut). they also bring out a small pot of bread for e<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> person, which was tasty and cute. service was very good and the waitress even bought us a round of shots because it was a b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> party, plus i think she thought the group was a bit too quiet for what we were celebrating lol. i would love to come here again and try the other steaks and entrees.\n\ntip: if you're driving here, park in the east garage because it'll be a shorter walk to the restaurant.",

            "i've found my new favorite steakhouse in vegas!  \n\ni made reservations way in advance for a friend's b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> party.  we came on a saturday night at 7:30pm, and were seated pretty quickly.  our servers were awesome!  everyone was super nice!  i had bought a round of shots for the table, and our server came b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> with a 2nd round on him!  \n\nall of us ordered some form of steak, and we thoroughly enjoyed every last bite.  i topped my fillet with foie gras and it was heaven!  i'm still very upset that ca banned it!  we ordered sides to share: creamed spinahc, parmesan truffle fries, mac & cheese, mushroom pot pie and the special trio of mac & cheese.  oh, and i can't forget about their bread!  it was topped with melted blue cheese, and we ate it all!  either we're a bunch of pigs or all the food was delicious because there was nothing left.\n\nanother reason we loved the restaurant was the music.  the dj was spinning hip hop and he had us dancing in our seats.  even the table next to us was having a great time and danced as they got up to walk around!  it does get pretty loud in the restaurant, so don't go there expecting to have a quiet, romantic <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>. \n\nthe only one bad thing i could even think of for stk was the single stall for the bathrooms.  not very convenient.  but everything else was superb!", 
            "i've been to this stk at least 4 times and they always deliver a great experience!  compared to the one in <mark>Malbec, Terrazas De Los Andes Altos Del Plata, AR 13</mark>, the vegas stk seems to win in every category.  for starters, the d\\u00e9cor is very sleek and modern but still intimate and perfect for any occasion.  we started at the bar and ordered <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> before getting seated.  there were 8 of us so there wasn't much room considering this is more of a sit down restaurant versus a bar to hang at.  shortly after our drinks arrived we were sat in the upper booths but still had a perfect view of the whole restaurant.  as usually the wait staff is immediately on top of things and comes by to introduce themselves and talk about the specials.  we ordered another round of drinks as well as a few bottles of wine to go with our much anticipated steaks!  this is a very high end restaurant so you need to expect to spend some cash; however i wasn't thoroughly impressed with what they delivered for wines in the $100-$200 price range.  it's more our fault since we were looking to save a few bucks since we just spent nearly $10k in bottle service over the la<mark>Zinfandel, St. Francis, Sonoma, CA 12</mark> days.  anyway, for a starter we all ordered the tuna tartar and i must say it's probably the best out there.  that is a seriously bold statement coming from a guy who lives in la and has sushi joints at nearly every corner.  but seriously this is beyond delicious!   the tuna was very fresh and of the highest quality.  it wasn't a huge portion but they served it on some sort of <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> wonton cripes and dressed it with oil and an avocado sauce.  the mixture of the avocado and sweetness of the wonton was unbelievable when eaten with the tuna.  also, by ad<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> the sugar to the wonton it kept the shell together so it didn't fall apart like most in tartar dishes.  next came the steaks and the sides and as always the meat was of the highest quality.  although everything was amazingly delicious, i did learn one valuable lesson about steaks.  since we were on our way to another club i didn't want to over stuff myself so i ordered the petite filet; <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> of the other guys ordered the medium size or larger.  we ordered them medium rare but i noticed mine was cooked more through than the others.  the lesson is, always go with the larger even if you don't plan on eating it so <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> can stay cooler while charring the outside.  anyway, it was still very good but just a small thing to point out.  a few of the other guys went with the porter house and it was just perfect.  for sides we had the mash potatoes, mac and cheese, cream spin<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> and some garlic potato wedges.  for me the mac and cheese was just beyond amazing!  crispy on the outer edge and creamy on the inside.  the spin<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> and the potatoes were a little under salted for me but i think they do it so you catch more of the steaks flavor versus having too rich of a side.  to finish things off we all ordered a double espresso, a lemon cello and <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> chocolate peanut butter bars.    the whole experience was extremely top notch from start to finish and that is why i go to stk every time i'm in vegas.", 
            "amazing! we went here with a b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> party and the entire party is now raving about this steakhouse. we made reservations about a month prior and when we arrived at 7:30 for our <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> we were seated within five minutes. \n\nour waiter mags seriously made the experience so great. he had the best people skills and kept us thoroughly entertained. \n\nnow for the food- we all ordered steaks that were cooked perfectly; mine in particular with the red wine sauce which was fantastic. we ordered a few sides to share and wish we would of realized how big the sides <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> were .  definitely not necessary for everyone to order their own side! \n\noverall i'd highly recommend this spot! the music is bumping good ol hip hop jams and the vibe is just so fun in there!",

            "this was our 'splurge' <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> on our trip last weekend to vegas.  we had a group of 8 people for early evening reservations.  we got to our table right away and were greeted by our waiter, teddy.  teddy killed the presentation and specials for the evening.  i think that our entire group was sold from the minute that we sat down. the pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> was hoppin.  the environment was like a party without any sort of craziness.  \nas for the food, i had the wedge salad.  it had huge chunks of bleu cheese and b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> along with these funky pickled tomatoes.  it was really good.   i then went with the 16oz sirloin with shitake mushrooms on top.  i love red meat and this thing was massive!!  i felt like john candy in \"great outdoors\" eating the ole '96er.  although i didnt finish the steak, i enjoyed every single bite.\nas for the sides...we went with the truffle fries, mac/cheese, yukon potatoes and the sweet corn pud<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>.  i would have licked the bowl of the pud<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>, if allowed. man, it was good.\nafter <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>, everyone was stuffed until teddy introduced dessert.  ok, get this...sweet potato doughnuts with maple glaze and crumbled walnuts.  i'm a foodie, and these were the most ridiculously good doughnuts we all ever had.  \nour bill for 8 with wine and cocktails and gratuity came out to about $100 a person.  to me, that's a splurge but my wife and i would spend it again in a minute.  \nthere are a lot of fine restaurants in vegas.  stk on an all around perspective could not have been a better <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> experience for us.",

(or -- as it was suggested by some in the party -- change the name to \"std\"?)  hepatitis (or worse?)  on the forks is a legitimate but secondary concern:  how about the group of us simply wanting to enjoy a glorious steak at midnight served by a wait staff who really knows their stuff without having to be witness to a hustler letter to the editor in the making?\n\nstop the ho's at the door. for the love of christ, turn down the music. now you've really got something.",

            "such a nice surprise for my birthday trip to vegas.  i wanted somewhere fun, good, and not too expensive to have a birthday <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> and this was perfect.\n\nparking: it's located in cosmo, on the 3rd floor.  if you park in self-parking you have to walk kind of far because it's located near the lobby.\n\natmosphere: the inside is dark and trendy.  with hanging ball lights and cool fixtures.  i made reservations for 6pm because we had to get to <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> early and it was slightly crowded, but i'm sure it gets more crowded later on at night.  it was perfect for a fancy birthday <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>.  we got a half booth half table with 3 people sitting on chairs.  for attire i could see you getting away with a nice skirt and top, fancy top and jeans or dress.  you can't be overdressed here.\n\ni heard the music was super loud and fun, which makes the <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> experience better but at 6pm the music was kind of soft and more old school.  i think as the night went on it got louder and they were slowly making their way into the 90s but we didn't stay long enough to experience it.  \n\nfood: \n\nsteak - their cheapest steak is like $39 and they have a lot of other options but if you don't like steak i wouldn't come here.  my suggestion is to share the steak with someone else because it is pretty big and expensive.  my boyfriend and i shared the bone in rib steak (basically the rib eye) and it was plenty for both of us.  the steak itself doesn't come with anything so it's recommended you get sides ($12 e<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>!) we got 4 to share among the 8 of us and it was plenty.  beware though because we got the truffle mac n cheese and that was more than $12.  you can get \"toppings\" on top of your steak but it's not needed.  the steak itself is very flavorful and tasty without anything.\n\nsides -\ntruffle mac n cheese - the mac was the round short pastas usually in m<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> salad and i really liked that.  a good crust on the top with a yummy truffle flavor and pretty creamy mac n cheese.\n\ntruffle parmesan fries - they are thickly cut and are more like potato rectangles than fries.  they are st<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> like jenga and have parmesan and truffle oil on them. they were a little too potato-y and thick for my liking but everyone at the table loved them.\n\nmushroom pot pie - a weird side but it was literally a pot pie with mushrooms, onions and <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> sauce inside.  it tasted like truffle but i don't even know if it had truffle.  the top is a light crust, which wasn't that flaky and pretty thin.\n\nbok choy - weird for a steak pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> but it was kinda spicy.  very flavorful though with lots of soy sauce and garlic.  not bad <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> for some greens.\n\noverall very impressed with stk.  i thought it would be more for the atmosphere but the food was really good! they even brought me out this chocolate cake/mousse for my birthday with <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> :)",

we were never bombarded by food, and the wait between courses was never very long.  \n\nthe others on the wait staff were also very attentive.  our waters were never empty, our tables were always folded if we left to use the bathroom f<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>, and any time our cocktails/wine was looking low, there was someone there to offer us another.  \n\nfood: \n\ncaesar salad (4 stars) - don't know how they did it, but even <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> salad was rememberable.  the lettuce was so crisp/fresh, and the dressing and croutons were remarkably tasty.\n\n\n\nspiced pickled prawns (5 stars) - hands down the best starter/non-beef item of the night.  <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>, ranks right up there with the steak with how much i truly enjoyed this item.  the two are just apples and oranges, so hard to really compare the two. anyway, i will get this every time i'm here.  the shrimp was perfectly crisp (not the dense/gritty texture that you sometimes find with some shrimp when they've been completely overcooked) and so fresh.  also, loved the balance of <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> with the level of heat.  i love heat, so i ended up eating all of the slices of jalapeno pepper it came with (my husband avoided those, and enjoyed his level of heat without them)\n\nlobster cocktail (3.5 stars) - this was good, but in comparison to everything else, not rememberable.  we would forego this item next time.\n\nbone-in filet (5 stars) - holy crap, the star of the night.  definitely enough steak to split between the two of us.  so amazing, and perfectly cooked to our requested rare-medium/rare.\n\npork belly (3 stars)  -  this item came along with the steak and fries toward the end of our meal.  it was delicious, but i wish it had more crispiness (i'm not a huge fan of pork belly unless it's been crisped up just right - the texture of chewy/soft fat makes me want to hurl).  probably wouldn't order this item again.  maybe would have \"shined\" a bit more if it wasn't brought out with the steak and fries, who knows.\n\nparmesan truffle fries (4.5 stars) - so full of truffle flavor, piping hot, crispy on the outside, and soft in the inside.  a must order for sides.\n\ndrinks:\n\ndouble espresso - we rarely do coffee/dessert after <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>, but this one called for it.  the espresso (while very, very spendy!!) was perfection.  don't think i'd get it again, however, as the price was gasp-worthy (something like $12-15 e<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> for a small little espresso drink).\n\nmanhattan - very well balanced and tasty (per my husband); one complaint is they used a maraschino cherry (i.e., bright red) vs. a gourmet cocktail cherry.  that would have made <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> perfection in a glass.\n\nvodka martini up w/ splash of st. germain - perfection in a glass; a signature of mine, i've found a lot of pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> over-do the st. germain so it's too sweet and not to my liking.  this pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> nailed it (twice - oops!).\n\nglass of \"justin\" cabernet savignon to pair with the steak ($4) - we'd tried a bottle of justin red blend previously (retails around $40-50 a bottle), so we decided to try out <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark>.  we were not disappointed, and it paired very nicely with the filet.\n\noverall: \n\nfantastic <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> experience.  an experience indeed.  will definitely be b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>;

            "love, love, love this pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>! i've heard so many great things about stk, but at first, i have to admit that i was a little bit hesitant to try it. over here in la, we have so many eateries and when we want a good steak and service, we always resort to ruth chris's. \n\nmy boyfriend and i made reservations to celebrate our 4 year anniversary. when i called the restaurant, i never told the hostess that we were celebrating anything and the next available reservation she had available was at 11:15. ofcourse, it being a friday night and in vegas, we figured we could do a little bit of gambling at <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> before having <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>. we arrived at the restaurant around 11 and instantly, we loved the vibe of the restaurant and the beautiful decor. normally, the bf and i would want a nice, quiet environment   for <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> since we're in our early 30s (yes, we're old!), but we figured, why not since we're in vegas. the restaurant was busy, but filled with good music. we decided to grab a drink at the bar while waiting. i've been to vegas many times and usually, it takes a while for a male to order a drink. the kind bartender instantly noticed my boyfriend and helped us out. customer service is one of the biggest things we value when we go out to eat and if a pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> doesn't have good customer service, we usually aren't returning customers.  \n\nthe hostess sat us to our table and asked us if we were celebrating anything. we just responded that we were in vegas for a wed<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>, but we decided to kill 2 birds with 1 stone and also celebrate our anniversary since we haven't been out in a while. our server was named luis <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> us immediately and served us some of their delicious and buttery bread. he explained to us the menu and also the sauces that we can add-on to our steak, if we wanted. i ordered the rib-eye, medium rare and the bf ordered the same thing. as sides, we ordered the broccolini and the mac and cheese. \n\n our food came out on time but i noticed that my steak was cooked more on the medium well as i cut into it. i normally don't like to complain, and i wasn't going to, but our waiter luis noticed that our steaks weren't what we had ordered and wanted to make things right. he took b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> our steaks and had new ones made. while our steaks were being made, the bf and i just sn<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> on the broccolini since we were starving. as soon as luis brought b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> our new steaks, he brought out some new sides because he wanted our sides to be warm for our steaks. he kindly apologized about the food and also brought us some shots.\n\nour steaks and our sides were absolutely delicious! the mac and cheese was creamy, the broccolini had a nice parmesan garlic flavor to it, and our steaks were cooked to perfection. i added a side of chimichurri sauce and that made my steak even more heavenly. as soon as we finished our meal, luis found out from the hostess that we were celebrating an anniversary, and brought us <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> dessert! the desserts consisted of a warm apple crisp and <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> cheesecake. both desserts were scrumptious and after eating there, i was afraid the zipper on my desk would rip! lol. we ended up also chatting with another worker named chris who gave us some recommendations on things to do that were nearby. he also explained how he enjoyed working at stk because of how the staff feels like a family since they also hang out after work. \n\nluis and chris, you guys are amazing! one of you told us that anyone who comes in is treated like vip at stk, and i truly believe it. the food and <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> service is why we will be returning to eat there in the future, every time we make a trip out to vegas. thank you for making our 4 year anniversary very memorable for the both of us!", 
            "we came at a perfect time, when the noise level was at an appropriate level. from everything that i've read and heard, the loud head-poun<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> music can be a turn off for those who yearn for a romantic candle-lit <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>, where you can <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> hear e<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> other conversate and not just pretend to be. so my tip for you would be book your reservation at a really early time, our was for 5:30pm. \n\ni requested a booth so that we could have more seating and arm room. my request was readily <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> for. our server was really sweet and genuine. i had to wait for <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> for over 30min even though the pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> was not quite p<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> yet, but i guess they had to go get a watermelon so she told me <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> would be on the house.\n\nwe started off with the beef carp<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> w/ pesto angel hair, fried lobster tail and crab salad w/ honeydew and grapefruit. everything was delish, and balanced e<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> other very nicely. \n\nthe hub<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> the porterhouse and i ended up w/ the bone-in-filet topped w/ foie gras. sides were truffle parmesan fries, brocollini and corn pud<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>. our steaks were cooked to perfection, but the stk sauce that we chose didn't complement it very well. i wished our steak was seasoned just a bit more, so that no sauce was needed. after our request for a1 came, it made everything so much better!! <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> pud<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> had too much fillers and not enough corn so i would skip out on that next time. i loved my thick cut truffle fries, but it was way too pungent tasting for the hubs. \n\nas for dessert, we just had to get the sweet potato donuts! we were so full, but luckily the donuts were light and airy. we had an enjoyable evening, but i'm not sure if we would be b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> w/ all the many vegas options there is that we have yet to try.", 
            "considering we were guests of cosmopolitan, i was excited to learn stk was in the hotel.  i've been to other locations in dc and nyc.. but the rest of my party first time. \n\nlong story short, the hostess made every attempt on getting us to leave. our reservation which was made 2 weeks prior wasn't honored, we were shuffled around the <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> area because the hostess confused two groups, one of 4 other of 5 (our group and the other only had one thing in common). they seat us at a bar table. this was my best friends 40th birthday, which i noted on the reservation... i've sat at the bar for many years with 40 years plus on this earth, i couldn't stand for it!!  \n\nafter my complaint, they then seat us in the b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> by the kitchen. the waiter was witty so we decided to stay... we order, receive our food - all of it was cold and had to be sent b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> (at this point we hoped for the best, but really should've left). it was so bad that one person in the party just opted not to eat. (very sad f<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>)\n\nthe waiter was great (sorry didn't catch his name) ...we really appreciated him for making up for the hostesses many attempts on trying to get us to leave. it's unfortunate this happened because i raved to my friends on how much i loved this pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>... :(", 
            "wow. i really enjoyed this pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>. i've never been to a steakhouse with a real nightclub feel and thought it was perfect for vegas. i think you have to be have to be ready to party when you come here. the bar area had a very social feel which was nice to have before sitting. we went there since our \"table wasn't ready\" but i think its by design to get us to grab some drinks at the bar before sitting. i say that because when we sat down there was a few open tables that appeared to not be filled for awhile. our server was fast and on point with good knowledge of the menu. my ribeye was cooked to my medium rear liking with a nice sear on  the outside just like i like it. mashed potatos were fantastic. they did under cook one person at our tables filet mignon, but he was too polite to send it b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> to be cooked longer. steakhouse usually error on that side so they can always throw it in longer. the point off for the visit was strictly because they didn't serve prime steak, but charged \"prime\" prices. the steaks were angus though a very tasty! i'm going to orlando in march and hope to eat at their new pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> down there too!",

            "updated review: (marked down to 3 stars).\n\nwe had such a great experience here during the grand opening that we decided to go b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> a week later with a friend visiting from out of town.  the experience was not as great.  here is the low down:\n\nhost staff:  clueless.\nwe made reservations a few days in advance and asked to sit with our server from our first visit.  on the night of our <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> we arrived 20 minutes early to see plenty of open tables but the hostess was absolutely clueless on what to do with us.  uh, seat us maybe?  we gave her a break and decided to sit in the lounge for a drink while she sorted it out but after 30 minutes (10 minutes after our reservation) we never got appro<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> about our table (except for the wrong name - \"are you mr. kluss\"?) and so we had to go b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> up to the stand to find out what was going on with the <mark>Malbec, Terrazas De Los Andes Altos Del Plata, AR 13</mark>.  the hostess seemed like she was making an excuse up (similar to lost homework judging from her age) as to why our table still wasn't ready and so we ended up having to talk to another hostess to get it right.  when they finally went to sit us down it wasn't in the servers area we had twice requested (once during our reservation a week before and once when we arrived).  when we let her know of the mistake the hostess seating us (a different one) made some rude remark about how 'messed up' things were here and sat us down in the section we requested.  not a good tee-off to a $260 <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> for 3.\n\n<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>: too slow and with mistakes.\nthe best part of <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> was the demeanor from or original server.  she was a real pro and as cool as we remembered the first time but seemed to be hamstrung by the slow kitchen service and a few lapses in attention to detail from there - missing or slow items she had to notice and then retrieve.  i'm no stranger to fine <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> and a slow p<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> is nice but it took a good 40 minutes just to get our apps - thats too long.  overall the food was just \"okay\" for as long as we waited and for the price.  i've been much more impressed at half a dozen other steakhouses in town (the palm @ caesars, capital grill, ruths chris's, del friscos, flemings etc).  really surprised too that <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> were made so inconsistently (in taste) because how complicated is <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>?  it was so left to right that we had to keep saying something to the point that the server felt bad enough to finally bring us an extra (right) one for free.\n\nsummary:\nlike the other reviewer our trouble started with the front host staff and unfortunately continued with slow service.  as native las vegans we like <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> a lot as far as hotels go and may give stk another shot after we've tried the other restaurants at the hotel first.  the layout is great, the decor, the music and the overall vibe are solid too but as far as service goes and food that blows you away goes - maybe they just have opening week issues.\n\ncaveat emptor.",

            "i must admit that at first we were a bit hesitant in giving this pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> a try. there haven't been too many reviews yet for this restaurant, which made us a little uneasy about choosing this pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>. all we knew is that we wanted to try a restaurant in <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> and both the vibe & menu of stk got our attention. \n\nwe checked out <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> bar & managed to lose some money on the tables before hea<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> over for our 8:00 reservation. my first impression of this pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> was that it was a bit smaller than i expected, and other reviewers are right in saying the music is bumping. \n\nwe sat at the bar for about 10 mins. before being seated. although i would have rather sat b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> further in the <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> area we were seated in another <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> section right off the bar...i guess it made for some good people watching at the bar (like guys with lucky poker pants...see pics)! also, i thought it might be a little hard at first to hold <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> over the music but to my surprise it wasn't at all...but maybe that's because the more i drink the louder i naturally get, and so goes for my spouse and probably just about everyone else out there, haha ; ) \n\nthe bread is amazing, so amazing i took one bite and just stopped so i wouldn't get full off of just bread.  for starters, we had their foie gras french toast and beef tartare. both were exceptional....the foie gras french toast had a very interesting flavor while being sweet at the same time and the beef tartare was <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> the best i have tasted. i have only ever tried like 3 in my life, but it just surprised me how fresh, light, and tasty this one was! \n\ni ordered a filet, which was a bit over cooked for medium but i didn't want to send it b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> and just enjoyed what i could of it. my husband's ribeye was cooked a perfect rare and he just about ate the whole thing! on the side, we enjoyed maple glazed carrots and sweet corn pud<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>. the sweet corn pud<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> tasted like a dessert to me, almost not like a si<mark>Malbec, Terrazas De Los Andes Altos Del Plata, AR 13</mark> all. we passed on <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> dessert and just enjoyed our wine. \n\nour server was great! usually, when we go to restaurants we are often attended to by a team of servers. and, sometimes it's even hard to figure out who the head-server is, but at stk our server stayed with us the whole time, which we enjoyed. \n\none thing i wanted to note was that the music was definitely bumping and other reviewers are correct in saying if you are looking for a quiet, romantic <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> for two...this isn't the pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> for you. if you are looking for an upbeat sp<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> with some great service & food then you stk might be just what you are looking for.",

            "my first experience with stk was at the nyc location, and i was hardly surprised when they decided to bring an stk to my current digs in <mark>Malbec, Terrazas De Los Andes Altos Del Plata, AR 13</mark> -- <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> that has its fair share of trendy restaurants that l<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> culinary inspiration. suffices to say i was less than shocked when i heard <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> hotel in las vegas would also feature an stk restaurant. \n\nmy experiences at all three locations have been markedly different. the nyc location boasted good food and <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> atmosphere in the meatp<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> district (an area which wasn't hurting for culinary hot-spots at the time) and was able to deliver consistently, even in its nascent stages (i moved out of nyc shortly after it opened so i wasn't able to see how the restaurant fared in the later stages of its existence). while the steaks left something to be desired, the restaurant was trendy and the overall experience was fun. i'll unabashedly add that, hands down, the best steaks still come from texas. \n\nwhen the <mark>Malbec, Terrazas De Los Andes Altos Del Plata, AR 13</mark> restaurant opened, i was happy to see that same ambiance maintained, but unfortunately, the food was inconsistent at best (definitely nothing to write home about) and it's \"tren<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>\" quickly declined within its first year. stk la's biggest redeeming quality was (and still is) its proximity to other la nightlife hotspots, and the location is enough to get me there with a group of friends for some cocktails and light appetizers to kick the night off. \n\nfast forward to 2011 and the latest trendy hotel in vegas, <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark>, now boasts its very own stk. a group of us made up of my closest friends from texas, new york and california were staying at the hotel for the weekend to celebrate my birthday, so we decided to check out stk. i tried making a resie through the hotel but, annoyingly, the restaurant handles its own reservations and my call was promptly directed to their hostess. getting a reservation was easy enough -- i called 4 days in advance of our arrival -- and we figured 9:30pm would be a good time to eat before an insanely late night of dancing. our group of 4 arrived on time and the hostess informed us that the wait would be half an hour...with a reservation. disgruntled, but determined not to let the unfortunate news spoil our mood, we proceeded to the bar to have some very expensive, very plain drinks -- if you are price-sensitive and like to imbibe, then this is not the restaurant for you. \n\n45 minutes later, we were seated and starving. this is when things got exponentially better. our servers were incredibly fun, enthusiastic and attentive. throughout the entire meal, our waitress helped us by making great recommendations, taking photos of us to help commemorate the trip, and showering us with an endless supply of complimentary birthday shots as well as <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> dessert plate, replete with delectable bite-sized cake and ice-cream lollipops. crisis averted. be sure to request raquel m. as your server -- raquel and her fellow cohorts will make sure you have a blast. the restaurant manager even let us explore the kitchen, meet <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark>, observe the plating ritual and peruse all the fresh ingredients. the kitchen was very clean and well managed and the staff was very friendly. \n\nthe giant seafood platter we ordered was thoroughly enjoyed by everyone but me (i'm picky, obvi) --  the king crab was a little soggy for my taste and the oysters left me underwhelmed -- and the steaks were <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> better than the ones i had at the nyc and la locations. i ordered the ribeye medium rare and <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> and flavor were excellent. still not on par with texas steaks, but as far as the stk chain goes, i really enjoyed my meal.\n\nnet/net, while the steaks at stk restaurants are not my favorite, the ambiance is usually pretty fun and the staff at the las vegas location absolutely made this experience worthwhile. if you are staying at <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> and/or looking for a fun/trendy pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> to eat before you head to marquee, this is the pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> to go.",

            "i love trying new steakhouses, so i had a lot of past experiences to compare to a new steakhouse experience. stk wasn't the best, but certainly not the worst. i quite enjoyed my experience there. the best thing i could say, it was an experience i have never had before at a steakhouse.\n\nwhen i think of a steakhouse, usually it involves older white men as servers wearing doctor white coat, dark wood, calf skin or some type of homage to the steer, and the pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> is usually filled with business people or couples.\n\nthis pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> had none if those above!! it was like <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>! it was very modern. there was a dj, and people dancing around. it was hard to talk as the music was so loud. when you wait for your table at the bar, people may try to pick you up or some lady's boobs were on your f<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> as you turn some other directions. well, it is vegas after all! so the atmosphere would be considered \"fun\" unless you hate clubbing. \n\ni was there with my business associates and one more plus was this meal wouldn't cost me a penny. before i knew it, wine was flowing, seafood tower and beef tartare were gr<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> the table. yum yum yum.. all were delicious!\n\ni ordered a regular filet with foie gras topping. i was pretty happy. the foie put it over the top for sure! i loved it but i had better tasting steak before. i wish i ordered the boned in filet but i was trying to not take advantage of the opportunity. after all, i already topped it with foie gras. it was rather cheap however, $12 for the topping. what a <mark>Malbec, Terrazas De Los Andes Altos Del Plata, AR 13</mark>.\n\nsome of the guys ordered the boned in filet and porterhouse. they seemed very pleased.\n\nnext to our table, there was a paralyzed guy in an elaborate wheelchair. i guess he was a loaded poker champ that got injured from some <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>. around him, there were at least five scantily clad women dancing around him, worshipping him. they looked hired but whatever, he was having fun and good for him. it was quite a show for us too!\n\nlastly, our cool server bought our table a round of shots of 1942 tequila and he did the shot with us! how cool.. never in my life.\n\nso.. see...?! the experience at stk was nothing i have ever had. not sure if i would go b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> though, as once is enough.",

            "i've been to this stk at least 4 times and they always deliver a great experience!  compared to the one in <mark>Malbec, Terrazas De Los Andes Altos Del Plata, AR 13</mark>, the vegas stk seems to win in every category.  for starters, the d\\u00e9cor is very sleek and modern but still intimate and perfect for any occasion.  we started at the bar and ordered <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> before getting seated.  there were 8 of us so there wasn't much room considering this is more of a sit down restaurant versus a bar to hang at.  shortly after our drinks arrived we were sat in the upper booths but still had a perfect view of the whole restaurant.  as usually the wait staff is immediately on top of things and comes by to introduce themselves and talk about the specials.  we ordered another round of drinks as well as a few bottles of wine to go with our much anticipated steaks!  this is a very high end restaurant so you need to expect to spend some cash; however i wasn't thoroughly impressed with what they delivered for wines in the $100-$200 price range.  it's more our fault since we were looking to save a few bucks since we just spent nearly $10k in bottle service over the la<mark>Zinfandel, St. Francis, Sonoma, CA 12</mark> days.  anyway, for a starter we all ordered the tuna tartar and i must say it's probably the best out there.  that is a seriously bold statement coming from a guy who lives in la and has sushi joints at nearly every corner.  but seriously this is beyond delicious!   the tuna was very fresh and of the highest quality.  it wasn't a huge portion but they served it on some sort of <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> wonton cripes and dressed it with oil and an avocado sauce.  the mixture of the avocado and sweetness of the wonton was unbelievable when eaten with the tuna.  also, by ad<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> the sugar to the wonton it kept the shell together so it didn't fall apart like most in tartar dishes.  next came the steaks and the sides and as always the meat was of the highest quality.  although everything was amazingly delicious, i did learn one valuable lesson about steaks.  since we were on our way to another club i didn't want to over stuff myself so i ordered the petite filet; <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> of the other guys ordered the medium size or larger.  we ordered them medium rare but i noticed mine was cooked more through than the others.  the lesson is, always go with the larger even if you don't plan on eating it so <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> can stay cooler while charring the outside.  anyway, it was still very good but just a small thing to point out.  a few of the other guys went with the porter house and it was just perfect.  for sides we had the mash potatoes, mac and cheese, cream spin<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> and some garlic potato wedges.  for me the mac and cheese was just beyond amazing!  crispy on the outer edge and creamy on the inside.  the spin<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> and the potatoes were a little under salted for me but i think they do it so you catch more of the steaks flavor versus having too rich of a side.  to finish things off we all ordered a double espresso, a lemon cello and <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> chocolate peanut butter bars.    the whole experience was extremely top notch from start to finish and that is why i go to stk every time i'm in vegas.", 
            "i realize that stk is some hyper-cool, vowel-free play on the word \"steak\", but i also hoped that it might also be an <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> for something.  perhaps \"sexy trendy k____\", but i couldn't think of an appropriate k-word.  oh well.\n\nlinguistics aside, stk is a rad pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> for <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>.  located in the p3 restaurant zone of <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> hotel, stk is nothing like your typical, stuffy, smoke-filled vegas steakhouse.  at stk, ultramodern decor, ed hardy button-down shirts, sky-high hooker heels, free-flowing cocktails, and loud electronic music rule the day.  i would expect no less at <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark>.\n\ni had my first stk experience when i met some friends for <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> at the bar on a friday night.  the pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> was p<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> solid, but it was mostly groups waiting for tables in the <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> room, leaving the bar empty.  (side note: the bar is all curvy and gorgeous, but it comes at the expense of leg room.  tall people beware.)\n\ni ordered a delicious pinot grigio (thanks for the heavy pour!) and noshed on the free bread (loved the blue cheese butter and chive olive oil!) while browsing the menu.  there are lots of traditional steakhouse items, but plenty of fish and vegetarian options make stk a good option for any sort of <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>.  our group ordered a bunch of different items, which was i<mark>Malbec, Terrazas De Los Andes Altos Del Plata, AR 13</mark> for sampling and tasting:\n\n** foie gras and waffles.  this appetizer was absolutely **amazing**.  easily the best foie preparation i've ever had (but, admittedly, i haven't tried all that many).  loved the sear on the foie, and how the sweet huckeberry gastrique cut through the savory foie.  the waffles were crispy and light as air, too.\n\n** beet salad.  simple, but outstan<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>.  the beets were perfectly cooked and had a nice sweetness.  plenty of goat cheese and pist<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> pesto, too.\n\n** 7 oz filet.  admittedly, i'm not much of a steak guy -- but this filet was out of this world.  its texture was like butter, and it had amazing flavor.  (more hardcore carnivores may probably opt for a larger cut, but 7 oz was just right for me.)  \n\n** broccolini.  an i<mark>Malbec, Terrazas De Los Andes Altos Del Plata, AR 13</mark> side dish, since it was excellently cooked, and provided a nice crunch to contrast with the filet.\n\n** sweet potato donuts.  you might not think of stk as a dessert destination, but these divine donuts might change your mind.  sweet potato made for an unusual twist on <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> donut, and a gooey and decadent pecan glaze brought it all together.  heaven!\n\nservice was outstan<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>.  pretty much everyone on the staff looks like a model, with sex appeal dripping out of every pore -- but don't expect \"vanderpump rules\"-style drama or catty behavior.  quite <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> -- the staff at stk are 100% professional and courteous, and quite friendly.  the p<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> of the dishes was nice and steady, and we were never felt rushed or pressured to leave, even as we lingered over glasses of wine for maybe ~30 min after we had paid our tab.\n\ni was definitely impressed by stk.  the whole experience was prfct.",

            "had a reservation for 1015pm but somehow we didn't get seated til after 30-40 minutes, maybe because paris hilton was chillin there? it was alright though since we were able to hangout by the bar, had some great drinks and enjoyed the ambiance.\n\nnow the food. i really liked <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> bread but i didn't think it was enough... maybe it was ju<mark>Zinfandel, St. Francis, Sonoma, CA 12</mark> i was really hungry. i had <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> lamb chops, and man oh man that was definitely a winner. the meat was very tender and what i loved more about it was that their lamb didn't taste gamey at all. you can still tell it was lamb but it didn't have that strong lamb taste to it. we also got <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> of super delicious sides, the truffle parmesan fries, which comes in brick form, and the very creamy corn pud<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>. oh yeah, and a plate of asparagus too, which was pretty much mediocre at best. \n\noverall, stk has it going on. the ambiance, people and food made our <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> worthwhile. by the way, the dj was really good too.. if there was a dance floor i would've been on that real quick.", 
            "first, i want to say that this restaurant has the most beautiful hostesses and waitresses working in las vegas. it felt like you were on the set of entourage or something. pretty dope. \n\nfirst, came the bread. i thought <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> loaf of parmesan glazed bread was pretty good. i liked the pesto olive oil dipping sauce it came with. good starter i suppose.   \n\n3-stars for the ribeye. while the fir<mark>Zinfandel, St. Francis, Sonoma, CA 12</mark> of bites were juicy and delicious, the steak got dry over time and the salt was a bit overbearing. i'm guessing they served the steak to me without adequate rest and oversalted the meat a bit.\n\n5-stars for the mac n cheese and yukon gold potato puree side dishes. i thoroughly enjoyed these side dishes. of all the steak pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> i've eaten, it is nearly on par with craftsteak's side dishes. \n\noverall it was a good <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> experience.",

            "to celebrate my boyfriend's 30th birthday, we travelled to las vegas with two friends of ours. while there, i wanted to treat him to a stellar <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> and picked stk. i was a bit hesitant as a lot of reviewers have had mixed feelings and said that it's a loud spot for a nice <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>, but i'm really glad i went with my gut and picked stk. it wasn't romantic but definitely sexy.\n\nwhen i made the reservation, i noted that our <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> was to celebrate my boyfriend's 30th. we arrived for our 8pm reservation time but were told that they were running behind and it would be about 25 minutes, so we were welcome to get a drink at the bar. (i suspect they tell everyone this to beef up their liquor sales.)\n\nwe were <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> seated in about 15 minutes and were greeted by our very pleasant server. for <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> we picked the shrimp rice krispie squares, m<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> and cheese and the much-recommended mushroom pot pie. i ordered a filet medallion and he had the 16oz. striploin. all was incredibly delicious - especially the mushroom pot pie! it was to diiiiiie for!\n\nwhile my boyfriend was in the washroom, i asked our server if we could get a dessert with <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> and she responded \"yeah of course - it's your boyfriend's 30th birthday, right?\" i was stunned! for the restaurant to pay attention to that reservation detail, remember it and relay the message to our server was highly impressive.\n\napart from the food and dessert, we also had wine and cocktails. the selection is solid but not overwhelming.\n\nwhile the noise level isn't ex<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> \"intimate\", stk had a lively vibe with most-excellent tunes. every song that came on excited me, inclu<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> '80s madonna, ub-40 and even tom cochrane (being <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>, i was stoked). my only complaint might be the hostessing staff - there was something about their attitude that left a sour taste in my mouth, so thankfully the rest of our stk experience more than made up for it!\n\nat the end of the day, we would most definitely find ourselves at stk again. it's not your everyday pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> to grab <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> (for the two of us for two glasses of wine, one martini, two steaks, an appetizer, two sides and a shared dessert it was $220 with tip), but mo<mark>Zinfandel, St. Francis, Sonoma, CA 12</mark> worthy of special occasions. believe the hype.", 
            "i absolutely love this pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>.  i've been to the stk in la which is both trendy in food and ambience.  but there is something about vegas that ju<mark>Zinfandel, St. Francis, Sonoma, CA 12</mark> be reproduced!  i loved that they had a live dj that creates a lounge feeling.  there were beautiful women in high-heels and sexy outfits.  well-dressed men in suit j<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>.  more than a handful of cougars on the prowl.  afterall, it is vegas!", 
            "not worth the $250 i threw down on <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> with just my husband.  trust us, we eat a lot of steaks and know what we like!  this pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> unfortunately disappointed.  i would given 2 stars, but our server was really on top of it, so i'm giving it 3.  $49 for a ribeye, i would hope that it would be tender, but it was really grainy and hard to cut into. my husband's first ribeye was half fat!  but the server noticed right away as he cut into it, and without hesitation took it b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> and got him a new one. the highlight of my dish was the foie gras that was on top of my filet.  i'm from california and foie is banned here, so i was excited to find a pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> that served it.  i know it's cruel, but if you missed my point of \"we eat a lot of steaks\", you can take it that i'm a true carnivore!  i would go ahead and skip this pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>, but it's good for drinks and lounging with friends.  they have a dj here nightly and depen<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> on the night, they play good music.  they have \"magnum mondays\" like marquis, where you buy a bottle and they bring you <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark><mark>Zinfandel, St. Francis, Sonoma, CA 12</mark> size!", 
            "i came to stk on my girls trip to vegas. we had a large party and were given a private room, so we had no issues with loud music. in f<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>, after a few drinks we were begging the waiter to let us change the soft music coming out of the speakers! the steak was, as expected, quite good, and the sides (truffle mac and cheese and spin<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>) were delish. the oysters on the other hand...were not shucked well...the had sand in every single one of them...which of course was rather disappointing. i alerted the waiter and he was extremely apologetic and removed them from the bill which i appreciated. \n\noverall, my experience at stk was nice (great food and great service)..minus the oyster hiccup (still..it was pretty gross). i wouldn't object if someone wanted to come b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> to stk but it would not be my fir<mark>Zinfandel, St. Francis, Sonoma, CA 12</mark> either. there are plenty of other fabulous pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> to eat in las vegas that come without a side of \"ocean floor\"", 
            "my first visit to stk was not very positive. a friend and i walked in to get a few cocktails, an appetizer, and some desserts. we stood at the front while the hostesses chatted amongst themselves and completely ignored us. when a different friend suggested that we go b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> for starters before our reservation at jaleo, i was hesitant. \n\ni am not a huge fan of supper clubs either and that played into my distaste for this pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>. when i am at <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>, i generally don't like having to scream <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> the table to talk to my friends. with that statement being said, i had a great time here. the dj that night was spinning 90's r&b and i was hooked. \n\nwhen we got there, we were seated right away this time on the high top tables near the bar. the service was a little slow at the beginning, but all our needs were taken care of. the four of us ordered; shortrib agnolotti with kabucha, steak tartar, crispy shrimp with a spicy bisque, beef carp<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>, and the beet salad.\n\noverall, the food is decent. the best item was the beet salad. it is not a knock to the other items, but the greens were just that good. i love beets and am glad to see them make an appearance on many menus nowadays. the agnolotti were also wonderful. the stuffed pasta was cooked to a perfect al dente. the sauce is reduced to caramel consistency and retained all the flavor of the beef. out of the raw dishes, <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark><mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> was better. the pesto tossed noodles on top was a splendid pairing. i've had better tartars on the strip, so i would skip that next time. the bisque for the shrimp had a nice flavor to it and would be great for <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> day. \n\nnow, would this be my fir<mark>Zinfandel, St. Francis, Sonoma, CA 12</mark> for <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>? no, but i would not oppose returning.", 
            "stk is hands down the best steakhouse i've been to.  i've been about 3 times within the past year and e<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> time i go the experience is great and the steak is phenomenal.  it's better than ruth's chris, capital grille, bourbon steak, blt steak, ray's the steaks, charlie palmer (yes, there are a lot of steak pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> in dc).\n\ni'm a bone-in ribeye type girl and won't hesitate to ask for the fattie<mark>Zinfandel, St. Francis, Sonoma, CA 12</mark> every single time.  stk gets it right every time.  the last time i was there i even added b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> butter to my ribeye.  yum.\n\nambiance is great.  most of the tables are half booths with sp<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> chairs on one side of the table.  plenty of room for everyone.  decor is as you would expect...dark wood but this pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> is very modern.\n\nthe only thing that would've made me happier would be to have more grass-fed steak options.\n\ndefinitely make a reservation.", 
            "based on the reviews, i didn't quite know what to make of stk.  i was afraid it would be a little too trendy, maybe some \"you're not cool enough to eat here\" attitude.  but the food was fantastic, the service couldn't be better, and not even a hint of 'tude.\n\neven the bread basket was a treat.  i normally don't like to fill up on bread before the meal, even if it's really good bread.  they brought out just the right amount - enough to take the edge off your hunger pangs without filling you up.  their take on the bread basket was brioche with blue cheese butter melted on top, served with chive olive oil.  the blue cheese butter was subtle and mild, and <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> olive oil was just delicious.  for an appetizer, we both got the foie gras waffle - seared foie, huckleberries, herb butter & a waffle.  it's <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> combination that turned out to be amazingly delicious.  i get seared foie gras almost anywhere it's served, and this version might be the yummiest i've ever had.\n\nthe steak was first rate.  we got the porterhouse and flank steaks, both with foie gras butter.  both cuts were done just right, and the foie gras butter made for a sinfully rich complement.  i got the asparagus for a side.  what i like about stk is they put a twist on all the steakhouse classics, without being pretentious about it.  instead of the usual straight hollandaise, they make an orange-japaleno version, and it worked!  for dessert i had the frozen zabaglione, which was basically a semi-frozen eggnog since you couldn't taste any marsala wine (which i don't like anyway, so good).  from bread to dessert, everything at stk was superb.\n\nwe managed to finish out meal before the dj started, so i can't comment on the volume level.  what made our meal a five-star experience was the service.  our server couldn't have been nicer and more helpful.  when i dropped a knife that made <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>! so loud it sounded like it was mic'd up, another server scooped it up a second later.  when i apologized for my very noisy clumsiness, she laughed it off and said don't even think about it.  none of the 'tude i was nervous about, none at all.  ju<mark>Zinfandel, St. Francis, Sonoma, CA 12</mark>, first-rate food and friendly, professional service.  also, while stk isn't cheap, it's <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> a bit less expensive than most of the top steakhouses on the strip.  i can't wait to come b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>!", 
            "i really like this pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>.  first it is located in cosmopolitan which is a great resort.  stk itself has a great vibe.  the noise level was not super quiet or overall noisy.  a good mix.  the service was really good.  the waiter had some good suggestions for my friends from drinks to sides.  it might not be the be<mark>Zinfandel, St. Francis, Sonoma, CA 12</mark> of meat you can get it las vegas, but it is really good.  more importantly it is a good value, especially for las vegas.  i had a group of 4 we need some apps, e<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> had a steak, shared a few sides and had 2 drinks e<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> and dessert.  we were out for under $500.  i paid way more for less at other pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>.  i have been here twice and will definitely go again!", 
            "i would give stk in vegas 5 stars but they have the wor<mark>Zinfandel, St. Francis, Sonoma, CA 12</mark> service so 2stars for them. blonde chick that checked our rsvp was a snob... really bitch get a real job. make sure to have the entire party present otherwise the last person to arrive won't be able to order her food and will just have to share with the others. the waiter rushed us and asked \"are you done now?\" didn't ask if we wanted to take any food to go and just grabbed our plates while one of my friend was still eating. so we took our time to order and eat desserts and left 10% tip instead of 20% on 400$ tab. no need to be rude when you're making minimum wage, idc if you're busy, they shouldn't have booked 100 ppl in a 50ppl max cap<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> room. \n\nother than the horrible customer service, food here is delicious!",

            "i've been to this stk at least 4 times and they always deliver a great experience!  compared to the one in <mark>Malbec, Terrazas De Los Andes Altos Del Plata, AR 13</mark>, the vegas stk seems to win in every category.  for starters, the d\\u00e9cor is very sleek and modern but still intimate and perfect for any occasion.  we started at the bar and ordered <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> before getting seated.  there were 8 of us so there wasn't much room considering this is more of a sit down restaurant versus a bar to hang at.  shortly after our drinks arrived we were sat in the upper booths but still had a perfect view of the whole restaurant.  as usually the wait staff is immediately on top of things and comes by to introduce themselves and talk about the specials.  we ordered another round of drinks as well as a few bottles of wine to go with our much anticipated steaks!  this is a very high end restaurant so you need to expect to spend some cash; however i wasn't thoroughly impressed with what they delivered for wines in the $100-$200 price range.  it's more our fault since we were looking to save a few bucks since we just spent nearly $10k in bottle service over the la<mark>Zinfandel, St. Francis, Sonoma, CA 12</mark> days.  anyway, for a starter we all ordered the tuna tartar and i must say it's probably the best out there.  that is a seriously bold statement coming from a guy who lives in la and has sushi joints at nearly every corner.  but seriously this is beyond delicious!   the tuna was very fresh and of the highest quality.  it wasn't a huge portion but they served it on some sort of <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> wonton cripes and dressed it with oil and an avocado sauce.  the mixture of the avocado and sweetness of the wonton was unbelievable when eaten with the tuna.  also, by ad<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> the sugar to the wonton it kept the shell together so it didn't fall apart like most in tartar dishes.  next came the steaks and the sides and as always the meat was of the highest quality.  although everything was amazingly delicious, i did learn one valuable lesson about steaks.  since we were on our way to another club i didn't want to over stuff myself so i ordered the petite filet; <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> of the other guys ordered the medium size or larger.  we ordered them medium rare but i noticed mine was cooked more through than the others.  the lesson is, always go with the larger even if you don't plan on eating it so <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> can stay cooler while charring the outside.  anyway, it was still very good but just a small thing to point out.  a few of the other guys went with the porter house and it was just perfect.  for sides we had the mash potatoes, mac and cheese, cream spin<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> and some garlic potato wedges.  for me the mac and cheese was just beyond amazing!  crispy on the outer edge and creamy on the inside.  the spin<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> and the potatoes were a little under salted for me but i think they do it so you catch more of the steaks flavor versus having too rich of a side.  to finish things off we all ordered a double espresso, a lemon cello and <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> chocolate peanut butter bars.    the whole experience was extremely top notch from start to finish and that is why i go to stk every time i'm in vegas.", 
            "literally the most amazing meal i've ever had.  \n\na friend that goes to vegas on the regular, swore up and down i had to eat at stk.  obviously a meal this fantastic isn't cheap, but it was worth it, since we weren't hitting pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> like this every night.  we were able to score a prime table (thanks to my friend) and was immediately greeted.  we chose a nice bottle of wine, and off we went.  everyone at the table ordered a petite filet, which was the perfect amount for a girl.  i've heard rave reviews about the bone in rib eye, but with all the sides we ordered, i ju<mark>Zinfandel, St. Francis, Sonoma, CA 12</mark>'t.  we also ordered the asparagus, creamed corn and mac and cheese with truffle and lobster.   the mac and cheese was the real star, absolutely mouth watering, and served in <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> iron skillet.  coming from the south, this mac and cheese is in my top 3 easily.  creamed corn was also very very tasty.  service was outstan<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>, as i never wanted for anything.  also, what i really liked about stk was the music.  this is the only restaurant i've ever experienced that i didn't know if i should eat or dance.  the dj that was spinning was really really great.  stk is p<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> full of beautiful people just like <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark>, so with the great food, great wine, kicking music and eye candy, your <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> experience is complete!",

            "i came to las vegas for a business conference and one of my managers recommended this restaurant. it is everything you think of when you watch tv shows like \"sex and <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark>!\" it is modern, hip, refined, elegant and caters to the uppity 30 to 50 year old crowd. \n\neveryone from the restaurant staff to customers were dressed to impress. i felt like i was in that movie \"oceans 11\" with george clooney..\n\ni came with a party of 5 and we ordered several different steaks and side dishes, as well as wine and dessert.\n\nappetizers:\n\nthey give you this baked loaf of bread with parmesan and garlic sprinkled over the top. it comes with a dipping sauce of herb infused butter oil. it is really a tasty treat.\n\n\nsalad: they have a great salad that comes with goat cheese, greens and balsamic vinegar drizzled over it. it is kind of a small salad, but it is quite tasty.\n\n\nentrees:\n\ni ordered the 14 ounce filet steak that is cooked on the bone. my waiter recommended that its better to get the steak that is cooked on the bone, because the meat is more flavorful and juicy. when they serve the meat, it is deboned, and it is was very good. i ordered it medium and it came out and was super tender, but still dense and so it felt like a real steak and not just soft. it was very tasty and you can order a few sides with your meal.\n\nmy colleagues also ordered different steaks and they all enjoyed their various entrees. \n\nwe ordered several different sides and i would rate them as the following:\n\ncreamy corn:  this was herb infused corn with creamy goodness. it had the texture of mashed potatoes, but it was a very robu<mark>Zinfandel, St. Francis, Sonoma, CA 12</mark> flavor.\n\njalapeno cheese grits:   green jalapeno pureed with melted cheese and infused into the grits. it had a spicy kick and it was pretty good.\n\nmushroom pot pie:    this is a great dish to order on the side. its basically mushrooms saut\\u00e9ed with caramelized onions and cream sauce in a little pot pie. i enjoyed scooping out the mushrooms and drizzling them over my steak. the flavor combination was intense.\n\n\nthe wine list is pretty good and we ordered a bottle of pinot noir. i forgot which one, but the waiter said its very popular and you should buy this in a full bottle.\n\n\ndessert:   they have a pist<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> and strawberry cake that is baked on an almond and marzipan coated crust. it is served with whipped cream and drizzled with strawberry sauce and its amazing! it is very light and not too heavy and a great way to end your meal.\n\n\nthis is a pricy restaurant, but its worth visiting when you are in vegas for a special <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> or night out with friends. one of the better steakhouses in las vegas!"

            "updated review: (marked down to 3 stars).\n\nwe had such a great experience here during the grand opening that we decided to go b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> a week later with a friend visiting from out of town.  the experience was not as great.  here is the low down:\n\nhost staff:  clueless.\nwe made reservations a few days in advance and asked to sit with our server from our first visit.  on the night of our <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> we arrived 20 minutes early to see plenty of open tables but the hostess was absolutely clueless on what to do with us.  uh, seat us maybe?  we gave her a break and decided to sit in the lounge for a drink while she sorted it out but after 30 minutes (10 minutes after our reservation) we never got appro<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> about our table (except for the wrong name - \"are you mr. kluss\"?) and so we had to go b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> up to the stand to find out what was going on with the <mark>Malbec, Terrazas De Los Andes Altos Del Plata, AR 13</mark>.  the hostess seemed like she was making an excuse up (similar to lost homework judging from her age) as to why our table still wasn't ready and so we ended up having to talk to another hostess to get it right.  when they finally went to sit us down it wasn't in the servers area we had twice requested (once during our reservation a week before and once when we arrived).  when we let her know of the mistake the hostess seating us (a different one) made some rude remark about how 'messed up' things were here and sat us down in the section we requested.  not a good tee-off to a $260 <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> for 3.\n\n<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>: too slow and with mistakes.\nthe best part of <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> was the demeanor from or original server.  she was a real pro and as cool as we remembered the first time but seemed to be hamstrung by the slow kitchen service and a few lapses in attention to detail from there - missing or slow items she had to notice and then retrieve.  i'm no stranger to fine <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> and a slow p<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> is nice but it took a good 40 minutes just to get our apps - thats too long.  overall the food was just \"okay\" for as long as we waited and for the price.  i've been much more impressed at half a dozen other steakhouses in town (the palm @ caesars, capital grill, ruths chris's, del friscos, flemings etc).  really surprised too that <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> were made so inconsistently (in taste) because how complicated is <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>?  it was so left to right that we had to keep saying something to the point that the server felt bad enough to finally bring us an extra (right) one for free.\n\nsummary:\nlike the other reviewer our trouble started with the front host staff and unfortunately continued with slow service.  as native las vegans we like <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> a lot as far as hotels go and may give stk another shot after we've tried the other restaurants at the hotel first.  the layout is great, the decor, the music and the overall vibe are solid too but as far as service goes and food that blows you away goes - maybe they just have opening week issues.\n\ncaveat emptor.", 
            "hostess and wait staff were perfectly <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>, although it was a monday night and i guess they weren't super busy. our party of 5 showed up without a reservation around 7, 730pm and were seated within 10 minutes. our drinks from the bar hadn't even arrived so they were brought to our booth. \n\nambience was great, a dj was spinning some excellent tunes (think bennie and the jetts) - although music was a bit loud for conversation.\n\ni had the 10 oz. filet and my friend had the organic chicken. i loved <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> on my steak. the steak was tender and flavorful despite the f<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> that i opted out of any additional toppings/sauce for my steak (i'm a purist). <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> was very soft and moist, although the portion was very small.\n\nwe shared sides:\n-mac and cheese (standard, nothing special. i consider myself a mac  n cheese connoisseur and i like a good crispy crust with cheesy al dente pasta but this was more <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> white concoction that i wasn't in love with)\n-parmesan truffle fries (not shoe string but more like perfectly rectangular steak fries, st<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> kinda like jenga. pretty good but again, nothing to die for)\n-roasted carrots (baby yellow and orange market carrots - delicious, tender, flavorful)\n-mushroom pot pie (presentation was great. they bring it out in it's little pot, cut around the top of <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> and dump the dish out upside down onto another plate. presentation was better than the flavor - basically different mushrooms in <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> sauce, but still fun.)\n\n overall: my steak did it for me. i'd go b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>.",

(btw, there is a big fr<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> knob for the volume. turn it counter-clockwise)\n\n\nlike many of the reviews on here, i was hoping for awesome and i got moments of cool with whole smattering of  average. i have eaten at 90% of the steakhouses here in town and i have a pretty good feel for what is hip and cool. \n\nambiance-\nthe music is way to fr<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> loud. it's bad form to have to yell at my wife who is 3 feet away from me during <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>.  i have 6000 watt home theater with 4 18 inch subs so i'm not in the \"if it's too loud your too old club\".  \n\nbut for an upscale steakhouse in an amazing casino it's just amateurish. i get concepts and this one just sucks. \n\nnor is this the pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> to bring clients to discuss business. it is however a good pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> to bring inlaws because you won't be able to hear them.\n\nannoyance f<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> minus 2 stars\n\nfood-\nwe asked for a heavy peppercorn rub on our steaks so much so that the steaks would be \"ruined\" with pepper. they brought our steaks cooked perfectly to temp and with a thick coating of peppercorns.  perfect! i had the stk bold sauce and my wifey had <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> horseradish. my sauce was good if not a bit too sweet and the horseradish cream sauce was blah. \n\nwe had the truffle fries (loved), asparagus (good as it can be) and mac and cheese(eh, cheesier and more crunch please)\n\nif i had to find fault it would be that food came out a bit too quick. it was about 5 or so minutes after the apps were completed. \n\noverall n9ne, botero and brand have a better product. \n\nminus .5 stars\n\n\nstaff- \nthe foh girls were cute, dressed well and very friendly.  no complaints here. \nbar staff was interesting- my bartender told me her signature drink was <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> and basil martini. she said was it amazing and i asked, is she so sure that she will buy it if i don't like it? she said no.  fair enough, except the bartender next to her had a group of folks come in. couldn't tell if they were friends or business but there were 8 of them in the group and he proceeded to make them all drinks and then tell the group that the whole round was on them.  hmmm....\ni joked to my girl if i could be part of their group. she didn't get it. oh and <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> martini at union is way better. \n\nour waiter was awesome as was the buss staff.  he was polite, fun and knowledgeable about the menu.  \n\n\ni probably won't be b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> as i'd rather go to n9ne or botero for the same price and not have to <mark>Malbec, Terrazas De Los Andes Altos Del Plata, AR 13</mark> with the fr<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> music. plus n9ne has <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> vibe that is way more  my liking than \"steak at the roxbury\" feel of stk.", 
            "ah stk the pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> to be seen and to mingle. as soon as you walk into this restaurant you notice all the beautiful people, loud music, and dim atmosphere. the hostess sits you in round booths that are so close to your neighbor by the end of the night you might have new friends. you order a round of their signature cocktails and soak in the glitz and the glam. but is it worth all the hype and the $$$? \n\nservice - our waitress was awesome. she was very detailed when going over the menu (maybe a little too much) and was more than obliged to offer her recommendations. she was on top of her game and provided excellent service to our table. i was a little intimidated by the bussers as they were like vultures as soon as you finished a dish. they also swooped in to fold the napkin on the table everytime my date got up from the table. side note: just make sure to say you ordered sparkling water so they don't pour regular tap water when they see your glass almost empty. tap & sparkling do not mix well.\n\nfood - within minutes of being sat down, you are greeted with <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> parmesan garlic roll and it's dipping oil, which i can't remember what it was off the top of my head. the roll wasn't bad. \n\nwe order our cocktails and appetizers - tuna tartare & foie gras french toast. phenomenal! both were so refreshing and hit that palate perfectly. the tuna tartare was fresh with diced jalapenos, onions and lime in a t<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> shell with a avocado puree and chili oil. the foie gras french toast was balanced excellently. the toast in a sherry reduction and the foie gras perfectly cooked, sprinkled with powdered sugar and served with a po<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> apple made happy time in my mouth! i highly recommend these two apps. \n\nwe then ordered a medium rare bone-in fillet with a side of parmesan truffle fries, mac & cheese, mushroom pot pie and steamed alaskan crab legs. the fries were not like the usual shoestring fries you find around town, they were more like steak potato blocks, not bad if i say so myself. the mushroom pot pie is good for mushroom fiends. they bring it out as a pot pie and cut the top off and dump the filling on a plate for you. the alaskan crab legs were nicely plump and sweet, oh how i miss the northwest! \n\nnow for the main entree- for being a steakhouse i was disappointed that their steak did not live up to the hype. it was cooked perfectly but had no flavor! a little salt & pepper would have made it one of the top steaks in town. maybe the reason it's so bland is because they do give you an option to add a topping or sauce to your steak. however, i'm a purist and great steak doesn't need anything fancy on it if seasoned right. the waitress brought us their steak sauces to try and honestly i wasn't impressed by them. the flavor was so bland. the mushroom & peppercorn sauce was probably the better of the 4 but it still l<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> flavor. word of advice don't order the mac & cheese, no flavor whatsoever. i couldn't tell you if it was suppose to be a truffle mac & cheese or just a white mac & cheese (best mac & cheese: stripsteak's truffle mac & cheese). \n\nwait still not done! we had to top off the night with dessert to have the whole stk experience. we ordered a molten chocolate cake and the famous bread pud<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>. if you have a sweet tooth, these two desserts will rock your world. i did like the bread pud<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> but it was a little too sweet for me as it was drenched in <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> syrup. <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> crunch addition to the bread pud<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> was quite interesting. \n\nwhen all was said and done, we got are bill and walked away stuffed. we easily spent over $200 for the 2 of us but we also wanted to have the full stk experience. overall, <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> to be if you don't mind the loudness, dark lighting and have <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> hours to kill...our <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> lasted over 2 hours. \n\nside notes:  the timing between apps and entrees seemed so spread out. i feel like we waited 15-20 for our entree to come out, could be a bad thing if you're starving. the steak was a disappointment but willing to try it again or try something else. be prepared to wait in line to use the restroom as there is only one stall per gender. make reservations as it can get crowded.",

(i was wondering why they didn't give us steak knives)  our water glasses were constantly refilled, and the wine selection was overwhelming. (in a good way)  we also enjoyed <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> lollipop desserts.  the ambience was hip, and the music selection was good.

            "first the good things. the beef tartar and the serrano ham appetizers were excellent. really, just awesome. the beef had a good flavor and texture, served with potato chips that were good. the serrano ham appetizer was also great, soft, tasty, the melons, figs and jam tasted great.\n\nnow the bad things. \n\nservice was spotty - not attentive enough for a pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> like this. they were friendly but inattentive at times.\n\nthe sommelier was more of a wine waiter - not warm and fuzzy at all. many wines were out of stock, inclu<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> the three least expensive cabernet, the wines were brutally overpriced (well over 2x retail), and lists started at very high price points (most over $100). we only ended up with two bottles for the table, they were so so wines and were $80 e<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>, and i've never until now not really enjoyed wines at this price point.\n\nthe steak - <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> do raw steak just fine apparently, but then they go and cook it, what the heck? they were out of several steaks. the australian kobe steaks were priced ok, but i didn't get them (12 oz @ $140). fillet mignon was out. annoying. so i got the porterhouse. the porterhouse on the strip side was not trimmed properly and the meat seemed to come from a bovine weightlifter. the fillet side was very good. but i was upset i couldn't just get fillet, the beef was trimmed wrong, and how un-marbled the strip side was. \n\nlines at the restrooms, very annoying. there is clearly a problem with this restaurant handling the volume of people and their restroom needs. build more restrooms.\n\nextremely loud. the dj, the moron he is, didn't use headphones, so the volume just kept creeping up, it was at club level noises by the end. screaming was needed to have <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>. who is the restaurant manager here, some idiot - i mean, i'm supposed to spend $140 on a steak and eat it 12 inches from a jbl bass cone thumping at  5 inches of deflection? seriously?\n\ni was not happy, and felt this pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> overall had bad value, and the main course was underwhelming and the environment was brutally loud.", 
            "quite possibly one of my favorite pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>. which is saying something, considering it's a steakhouse and i don't even eat meat. but it's much more than just that. the djs make it a really fun spot for a drink or <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>, and a the perfect pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> for <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> or two before you hit <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark>. food is incredible and servers are great--they clearly love the vibe of the pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> and work with it.\n\nbe warned that it can be loud, so perhaps not the best spot for <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> date. great for groups, and be prepared to dance in your seat throughout the meal.", 
            "i love wolfgang pucks cut but decided to  eat at stk since it was in the hotel i was staying at. i was not impressed by anything that we had except for <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> salad. the bread was very strong in cheese odor and the sauce that came with it was not very good. my group ordered the mac and cheese, mushroom pot pie, corn bread pud<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>, tuna tartar, pear salad, kobe sliders, rib eye, fillet mignon, and skirt steak. everything was just ok and nothing above and beyond. will stick to cut next time",

( i take no responsibility for that one, but when she wasn't looking, i took a piece and that too was delish!)  dessert time.  michelle appro<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> me and asked me if we'd like to see a dessert menu.  i told her it was my friend's birthday.  she simply said. \"would you like me to take care of it?\"  awesome!  that is ex<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> what i wanted to hear.  she took the initiative and made it happen.  a large tray with an assortment of desserts showed up a few minutes later with \"happy birthday\" inscribed in chocolate <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> the platter with candles.  perfect.  i love it when a server takes control, shows leadership and \"hooks it up\".  all i remember is taking a spoonful of bread pud<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>, with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, drenched in a warm caramel sauce topped with what i think was cap'n crunch cereal and thinking to myself, \"now, i can die!\".\n\nin all honesty, i've had a better steak at cut or mastro's in beverly hills, but this steak is a very close second.  but neither cut nor mastro's (in the numerous times that i've been to e<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>) even comes close to the service we got and the fun time we had at stk. not! even! close!\n\nnow, for the party that broke out in the restaurant during <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>.  this is where the fun comes in.  the resident dj was inspiring!  he played <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark>, hippest, most fun, and most want-to-get-out-of-your-seat-and-sing-and-dance-along music ever!  from sinatra, bon jovi, journey, kid rock, joan jett, jay-z, lady ga-ga, madonna.  he turned this already loud and happening restaurant into a full blown night club.  we and the three or four tables around us were up and singing and dancing and jumping, and laughing, and drinking, and hugging like it was a wed<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> or something.\n\nthe nine of us all agreed, this was the most fun, and most memorable <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> experience we've ever had.  the next time you go to vegas with a large group, go to stk, ask to sit in michelle's section and be ready to party!\n\nthank you stk, michelle and the rest of your team.  you guys gave us a night we'll never forget.",

(4 of 5) $48 - tasty and juicy. nice cut and cooked perfectly to medium rare. no complaints, but at the end, the rib steak was tastier because of the fat content.\n* bone-in rib steak 20 oz. (4 of 5) $49 - tasty and the bone was so small, it was almost like boneless. this was tasty and juicy.   \n* add on topping foie gras (5 of 5) $15 - what a bang for the buck! this is probably <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> add on foie gras price ever and it was a huge piece. delicious!!!\n* add on side raw horseradish $2 - we were slightly disappointed that the menu asked for $2 for raw horseradish. nonetheless, we had to order it. \n\noverall, the pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> was nice, food was good, and staff was very helpful.", 
            "chose stk as a nice birthday <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> for our friend. of all the nice steakhouses i've eaten in vegas, stk is the only one who did not <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> the special occasion reason noted on our open table reservations. \n\ni had the 7oz filet medallions medium which was not cut so it left me a bit confused. i figure medallions would be sliced when served. it was nothing special. not juicy. not melt in your mouth delicious. it was just a piece of filet. \n\nbirthday boy had a 10oz filet medium rare with the foie gras topper. the foie gras was a pretty generous portion. he savored his meal saying it was nice and buttery. \n\nthe other 2 guys eating healthy chose the ahi tuna rare which was a big portion. it could've been shared between the two of them. they said it was good and fresh. \n\nthe sides: first off the server told us we should all order our own bc it was too small to share. at $11 a side you wonder wth? not family style like most steakhouses?! so we got the broccolini, green beans, and mushroom potpie. when the sides came out i admit they were small but not so small you couldn't share. so the guys felt hustled by our server haha. the broccolini wasn't bad, the jalepeno gave it a spicy kick. i liked the soy glaze on the green beans. then the mushroom potpie... oh man! yes i have to agree with other reviews this is a must order for sides. another item on this trip that was worth one of my diet cheats. <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> sauce was rich but not overpowering and the mushrooms are a mixture of various kinds which was neat. <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> was flaky and light. \n\noverall i will not be going b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> to stk. i'd prolly only go b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> for the mushroom potpie. nothing spect<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> but a decent <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>. birthday boy enjoyed it. he also enjoyed <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> bread and parsley butter. i had a tiny piece and it was good! \n\nso there you have it. stk was only good for mushroom potpie and free bread hence the reason for no pics bc it wasn't worthy. ha!", 
            "this pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> is not tight. you literally get a piece of meat on a plate. and not a noticeably great piece of meat where you can taste the obvious high quality, which is how i'm guessing stk is supposed to be justifying themselves as a worthwhile, fancy restaurant.\n \nplus, if you want to order anything else (like fries or lobster mac & cheese) it's an extra $11-20. i wouldn't mind this if the fries & lobster mac & cheese had any extra pizzazz compared to their normal versions, but this wasn't <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark>. just a regular old mac and cheese with hardly any lobster! needless to say, i was very unimpressed by stk. this pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> is stuffy, overpriced ($600 for 6 people, 3 girls & 3 guys), and not sufficiently yummy...best part about it was the b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>-y<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> feel of the interior...if you're into that kind of look.",

(luckily our company paid for it.)  to me, it wasn't worth  $225 per person, probably more like $150-$175 range.  but, then again, we did drink quite a bit.  \n\nalso, i have to say that the service was top-notch.  they had 1 main waiter and 2 other people taking care of us.  they did a great job.\n\none other semi-annoying thing was that they only have 1 single restroom for men and women.  2 stalls for the entire restaurant.  this seems absurd to me.  as i said at the start, they told us it was a quiet night for the pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>...  but, there was still a line every time i had to use the restroom (which was quite often as we were \"indulging\").  i can't imagine the lines on a weekend.",

            "i'm generally not a steak person.  i have been to some nice steakhouses but i ju<mark>Zinfandel, St. Francis, Sonoma, CA 12</mark>'t manage to really get into it.  as such, stk was never high on my list of pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> to eat in vegas.  i ended up going for a business <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> and was generally pleased, even for my steak-averse palate.\n\npros\n*the appetizers were amazing.  hands down.  everything we ordered was fantastic and they <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> gave us the appropriate number of items based on the people at the table (might have been coincidence but i'll give them the point)\n*the music selection was late 90's and early 2000's that reminded me of days gone by.  it was not what you normally hear at <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> or a restaurant so it was a fun change of p<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>\n*the drinks were fantastic and we were always asked about a fresh one before our glasses were empty\n*the steak!  i know!  i said it.  it was a pretty good steak.  i only had a few bites of someone else's but it was <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> opposite of where my mind goes when i think about steak.\n\nso far this review has been high-fives and kudos.  but that two star rating up there, that wasn't a mistake.  every cloud has its silver lining, and at stk there were plenty of dark clouds to go with those small positive notes.\n\ncons\n*the volume of the music is insane.  it started out manageable but we were basically shouting at e<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> other by the time we left\n*the drink i ordered was $18, and that seemed to be about average\n*the sides were hit or miss.  asparagus was cold but the truffle fries were like pillows of potatoey goodness.  the gratin was basically raw potatoes but the mushroom pot pie was flavorful, hot, and exotic tasting\n*the service.  our waiter was great.  friendly, outgoing, ready to make recommendations.  unfortunately, after he took our order he was gone and never to be seen again.  instead we ended up with a loitering busser.  \n\nas i mentioned earlier, this was a business <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>.  we were there to eat, of course, but we were also talking and enjoying our evening.  i guess we took too long to finish our appetizers because the server asked us no less than three times if he could clear anything away.  every time we said no and he just slipped to the si<mark>Malbec, Terrazas De Los Andes Altos Del Plata, AR 13</mark> waited there.  it was like he was counting mississippi's in his head until he could ask us again.\n\nso we've finished our entrees.  we ordered a shared dessert and coffee.  we're win<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> our evening down when the manager comes over to the table.  i assumed that he was there to just say thank you since i'm sure our bill was near the $1000 mark for the evening.  turns out he was basically kicking us out of our seat.  he said the restaurant was at cap<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> and he wanted to buy us a drink at the bar so we could free up the table.\n\ni'm sure there are people in vegas who wish that their restaurants could be so full at 8pm on a weeknight that they are at cap<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>, but i can't tolerate being rushed from our table just because other people want to sit down.  i've waited at restaurants for over an hour because people weren't getting up and leaving, and that's just the way it goes.  if you dont like the wait time you go elsewhere.  it was really poor form that the manager asked us to v<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> the table (after <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> had been paid, mind you).\n\noverall i am disappointed with stk.  i went into the experience expecting stellar service and mediocre food.  turns out the food was the surprise winner and the service was just leaving much to be desired.", 
            "i've been to vegas again since eating at stk and honestly it's all i thought about the whole time. since vegas has so many options, i hate going to the same pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> twice. i have this guilty feeling that i'm missing out on something, however this time around, i'm genuinely pissed at myself.  stk is perfect for a late meal before clubbing, or for a lively group of people that don't mind eating <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> in a loud atmosphere. we walk in and the pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> was jamming. they had a dj spinning awesome 90's r&b and rap and all the servers were on their a game. the food was fresh, delicious and came out promptly - but not so fast where you think it's not being cooked for you. \n<mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> part about stk is going to the kitchen and seeing <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark>'s line with their amazing view. <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> are having just as much fun as all of the guests. i'd highly recommend stk and will absolutely be visiting my next time in vegas.",

            "i've been to this stk at least 4 times and they always deliver a great experience!  compared to the one in <mark>Malbec, Terrazas De Los Andes Altos Del Plata, AR 13</mark>, the vegas stk seems to win in every category.  for starters, the d\\u00e9cor is very sleek and modern but still intimate and perfect for any occasion.  we started at the bar and ordered <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> before getting seated.  there were 8 of us so there wasn't much room considering this is more of a sit down restaurant versus a bar to hang at.  shortly after our drinks arrived we were sat in the upper booths but still had a perfect view of the whole restaurant.  as usually the wait staff is immediately on top of things and comes by to introduce themselves and talk about the specials.  we ordered another round of drinks as well as a few bottles of wine to go with our much anticipated steaks!  this is a very high end restaurant so you need to expect to spend some cash; however i wasn't thoroughly impressed with what they delivered for wines in the $100-$200 price range.  it's more our fault since we were looking to save a few bucks since we just spent nearly $10k in bottle service over the la<mark>Zinfandel, St. Francis, Sonoma, CA 12</mark> days.  anyway, for a starter we all ordered the tuna tartar and i must say it's probably the best out there.  that is a seriously bold statement coming from a guy who lives in la and has sushi joints at nearly every corner.  but seriously this is beyond delicious!   the tuna was very fresh and of the highest quality.  it wasn't a huge portion but they served it on some sort of <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> wonton cripes and dressed it with oil and an avocado sauce.  the mixture of the avocado and sweetness of the wonton was unbelievable when eaten with the tuna.  also, by ad<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> the sugar to the wonton it kept the shell together so it didn't fall apart like most in tartar dishes.  next came the steaks and the sides and as always the meat was of the highest quality.  although everything was amazingly delicious, i did learn one valuable lesson about steaks.  since we were on our way to another club i didn't want to over stuff myself so i ordered the petite filet; <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> of the other guys ordered the medium size or larger.  we ordered them medium rare but i noticed mine was cooked more through than the others.  the lesson is, always go with the larger even if you don't plan on eating it so <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> can stay cooler while charring the outside.  anyway, it was still very good but just a small thing to point out.  a few of the other guys went with the porter house and it was just perfect.  for sides we had the mash potatoes, mac and cheese, cream spin<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> and some garlic potato wedges.  for me the mac and cheese was just beyond amazing!  crispy on the outer edge and creamy on the inside.  the spin<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> and the potatoes were a little under salted for me but i think they do it so you catch more of the steaks flavor versus having too rich of a side.  to finish things off we all ordered a double espresso, a lemon cello and <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> chocolate peanut butter bars.    the whole experience was extremely top notch from start to finish and that is why i go to stk every time i'm in vegas.",

(side note: the bar is all curvy and gorgeous, but it comes at the expense of leg room.  tall people beware.)\n\ni ordered a delicious pinot grigio (thanks for the heavy pour!) and noshed on the free bread (loved the blue cheese butter and chive olive oil!) while browsing the menu.  there are lots of traditional steakhouse items, but plenty of fish and vegetarian options make stk a good option for any sort of <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>.  our group ordered a bunch of different items, which was i<mark>Malbec, Terrazas De Los Andes Altos Del Plata, AR 13</mark> for sampling and tasting:\n\n** foie gras and waffles.  this appetizer was absolutely **amazing**.  easily the best foie preparation i've ever had (but, admittedly, i haven't tried all that many).  loved the sear on the foie, and how the sweet huckeberry gastrique cut through the savory foie.  the waffles were crispy and light as air, too.\n\n** beet salad.  simple, but outstan<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>.  the beets were perfectly cooked and had a nice sweetness.  plenty of goat cheese and pist<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> pesto, too.\n\n** 7 oz filet.  admittedly, i'm not much of a steak guy -- but this filet was out of this world.  its texture was like butter, and it had amazing flavor.  (more hardcore carnivores may probably opt for a larger cut, but 7 oz was just right for me.)  \n\n** broccolini.  an i<mark>Malbec, Terrazas De Los Andes Altos Del Plata, AR 13</mark> side dish, since it was excellently cooked, and provided a nice crunch to contrast with the filet.\n\n** sweet potato donuts.  you might not think of stk as a dessert destination, but these divine donuts might change your mind.  sweet potato made for an unusual twist on <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> donut, and a gooey and decadent pecan glaze brought it all together.  heaven!\n\nservice was outstan<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>.  pretty much everyone on the staff looks like a model, with sex appeal dripping out of every pore -- but don't expect \"vanderpump rules\"-style drama or catty behavior.  quite <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> -- the staff at stk are 100% professional and courteous, and quite friendly.  the p<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> of the dishes was nice and steady, and we were never felt rushed or pressured to leave, even as we lingered over glasses of wine for maybe ~30 min after we had paid our tab.\n\ni was definitely impressed by stk.  the whole experience was prfct.",

(or -- as it was suggested by some in the party -- change the name to \"std\"?)  hepatitis (or worse?)  on the forks is a legitimate but secondary concern:  how about the group of us simply wanting to enjoy a glorious steak at midnight served by a wait staff who really knows their stuff without having to be witness to a hustler letter to the editor in the making?\n\nstop the ho's at the door. for the love of christ, turn down the music. now you've really got something.",

            "such a nice surprise for my birthday trip to vegas.  i wanted somewhere fun, good, and not too expensive to have a birthday <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> and this was perfect.\n\nparking: it's located in cosmo, on the 3rd floor.  if you park in self-parking you have to walk kind of far because it's located near the lobby.\n\natmosphere: the inside is dark and trendy.  with hanging ball lights and cool fixtures.  i made reservations for 6pm because we had to get to <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> early and it was slightly crowded, but i'm sure it gets more crowded later on at night.  it was perfect for a fancy birthday <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>.  we got a half booth half table with 3 people sitting on chairs.  for attire i could see you getting away with a nice skirt and top, fancy top and jeans or dress.  you can't be overdressed here.\n\ni heard the music was super loud and fun, which makes the <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> experience better but at 6pm the music was kind of soft and more old school.  i think as the night went on it got louder and they were slowly making their way into the 90s but we didn't stay long enough to experience it.  \n\nfood: \n\nsteak - their cheapest steak is like $39 and they have a lot of other options but if you don't like steak i wouldn't come here.  my suggestion is to share the steak with someone else because it is pretty big and expensive.  my boyfriend and i shared the bone in rib steak (basically the rib eye) and it was plenty for both of us.  the steak itself doesn't come with anything so it's recommended you get sides ($12 e<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>!) we got 4 to share among the 8 of us and it was plenty.  beware though because we got the truffle mac n cheese and that was more than $12.  you can get \"toppings\" on top of your steak but it's not needed.  the steak itself is very flavorful and tasty without anything.\n\nsides -\ntruffle mac n cheese - the mac was the round short pastas usually in m<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> salad and i really liked that.  a good crust on the top with a yummy truffle flavor and pretty creamy mac n cheese.\n\ntruffle parmesan fries - they are thickly cut and are more like potato rectangles than fries.  they are st<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> like jenga and have parmesan and truffle oil on them. they were a little too potato-y and thick for my liking but everyone at the table loved them.\n\nmushroom pot pie - a weird side but it was literally a pot pie with mushrooms, onions and <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> sauce inside.  it tasted like truffle but i don't even know if it had truffle.  the top is a light crust, which wasn't that flaky and pretty thin.\n\nbok choy - weird for a steak pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> but it was kinda spicy.  very flavorful though with lots of soy sauce and garlic.  not bad <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> for some greens.\n\noverall very impressed with stk.  i thought it would be more for the atmosphere but the food was really good! they even brought me out this chocolate cake/mousse for my birthday with <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> :)",

we were never bombarded by food, and the wait between courses was never very long.  \n\nthe others on the wait staff were also very attentive.  our waters were never empty, our tables were always folded if we left to use the bathroom f<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>, and any time our cocktails/wine was looking low, there was someone there to offer us another.  \n\nfood: \n\ncaesar salad (4 stars) - don't know how they did it, but even <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> salad was rememberable.  the lettuce was so crisp/fresh, and the dressing and croutons were remarkably tasty.\n\n\n\nspiced pickled prawns (5 stars) - hands down the best starter/non-beef item of the night.  <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>, ranks right up there with the steak with how much i truly enjoyed this item.  the two are just apples and oranges, so hard to really compare the two. anyway, i will get this every time i'm here.  the shrimp was perfectly crisp (not the dense/gritty texture that you sometimes find with some shrimp when they've been completely overcooked) and so fresh.  also, loved the balance of <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> with the level of heat.  i love heat, so i ended up eating all of the slices of jalapeno pepper it came with (my husband avoided those, and enjoyed his level of heat without them)\n\nlobster cocktail (3.5 stars) - this was good, but in comparison to everything else, not rememberable.  we would forego this item next time.\n\nbone-in filet (5 stars) - holy crap, the star of the night.  definitely enough steak to split between the two of us.  so amazing, and perfectly cooked to our requested rare-medium/rare.\n\npork belly (3 stars)  -  this item came along with the steak and fries toward the end of our meal.  it was delicious, but i wish it had more crispiness (i'm not a huge fan of pork belly unless it's been crisped up just right - the texture of chewy/soft fat makes me want to hurl).  probably wouldn't order this item again.  maybe would have \"shined\" a bit more if it wasn't brought out with the steak and fries, who knows.\n\nparmesan truffle fries (4.5 stars) - so full of truffle flavor, piping hot, crispy on the outside, and soft in the inside.  a must order for sides.\n\ndrinks:\n\ndouble espresso - we rarely do coffee/dessert after <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>, but this one called for it.  the espresso (while very, very spendy!!) was perfection.  don't think i'd get it again, however, as the price was gasp-worthy (something like $12-15 e<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> for a small little espresso drink).\n\nmanhattan - very well balanced and tasty (per my husband); one complaint is they used a maraschino cherry (i.e., bright red) vs. a gourmet cocktail cherry.  that would have made <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> perfection in a glass.\n\nvodka martini up w/ splash of st. germain - perfection in a glass;

            "we came here on a saturday night during a girl's trip to celebrate a birthday. the atmosphere is just what we wanted; upscale but also fun, the server was awesome and let us take our time, made great recommendations, and the food was all delicious. we had the burrata, a wedge salad, <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> entree, mac and cheese, mashed potatoes and broccolini - all shared family style. the server brought the salad out chopped so it was easy to share and had <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> sliced for us in the kitchen, without us asking. definitely the best restaurant i have been to on the strip and a good model for restaurant owners to base server training on. will be b<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> during future vegas trips for sure!", 
            "stayed at <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark>. i was not impressed with the food we ordered filet, lamp chops, steaks, rib eye, potato mash, salads etc! party of 5 on a tuesday night in vegas for a business <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>, we were unable to have <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> because the music was too loud. the service was excellent plus the runners. however the food was just very bland and tasteless. spend your $ somewhere else for a good steak <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> unless you want to sit in a restaurant that sounds like a nightclub.", 
            "i came to las vegas for a business conference and one of my managers recommended this restaurant. it is everything you think of when you watch tv shows like \"sex and <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark>!\" it is modern, hip, refined, elegant and caters to the uppity 30 to 50 year old crowd. \n\neveryone from the restaurant staff to customers were dressed to impress. i felt like i was in that movie \"oceans 11\" with george clooney..\n\ni came with a party of 5 and we ordered several different steaks and side dishes, as well as wine and dessert.\n\nappetizers:\n\nthey give you this baked loaf of bread with parmesan and garlic sprinkled over the top. it comes with a dipping sauce of herb infused butter oil. it is really a tasty treat.\n\n\nsalad: they have a great salad that comes with goat cheese, greens and balsamic vinegar drizzled over it. it is kind of a small salad, but it is quite tasty.\n\n\nentrees:\n\ni ordered the 14 ounce filet steak that is cooked on the bone. my waiter recommended that its better to get the steak that is cooked on the bone, because the meat is more flavorful and juicy. when they serve the meat, it is deboned, and it is was very good. i ordered it medium and it came out and was super tender, but still dense and so it felt like a real steak and not just soft. it was very tasty and you can order a few sides with your meal.\n\nmy colleagues also ordered different steaks and they all enjoyed their various entrees. \n\nwe ordered several different sides and i would rate them as the following:\n\ncreamy corn:  this was herb infused corn with creamy goodness. it had the texture of mashed potatoes, but it was a very robu<mark>Zinfandel, St. Francis, Sonoma, CA 12</mark> flavor.\n\njalapeno cheese grits:   green jalapeno pureed with melted cheese and infused into the grits. it had a spicy kick and it was pretty good.\n\nmushroom pot pie:    this is a great dish to order on the side. its basically mushrooms saut\\u00e9ed with caramelized onions and cream sauce in a little pot pie. i enjoyed scooping out the mushrooms and drizzling them over my steak. the flavor combination was intense.\n\n\nthe wine list is pretty good and we ordered a bottle of pinot noir. i forgot which one, but the waiter said its very popular and you should buy this in a full bottle.\n\n\ndessert:   they have a pist<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> and strawberry cake that is baked on an almond and marzipan coated crust. it is served with whipped cream and drizzled with strawberry sauce and its amazing! it is very light and not too heavy and a great way to end your meal.\n\n\nthis is a pricy restaurant, but its worth visiting when you are in vegas for a special <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> or night out with friends. one of the better steakhouses in las vegas!", 
            "awesome atmosphere! great pl<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> to have <mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark> with a group of people, or a date. <mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> bread was a definite winner! my braised short rib fell short in the flavor department, but was extremely tender.", 
            "closes later than other steakhouses. i didn't want to rush to a different steakhouse 30min before their closing time. \n\ncame on a monday night. took 5-10min to get a table. it was crazy loud and pr<mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> like <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark>. wasn't a big fan of that. our waiter was super polite and friendly. checked on us regularly. \n\nyellowtail appetizer was yummy. fresh and it surprisingly goes well with apples. it also has <mark>Pinot Noir, a by Acacia, CA 13</mark> sauce that comes with it. \nmy boyfriends bone-in ribeye was okay. wasn't juicy enough. had better. \ni got the bone-in filet. asked for medium rare. was slightly over cooked in my opinion. but the portion by the bone was amazing.\nwe both got the stk sauce. their house steak sauce was sweeter than i expected. the boyfriend wasn't a big fan, but i thought it was okay. i think the stk bold would have been a better choice. \nwe sha<mark>Red Blend, the Prisoner, Napa <mark>Cabernet Sauvignon, Jordan, Alexander Valley, CA 11</mark> 13</mark> corn pud<mark>Stellina Di Notte, Prosecco, Veneto, Italy NV</mark>. that was a favorite. tasted like a sweet mashed potato with pieces of corn. \n\noverall, the food was okay.",
