            "this is a review for <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> island restaurant. \n10oz steak, <mark>Pork Chops And Two Eggs</mark>, potatoes and toast all for $3.50 !!  best breakfast i have had in a long time. this is easily <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> deal you can get anywhere on or off <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>. <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> is pretty low priced too but, i came here strictly for <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> due to all <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> reviews on yelp. i will definitely be back here again on my next trip to vegas.", 
            "i had to rewrite <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> for this place after our last visit because a lot has changed. so we've been coming to vegas a lot this year and basically, this is a place we return to time after time again. if you've lost all your money gambling, or have spent way too much eating on <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> this place will feed you for mere pennies.\n\nthe $4.95 10oz sirloin steak dinner is not available any longer. that is such a bummer. in its place is <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> mignon dinner for $6.99 and comes with <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> stuff as <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> dinner did: soup or salad, a side of veggies and your choice of <mark>Baked Potato</mark>, fries or <mark>Rice Pilaf</mark>. it's still a fantastic deal, but i must say, i much prefer <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> over <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>. filet mignon is just not a cut i usually like because it lacks flavor imo.\n\nfor breakfast, you can get <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> <mark><mark>Corned Beef Hash</mark> <mark>Top Sirolin Steak <mark>Pork Chops And Two Eggs</mark></mark></mark> special which is now still under 4 bucks and that piece of steak is a ny strip. this is a delicious alternative to the $6.99 steak dinner option if you like that cut of meat.\n\ngone are also <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> 99 <mark>Breakfast Special</mark>. i'm guessing that <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> meals <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> were dishing out were losing <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> money and now, <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>'ve had to raise <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> prices a few bucks in order for <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> to make a profit. however, <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> <mark>Breakfast Special</mark> at $4.99 comes with 2 huge pancakes, 2 eggs and your choice of <mark>Bacon or Sausage</mark> (which used to be around a buck 99). a side of <mark>Bacon or Sausage</mark> is still $1.99 which is cheap compared to o<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> places which charges about 4 bucks for <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> thing.\n\nit's still one of <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> bargains in vegas. if you don't get a drink it will keep your costs way under for a meal which is going to not only be satisfying, but will make you wonder why in <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> charge so much on <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> for <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> stuff.\n\n<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> days when i go to ellis island for my steaks i bring my portable sea salt dispenser with me. <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> don't season <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> steaks and all <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> have is table salt or a1 steak sauce. <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> steaks are good enough to eat with just a sprinkle of salt, but don't ruin <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> with plain ole table salt!!! <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> here was far better in quality when served rare than <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> beef tataki i had at shibuya where i paid an arm and a leg for my meal. go figure!!\n\nps: now that <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> is a far thicker cut than <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> ever was, make sure you order it more well done than you like. my medium came out rare, but it's a hit and miss because <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> i had yesterday was done just right (yes.... i went <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> 2 days in a row for <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> dinner).",

            "dear hubby and i really like this inconspicuous little place for its steak dinner special.  it comes w/ a 10 oz sirlion, cut like a filet, <mark>Green Beans</mark> and choice of potatoes.  it used to be $4.95 for <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, but recently it has been $6.95 w/ choice of <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> microbrewery beer or <mark>Eib <mark>Amber, Hefe Weiss, Stout, Light, IPA, Root Beer</mark></mark>.  still a great deal for a nice steak.\n\nit doesn't hurt that <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> playing while we're waiting for a table is more than fair and i usually come out ahead.\n\non our most recent visit, we found out about <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> <mark>Breakfast Special</mark> from 11 pm to 11 am.  steak <mark><mark>Corned Beef Hash</mark> <mark>Top Sirolin Steak <mark>Pork Chops And Two Eggs</mark></mark></mark> for $3.99 which can't be beat.",

(?).  so essentially he didn't get what he ordered, but i was not surprised that <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> would not understand how to separate out <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, and would not be <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> bit surprised if <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> never ever had a customer request <mark>Egg Whites</mark> (only). & what <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, a cheese omelet with <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> on <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>??  i cannot make this stuff up... good thing he also ordered <mark>Cinnamon Vanilla French Toast</mark>, although i don't think that was anything to write home about ei<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>. \n\nnow my food was just that: scrambled eggs, uninspired but tasty enough albeit slightly greasy bacon, <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> weird potato things that taste ok/pretty good (probably microwaved from frozen), and toast that was heavily buttered and textured like styrofoam.  \n\ni get it: my breakfast was $5.99, and <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> bill with drinks and extra sides was $23 in total (i almost always tip 20%).  it wasn't like wolf gang puck was back <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> slinging hash, but like i said before: in new york you can get some absolutely delicious food that is super cheap, so cheap you can feed your whole small family, and it's like you're stealing it-- you know what i'm saying\" like a whole steamy, juicy, tasty rotisserie chicken from <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> spot with arroz y gandules or frijoles and/or maduros for like $10.  and you leave <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> rubbing your belly like, \"damn!\" swearing you're not going to eat for a year because you ate long after you were full because <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> was that good.  and you don't have to go to gordon ramsey's steak ei<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>.  \n\nanyway, my point is that <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> experience was blah at best, more like peculiar, and just nauseating at worst.  it wasn't that <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> tasted bad, but was not enjoyable. & although you do get what you pay for, that certainly does not hold true necessarily with <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> york dining experience (& so i am a bit spoiled!).  much better food can be found at ihop, and even denny's i'd bet, for a few extra dollars."

            "this joint got great overall reviews here on yelp as well as trip advisor. now i concede- if you're paying $5.99 for breakfast, don't expect gordon ramsey fare.  i came here because after 4 days of paying obscene prices to eat a meal on <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> (e.g. $5 for a slice of pizza), my pocketbook needed a break. moreover, after my class i wanted breakfast, and it was after 11 am on a saturday.  now in new york you can get breakfast 24/7, no problem.  & good breakfast at that.  on <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> strip you better get breakfast by 11 am, and brunch fare is very limited.  i don't get this in a non-stop party city like vegas that you can't get breakfast anytime of day any day of <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, but at least on <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>. smdh, but i digress.....\n\nso my son found this joint that serves breakfast until 2 pm, & i really, really liked <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>.  it's a decent walk off <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> path, and hence can feel a little unsafe.  but being from brooklyn, it takes a bit more than that to scare me, but i digress.... moreover, if you're from new york city you know: sometimes <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> tasting food comes out of <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> holes-in-the-wall; look at this caridad restaurant by woodhull hospital in bushwick, or angie's breakfast spot also in bushwick.  anyway, i kept an open mind.\n\nyou have to pass through <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, dingy, smoke-filled casino to get to <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> area.  mind you all public spaces in new york indoor areas, and even some outdoor spaces, are smoke-free & have been so for many years, so i am unaccustomed to eating around smoke.  as <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> area was not enclosed, <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> odors of tobacco is always present everywhere, including <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> area.\n\nwe had an expected 30 to 40 minute wait, and was seated about 45 minutes later.  my son ordered an egg white cheese omelet.  problem #1:  egg white.  i ordered safe: bacon & eggs.  can't mess that one up. our food came within a reasonable amount of time. what <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> gave my son was some round, pancake-shaped mass of (whole) egg with 2 slices of what looked like kraft cheese singles on top (!) (?).  so essentially he didn't get what he ordered, but i was not surprised that <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> would not understand how to separate out <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, and would not be <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> bit surprised if <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> never ever had a customer request <mark>Egg Whites</mark> (only). & what <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, a cheese omelet with <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> on <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>??  i cannot make this stuff up... good thing he also ordered <mark>Cinnamon Vanilla French Toast</mark>, although i don't think that was anything to write home about ei<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>. \n\nnow my food was just that: scrambled eggs, uninspired but tasty enough albeit slightly greasy bacon, <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> weird potato things that taste ok/pretty good (probably microwaved from frozen), and toast that was heavily buttered and textured like styrofoam.  \n\ni get it: my breakfast was $5.99, and <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> bill with drinks and extra sides was $23 in total (i almost always tip 20%).  it wasn't like wolf gang puck was back <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> slinging hash, but like i said before: in new york you can get some absolutely delicious food that is super cheap, so cheap you can feed your whole small family, and it's like you're stealing it-- you know what i'm saying\" like a whole steamy, juicy, tasty rotisserie chicken from <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> spot with arroz y gandules or frijoles and/or maduros for like $10.  and you leave <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> rubbing your belly like, \"damn!\" swearing you're not going to eat for a year because you ate long after you were full because <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> was that good.  and you don't have to go to gordon ramsey's steak ei<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>.  \n\nanyway, my point is that <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> experience was blah at best, more like peculiar, and just nauseating at worst.  it wasn't that <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> tasted bad, but was not enjoyable. & although you do get what you pay for, that certainly does not hold true necessarily with <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> york dining experience (& so i am a bit spoiled!).  much better food can be found at ihop, and even denny's i'd bet, for a few extra dollars.",

(?).  so essentially he didn't get what he ordered, but i was not surprised that <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> would not understand how to separate out <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, and would not be <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> bit surprised if <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> never ever had a customer request <mark>Egg Whites</mark> (only). & what <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, a cheese omelet with <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> on <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>??  i cannot make this stuff up... good thing he also ordered <mark>Cinnamon Vanilla French Toast</mark>, although i don't think that was anything to write home about ei<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>. \n\nnow my food was just that: scrambled eggs, uninspired but tasty enough albeit slightly greasy bacon, <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> weird potato things that taste ok/pretty good (probably microwaved from frozen), and toast that was heavily buttered and textured like styrofoam.  \n\ni get it: my breakfast was $5.99, and <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> bill with drinks and extra sides was $23 in total (i almost always tip 20%).  it wasn't like wolf gang puck was back <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> slinging hash, but like i said before: in new york you can get some absolutely delicious food that is super cheap, so cheap you can feed your whole small family, and it's like you're stealing it-- you know what i'm saying\" like a whole steamy, juicy, tasty rotisserie chicken from <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> spot with arroz y gandules or frijoles and/or maduros for like $10.  and you leave <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> rubbing your belly like, \"damn!\" swearing you're not going to eat for a year because you ate long after you were full because <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> was that good.  and you don't have to go to gordon ramsey's steak ei<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>.  \n\nanyway, my point is that <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> experience was blah at best, more like peculiar, and just nauseating at worst.  it wasn't that <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> tasted bad, but was not enjoyable. & although you do get what you pay for, that certainly does not hold true necessarily with <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> york dining experience (& so i am a bit spoiled!).  much better food can be found at ihop, and even denny's i'd bet, for a few extra dollars.",

            "i had been meaning to visit ellis island to jam a night away singing karaoke. ellis island seems to have a reputation for killer karaoke. but what is it that ultimately got me to take a trip to ellis island? a video from vice's youtube channel, munchies. in <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, ellis island is explored as one of the (cheap) places to hang out at. so off we were to our $9.99 steak special to see if it was as good as <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> made it out to be. honestly, it wasn't. and it wasn't even $9.99!\n\nwhen we initially entered ellis island we were taken back by how big <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> is. i was imagining it to be a medium to large dive bar... this place is (obviously, as i later discovered) a \"full size\" casino. <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> are table games and slots on slots on slots - after all, i am in las vegas. karaoke was alive and well. in case you're wondering, karaoke is in a separate room to <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> from <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> entrance. <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> segment had mentioned signing up for <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> player's card and getting free slot play, so that's what we did. i was disappointed that i wasn't cool enough to get <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> chicken, but <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> play was a nice score. naturally, i won nada. <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>'s card sign up was pretty easy and didn't take too long even though <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> were two of us signing up.\n\n<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> are a couple restaurants to choose from inside ellis island, most of <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> were closed when we arrived though. <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>\\u00e9 was very much opened and exactly where we wanted to go to try <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> food. <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> are pretty cheap considering ellis island's proximity to <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>. i was adamant about trying <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> special but my boyfriend got a <mark>Cinnamon Vanilla French Toast</mark> dish. <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> was pretty thin and a bit dry in places and chewy in o<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, overall it wasn't horrible... perhaps i just had my expectations raised after watching that show. my boyfriend's <mark>Cinnamon Vanilla French Toast</mark> was pretty darn good though! ellis island has <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> own brews so i tried <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> ale which also wasn't bad...especially for $2.\n\noverall, ellis island is pretty fun escape from <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>... and it's not ridiculously far away so i will encourage tourists seeking a \"different\" vegas experience to visit. i still want to go back and fulfill my karaoke needs and will be sure to post an update to this review on that experience, but for now... bye, bye, bye!"

            "thank you fellow yelpers! i would never have found such a goldmine of a restaurant had it not been for you. yeah, <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> is a little dive, but i like <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> type of places. \n\ni ate here twice (once for breakfast, once for a late night dinner). <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> was incredible for what <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> charge you. the <mark>Corned Beef Hash</mark> that i ordered for breakfast was a little salty but good. it came with <mark>Pork Chops And Two Eggs</mark>, fantastic potatoes, and toast for $5.99. seriously?! \n\n<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> special for $6.99 was so worth a second meal here. when my bf suggested this place for a late night dinner after seeing <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, i secretly did a happy, little dance. this is <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> of old-school vegas that i miss. great food, cheap prices. anyway, <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> came with a gorgeous, <mark>Fresh Salmon Salad</mark> (<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> cheese was yummy), string beans, potato, and a beer from <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> brewery or <mark>Eib <mark>Amber, Hefe Weiss, Stout, Light, IPA, Root Beer</mark></mark>. i ordered <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> and i think that it was probably <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> hefeweizen that i have ever had. our bill for 2 was $15 bucks. can't beat that!!! love, love love it!", 
            "when i first saw <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> of this place i wondered what i'd gotten myself into. people who know me know i love pretty decor and a clean, scrubbed look. well, you won't get <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, but you will get fabulous food!\n\n<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> can be long sometimes, but trust me, it's well worth it. i'd say that <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> is okay. it's nothing that i'd write home about, but it's average and you won't have any complaints. \n\nagain, <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> is not pretty, but <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> is so yummy good. i used to always order the <mark>Fresh Salmon Salad</mark> and, oh my gosh, it is so delicious that i went back three days in a row for it when i first ate it. that's how spectacular it was. i <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> branched out to <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> dinner (i know, i really put myself out <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, don't i?) and, of course, cooked perfectly. i really do love this place.\n\nseriously, when you walk in you will wonder what you are doing <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, but you eventually find out that this place is not only great, but affordable! don't let <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> keep you from going inside for a whole lot of goodness. yum!\n\ni wish i could write about all <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, but i've pretty much had salmon every time, but truthfully, if <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> can cook that fish perfectly, think about what <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> can do with steak<mark>1/2 Bbq Chicken</mark>, etc! go do it!"

            "<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> special here is fantastic! it's pretty much my go-to when i'm strapped for cash but still want a restaurant experience with courses. doesn't hurt that <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> crafted in house are only $1.75.\n\nis this <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> steak you'll ever have? heck no. but where else can you regularly get soup or salad to start, and a filet cut top sirloin with choice of potato and <mark>Green Beans</mark> for $8? nowhere, i tell you. <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> part about this deal? it comes with a free beer (or <mark>Eib <mark>Amber, Hefe Weiss, Stout, Light, IPA, Root Beer</mark></mark>.. get a beer, sissy). and <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> beers are pretty darn good.\n\ni personally love <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> of sirloin. i think filet mignon is overrated in everything but it's tenderness (ribeye.. that is all.) <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> at ellis is hit or miss, really, both in preparation and in quality. sometimes i've gone and it's been tender, and sometimes my jaw is sore by <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> of dinner. i usually order medium-rare and it's usually medium or medium-well, occasionally rare, and once in a blue moon, cooked correctly. <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> beans are fresh <mark>Green Beans</mark> and are sometimes still crisp, and sometimes really mushy and buttered with loads of fresh garlic. <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> potato is standard, and <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> potatoes come with gravy that is much like cafeteria gravy and is oddly satisfying in that way.. <mark>Basket Of Steak Fries</mark> are <mark>Basket Of Steak Fries</mark>. <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> change day to day and range from chili to new england clam chowder (surprisingly good). <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> are your standard iceberg romaine carrot purple cabbage mix with croutons and cherry tomatoes, but <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> italian dressing is made in house and it is bangin'.\n\no<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> dishes: <mark>Orange Roughy</mark> - delicious. fish n chips - delicious! (same as village pub, but cheaper at village pub). clams - good, fresh. <mark>French Onion Soup</mark> - super greezy. i think <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> use is a piece of <mark>Garlic Bread</mark>. <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> also have <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> casino <mark>Breakfast Special</mark> that seem like a good deal, i've never tried <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>.\n\nthis is an $8 steak. this is not a steak house. this is <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> of steak that benefits from being cooked a little more by getting just a bit more tender.. go medium-rare. for <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, you won't have any regrets. unless you're a vegetarian (sissy).", 
            "oh boy ellis island.  my coworker suggested this place <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> time i went to vegas a few months ago (yeah i'm a loser i waited way past i was 21 for my return to vegas).  i was really skeptical since she said <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> rib here was under $10 with <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> card and tasted exactly like <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> stuff.  still, i managed to pull my hungover self as a place to eat on <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> back home on a sunday and omg i fell in love.  i ended up staying here a few hours longer than i expected and make it a point to come back here every time i'm in vegas!  <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> two times i came <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> was about a 20 minute wait, but <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> time i came for lunch <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> was no wait at all.  i heard <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> is usually a wait so just make a players card and use the $10 credit <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> give you while you wait.\n\n<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> don't have <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> rib as a special anymore but <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> have a top sirloin with a beer (regular brew or <mark>Eib <mark>Amber, Hefe Weiss, Stout, Light, IPA, Root Beer</mark></mark>) for $8.99 so i always order that instead.  <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> for <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> of food is spectacular!!!  the 8 oz steak i usually get medium-rare and usually is cooked to perfection except for one time (it was overcooked just a little but it was easily sent back).  it comes with a side of potatoes, <mark>Green Beans</mark>, and a salad.  <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> has a nice crust  and it so deliciously juicy.  all <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> taste like how <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> are supposed to and you'd be surprised by how not overcooked/soggy <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> beans taste cause <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> still have a slight crisp to <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, and <mark>Baked Potato</mark> are pretty hard to mess up.  this last time i ordered a <mark>French Onion Soup</mark> and i thought it had a pretty decent flavor for being $4.99.  i have also tried <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> <mark>Eib <mark>Amber, Hefe Weiss, Stout, Light, IPA, Root Beer</mark></mark> and it tastes pretty good but you can definitely taste <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> at <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>.\n\ni always end up sitting around <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> for a while before/after eating and just relaxing getting out of <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> and bustle of vegas.  i like winding down here and having a light beer (really refreshing!).  bf always forgets and orders <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> which he doesn't like and the 2nd beer always turns out to be a light heh.  service is always quick and hospitable.   \n\n<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> are tons of advertisements for cheap food with <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> food not looking like <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, but hands down i think ellis island has <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> taste and value for <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>!  if you're coming to vegas without intentions to spend a lot of money on food, definitely stop by here.", 
            "apparently this is where all <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> go. i think we were recommended this place by our cab driver. anyway, we had just been dropped off, walked in , and was confused as hell. of course it's a casino when you walk in! where's <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>? my bf asked a security guard \"where's ellis island?\" and this guy looked at him like he was a crazy person. not cool man! anyway, we found it like right in front of us. for some reason i think we just didn't know what to expect and it looks like a little cafe or something. so we put our names in for a twenty min wait. it was actually pretty packed. waited at <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> and laughed at <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> people karaoke-ing. so now for <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>. <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> have <mark>French Onion Soup</mark>!! also got a steak, which was good too. <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> were amazingly cheap and <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> was pretty damn good. and hey, in my book any place that has <mark>French Onion Soup</mark> is a winner. <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> was laid back and quick. will definitely be back next time i'm in vegas.", 
            "<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> was good. <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> was so slow! we got <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> at 11:45, took about 15 minutes before our drink order was even taken. <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> ano<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> 40 minutes until our food was delivered! the <mark>French Onion Soup</mark> comes in a huge bowl & is enough for a meal. the <mark>Grilled Chicken Salad</mark> is also enough for two people. my husband ordered the <mark>Sou<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> <mark>Chicken Fried Chicken</mark></mark> & said it was pretty tasty. he also had <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, that was o.k. too. i ordered a side salad too, but since we were all done eating, i told our waitress i no longer wanted it and <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> made me full enough. she said she put <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> in as an appetizer, but <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> wouldn't my salad have been brought out with everyone's entrees too? so she took it off <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> for us. don't think we will be back here on purpose any time soon."

(<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> house ranch was really tasty) all for 10.99!!! overall we had a really friendly and efficient server and <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> was very good, we both ended up taking most of <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> back to <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> and having it for lunch when we woke up <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> day and it was all still really good. \n\nas for <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> small and older. definitely seemed like a local spot and much slower pace.

no. it didn't occur to me until later that of course she was lying because you can't get a mixed drink like that to pour separately out of a gun, it would be a solid color and i wouldn't have seen <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> thin stripe of kahlua at <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>. so i gave her <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> and asked her to take it off <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> and she left.\n\nshe comes back a few minutes later with <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> and tells me she told <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> and <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> added a free shot of kahlua to it and now <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> is gone like <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> stirred it. so benefit of <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, i'm thinking it looks like <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>'re trying to make things right. i take a sip and it's like drinking slightly sweetened cream in ice. no hint of alcohol in <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>.\n\nmeanwhile, my friend had ordered an adios mo<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> f****r which should have been named a 'see ya later, pal' because like my drink, his didn't even had stiff language in it. he kept his though after watching <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> dance i was doing with <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>. \n\nwhen she returned again, i told her that <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> was still horrible. i didn't want it. <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> was still full and to take it back. she did and mostly avoided our table <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> of <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>. at one point she came by and asked my friend if he wanted ano<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> and he told her he'd ra<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> not pay $11 for ano<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> blue lemonade.\n\ni don't know about <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> everyone else talked about on yelp because after 9 <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> only served a small list of appetizers that were okay from our sampling in <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> area. nothing i would worry about getting again but not <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> i ever had. <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> was fun and <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> were actually a mixture of really good and really bad,..basically what you want from karaoke.\n\nwhen she finally brought <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> was <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> russian living large at full price for all to see. it had not been removed and no manager ever came by to see what he could do. <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> just didn't give a crap whe<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> we came back or if we told anyone or everyone on <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> how crappy it was.\n\nso <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> line is: if you go, drink beer and nothing else because <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> will completely screw you as evidenced with <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> trying to charge me for a small glass of cream that may or may not at one time have been sitting next some alcohol but <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> of <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> never saw any.\n\nbut if you want to karaoke, <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> are plenty of places you can go where <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> might respect <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> customers at least a little and/or be aware that <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> is this thing called <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> where people will tell o<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> people how poorly(pourly?) <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> think of <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> expect money from.",

            "this joint got great overall reviews here on yelp as well as trip advisor. now i concede- if you're paying $5.99 for breakfast, don't expect gordon ramsey fare.  i came here because after 4 days of paying obscene prices to eat a meal on <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> (e.g. $5 for a slice of pizza), my pocketbook needed a break. moreover, after my class i wanted breakfast, and it was after 11 am on a saturday.  now in new york you can get breakfast 24/7, no problem.  & good breakfast at that.  on <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> strip you better get breakfast by 11 am, and brunch fare is very limited.  i don't get this in a non-stop party city like vegas that you can't get breakfast anytime of day any day of <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, but at least on <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>. smdh, but i digress.....\n\nso my son found this joint that serves breakfast until 2 pm, & i really, really liked <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>.  it's a decent walk off <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> path, and hence can feel a little unsafe.  but being from brooklyn, it takes a bit more than that to scare me, but i digress.... moreover, if you're from new york city you know: sometimes <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> tasting food comes out of <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> holes-in-the-wall; look at this caridad restaurant by woodhull hospital in bushwick, or angie's breakfast spot also in bushwick.  anyway, i kept an open mind.\n\nyou have to pass through <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, dingy, smoke-filled casino to get to <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> area.  mind you all public spaces in new york indoor areas, and even some outdoor spaces, are smoke-free & have been so for many years, so i am unaccustomed to eating around smoke.  as <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> area was not enclosed, <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> odors of tobacco is always present everywhere, including <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> area.\n\nwe had an expected 30 to 40 minute wait, and was seated about 45 minutes later.  my son ordered an egg white cheese omelet.  problem #1:  egg white.  i ordered safe: bacon & eggs.  can't mess that one up. our food came within a reasonable amount of time. what <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> gave my son was some round, pancake-shaped mass of (whole) egg with 2 slices of what looked like kraft cheese singles on top (!) (?).  so essentially he didn't get what he ordered, but i was not surprised that <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> would not understand how to separate out <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, and would not be <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> bit surprised if <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> never ever had a customer request <mark>Egg Whites</mark> (only). & what <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, a cheese omelet with <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> on <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>??  i cannot make this stuff up... good thing he also ordered <mark>Cinnamon Vanilla French Toast</mark>, although i don't think that was anything to write home about ei<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>. \n\nnow my food was just that: scrambled eggs, uninspired but tasty enough albeit slightly greasy bacon, <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> weird potato things that taste ok/pretty good (probably microwaved from frozen), and toast that was heavily buttered and textured like styrofoam.  \n\ni get it: my breakfast was $5.99, and <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> bill with drinks and extra sides was $23 in total (i almost always tip 20%).  it wasn't like wolf gang puck was back <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> slinging hash, but like i said before: in new york you can get some absolutely delicious food that is super cheap, so cheap you can feed your whole small family, and it's like you're stealing it-- you know what i'm saying\" like a whole steamy, juicy, tasty rotisserie chicken from <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> spot with arroz y gandules or frijoles and/or maduros for like $10.  and you leave <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> rubbing your belly like, \"damn!\" swearing you're not going to eat for a year because you ate long after you were full because <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> was that good.  and you don't have to go to gordon ramsey's steak ei<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>.  \n\nanyway, my point is that <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> experience was blah at best, more like peculiar, and just nauseating at worst.  it wasn't that <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> tasted bad, but was not enjoyable. & although you do get what you pay for, that certainly does not hold true necessarily with <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> york dining experience (& so i am a bit spoiled!).  much better food can be found at ihop, and even denny's i'd bet, for a few extra dollars.",

            "when we walked up to it my first impression was like this is all <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>? and i was a little bummed thinking that it was going to be really smoky! but when you entered your immediately hit with <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> of <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> bbq! not dingy cigarette smoke (join <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> ellis island players club and receive $3 off <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> bbq plates!!) it was nearly 10p and we missed <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> so we trekked about 100 feet over to <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> village pub. <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> was about a 5 minute wait on saturday. when we were seated i noticed most of <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> were ordering <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> special for  4.99 (includes a steak, veggie and choice of potato, side salad and a in house micro-brew beer or <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> <mark>Eib <mark>Amber, Hefe Weiss, Stout, Light, IPA, Root Beer</mark></mark>). tempting but since <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> has so many latenight steak deals we opted to check out <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> of <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> extensive menu. my boyfriend ended up ordering <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> <mark>Pork Chop Dinner</mark> ($10ish) (includes 2 large bone-in thick cut pork chops, choice of potato (<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> potatoes were killer!!) and a veggie (he got <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>) <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> chops were juicy, not dry and had a good seasoning and nice char flavor to <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>. hes a big eater and he couldn't even get thru half of his meal. i got <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> <mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark> dinner, seriously this thing is ridiculous! its is a large frisbee sized <mark><mark>Broiled Chicken Breast</mark></mark> flattened tho still managed to retain a 3/4 of an inch thickness! that's been lightly coated in a flavorful italian breading topped with a tasty marinara sauce and lots of mozzarella cheese :) served with marinara covered linguine. <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> if that wasn't enough food this dinner also comes with two large slices or sourdough buttery <mark>Garlic Bread</mark> and a large side salad! (<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> house ranch was really tasty) all for 10.99!!! overall we had a really friendly and efficient server and <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> was very good, we both ended up taking most of <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> back to <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> and having it for lunch when we woke up <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> day and it was all still really good. \n\nas for <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> small and older. definitely seemed like a local spot and much slower pace. (it reminded me a lot of <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> in mesquite) <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> only have a one craps table but my boyfriend was able to win back <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> he'd lost while gambling on <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, and <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> were that night were paying out pretty well. <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> a very short walk if your staying at <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>/ballys/cesars area like we were and was nice to get off <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> and win some money and have a cheap meal! def coming back each time we come to vegas in <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>."

(<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> house ranch was really tasty) all for 10.99!!! overall we had a really friendly and efficient server and <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> was very good, we both ended up taking most of <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> back to <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> and having it for lunch when we woke up <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> day and it was all still really good. \n\nas for <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> small and older. definitely seemed like a local spot and much slower pace.

            "i'm not giving ellis island casino five stars for its luster and chic atmosphere. i give it five stars for its \"dive\" and dingy appeal, unpretentiousness, great beer, even greater <mark>Eib <mark>Amber, Hefe Weiss, Stout, Light, IPA, Root Beer</mark></mark>, and reasonably priced comfort food. \n\ni'm a casino employee (not at e.i.) and embrace <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> of e.i.'s daily graveyard special...casino employees drink free from 3am-8am!!!! as if <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> of <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> cocktails, homemade beers, domestic/import beers weren't cheap enough (and <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> are)...<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> go ahead and give a hand out to <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> casino employees. \n\ndrinks are good here with an emphasis on <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> homemade beers. if you prefer a non-alcoholic beverage, i can reassure you many yelpers and i will attest to <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> homemade <mark>Eib <mark>Amber, Hefe Weiss, Stout, Light, IPA, Root Beer</mark></mark>. it has a very nice smooth carbonation to it, with a slightly sweet and bitter taste, and classic <mark>Eib <mark>Amber, Hefe Weiss, Stout, Light, IPA, Root Beer</mark></mark> scent. \n\nfood at e.i.... upon sitting down, you will be served one dinner roll per person. however, beware of ordering too much! <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, salads, and entrees are huge! we ordered: \n1) two e.i. <mark>Eib <mark>Amber, Hefe Weiss, Stout, Light, IPA, Root Beer</mark></mark> \n2) buffalo <mark>Chicken Wings</mark> w/mild sauce on <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> (<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> was so tasty but <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> were a bit on <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> side) \n3) <mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark> sandwich -- bf ordered this \n4) <mark>Chef Salad</mark> -- me \nmy salad was huge, like cheesecake factory salad-huge. all of <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> were fresh and, unlike most restaurants, <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> do not skimp on <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> cuts of deli meats and cheeses. i got the 1000 island dressing which was totally delicious. i guess it's because <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> make all of <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> dressings from scratch <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>. my bf's meal came with a small (normal sized) <mark>Dinner Salad</mark> w/a delicious french dressing. he commented that his sandwich wasn't great nor bad....just ehh. it looked like it was nestled on a ciabatta roll with a nice portion of chicken, cheese, and sauce. an older gentleman sitting near us ordered <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> that night, roast <mark>Pork Chop Dinner</mark> for $6.99. oh my god, i don't think three people could've finished that plate. <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> was literally piled 4-5\" high! if he had a small child behind that plate, i wouldn't have known it from my point-of-view. \n\nour first dining experience at e.i. was very cool and laid back. <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> was good and friendly. luckily, we arrived at about 4pm, so we were seated with no wait. as we progressed through our meal, a small crowd of people began to form. as i saw it, <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> staff accommodated and sat each group quite quickly. <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> restaurant system seems to be a well oiled machine. \n\ni hesitate to recommend everyone to dine here because <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> is not for everyone. because of <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> of good food, cheap drinks, and gambling <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> casino/restaurants (yes <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> are two \"sit down\" restaurants here) tend to attract some less desirable folk. <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> of <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> reminds one of the 70s and <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> does contain smoke. you will hear hoots and hollars, slot machine rings, and depending on <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> of day you may visit, karaoke. so remember <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> factors before you decide to dine here. this is not an establishment that is trying to lure you in for its luxuriousness, <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, or glamour. it's a great and reasonably priced place to get away from all of those above!", 
            "when we walked up to it my first impression was like this is all <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>? and i was a little bummed thinking that it was going to be really smoky! but when you entered your immediately hit with <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> of <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> bbq! not dingy cigarette smoke (join <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> ellis island players club and receive $3 off <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> bbq plates!!) it was nearly 10p and we missed <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> so we trekked about 100 feet over to <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> village pub. <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> was about a 5 minute wait on saturday. when we were seated i noticed most of <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> were ordering <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> special for  4.99 (includes a steak, veggie and choice of potato, side salad and a in house micro-brew beer or <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> <mark>Eib <mark>Amber, Hefe Weiss, Stout, Light, IPA, Root Beer</mark></mark>). tempting but since <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> has so many latenight steak deals we opted to check out <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> of <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> extensive menu. my boyfriend ended up ordering <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> <mark>Pork Chop Dinner</mark> ($10ish) (includes 2 large bone-in thick cut pork chops, choice of potato (<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> potatoes were killer!!) and a veggie (he got <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>) <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> chops were juicy, not dry and had a good seasoning and nice char flavor to <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>. hes a big eater and he couldn't even get thru half of his meal. i got <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> <mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark> dinner, seriously this thing is ridiculous! its is a large frisbee sized <mark><mark>Broiled Chicken Breast</mark></mark> flattened tho still managed to retain a 3/4 of an inch thickness! that's been lightly coated in a flavorful italian breading topped with a tasty marinara sauce and lots of mozzarella cheese :) served with marinara covered linguine. <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> if that wasn't enough food this dinner also comes with two large slices or sourdough buttery <mark>Garlic Bread</mark> and a large side salad! (<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> house ranch was really tasty) all for 10.99!!! overall we had a really friendly and efficient server and <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> was very good, we both ended up taking most of <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> back to <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> and having it for lunch when we woke up <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> day and it was all still really good. \n\nas for <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> small and older. definitely seemed like a local spot and much slower pace. (it reminded me a lot of <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> in mesquite) <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> only have a one craps table but my boyfriend was able to win back <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> he'd lost while gambling on <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, and <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> were that night were paying out pretty well. <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> a very short walk if your staying at <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>/ballys/cesars area like we were and was nice to get off <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> and win some money and have a cheap meal! def coming back each time we come to vegas in <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>.", 
            "i do love me some ellis island!! went to dinner with family. i had <mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark> it's always delicious!! my aunt and uncle both had the $8.99 steak special. steak was cooked perfect and it looked really good. for $8.98 can't beat <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>!! service was excellent! my aunt thought i was crazy for ordering <mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark> <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> lol but she was pleasantly surprised how good it was!!", 
            "budget food restaurant with some good deals and bad deals. we ate here a few times and <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> or <mark>King Cut Prime Rib</mark> specials are really worth <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>. a regular restaurant would charge twice what ellis charges. it's a great value, but it isn't amazing quality food. our first breakfast came out a bit cold, which is a pet peeve of mine. our second meal at 1am was pretty good and a great option for recovering. our third meal went pretty badly. <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> ran out of <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> <mark>King Cut Prime Rib</mark>, so we settled with a more expensive dinner option, like <mark>Chicken Parmesan</mark>. we waited an hour. one hour. obviously <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> was dropped somewhere and <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> was too bad to check in on us sooner. <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> parmesan was extra salty, <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> was way overcooked and soggy. meh. my advice is to stick to <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> <mark><mark>Corned Beef Hash</mark> <mark>Top Sirolin Steak <mark>Pork Chops And Two Eggs</mark></mark></mark> deal or <mark>King Cut Prime Rib</mark> deal. everything else isn't worth <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, effort, or calories."

            "i had to rewrite <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> for this place after our last visit because a lot has changed. so we've been coming to vegas a lot this year and basically, this is a place we return to time after time again. if you've lost all your money gambling, or have spent way too much eating on <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> this place will feed you for mere pennies.\n\nthe $4.95 10oz sirloin steak dinner is not available any longer. that is such a bummer. in its place is <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> mignon dinner for $6.99 and comes with <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> stuff as <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> dinner did: soup or salad, a side of veggies and your choice of <mark>Baked Potato</mark>, fries or <mark>Rice Pilaf</mark>. it's still a fantastic deal, but i must say, i much prefer <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> over <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>. filet mignon is just not a cut i usually like because it lacks flavor imo.\n\nfor breakfast, you can get <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> <mark><mark>Corned Beef Hash</mark> <mark>Top Sirolin Steak <mark>Pork Chops And Two Eggs</mark></mark></mark> special which is now still under 4 bucks and that piece of steak is a ny strip. this is a delicious alternative to the $6.99 steak dinner option if you like that cut of meat.\n\ngone are also <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> 99 <mark>Breakfast Special</mark>. i'm guessing that <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> meals <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> were dishing out were losing <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> money and now, <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>'ve had to raise <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> prices a few bucks in order for <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> to make a profit. however, <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> <mark>Breakfast Special</mark> at $4.99 comes with 2 huge pancakes, 2 eggs and your choice of <mark>Bacon or Sausage</mark> (which used to be around a buck 99). a side of <mark>Bacon or Sausage</mark> is still $1.99 which is cheap compared to o<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> places which charges about 4 bucks for <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> thing.\n\nit's still one of <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> bargains in vegas. if you don't get a drink it will keep your costs way under for a meal which is going to not only be satisfying, but will make you wonder why in <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> charge so much on <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> for <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> stuff.\n\n<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> days when i go to ellis island for my steaks i bring my portable sea salt dispenser with me. <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> don't season <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> steaks and all <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> have is table salt or a1 steak sauce. <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> steaks are good enough to eat with just a sprinkle of salt, but don't ruin <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> with plain ole table salt!!! <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> here was far better in quality when served rare than <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> beef tataki i had at shibuya where i paid an arm and a leg for my meal. go figure!!\n\nps: now that <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> is a far thicker cut than <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> ever was, make sure you order it more well done than you like. my medium came out rare, but it's a hit and miss because <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> i had yesterday was done just right (yes.... i went <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> 2 days in a row for <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> dinner).",

            "on my annual roadtrip to vegas with my family (yeah i'm classy like that) we almost always go straight to ellis island for dinner. originally we went for $6 steak dinner (not on <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>) and $1 draft beer. since <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, prices have raised- beers are now $2/pint at <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, and $2.50 at <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>. i in no way believe that's expensive, just pointing it out. also- <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> special is now $12, unless you have a coupon, which you can only get if you have a player's card. with <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> it's $9 or so. so keep that in mind when you come. \n\nhonestly <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> is pretty good but on our last trip, we ate here two times and i got different items instead. once i got <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> and <mark>Rice Pilaf</mark>, i can't remember <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> name. it was excellent- sauteed <mark><mark>Broiled Chicken Breast</mark></mark>, spinach, sundried tomatoes, and mushrooms on top of pilaf. it also came with salad. <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> time i got \"no carb <mark>Sou<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> <mark>Chicken Fried Chicken</mark></mark>\" which is just <mark>Sou<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> <mark>Chicken Fried Chicken</mark></mark> without breading, and i will say that this made me rethink <mark>Sou<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> <mark>Chicken Fried Chicken</mark></mark> completely. it was without a doubt much better than most <mark>Sou<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> <mark>Chicken Fried Chicken</mark></mark> i've ever had, specifically because <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> was able to get very crispy not being battered, and <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> was incredibly moist and flavorful due to <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> being on. \n\nwe've definitely had some colorful visits here, and sometimes <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> has been not as good. <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> can be chewy and tough at times, and once my fa<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> literally choked on it (like, <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> was a line of people giving him <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> maneuver). however i think he blames it on his lack of chewing, not <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, since he happily returns here for <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>. i realize that's a bizarre endorsement but hey, it's gotta count for something. our most recent visit, it was right after my birthday and right before my mo<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>'s birthday and our waiter brought us a free slice of <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> <mark>Chocolate Spoon Cake</mark>. normally i wouldn't care much about free <mark>Chocolate Spoon Cake</mark>, but this was fantastic. it was also made in house and really made me see <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> desserts in a different light. <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, pizza and deli options here are also very good, so i would happily come back here on my next trip, and if you want a good cheap meal, i would recommend o<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> come here as well.",

            "this is my husband's first time in vegas - i have been here five o<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> times, and i wanted to give him a down and dirty vegas experience (that did not involve naked women dancing for dollars). we were some hangry people, so i hopped on yelp to see what was good close by and was not a chain restaurant and i was provided with this place. knowing how much <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> loves beer, i figured this would be a win.\n\nso now that i have spent <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> two and a half hours <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> waiting around in <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> (getting lung cancer most likely from all <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> smoke) getting him buzzed on $2 house brewed hefeweizen, having two fights because he was in bitch mode prior to said beers, and people watching before and after dinner i have to say this was exactly <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> i was looking for.\n\ni got <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> special - a 10 oz filet with a salad or soup, <mark>Green Beans</mark>, choice of potato and a beer for $8.99 if you have <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> (it's $12.99 without). i didn't realize we needed to have a coupon so our waiter went looking for one and gave it to me (score!).  hubby had <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> two b's in his dining trifecta - beef & bacon (the 50/50 burger with ground bacon and more bacon+ cheese on top). he had my beer since i don't drink beer.  my meat was perfectly cooked, <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> beans were fantastic, and <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>....i will never eat a normal burger again.\n\ntotal damage for this meal: $18.54 with tax and alcohol + and <mark>Hot Or Iced Tea</mark>.  i threw our waiter a significant tip for hooking me up with <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> (basically i gave him <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> in price in <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> plus what i would've normally tipped).\n\ni heartily recommend this establishment. life is great at <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> 8.  it's how seedy i remember vegas being prior to being taken over my rich beautiful young people who have shitty taste in music (edm) and who feel <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> need to coin <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> 'day clubs\" ra<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> than night club because god forbid you have to wait until dark to party!\n\nand now i have to close my eyes because i have a food coma starting.",

            "this review is for <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> at ellis island.\n\na few tips: despite <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> and cafe being open 24/7, <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> is not.  <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> are open sun-thurs 4pm-10pm and 4pm-11pm fri and sat.  also, don't plan on bringing your children as it's 21 and older.  when busy, <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> will give you a notification buzzer so you don't have to stand nearby.\n\nas a local for <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> 10 years, i've eaten <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> countless times and it has remained consistently delicious.  about three years ago, <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> was relocated from <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> side of <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> to its current position; wait times have been cut way down.  this time i waited 45 minutes on a sunday night at around 7pm with my party of three.\n\none aspect i appreciate here is <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> menu.  you have 4 options as my menu pic will attest to.  thankfully, no complicated 10 page menu.  i personally always pick <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> option (half chicken/half <mark>Full <mark>1/2 Rack Baby Back Ribs</mark></mark>).\n\n<mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> are cooked to perfection with a delicious sauce that really adds to <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> of <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>.  my only complaint (my personal preference) is that i cannot detect any smoke flavor.  sadly, you won't see any beautiful pink smoke rings on this meat.  frown.  <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> is very tasty but have noticed it can be slightly dry.  each entree is served on a very large black plate and includes 2 pieces of buttered <mark>Garlic Bread</mark>, an ear of corn (split in half), side of average tasting slaw and baked beans served with an ellis island based <mark>Eib <mark>Amber, Hefe Weiss, Stout, Light, IPA, Root Beer</mark></mark> sauce.\n\ni finally decided on a 4 star rating as <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark>, while consistently friendly, can be on <mark>The Berkshire 50/50</mark> side and it can be hard to get refills on drinks.  \n\nbut overall, i recommend and look forward to going back.",
