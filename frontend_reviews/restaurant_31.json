            "this review is for the restaurant, not the club. after talking to our concierge at encore, we decided to try lavo. it was 7:45 and she said she'd call over for an 8:00 reservation, which i didn't think was necessary on a thursday night, but i'm glad she did. when we showed up, the place was 75% full, and by 9:00, it was packed. the dining room is very cool - dark and sexy, with thumping house music, as you'd expect from a restaurant/nightclub from the tao people. service was just okay - our server seemed bummed when we told her we weren't having any drinks, and when we told her we needed a couple more minutes to look at the menu, she disappeared for about 20 minutes. she got nicer as the night went on, though. we shared the <mark>Baked Clams Oreganato</mark> to start. at the same time, they brought out an entire loaf of garlic bread with marinara sauce to dip. we noticed that they always wait to bring this complimentary garlic bread until after you order - probably because it's huge and you'd order way less if you knew you were getting this. the clams and garlic bread were very good. then we had the caprese salad, which was very nice, although personally i could have done without the green tomatoes. for entrees, we split the veal milanese and the pasta with vodka sauce. the veal was just okay, but the pasta was delicious. word of warning: the portions here are enormous. we overheard the waiter telling another couple that when ludovic lefebvre was chef and they served mediterranean small plates, people were all complaining about the tiny portions. so now they so overcompensated with these obscenely ginormous portions that it's really wasteful. they should tell you about the portion sizes before you order. we left over half the veal uneaten. so just know, if you dine here, that one app or salad and one entree are perfectly enough for two to share. prices are reasonable to begin with, but when you see the portions and that you could share, it really becomes quite inexpensive. for good but not exceptional italian in a very hip vibe, head to lavo (especially if you want access to the club, which i hear is quite nice).", 
            "this is for the restaurant. \n\nwent here for the second time. first time was hit and miss, with the music way too loud to carry on a conversation and terrible service. but the food was good so we decided to give it another go. this time, everything worked out great. music was at a reasonable level. temperature very pleasant. server was fantastic. garlic bread tasty but a little crunchy. appetizer kobe rice balls, a little dense for my taste but very flavorful. appetizer <mark>Baked Clams Oreganato</mark> fantastic...hot, clams perfectly cooked with a nice toasted breadcrumb topping, great garlic sauce...i wanted to lick the plate.  my wife had the penna ala vodka...just o.k. we don't mind el dente, but her penne took el dente to a ridiculous level. and it was undersauced. spaghetti and kobe meatballs...delicious. gelato for dessert...the chocolate was awesome, caramel good and vanilla bean o.k. portions are large and priced reasonably.", 
            "while my most recent dining experience at lavo was not as stunning as before, i and my party enjoyed an excellent meal.  as an opener, <mark>Baked Clams Oreganato</mark> yielded very garlicky clams but they were accompanied in their shells by a very tasty sauce.  and, the buttery garlic bread that came with the meal was so good that i sought and received another loaf--and, after its arrival, polished off most of it myself.  a caesar salad was an excellent caesar, with unusual pesto croutons and requested anchovies.\n\nthis time for my chosen entree i went more rustic, and, opting for some fine peasant cuisine, ordered spaghetti with kobe meatballs, which featured large meaty balls, a superior thick tomato-based sauce, and <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark> and parmigiano cheese.  the dish was quite satisfying, as was a side of <mark>Roasted Rosemary Potatoes</mark>.  diane also enjoyed her well-pounded veal parm.\n\nservice was excellent and attentive.  the only discordant note was really the too loud driving music played nonstop by the dj.  it did not harmonize well with digesting food or trying to carry on a conversation with one's spouse and friends across a dining table.   \n\nloss of a half-step, and so a half-star, this outing.  a 4-1/2-star experience overall!"

            "oh lavo how i love thee!  we went here last saturday night for a bachelorette party. had a late night reservation for 8 at 945. got there, we were like 10 mins early, sat at the bar, chatted it up with the lovely christian, got some drinks and bing right on time our reservation is ready. hot damn!\n\nwe sit down, have a lovely waitress who is all smiles and is aiming to please [remind you she's female we are all female and she was still super duper nice]. we order, get more drinks, say hi to the manager who looks like superman, bread and appies arrive-life is good.\n\nok garlic bread [yes you are probably going to make out with some random later, so bring gum] b/c this bread is worth it!  kobe stuffed rice balls- there is a god.  these things are freaking amazing-like foodgasm good, calamari yummie, and flatbread pizza also very good.\n\ni ordered a tomato and mozzarella salad, this thing is huge [that's what she said], so share it.  it was again way too much food. my other friend and i split kobe meatballs and spaghetti, well that was so amazing, she's eaten meatballs everyday since just to try and pretend they were the same.  my other girlfriend who weighs about 100 lbs soaking wet got <mark>Eggplant Parmigiano</mark>. ok dude she was going to make out with it at the table, she said and i quote 'the is the best <mark>Eggplant Parmigiano</mark> i have ever had in my life\" she said it like 5 times so i'm fairly confident she meant it. she was also devising ways in which she could take the rest of it home, stick it in her going out bag, and eat it after we went to the club. she was distraught, to say the least, that she was not able to bring it with her for later.\n\nwe finish eating and literally roll our happy asses upstairs; whereby, we are escorted to our table and are assigned a wonderfully nice man by the name of tony who is our security guard for the night. tony is a miracle worker, basically he boots bad men away from you [a+] and when you have to use the ladies, he escorts you every time himself, flashlight in toe and hand delivers you to the restroom. then, bless his heart, waits for you and escorts you back so you don't have to deal w/ shoving people out of your way. oh what a lovely concept!\n\nwe had an a+ time here seriously, service was impeccable, price was right, and we all can't wait to do round 2!", 
            "this is my 6th time here and came with my family and fiance on our vegas trip to celebrate my father's 60th birthday. called a few weeks in advance to book a table, they ask you for a credit card to secure your reservation so be aware of that. requested a table outside and mentioned it was my daddy's 60th birthday.\nwe waited about 30 mins for the table (totally normal at this restaurant) for a table for 6 outside. they said they could seat us immediately inside but it was such a  gorgeous night we waited. we grabbed some drinks at the bar and yummy long bread sticks and stood outside and waited. once our buzzer rang we were seated at a great table with a view of the pirate show at ti. we ate late, around 11pm so we saw the last show of the night. quite loud so be prepared. the restaurant is one of the loudest restaurants (inside) in vegas - super fun. the food here is amazing! so tasty! to start we ordered:\nsun ripened tomato bufala mozzarella $19\n2 orders of the <mark>Eggplant Parmigiano</mark> (the server even warned us that they are huge but i told him we usually order 1 for my fiance and me when we come, they are that good!) you must order this $17\n<mark>Crispy Fried Calamari</mark> $17\n<mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark> $21\nthe men had beers and the ladies split this amazing white pinot grigio, i can't rem the name but it was so tasty and the price was really good!\nfor the mains we ordered:\norganic <mark>Mixed Green</mark> salad $16 \n<mark>Mixed Wild Mushrooms</mark> $11\n<mark>Chicken Parmigiano</mark> $29 (comes with a large side of pasta)\nfour cheese ravioli $24\nchicken & mushroom ravioli $27\nspinach & artichoke brick oven pizza $21\n\neverything was amazing. the only reason i am removing 1 star is because i reminded both the hostess and the server that it was my father's 60th birthday and nothing was done. not even a little candle. they must have forgotten, but i was quite disappointed with that part.\n\nwill return for the tasty food and environment.", 
            "my boss wanted to introduce me to lavo because she was so impressed with a couple of their dishes when she went earlier in the week (yes...she went twice in a week in las vegas where there are so many good restaurants). \n\nwe were seated on the patio, which overlooks  the strip. it was a beautiful night and the patio is very nice. while the service was a little slow, i loved what she ordered for us to share. \n\ndon't go to lavo without ordering the <mark>Eggplant Parmigiano</mark>. while it is on the appetizer menu, it is huge and the two of us split it for our entree. it is a unique dish unlike anything i've had before and the flavor is amazing. \n\nwe also shared the beet salad, which was great. we are headed back to las vegas next week for another work trip and my boss wants to go back again. i love trying new places, but if we go back, i'll be happy with it."

            "the reason i am giving lavo 5 stars is because there are few places of it's kind. i enjoy it's elegance, fantasticly revamped menu, and sick club. the only other outstanding club restaurant would be tao. tao is amazing! tao beach is a pool party with unreal food so this company has their sh-t together. this property is a little more high end boutique, but any one could have a great night here.\n\nthe food is fantastic. if you've heard mixed reviews in the past the food use to be mediterranean but it's now home cooked italian style. i've heard several people say, \"i usually have <mark>Crispy Fried Calamari</mark>, but this is unreal.\" yum! the salmon is the best! now i'm pretty hungry.\n\nlavo is a little more strict when it comes to dress code. i have seen several people in t-shirts get turned away. sandals on men or gym shoes are also not allowed. \n\nsundays dj vice performs. he is one of the most well known resident dj's in a town that has the most famous dj's in the world constantly performing. he plays the top 40's which everyone wants to hear but he also plays some old school music as well. he scratches which i don't hear or see many dj's do. late night he plays more house techno music. he plays to the mood and sets the mood at the club.", 
            "we checked out lavo last thursday night and i was pleased with our food, but incredibly disappointed with the service, which is why the rating is 2 stars. \n\nafter being seated and taking our drink orders, we were quickly deserted by our waiter. we sat for several minutes before a woman came over to tell us about the specials and then she disappeared. our waiter eventually came back and took our orders, but we were able to order our appetizers and entrees because we'd been sitting for so long. \n\ni ordered the lavolini - prosecco, passion fruit, st. germain - this was an excellent drink and was very refreshing. \n\nour group started out with orders of the <mark>Crispy Fried Calamari</mark>, spedini ala romano and the kobe beef rice ball. we also ordered the salad special, which was a delicious mix of arugula, heirloom tomatoes and a soft italian cheese (maybe stracchino, but i can't remember and it isn't on the menu).  the table was pleased with our starters. the spedini was delicious and salty, so be warned if you aren't a fan of salt. the calamari was delicate, and for a non-calamari fan, i thought it was good.\n\ni ordered the spaghetti with <mark>Spaghetti Fresh Tomato and Basil</mark>. the <mark>Spaghetti Fresh Tomato and Basil</mark> had me sold as we'd been eating out all week. the spaghetti noodles had a nice bite to them and the <mark>Spaghetti Fresh Tomato and Basil</mark> sauce was excellent. i ate quite a bit on my plate and still had enough to pack up and take back. i definitely could have split this portion with another person and still could have had plenty leftover. \n\nour waiter returned and took plates to pack for leftovers, but forgot about two orders our table wanted packed up to go and threw them out. he did take them off the bill, but those two guests were very disappointed that they didn't get to take their food home. \n\nif we'd had a different waiter, this rating would definitely be higher. not only was he slow, he had the attitude that he was something special and we should be honored to have him serve us. he also didn't take time to observe the table to see who was in charge at the table, and instead of going to that person, he automatically went to the lone man at the table.\n\nso, go for the food and atmosphere, but hope you don't get the same server we had.", 
            "went to the restaurant and the club...i'll start with the restaurant. (btw, the restaurant gets 4 stars...the club gets 0)\n\nthe decor inside was gorgeous, it felt very intimate with low lighting, and tables set waaaay too close together. but trust me, three glasses of wine later, you won't even notice that you can hear every word out of your neighbor's mouth, and presumably they can hear yours. \n\nthe food was delicious! i had the spaghetti and kobe meat balls (<mark>Spaghetti and Meatballs</mark>, my favorite!) well, the portion was huge, and i guess it better be, considering the $34 it costs. even being the noodle whore that i am, i couldn't even finish half of it. i did manage to eat about two of the giant meatballs though, and they were good.\n\nmy friend had the veal parmigiano, and it too was good. covered in good melted cheese, and spicy marinara. \n\nwe also had the <mark>Crispy Fried Calamari</mark> as appetizer, and it was delicious. fried just right, with good spicy marinara. they also served us garlic bread, which was to die for, except some bites were overpowered with too much butter (what, such a thing?) and cheese. otherwise good. i would go back just for the bread (because i'm a bread whore too, remember?)\n\non to the club then. so because we ate at the restaurant, they wave the cover, and let you by pass the line. we went back to our rooms for a bit, and went back to the club at around 1. ha, line pass? no need, there was no line! anyway, we went in right away, through this maze of a path, and ended up god knows where, and it was just horrific. it was so small and crowded! also, i was about a foot shorter than everyone there, and i felt like a child (i'm 5'5\", btw, i should not be feeling like a child anywhere!)\n\nthe music was rap (probably my least favorite), the dance floor was so small and crowded, and i felt like i was suffocating! i think at one point the dj threw money into the crowd- let me specify, he threw dollar bills into the crowd. no way in hell i'm bending over to pick up a freakin dollar in such a crowded dance floor in a dress!", 
            "we went to lavo's nightclub our first night in vegas for something chill, and ate at the restaurant our last night to go out with a bang. \n\nwhat we got was something.. average. for all the hype and celeb appearances surrounding lavo i was expecting a unique party scene but it was more cookie cutter and mainstream than i'd hoped. like a really upscale cheesecake factory. hopefully that doesn't come off as bad as it sounds.\n\nwe might've gone on the wrong night for the club, seeing as how we wanted something chill but still fun. but it was too chill..  and quiet? the club isn't really condusive to dancing and the dj was just okay. but it's nice, in a dark but clean, pretty cocktail waitresses kind of way. maybe we were the sober ones but we ended up leaving after about an hour. \n\non our last night in vegas we wanted a celebatory girls' dinner so i made reservations at lavo ahead of time. now, the best part of lavo is obviously not the food. the food was okay. (my short ribs risotto tasted strongly of seafood. the spaghetti had a sauce so acidic i had heartburn the rest of the night. but the <mark>Crispy Fried Calamari</mark>... yes!!) it's the people watching and scene that lavo's known for. most of the crowd were in their 20's, but there were also a couple older folks.\n\none thing i loved about the restaurant was that it was a mixed crowd, and for a glitz and tits kind of place, i didn't feel uncomfortable and i doubt other people would either, given they know what to expect. there were couples in their 50's enjoying a romantic night out, a group of 15 doing the cha-cha (literally) around their table, groups in jeans and sneakers, and the staff is surprisingly unpretentious.\n\nlavo's a cool place and i think if you want that 'night out' vibe at dinner then it's worth going to at least once. but there isn't enough to make me want to run back.", 
            "date/time:  thursday - 9:30pm\noccasion:   dinner before madness\nparty of:  five\nordered:  beef carpaccio, <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark>, bleu cheese wedge salad, <mark>Crispy Fried Calamari</mark>, crispy <mark>Truffled French Fries</mark>, <mark>Penne Alla Vodka</mark> pasta, <mark>Fresh Whole Maine Lobster</mark>, strawberry short-cake dessert, and deep fried oreos.\ntotal incl gratuity: $?\n\nbefore starting the madness on industry night, we stopped by lavo for a fairly light dinner.  we ordered an array of different appetizers, entrees, and desserts.   the wait was lengthy and unfortunately, the food and service were only mediocre. considering the prices - averaging $20/appetizer and $30-$40/entrees, i think the food could have been a lot better.  i was more impressed with the appetizers than the actual entrees.  the beef carpaccio had nice flavor and was served with parmesan crisps, which was a nice touch.  the <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> is worth ordering.  fresh tuna with just the right pinch of citrus.  the pasta and lobster were both sub-par; they were both lacking in flavor.  nothing that was worth paying premium prices for.\n\nif you're big on desserts, try the deep-fried oreos. it sounds ridiculously fattening, and i'm sure they, however they are heavenly.  little warm oreos deep fried in batter and served with vanilla ice cream.  do i really need to say more?\n\noverall, lavo is convenient and a great comfortable setting for getting together with friends, although don't come here expecting a magical culinary experience.",

            "on our \"girls night out\", we came to lavo for dinner.  we weren't sure where to go for dinner, so jeff, from vip red carpet, suggested lavo and we werent disappointed.  its located at the palazzo, a short walk from the mirage.  the decor was pretty cool.  it was pretty dim inside, but i really liked their chandeliers and lighting.\n\nanywho, we started with 2 of the <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> and 1 caesar salad, which was more than enough to split amongst us 4 girls.  the caesar was pretty good, and the croutons were huge!  the <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> wasn't that great for me...maybe im just used to fusion, but i was expecting some kind of chip to go with it, and i didnt really like the lemony taste it had.\n\nnext, they brought out some amazing garlic bread that you can dip in marinara sauce...pretty yummy.  they also brought out a pitcher of saggio (kind of like a blueberry mojito)...they suggested the pitcher because it was cheaper than ordering individually...that probably lasted 1.5-2 rounds for us.  i really liked it...it was very light and summery. perfect for those hot summer vegas nights!\n\nfor my entree, i went with my favorite fish, the <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark> accompanied by a breaded/fried portobello. man was that good. i was a little upset that i was getting full and couldnt finish it.  it was cooked perfectly, and the sauce was great.  my friends ordered the grilled swordfish, the penne ala vodka, and the filet...no complaints from any of them.   keep in mind that you have to order trimmings and potatoes separately for $10 each.  i ordered the <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark>, and another friend ordered the <mark>Roasted Rosemary Potatoes</mark>.  its pretty huge, so you can probably split with the table.  i actually could've done without it, it was a little dry and i didnt want to waste whatever room was left in my tummy, on potatoes.\n\nlast, but definitely not least....dessert!!!  we ordered deep fried battered oreos with a side of milkshake to dip them into.  pure heaven!!! it was so good...now im starting to drool again...lol.\n\nthis is definitely a cool place to check out for dinner.  the outside patio has an awesome view of the strip.  the ambience is great, the staff was friendly and they offered a ton of great suggestions.  they also knew we were in kind of a rush, so they happily accomodated.  i would definitely go back again.", 
            "i think i've always had a negative attitude about lavo because it is associated with being a night club and located in a vegas casino.  those two factors alone always seem to always bring my expectation of food down.  lavo proved me wrong.  i was pleasantly surprised with the caliber of food and service at our recent outing as a big bachelorette party group.\n\nthe food:\ngarlic bread (compliementary) - super garlicky and butter and perfectly crispy.  just the way i like it\n\nmeatball - they have a choice of meatballs and i thought that it would be a few meatballs, but this was one huge tasty meatball on a bed of fresh greens and flavorful <mark>Meatball with Salad and Garlic Crostini</mark>\n\n<mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> - refreshing mix of chopped tuna and avocado.  not bad.\n\nkobe stuffed rice balls - aracini stuffed with kobe beef.  interesting, yummy and filling.\n\n<mark>New York Strip</mark> steak - we ordered medium because we were sharing family style.  actually cooked perfectly and delicious\n\nrigatoni sausage bolognese - the rigatoni itself was al dente.  nothing impressive about the sauce.  \n\n<mark>Spinach and Artichoke</mark> pizza - soggy pizza.  enough said.\n\n<mark>Crispy Zucchini</mark> - deep fried shoestring zucchini.  yum!!\n\n<mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark> - .... what garlic?\n\nservice:\nwas it me or were all the servers handsome male models?  the service was actually really attentive.  waters were filled, wine glasses never empty, napkins folded whenever we went off to the restroom.\n\nconclusion:  i would say that the restaurant offers a nice variety of crowd pleasers with some nice service and eye candy.  overall, 3.5 stars because the food was a mix of mediocre to very good food.  definitely not your momma's homemade italian, but good for a fun night out on the strip and you can get a view of treasure island's pirate show's fireworks if you're positioned towards window.", 
            "came here for drinks & appetizers with some friends and were treated extremely well by the staff, which all looked like models of course. it was sort of an odd hour, after gambling in palazzo, so the place wasn't too happening yet. ambient music was being mixed by an on-site dj so that was cool. we shared a few things... calamari (decent), <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> w/ avacado (refreshing), kobe meatball w/ <mark>Meatball with Sausage Ragu</mark> (amazing), & <mark>Spaghetti Carbonara</mark> (so creamy rich i had to drink something after each bite... but still excellent). great decor but what the real trip was the restroom sinks. my first though walking into the restrooms, \"damn, those are some tall urinals\" hahaha which were actually sinks  but shaped like some sort of rituallistic cyllinders. fyi: they're not motion sensored so stop waving your hands like an idiot and use the foot pedal!", 
            "went to dinner here a few weeks ago as part of a large group.\noverall experience left us all happy-- \nwaiter was friendly and engaging.\n<mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> and beef carpaccio were fresh and good-  the later was a first for a few in the group and they both were pleasantly surprised.\ni had the <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark>-- which was perfect.\ni shared the <mark>Sauteed Broccoli Rabe</mark> with a friend, and we both agreed that is had a strange flavor-- seasoning- although i can't pinpoint what it was, wasn't a fit for the broccoli.\nwe all decided to go for desert since the dinner had been decadent- why not top it off? right\ni don't remember what it was called- but i do know what it consisted of-- battered and fried oreo cookies and vanilla ice cream.\nit was one of those things that although you know you shouldn't be eating it-- it was worth every bite.", 
            "date/time:  thursday - 9:30pm\noccasion:   dinner before madness\nparty of:  five\nordered:  beef carpaccio, <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark>, bleu cheese wedge salad, <mark>Crispy Fried Calamari</mark>, crispy <mark>Truffled French Fries</mark>, <mark>Penne Alla Vodka</mark> pasta, <mark>Fresh Whole Maine Lobster</mark>, strawberry short-cake dessert, and deep fried oreos.\ntotal incl gratuity: $?\n\nbefore starting the madness on industry night, we stopped by lavo for a fairly light dinner.  we ordered an array of different appetizers, entrees, and desserts.   the wait was lengthy and unfortunately, the food and service were only mediocre. considering the prices - averaging $20/appetizer and $30-$40/entrees, i think the food could have been a lot better.  i was more impressed with the appetizers than the actual entrees.  the beef carpaccio had nice flavor and was served with parmesan crisps, which was a nice touch.  the <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> is worth ordering.  fresh tuna with just the right pinch of citrus.  the pasta and lobster were both sub-par; they were both lacking in flavor.  nothing that was worth paying premium prices for.\n\nif you're big on desserts, try the deep-fried oreos. it sounds ridiculously fattening, and i'm sure they, however they are heavenly.  little warm oreos deep fried in batter and served with vanilla ice cream.  do i really need to say more?\n\noverall, lavo is convenient and a great comfortable setting for getting together with friends, although don't come here expecting a magical culinary experience.", 
            "things i loved about this place....\n\ndecor\n<mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> and <mark>Crispy Fried Calamari</mark> appetizers\nspaghetti with kobe meatball dinner\nbanana bread brittle dessert\nhelpful/witty staff\nthe flowing wine\n\nthings i did not love about this place...\n\nnothing", 
            "enjoyed the food. i had the <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> for appetizer <mark>Spaghetti and Meatballs</mark> with a glass of \"the riddler\" for my entree. all were delicious.\nbefore we got any food or drink, a waiter tripped and dropped his serving tray on my shoulder. it startled me and it also bugged the crap out of me that he never apologized. my own server said she was sorry but he did not. usually when something like that happens the manager comes by to make sure you're ok, but here, nothing. i let my server know i was bothered by his lack of interest that he conked me on the shoulder but she didn't seem to really care that much. if i really wanted to get into it i could have gone to the manager but due to the fact that i was with a larger party and uninjured, i let it ride.\nthe music during dinner could have been more quiet; we had to shout.\nnightclub was fun, since we ate there, we could walk upstairs for free. dj was really good, and the vibe was fun. note: this is not a sit-down club. its very small by vegas standards, but it was still a great time!", 
            "went back to the club and the restaurant as well. the vip host \"robert c\" was very good, he hooked us up with a great dancefloor table next to some very pretty girls. that was a good night. i love this club, its all about having a good time unlike other clubs where its all about trying to show off how much money you can burn through in a night. music is always great, favorite is the dj vice sundays but the la freak friday party was fun as well. \n\nalso had dinner here. the kobe meatball was amazing. huge, ate it later, would want to try it <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark>...also loved the eggplant, fresh mozerella and rigatoni....al dente...the complimentary garlic bread and tomato sauce was awesome. the only complaint was on the <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> the olive on the side made it a little salty, but then again i'm not really big on <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> to begin with. service was really great, our waitress really was helpful.", 
            "we waited 45 mins for our table, even with our reservation. the restaurant was highly recommended, so we were disappointed with the wait. the hostess did offer us a free round of drinks to compensate. we had the pomegranate limonata, which was made well. the restaurant does have a nice ambience upon entering, but looks much bigger than it really is. they had a dj playing good music in the lounge area. once we were finally seated, the restaurant manager came over to apologize for the wait. luckily, the food was very good. we ordered <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark>, beef carpaccio, meatballs <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark>, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> & a 12 oz steak, which was more than enough to split among three people. service was great & attentive. bathrooms were clean, but a little dark inside. we were able to access the nightclub after eating.\n\nas for the nightclub, the music was horrible! it was rap all night. not r&b that you could dance to, but rap that you couldn't understand the words with disgusting lyrics. the dj did not know how to transition from one song to another. there was an older crowd there, so with it comes creeps. the comped drinks we had were not good on anything except beer and champagne. not what i pictured the party scene to be after eating at such a trendy restaurant.", 
            "on first meeting, our waiter thought we were rubes. (not sure why, since we were dressed well.) i politely nodded through the explanation of the menu (appetizers on the left, pizzas in the middle, entrees on the right) and we promptly ordered a bunch of small plates, sides, and 70-year-old tequila.\n\nwaiter's demeanor changed immediately.\n\ndespite having a sad, stale excuse for a garlic bread service, lavo was decent. i loved the dark, contemporary atmosphere. the food was good, but not fantastic. our offerings were sequenced and spaced nicely. \n\nmy favorite dish was actually the haricot verts with pine nuts, which were blanched, shocked, and sauteed in an obscene amount of garlic and butter, giving them a fiesty texture. the assertive, nutty vinaigrette with the <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> took a close second, but the dish had far too much avocado to call it a true win.\n\nin all, we left satisfied, but bemused.\n\ndon't underestimate your customers. we have as much of an opportunity to surprise you as you do to surprise us.", 
            "our server was fantastic, although his name escapes me at the moment (tall, very short hair). i complimented the manager on the entire experience. at fancier restaurants, i tend to notice that my boyfriend and i (both in our early-mid twenty's) do not get the same attention as the group of businessmen that are sitting at the table two down from us. i understand the stereotype, especially because younger people usually can't afford to eat out at places of this one's stature. however, this was definitely not the case here. \n\nour server greeted us right away and offered us cocktails, although we both only ordered water. he walked us through the menu, giving suggestions, explaining the food & specialty items and answering my  myriad of questions with patience and a smile.\n\nwe started with the <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> appetizer, which was out of this world. the tuna was fresh and the sauce complimented it perfectly. \n\ni had the minestrone soup after that, which was also good, but nothing extraordinary.\n\nfor dinner, i had the rock shrimp lemon zest risotto. and wow, my mouth still waters just thinking about it.\n\nmy boyfriend had the bone in filet. the flavor was unmatched. i've been to many a fancy steakhouses, but this was the best bone in filet i'd ever had. although it came out exactly as our server described it, there was no irritation when my boyfriend asked for it to be cooked a little bit more before we packed it to go.\n\noverall, everything was wonderful. i wish i didn't live quite so far away, or this would quickly become a weekly favorite."

            "this is my 6th time here and came with my family and fiance on our vegas trip to celebrate my father's 60th birthday. called a few weeks in advance to book a table, they ask you for a credit card to secure your reservation so be aware of that. requested a table outside and mentioned it was my daddy's 60th birthday.\nwe waited about 30 mins for the table (totally normal at this restaurant) for a table for 6 outside. they said they could seat us immediately inside but it was such a  gorgeous night we waited. we grabbed some drinks at the bar and yummy long bread sticks and stood outside and waited. once our buzzer rang we were seated at a great table with a view of the pirate show at ti. we ate late, around 11pm so we saw the last show of the night. quite loud so be prepared. the restaurant is one of the loudest restaurants (inside) in vegas - super fun. the food here is amazing! so tasty! to start we ordered:\nsun ripened tomato bufala mozzarella $19\n2 orders of the <mark>Eggplant Parmigiano</mark> (the server even warned us that they are huge but i told him we usually order 1 for my fiance and me when we come, they are that good!) you must order this $17\n<mark>Crispy Fried Calamari</mark> $17\n<mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark> $21\nthe men had beers and the ladies split this amazing white pinot grigio, i can't rem the name but it was so tasty and the price was really good!\nfor the mains we ordered:\norganic <mark>Mixed Green</mark> salad $16 \n<mark>Mixed Wild Mushrooms</mark> $11\n<mark>Chicken Parmigiano</mark> $29 (comes with a large side of pasta)\nfour cheese ravioli $24\nchicken & mushroom ravioli $27\nspinach & artichoke brick oven pizza $21\n\neverything was amazing. the only reason i am removing 1 star is because i reminded both the hostess and the server that it was my father's 60th birthday and nothing was done. not even a little candle. they must have forgotten, but i was quite disappointed with that part.\n\nwill return for the tasty food and environment.",

            "this review is gonna be all over the place cuz there's a restaurant, a club, and a lounge. the best thing about this place is the restaurant! too bad i was not more hungry so i could finish that fuckn meatball. that damn thing was the size of my head! i shared it with <mark>Spicy Lobster Bisque</mark> and veggie sides. everything was sooo good! some of the best i've had in vegas. all very rich tho (butter! cream! olive oil!) so very filling. it's best to wear a bubble dress :p just get wine with the food, there's no alcohol in their cocktails. shit is like kool-aid. they even come in a kool-aid pitcher if u want a pitcher. the service was awesome. we had like 10 waiters come up to us. apparently they all were clamoring to get us plates and water. we pretty much got asked twice for everything...ha ha. they were all good looking and fun so it was cool ;)\n\nclub is 2 stars. it looked too crowded on the main floor and the music was just regular cheesy dance music. u know, like miley cyrus. \n\nwe were gonna bounce but the first floor lounge had some bad ass hip hop. so i had to stay for just one song....and then ooooh one more! and then i ended up just staying period. only a handful of people were dancing here & thre but i dint give a fuck! music made me wanna *move*. wish people were groovin to it too tho...", 
            "good food, great atmosphere.  love the garlic bread, <mark>Spicy Lobster Bisque</mark> and kone stuffed rice balls.. our waiter was very pleasant. tiramisu was so so.  not really a family enviroment per se, but my 12 year old daughter loved it.", 
            "i came on a saturday night, and for once, i didn't actually look at yelp reviews beforehand so i didn't know what to expect. i just came because some friends of friends were all into this place. at first, i was like, wha?? entree = club admission? what kind of decent, respectable place does that? and my mind was confused as it did not match the flashy style of previously-mentioned friends of friends.\n\nso a bit reluctantly but also curious, i went. inside, i would describe the restaurant as dark and lusty. yes, i said lusty. this is vegas after all. anyway, we were able to sit in the front bar portion without a reservation which was nice since it was a last minute thing. \n\nthe menu items don't actually sound that appealing to be honest. rather plain, ho-hum descriptions. but when we ordered, my god, the portions were huge! i must've missed something about family style, but lordy, you could've fed a whole village of my ancestors. so of course, we ordered way too much food. but my favorite dish was the beet salad. i wish i lived closer to you, beet salad. i'd totally order you again and again. i also got a <mark>Spicy Lobster Bisque</mark> - too salty for me though, and a little creamier than i like. we had the risotto with short ribs which was sorta the oddity on the menu (one of these kids is doing his own thing). the waitress told us it wasn't ordered a lot, but i still wanted to try it. it was good, not the best. one of my friends loved it, but i probably wouldn't order it again. we got the meatball - tasty and the size of a softball. then there was a veal dish that i didn't try. but back to you, beet salad. you were the best beet salad ever. perfect balance of beets, goat cheese, greens, candied nuts, etc. \n\nso i was about to roll over from being so full, but i love dessert so i ordered the bread pudding. again, a huge portion shared by about 4 main people, and 4 supporting cast. it was yummm-my. a keeper. \n\nthen onto the club part and time to work off the billion calories just consumed. the waitress stamped our hands. we wandered around inside the palazzo a little, then headed back to lavo for the club portion. it was a little chaotic around the entrance/elevator, but the stamp allowed us to enter without waiting or paying. big plus. up the elevator, to the club. it's not very big, and all the tables are reserved with bottle service. annoying because as a girl, you just want to have a place where you can sit or put your purse, coat, etc. anyway, we danced but the place soon got very crowded, the dj was just alright, and again, the fact that you can't really sit anywhere around the dance floor was a negative. so we left to meet up with a friend who was at the circular bar in the palazzo casino. honestly i had just as much fun, probably more, in the casino bar. \n\nin the end, lavo's food was a pleasant surprise, i didn't care much for the club, and i'd consider going back but it wouldn't be my first choice. i did like the casino bar though. i'd go there :)", 
            "a friend and i decided to grab some quick appetizers after work because i was about to eat my shoe. i had heard the <mark>Spicy Lobster Bisque</mark> was very tasty at lavo and it just happened to be down the way from me...so off we went. \n\nmy friend was super boring and just had a crown and 7...i on the other hand went for broke (yet again) on the calorie meter.i started with one of their signature cocktails called the lavolini. it was a yummy and somewhat tart mixture of prosecco, st. germain (so good) and passion fruit puree. of course i ordered the soup which was bloody fantastic with a sherry mascarpone creme. very decadent and so yummy. next course was a kobe beef carpaccio with an arugula salad, pepper corns, parmesan and black truffle oil (you know i love all things black truffle). it was heaven...so flavorful and again very rich. \n\nsteven, the bartender, was lovely. he brought us out some garlic bread but i could only tackle one piece before i waved the white flag of surrender....but just for giggles i wanted to look at the dessert menu...and there i spot it....fried oreo zeppoles with a vanilla malt on the side. i dug deep inside myself and made some extra room in my tummy for this dessert gift from god. it was one of the best desserts that i have ever had. plus i ordered the noce dessert cocktail with nocello, godiva chocolate liqueur and vanilla vodka. perfect ending to a wonderful meal. my friend and i couldn't finish the oreos so we shared the wealth with the ladies next to us who were drooling over them. so fun when you meet new people. thank you lavo, steven and nicole...we will be back soon.", 
            "nice beautiful place. the food was okay.\nappetizers: calamari, beet salad, and <mark>Spicy Lobster Bisque</mark> - total recommend\nentrees: penne ala vodka and <mark>Penne Seafood Alfredo</mark> was under cook.", 
            "my husband and i took a post shopping/pre dinner stop at the bar here just to get a drink.  well that was what the plan was til the cocktail waitress reccomended a few snacks they had on their menu.  ok so i caved...i swear we were only getting drinks.\ni had these figs with amazing cheese in the middle just little gems of a treat a bit ackward to eat but the taste was sublime.  my husband upped the annity and got a lobster flatbread that was amazing.\nso now were full, well sort of, so we think we'll skip dinner but on our way out we stop to get reservations.  alas it was not to be (trendy place better make reservations way in advance) but not to be put off we come back a few hours later, with our friends, and squeeze into the bar.\nluckily we were offered the full menu because i found their tomato <mark>Spicy Lobster Bisque</mark> fra diablo.  i think we had other food too but after eating this soup who cares?  seriously if you never eat another thing again you must, must, must have this soup.  its smooth and just flavorful.  you taste the tomatoes as if you've just picked them from the garden its almost sweet enough to be a dessert, but in a good way not in a sugary way.  then there is a hint of pepper when you bite into the glistening morsels of lobster.  \ni'm salavating just thinking about it now.  all joking aside i'd go to las vegas just for this soup.", 
            "i ate at the restaurant and partied at the club. here's the scoop on both solidly 3-star establishments. \n\ndinner: meh. bring a sweater. \n\nthe restaurant is pretty enough aesthetically, but freezing! we were dressed to impress for the club later, and literally all had hypothermia before the second course. we had to go sit outside for an hour before bracing ourselves to re-enter for the club. and the food was just so-so. the portion sizes were really all over the place. some girls in our group ended up with 5 pounds of pasta in heavy meat sauce that could have fed all ten of us. i ordered the handmade ravioli special and received 6 dainty little sachets of ravioli in a dribble of sauce that left me wondering if there was a jimmy john's nearby. sure, the entrees themselves were alright. but they need to work on the portion size. the <mark>Spicy Lobster Bisque</mark> was impressive, the calamari was good. our server was attentive. our check came out to about $75 per person, pretty typical for a nicer vegas dinner spot. all that said, i probably won't be back. too many other options without portion and climate control issues and with lower prices. \n\nclub: some good parts, some bad. \n\ni was in a group of 10 girls for a bachelorette party. a promoter got us in without a line or cover and gave us a roped off table along the dance floor with a sweet platform to dance on behind it, as well as hidden cubbies for purses. and we drank for free until 1:30am. of all the various deals and line jumping and free booze the promoters threw at us that weekend, this was the best treatment anywhere. we were vips and didn't pay a cent all night except tipping the bartender and waitress. 5 stars for how we were treated. \n\nsadly, this is a 3-star club. the clientele was not the typical \"beautiful people\" group you see at nice vegas clubs. cramming all these folks into a tiny space didn't help, because i was smushed and stepped on quite a bit so perhaps i had less patience with my fellow club patrons. however, out of all ten of us, not a single girl talked to or danced with a single guy the entire time we were there. there was literally no one worth leaving our little roped off area for. once the free drinks ended, we peaced out. too many people in too small a space, mediocre music, and sub-par clientele. too many other clubs that do it better. no thanks.", 
            "<mark>Spicy Lobster Bisque</mark> was excellent. kobe meatball was huge <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark> cheese on top, very filling. the lobster ravioli was a little bit overrated because for $38 a plate you would think to be able to taste the lobster and the dungeness crab that was drizzled on top. the layer chocolate cake was huge, good for 4 people to share. it was very rich in flavor. our waiter casey was awesome. to drink i had the pomegranate lemonada it was to die for. i love the ambiance of the place.", 
            "decent service but horrible food! this was the only place we could get in on short notice around 10:30 on a monday night. the <mark>Spicy Lobster Bisque</mark> was inedible, the chopped louie salad was 90% onions, 9% <mark>Mixed Green</mark> and 1% lobster and shrimp and the <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was so so. reasonably priced for vegas but definitely not somewhere i would recommend. i'm not sure if it was the alcohol i consumed that night or the food at lavo (probably the food) but it did not sit well and violently came back up the way it went down the next morning. tmi, sorry.", 
            "ugh. as if i havent sung this place enough praises, here i am writing another review for it. so, second time in vegas for 4th of july vaca. brought a new group of girls to indulge with me and everything was just as delicious as i last left it. from the time they bring you the garlic bread and marinara, just lean back and unbuckle your belt/corsets to make room, cause everything is so effing delicious. apparently i fell into a trance and started licking the sauce off the table with my fingers. wow. moving on, i had my <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark> with a side of mushrooms, it was perfection as usual. others ordered a risotto, a <mark>Penne Seafood Alfredo</mark>, rave reviews on the texture and freshness for both, a marinara pizza, long classic flavorful, a <mark>Spicy Lobster Bisque</mark>, not my fave, they make theirs taste too gingery i find, but it does have big delish chunks of lobster. but let me bring it back because the mvp of our dinner was the calamari. again, wow, simples done right, nice and crisp tight batter and the meaty perfectly sized hoops, again dunking into that heavenly marinara. once again, i haven't made it as far as desert cause we're always so stuffed before entrees even come, portions are huge, plus the drinks are great, we always enjoy gummi bear shots, and sparkling selections. ugh, just so much winning to do here. service was kind and prompt as usual, last hear we had a really cool brunette guy who comped us some shots, this time we had a lady with a short blunt cut bob, she was very nice and cautious of bringing everything quickly for us, knowing that we had to go somewhere after, and she even comped a dish for a girl who felt the pasta in her alfredo was a little too hard, and brought out a recooked version out of courtesy. thats good service in my book, treat your customers like you truly want them to enjoy their food and experience at all costs, and that keeps us coming back. also, i have another lavo location here in ny that i've dined at before to get a fix for my favorites, but its just nowhere near as delish. they cook with extra love at this vegas location, totally worth flying out 5 hours for! sidenote, i'm disappointed to see they closed their nightclub part. had really good times there last year (retroactive shoutouts to the chocolate cutie who used to work there named noah ;-) now they just have a cocktail/hookah lounge, that was actually closed on the sunday we went so place was pretty quiet and chill. its all good, we had limos and bottles waiting elsewhere to turn up, this dinner was still worth all of our attention!", 
            "lavo is my fave place to dine in vegas! i love the kobe beef meatball, the creamy <mark>Spicy Lobster Bisque</mark> soup , the garlic bread w sauce, everything is so yummy!! quality of food is top notch! def go and eat any occasion!!! it's the best!!"

            "came here for drinks & appetizers with some friends and were treated extremely well by the staff, which all looked like models of course. it was sort of an odd hour, after gambling in palazzo, so the place wasn't too happening yet. ambient music was being mixed by an on-site dj so that was cool. we shared a few things... calamari (decent), <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> w/ avacado (refreshing), kobe meatball w/ <mark>Meatball with Sausage Ragu</mark> (amazing), & <mark>Spaghetti Carbonara</mark> (so creamy rich i had to drink something after each bite... but still excellent). great decor but what the real trip was the restroom sinks. my first though walking into the restrooms, \"damn, those are some tall urinals\" hahaha which were actually sinks  but shaped like some sort of rituallistic cyllinders. fyi: they're not motion sensored so stop waving your hands like an idiot and use the foot pedal!",

            "seems to be a theme in vegas lately. food is great, service was terrible.\n\nbriefly on the food: started off with the kobe beef <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark>. spectacular. had the rigatoni sausage bolognese and it was very good also. nothing on the menu really stood out to me as very interesting, but it all looked great. and while we didn't make it to dessert, we saw some of the options at the tables near us and they looked spectacular.\n\nnow on to the service: had a reservation for 10, seated by 10:30, meh. our server was friendly, so i'll give him that much. we ordered a bottle of wine which we then were informed they were out of. ordered a different bottle. when served, our glasses were overfilled and our server didn't leave the cork, both of which are pet peeves. whatever nbd.\n\nordered the meatball and were told water and garlic bread would be right out. water finally arrived when the meatball did but no garlic bread. i reminded our server about the bread and he told me \"oh i'm sorry, it comes fresh so it takes a while.\" well, our meatball i assume is made fresh and yet it not only has arrived but has been eaten. so i doubt the problem is that the garlic bread is custom made for us. i hate lame excuses from servers, just say you're sorry and get it.\n\nfinally our entree arrives, served by someone else. we eat for a bit and our server comes over to check on how things are. my wife reminds him again about he garlic bread. he runs off to get it, comes back a little while later, and tells us \"he made sure to get it himself for us.\" well, thanks so much for going out of your way like that buddy.\n\nwe finished dinner, dessert menus were dropped off. 10 minutes later he finally comes by again to check and see if we'd like dessert. easily the longest i've ever waited to be asked if i want dessert or coffee, it seriously felt like an eternity.\n\nanyway, as always in vegas, there are much better options around, and this isn't one of them.", 
            "i feel like a hillbilly!  this is my first time back to vegas after 8 yr. crazy!  \"wow it so big,ma \" and real purty. \n\nhow do i rate the restaurant on food service, location or decor? \nfood was average,  the wait for a table inside was an hour, the location and view on the hot patio was amazing but its 90\\u00b0 at night and too hot to eat.  the decor is supposed to be a turkish bath leading up to the club on the second floor. cool bar nice lounge.  i hear its a small intimate club but nice. \n\nbut wez here to eatz.  so, my friend lives here and says they're known for their balls.  huge meatballs! !! really with the heat we were full with that and the yummy garlic bread. it was a huge 4\" meatball with italian grown tomatos. its just large not that tasty. i prefer small and tasty cuz really size isn't everything.  then i had eggplant rigatoni. h'm whatever a little over salty a little dry and like most italian i feel i make better at home. prices are reasonable, <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark> $20. rigatoni $24.\n\nwaiter was nice.  the benefit of sitting outside was watching the cheesy. siren show at the ti. it seemed very similar to the pirate battle.   \n\nwe were too full to eat our food, so we asked them to box it. remember my friend lives here.  the buss boy not understanding, since he's esl, stacked our food and tossed it. we only had two bites literally.  so the waiter says sorry, it's tossed.  if you want to wait it'll be a while.  okay. we'll wait. i'm still drinking my champagne anyways. so they prepared both all over so he can have leftovers. ;) i thought it was funny. the waiter was cool about it. \nfood taste average, but overall experience adds an extra gold star.", 
            "review is for restaurant, not club.\n\nwe were seated a few minutes after our reservation, which wasn't too bad. the interior is very upscale, gorgeous, and loud. the dj was okay but not memorable. service was very good and very friendly.\n\nwhat we ordered-\nkobe beef meatballs and spaghetti: delicious. really great. the meatballs were soft and flavorful. sauce was thick and hearty. the <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark> really pushed it over the edge too. \nmargherita pizza: this was better than expected. nothing too great, but definitely good. my only complaint was that it had a lot of crust. so i hope you like crust if you order this. \n\ngarlic bread: complimentary. very garlicky and delicious, but a little too toasted. almost impossible to chew.\n\nwine: i ordered a glass of prosecco which was delicious. \n\ndessert: skipped it but menu looked good.\n\nmy only complaint: the tables are so close together that the waiters can barely move. they have obviously tried to make the most of the small space and it shows. i think they could stand to lose about 1/4 of the tables in the place in order to give patrons a fighting chance in case of fire or flood. ;)", 
            "one of my most favorite places to eat & pourty while in vegas!\n\ni went here last weekend with some gal pals and once again, such a delightful experience.  the food is soo delicious.  i tried to warn my friends that we would get full real fast, but they were starving and excited to eat.  first off, i am not a marinara fan, but the marinara sauce they bring out w/ the garlic bread is definitely the best i've ever had.  it is a great dipping sauce to an even more awesome garlic bread.  for appetizers we got some calamari, and a kobe meatball on top of a arugula <mark>Meatball with Salad and Garlic Crostini</mark>.  after this, we were already so pleased, satisfied, and pretty much full, yet we went forward w/ our entrees.  i got the special ravioli of the night, filled <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark> cheese, soo good.  the other gals got the shrimp scampi and <mark>Penne Seafood Alfredo</mark>.  both were also winners.  \n\nafter we stuffed our face til we just couldn't stuff it no more, we changed into our flats (it's vegas... heels in the club can only last you so long, and you don't want to walk barefoot on those streets either!) and went to the lavo lounge/club portion.  luckily, we were staying at the palazzo, so we were able to bypass the long line and get in para gratis.  the upstairs club  is pretty small, compared to the other ones on the strip, but it was still on and crackin'.  we danced a little, then went back downstairs to the lounge and kicked it outside and danced.  the outside patio is perfect cuz it is right on the strip, and you can watch the sirens show at ti.  it also helps that the weather was about 101 degrees, so it was a beautiful night.  so, we danced the night away outside, inside, upstairs etc.  great selection of music both upstairs and downstairs. \n\nlavo is just fabulous! great food, great service, great music, and possible celebrity sightings... (last time i saw robin leach & a playboy bunny).  definitely a must every time i am in vegas.", 
            "i don't know what lavo's nightclub is like, but based on three dining experiences here, i will keep coming back for the food. the latest outing was to take advantage of some attractive restaurant week offerings. \n\nwe chose patio dining this time, and i was surprised to see that my party of four were seated directly across from the ti show, which we actually saw while we dined. as far as the show is concerned, i liked it better in its earlier sea battle incarnation minus the sexy sirens. \n\nmanagement was much more rigid this year than last when during restaurant week they graciously substituted veal parmesan for chicken parmesan at no additional cost, and agreed to substitute alfredo sauce for marinara sauce to cover a pounded veal cutlet. even though i offered to pay an extra charge if required, the waitress apologetically reported that the manager said that absolutely no substitutions would be allowed on restaurant week menu selections, including changing a sauce. but the requested substitution of one sauce for another was permitted at no extra charge when my wife ordered the veal parmesan from the regular, higher priced menu. this technicality struck me as rather petty--especially since the requested accommodations were made during restaurant week 2010. but at least requested lemon aioli was provided gratis to go with the calamari, and service all night was otherwise excellent. \n\ncomplimentary buttery and crunchy baked garlic bread served with a very mellow marinara sauce was an excellent beginning. and, the blond rings of calamari were all soft, tender, and delicious, whether with just a few added drops of lemon, dipped in the marinara sauce, or dunked in the smooth lemon aioli. \n\na chopped \"louie\" salad served as a first course was probably miscast. this lovely dish was an entree in itself. featuring many pieces of cold shrimp and large hunks of chilled lobster, along with cherry tomatoes, zucchini, red pimento, black olives, celery, and pepperoncini all tossed in a light house vinaigrette dressing, it was a great salad. the salad was presented with an 18-inch cheese stick on top that extended well beyond both sides of the plate. this cheesy bread product was praiseworthy in its own right. \n\n<mark>Brick Oven Salmon Oreganato</mark>, prepared with seasoned breadcrumbs, lemon, white wine, sun-dried tomatoes, and garlic butter, was moist and flavorful. and, it rested atop moist but slightly crunchy julienned vegetables that included zucchini. this was one of the few restaurants i have been where diners are asked whether they would like their fish to be prepared \"medium\" or some other degree of doneness. i stuck to medium, and was happy with the result. \n\npounded veal covered generously with mozzarella cheese and alfredo sauce was also tender and light but a bit too salty. a fellow diner pronounced his <mark>Center Cut <mark>Bone-In Filet Mignon</mark></mark> and the bearnaise sauce that accompanied it \"good.\" the visibly pink inside of the meat was clearly cooked medium rare as ordered. and, glistening <mark>Roasted Rosemary Potatoes</mark> served in a skillet were moist, buttery, and fork tender. they were an excellent choice for a side. \n\ntwo premium desserts shared the stage to complete a memorable repast: tiramisu and strawberry cheese cake. the tiramisu was moist and creamy, and obviously made with mascarpone, chocolate, some alcoholic beverage, and some coffee flavoring. they were respectively marsala wine and espresso. the strawberry cheese cake was delicious but surprisingly light.  its crust was crumbly and tasty. \n\nboth desserts were pretty looking, as well. the bi-level tiramisu reminded me of a log cabin with its six edible lady finger logs glued together with mascarpone. and, the strawberry cheese cake featured white upper and lower layers of <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark> cheese, and a pink middle layer of strawberry cream. its top was adorned with bright red strawberry sauce and three strawberry slices, and resting beside this delectable dessert was a high mound of whipped cream and more oozing strawberry sauce. \n\nit was a great meal, but i dread getting on the scale in the morning!", 
            "<mark>Spicy Lobster Bisque</mark> was excellent. kobe meatball was huge <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark> cheese on top, very filling. the lobster ravioli was a little bit overrated because for $38 a plate you would think to be able to taste the lobster and the dungeness crab that was drizzled on top. the layer chocolate cake was huge, good for 4 people to share. it was very rich in flavor. our waiter casey was awesome. to drink i had the pomegranate lemonada it was to die for. i love the ambiance of the place.",

            "had a really good experience on a wednesday night at both the restaurant and the club. \n\nit was a nice night, so we sat on the patio which is a very nice spot.  has the potential to get crowded quickly.  started off with the <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark>. ive definitely had better kobe meat balls (sorellina in boston). if i eat there again, i will not order the meat ball. i had <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark> and it was a very good dish with very bright flavors and cooked perfectly. our server was excellent. i believe his name was arthur.   this is not my favorite place in vegas but it was an overall good experience. \n\nmy biggest gripe was how much hell the staff gives you about going up to the night club after you've paid vegas prices to eat there. the bouncers are the worst, unnecessarily rude and on some stupid power trip.  once in the club, we found a good spot right at the bar, closest to the dance floor.  this is a very small club, but they were playing awesome music.", 
            "went back to the club and the restaurant as well. the vip host \"robert c\" was very good, he hooked us up with a great dancefloor table next to some very pretty girls. that was a good night. i love this club, its all about having a good time unlike other clubs where its all about trying to show off how much money you can burn through in a night. music is always great, favorite is the dj vice sundays but the la freak friday party was fun as well. \n\nalso had dinner here. the kobe meatball was amazing. huge, ate it later, would want to try it <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark>...also loved the eggplant, fresh mozerella and rigatoni....al dente...the complimentary garlic bread and tomato sauce was awesome. the only complaint was on the <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> the olive on the side made it a little salty, but then again i'm not really big on <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> to begin with. service was really great, our waitress really was helpful.", 
            "this review is solely based on my experience with the restaurant. \n\ni had the <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark> cheese and it was absolutely heaven and i had some calamari which was super delicious. \n\nfor dinner, i had the filet with the chimichurri sauce and spinach which went above and beyond my expectations. also, the salmon is spectacular and the fried oreos are a must. i was extremely pleased with this meal and pleasantly surprised to see how well priced things were-- especially compared to other restaurants in vegas that don't come close favor-wise. \n\ni'm giving it 5 stars because the food was delicious and our waiter was so nice and patient with our rather large party. i will definitely be coming back here any time i'm in vegas.", 
            "i literally licked my plate. yes i was a wee bit intoxicated but it was 100% justified.\n\nmy boss and his wife raved about how freaking amazing their kobe meatballs are. i prepared myself for potential over hype, but they lived up to all expectations.\n\ngoing a step back, we arrived on time for our 8pm reservation and had to wait as the place was super busy with it being the last night of ces. a slight nudge and the management did what every restaurant should do, they bought us a round of drinks. just as we were going to sweet talk our way into a 2nd round, our table was ready.\n\nthis place is sexy, though due to ces the male:female ratio was skewed to sausage. it is at this point that my boss taught me a life lesson. rather than deal with the back and forth after asking 'what does everyone feel like eating?', simply tell your server to pick their favourites for you. now this is assuming the server isn't useless. \n\nas i forget the sequence of arrival, here we go:\n\ngreen salad - helped with carb guilt\ncalamari - perfectly cooked, well spiced\na-5 kobe <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark> - what transpired in my mouth was a little intimate. wow^2.\n<mark>Rigatoni Melanzana</mark> - it had a generous dollop of buffalo mozzarella. enough said.\n<mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark> - delicate, butter ocean joy.\n<mark>Bone-In Rib Eye</mark> with a side of garlic herb butter - juicy, tofu-tender, carnivore heaven. i chewed the meat on the bone with pride.\ndeep fried oreos - i thought my boss was joking ordering such a thing at this kind of place, but he insisted. dipped in gelato, they were magical enough for me to lick my plate clean.\n\ni shall return. tongue out.", 
            "we waited 45 mins for our table, even with our reservation. the restaurant was highly recommended, so we were disappointed with the wait. the hostess did offer us a free round of drinks to compensate. we had the pomegranate limonata, which was made well. the restaurant does have a nice ambience upon entering, but looks much bigger than it really is. they had a dj playing good music in the lounge area. once we were finally seated, the restaurant manager came over to apologize for the wait. luckily, the food was very good. we ordered <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark>, beef carpaccio, meatballs <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark>, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> & a 12 oz steak, which was more than enough to split among three people. service was great & attentive. bathrooms were clean, but a little dark inside. we were able to access the nightclub after eating.\n\nas for the nightclub, the music was horrible! it was rap all night. not r&b that you could dance to, but rap that you couldn't understand the words with disgusting lyrics. the dj did not know how to transition from one song to another. there was an older crowd there, so with it comes creeps. the comped drinks we had were not good on anything except beer and champagne. not what i pictured the party scene to be after eating at such a trendy restaurant.", 
            "so when they say they have the best meatballs, they're not kidding.  not only was the meatballs <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark> delicious (and the size of a grapefruit), it was great to share.  we split a number of dishes, beet salad, minestrone soup, kobe beef meatballs with spaghetti and chicken parmigana.  minestrone soup was the only thing that was mediocre.  the rest was delicious.  waiter pushed us to order oreo beignets, tasted like an oreo funnel cake.  the sinks are really awesome.  night club was cool, but nothing insane", 
            "this is my 6th time here and came with my family and fiance on our vegas trip to celebrate my father's 60th birthday. called a few weeks in advance to book a table, they ask you for a credit card to secure your reservation so be aware of that. requested a table outside and mentioned it was my daddy's 60th birthday.\nwe waited about 30 mins for the table (totally normal at this restaurant) for a table for 6 outside. they said they could seat us immediately inside but it was such a  gorgeous night we waited. we grabbed some drinks at the bar and yummy long bread sticks and stood outside and waited. once our buzzer rang we were seated at a great table with a view of the pirate show at ti. we ate late, around 11pm so we saw the last show of the night. quite loud so be prepared. the restaurant is one of the loudest restaurants (inside) in vegas - super fun. the food here is amazing! so tasty! to start we ordered:\nsun ripened tomato bufala mozzarella $19\n2 orders of the <mark>Eggplant Parmigiano</mark> (the server even warned us that they are huge but i told him we usually order 1 for my fiance and me when we come, they are that good!) you must order this $17\n<mark>Crispy Fried Calamari</mark> $17\n<mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark> $21\nthe men had beers and the ladies split this amazing white pinot grigio, i can't rem the name but it was so tasty and the price was really good!\nfor the mains we ordered:\norganic <mark>Mixed Green</mark> salad $16 \n<mark>Mixed Wild Mushrooms</mark> $11\n<mark>Chicken Parmigiano</mark> $29 (comes with a large side of pasta)\nfour cheese ravioli $24\nchicken & mushroom ravioli $27\nspinach & artichoke brick oven pizza $21\n\neverything was amazing. the only reason i am removing 1 star is because i reminded both the hostess and the server that it was my father's 60th birthday and nothing was done. not even a little candle. they must have forgotten, but i was quite disappointed with that part.\n\nwill return for the tasty food and environment.", 
            "lavo should be known for their meatballs and panna cotta cheesecake!!\n\n*this review is for the restaurant only*\n\nafter hearing that lavo had the best meatballs in town and good food overall, i just had to go and try it for myself. we came here with my good friends from hawaii. i made reservations on a week night when there was no special event going on at the nightclub, hoping it would be less crowded.\n\nat first, service was good. we had 3 different servers who said that they would all be helping us. however, after our drinks were delivered, we got stuck with one server, who was kind of an airhead. i'll be nice and not mention her name, but this is how it went down. we were all obviously ready to order because our menus were closed and stacked nicely on one corner of the table.\nserver: \"are you all ready to order, or do we need a few more minutes?\"\nus: \"we're ready.\"\nserver: \"i'll give you a few more minutes.\"\nus: \"umm, we just said we were ready.\"\nserver: \"oh ok, go ahead.\"\nthen later that night....\nserver: \"are you still working on this or do you want me to take the plate out of your way?\"\nmy friend: \"still working on it.\"\nserver: *reaches out to grab the plate*\nmy friend:\" no, i am still working on it!\"\nserver: \"oh, ok.\"\ngeeez, she had serious issues! also note that we ate here right after they opened, so the place wasn't crazy loud at the time. if she's deaf, she shouldn't be a server. she really needs to get her act together! horrible!\n\nanyway, the food was awesome and we all enjoyed our dinner. we ordered the <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark>. good thing we split it between the 4 of us because it was huge! very flavorful and melted in my mouth! i wanted more, so i ordered the spaghetti with kobe meatballs. my husband ordered the <mark>New York Strip</mark> steak and said it was one of the best steaks he ever had. now i know what to order next time! our friends ordered the <mark>Chicken Parmigiano</mark> (also huge) and some other pasta dish. and now for the best part, dessert!! thanks to my friends, i am now addicted to the panna cotta cheesecake! i don't know how to explain it, except to say that is was a big delicious slice of heavenly, creamy berry goodness! sometimes cheesecakes can be too rich, but this one was light and not overly sweet. slices are big enough for 2 people to share, but i honestly think i could eat the entire thing on my own. i would seriously do a take out order, just for the cheesecake!\n\ndefinitely looking forward to coming back and trying other items on the menu. hopefully, service will be better next time!", 
            "really good food and service!\n\n(this review is for the restaurant only.)\n\nwe rarely venture out of the cosmo or encore for food when in vegas, but we had some friends staying at the palazzo this go around so we decided to give a new restaurant a try.  we decided on lavo due to its location and becuase it seemed to have a cool vibe.\n\nhalf of our party arrived fairly late, but the restaurant was very polite about it.  we hung out at the bar and watched the hawks lose to the bruins.  the bartender was nice and friendly as were the other patrons at the bar.  i didn't check out the bar too much as i was too caught up in the game so can't really comment on that portion of my visit.\n\nthe remainder of our party finally arrived and we were seated at a nice round table in the middle of the restaurant.  we had awesome views of the entire place...including the upstairs area which i assume is used for the nightclub (???).  our waiter, scott r., was super nice and funny...cracking jokes with us the whole night.\n\nour table ordered the <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark>, calamari, mixed salad, carbonara, 8oz filet, 3 peas risotto, spaghetti with meatballs, <mark>Mixed Wild Mushrooms</mark>, and the 20 layer cake.  everything was delicious!  the portions were huge so everyone kind of just shared everything.  \n\nwe got the check and i and my husband decided to pick the bill up for the table to say thanks to our friends.  i am in charge of payments and tips in our house so when i looked at the bill and saw $354.20 for 6 people i was thinking we had gotten off cheap (that's like $59.00 per person with drinks and coffees, espressos, etc.).  we had a great time and thought scott r. was awesome...so we left him an appropriate tip.  as we were leaving, scott r.  came over and stopped my husband and told him that a 20% gratuity was included in the $354.20 total and that he did not have to leave an additional tip (i apparently missed that on the check...doh!).  my husband was blown away by his honesty and decided to leave him a small portion of the additional tip we had intended on giving.  so...that means our check was even less that i had thought...great food at a decent price...in vegas...what???\n\nso, in summary...the food is good, service is amazing, servers are honest, and the food is decently priced.  we will definitely be returning to lavo...perhaps to even check out the nightclub.", 
            "hmm, the first time i came here to eat, i was very disappointed and did not enjoy my meal at all!  the food was bland and did not entice my taste buds.  now the second time i came here, i came with my friend who was visiting vegas for the weekend.  it was a late meal and we were both hungry!  haha.  walking around the strip, the restaurant lavo caught my friend's eye and we looked at the menu and she wanted to dine there.  i was a bit hesitant, but since she was the guest, i complied and asked for a seat for two for dinner.  \n\nas we got the menu, we were trying to decide what to order.  we ended up decided to order family style.  this mean, 2 friends, 5 dishes, ranging from salad, appetizers, a main entree, and including dessert!  we ordered their famous meat ball <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark> cheese, the truffle fries, a lobster scampi pizza, and a fish dish with a delicious crouton salad that i forgot the name of!  \n\nthe meatball was actually really good!  i can see why everyone talks about it!  it is one full pound of wagyu beef (very tender beef)  cooked with lots of flavors and topped with marinara sauce and ricotta cheese.  eating it by itself was a bit too salty, so i paired it with their complimentary garlic bread.  both of use only had 1/4 of the ball since we wanted to try everything else.  \n\nwhen the truffle fries came out, it was delicious!  now this is how fries are suppose to be!  semi burnt! ;-)  hahaha.  i loved burnt potatoes!  not of those light gold colored fries you get at mcd's, but the dark brown, crispy fries that has been in the fryer longer than it was suppose to be!  hahahaha.  topped with parmasean cheese and truffle oil, my mouth was dancing in joy with each bit!  \n\nnext up, the lobster scampi pizza and the fish dish (which was not memorable besides the crouton salad it came with).  now lobster scampi on top of a flat bread pizza...need i say more?  it was delicious!  no complaints there!  \n\nas for the fish dish, it was okay...but the croutons side dish was so good!  i swear what they did was cubed bread, deep fried it to a crisp, tossed it was cucumbers and tomato and served it!  simple yet amazing!  \n\nlast but not least...dessert....not i know lavo is known for their deep fried oreos...but after hearing about its texture, i was not appeased to even try it!  the waiter basically told us it tasted like oreo dough...in my mind (oreo soaked in oil)  ouch...heart attack!  so instead, we chose to order the toasted marshmellow 7 layer rolled cake....such a great decision because it was what we both were craving!  it was a thin layer of chocolate cake, rolled with a vanilla type of cream and covered with chocolate ganache.  very sweet, but perfect ending to such a delicious meal!  \n\nnow i wasn't impressed with my first experience here, and after giving it a second chance, lavo has won my taste buds!  i'd recommend my friends to come here, so you should come and try it too! =)", 
            "i came here last friday for dinner (see public house review).  i'm local, and this was my 2nd visit in 5 yrs or so.\natmosphere- just the way i like, dark, rich and great d\\u00e9cor.  we were 'walk-ins' around 7pm or so.  hostess did not 'insult' when we said we did not have reservations. we were seated at at 2-top in about 10-15 min. no bad. but 2-top so close to next 2-top we almost had \"dinner guests\". we had a glass candle holder-nice, two glasses of water along with salt/pepper...i asked the waitress \"where are we going to put our plates, and salads on this tiny table?\"  note to self: never again.\nfood- (my guy and i usually share because we don't like to take food home). i told our waitress we planned to share and would need extra plates.  she was very kind and upbeat.  we enjoyed the garlic bread with marinara sauce --complimentary.\nour order: wedge salad, eggplant appetizer and of course one of their famous  'meat balls'  ($22), we both had a glass of zin.  what a pleasant surprise- the waitress had our salad divided before serving.  this was the largest wedge salad i have ever seen.  i am sure the price was high, i don't remember- but i was impressed... and the taste was also great.  here came the 'meatball' (we ordered the one <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark> on top and it looked like a mtn of whipped cream)  yummm is all i can say! and this 'ball' is big enough to share with 4 if needed.   now to the eggplant, our waitress said it was her 'favorite', but 'heavy'.  she explained the eggplant is sliced lengthwise in very,very thin sheets and layered like lasagna.  this was delicious, but a meal for 2 hungry or 4 to taste and enjoy--yes very filling and i had to take home and gave to my daughter.  so, with that said, the salad and meatball would be perfect for two.\nservice- great.\nnoise- noise and, oh i almost forgot-noise- this place was the loudest with yelling people trying to talk over each other that i've been in for longer than i can remember.  the music in background, ok, the yelling, crazy.  our 'almost dinner guest' next to us actually screamed to get some friends passing by to see them- this scream right into my ear, i actually jumped.  the friends then huddled around our teenie table and one actually used my guy's chair back to lean on all during their over 5 minute visit.  yep they were going to 'old town' and yep they would meet up later and yep they reviewed their food ya-da-ya-da. this, not the fault of lavo, just rude people.\nprice- \"vegas gourmet\"...you got it... $$$   that's a mea-ta-ball!", 
            "great strip views on the patio - you will really feel the vegas vibe . pretty expensive - huge and amazing meatballs <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark> - great club to dance !", 
            "i can only speak to my restaurant experiences as i haven't yet taken part in the night club experience (and probably never will).  \n\nthe food on each of my last two visits was terrific. my wife enjoyed the kobe <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark> cheese and i usually lean towards the chicken parm, both of which were delicious. \n\nthe service was a whole different story. it was so bad that it takes what should be a 5 star rating down to what should be less than a \"2\".  \n\nafter checking in for our reservation, we opted to take a seat at the bar and have a drink before dinner (this was mistake #1). we alerted the hostess to this and she said no-problem. we were then greeted by the slowest bar tender on the planet, who struggled to tend to ourselves and 2 other customers she had at her bar (it was early in the evening and the place was nearly empty). after walking past us at least 3 times, she finally decided to stop. seeing the disgust in my face, i immediately detected a bit of an attitude from the gal, when she asked if we needed a drink menu. a while later, another male employee hands us a drink menu. the bar isn't that big - how difficult is it to locate a drink menu? the bartender eventually returns to take our drink order, with my wife getting a glass of pinot and i asked for a coors light. i was immediately told they don't have coors light (yet the palazzo bar across the lobby does). in fact, you can get a coors at darn near any bar in the venetian or palazzo....except at lavo. i thought to myself, \"this is the lavo at the palazzo and they can't walk a few feet for the overpriced beer i requested .... really? the cocktail waitresses throughout the casino can walk hundreds of yards for a customer's free beer and a lousy tip .... but god forbid the staff at lavo walk a few feet for the customer actually paying for their beer.\n\nwe return to the attractive (but not so bright) hostess who greeted us earlier, asking to be seated. she immediately grabs my wife's pinot and pours it into a plastic cup, saying \"you can't leave with the glass\". i point out to her that we're not leaving, instead, asking to be seated at our table. she then catches on to her goof and seats us. \n\non to dinner. again food was terrific but service was marginal. i ordered a <mark>Sea Salt Baked Potato</mark> with my dinner, which arrived with my meal. i asked for 2 portions of butter as i wasn't interested in their spicy butter concoction. the waiter breaks open my potato in such grand fashion and said he'd return with my butter. roughly 10-15 minutes later, our waiter returns and asks if we needed anything. i responded, stating \"yes, the butter i asked for earlier\". realizing his mistake, he hurried off. a few minutes later, i see him at another table taking drink orders. really, my potato is colder than my ice water and he's taking drink orders? eventually, he returns with a rock hard piece of butter (looked like a bar of soap), which never melts on my potato. i didn't eat it as i wanted him and hopefully the manager to see the state of the potato with un-melted butter. \n\nthe bill arrives and the waiter indicates that the $11 potato was removed by his manager, the same manager who was too busy to walk about the restaurant and check on customers??? low class joint. \n\nthe food is very good but the staff and the service they provide was far from venetian or palazzo standards. they should hire fewer \"pretty\" people and more \"skilled\" service professionals. they tout the place as \"fine dining\" but i've gotten 10x better service from the grand lux caf\\u00e9 and the coffee bean in the hotel.\n\nnever returning.", 
            "went here last wednesday.   i ordered what i was told a popular items: kobe <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark>.  i also age chicken parmesan with a dice of pene pasta.  for desert their oreo malt.  i spit all of this with a friend.  thr meatball was so salty we both could not eat it.  the server could have cared less when he asked why we did not eat it.  the chicken was bl<mark>Spaghetti Fresh Tomato and Basil</mark>.  finally the malt.  my fault here because i guess i did not read the menu clearly because was mini size with a plate of deep fried oreos.  i thought it was just a oreo malt. \n\nall in all i will never go back.  too many othet choices in vegas with much better food.", 
            "best. meatballs. ever.  nuff said.\n\nokay, i'll say more. seriously this place was amazing. i'm getting hungry again just thinking about how great our meal was. we were in vegas during restaurant week and 4 out of the 5 of us ordered off the pre-fixe menu. we shared one of the kobe beef meatballs <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark> and tomato sauce to start. this was amazing!! served in a mini cast-iron skillet and served piping hot. gah. amazing. we were also served fresh garlic bread, right out of the oven. one of the best starts to a meal i've probably ever had. we also had a bottle of malbec which really set off all the rich dishes. \n\nfor my pre fixe menu, i had the arancini, penne ala vodka, and strawberry shortcake. unfortunately the rest of the meal didn't quite live up the start, but everything was still fantastic. arancini was soft and fluffly, and penne had a great vodka sauce (penne was a little al dente in my opinion). i only had a couple bites of my dessert since i was so full at that point, but that was also wonderful. \n\nservice was absolutely fantastic. we had several different waiters buzzing around us throughout the course of the meal clearing plates, filling water, and checking on us. our server was super friendly and outgoing- even bumped my mom out of the bad mood she was in. wonderful italian on the strip!", 
            "meatballs!! that's all you gotta know about lavo (the restaurant) \n\nstaying at the palazzo means having an array or restaurants to choose from. my friend and i wanted something convenient, italian, with outdoor seating availability. we chose lavo. \n\nwe actually took quite a bit of time looking over the menu; having trouble deciding on a pasta dish, meatballs, or a signature dish.  our eyes were definitely bigger than our appetites. after having decided on an order of kobe meatballs <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark>, salmon oreganto, and the chicken and mushroom ravioli, we quickly had a change of heart.  the waiter gave us fair warning that the first two dishes would be sufficient, and boy was he right.  we cancelled the ravioli and ordered: \n\nkobe meatballs <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark> ($22): holy meatball.. this thing was ginormous! the waiter wasn't kidding around, this could easily serve 3-4 people; especially after serving us the complimentary garlic bread. the meatball was juicy and tender, although a bit salty for my taste (i am very senstiive to salty foods) but to anybody else i'm sure it's just the right amount of salty.  perfect when paired with the garlic bread.  definitely something i would come back for in the future. hell, i'd even come, sit at the bar and order just the meatball.\n\n<mark>Brick Oven Salmon Oreganato</mark> ($29): this too was a bit on the saltier side. we honestly probably could have done without this had we known the garlic bread would be so filling.  the fish was pretty good, not too dry and very flavorful.  the cucumber nestled underneath the salmon helped balance the saltiness of the fish and was very refreshing.  \n\n20 layer peanut butter chocolate cake ($13):  this was quite a hefty-sized cake.  pretty good bang for your buck if you're sharing among 4+ people.  between the two of us, we barely made a dent.  it tasted like a peanut butter cup... and i love peanut  butter cups.  i will say, i am not a fan of the chocolate shavings they put on the outside of the cake.. too crunchy and adds to the already over-sweet taste of the dessert.", 
            "while my most recent dining experience at lavo was not as stunning as before, i and my party enjoyed an excellent meal.  as an opener, <mark>Baked Clams Oreganato</mark> yielded very garlicky clams but they were accompanied in their shells by a very tasty sauce.  and, the buttery garlic bread that came with the meal was so good that i sought and received another loaf--and, after its arrival, polished off most of it myself.  a caesar salad was an excellent caesar, with unusual pesto croutons and requested anchovies.\n\nthis time for my chosen entree i went more rustic, and, opting for some fine peasant cuisine, ordered spaghetti with kobe meatballs, which featured large meaty balls, a superior thick tomato-based sauce, and <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark> and parmigiano cheese.  the dish was quite satisfying, as was a side of <mark>Roasted Rosemary Potatoes</mark>.  diane also enjoyed her well-pounded veal parm.\n\nservice was excellent and attentive.  the only discordant note was really the too loud driving music played nonstop by the dj.  it did not harmonize well with digesting food or trying to carry on a conversation with one's spouse and friends across a dining table.   \n\nloss of a half-step, and so a half-star, this outing.  a 4-1/2-star experience overall!", 
            "i recently spent five righteous days at the palazzo hotel in las vegas between christmas and new year's eve. on the 1st night, i was hanging out with my family at the 'imperial bar', a suggestion was made to go check out 'lavo'. we walked in and was seated readily by the highly courteous waitstaff. we ordered a massive <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark> cheese,  a 4-cheese pizza, and some soup - we just wanted to keep it simple for this initial visit. while we were waiting, we were given garlic bread with marinara sauce to nibble upon while waiting for the sumptuous meal to come. during our wait, one of the managers came over and spent a few minutes to greet us, his name was francis and he recommended that we head over to 'tao' nightclub over at the venetian hotel. the food arrived and at the first taste i can honestly say this is some of the absolute best italian fare that i have had in several years. \n\nwe feasted heartily and then expeditiously trekked over to 'tao' and saw multitudes of folks trying to get in, only to be consistently shot down in their attempts by gain entry by a platoon of bouncers who were keeping them at bay with great ease - considering this scene, it did not seem possible that we would gain entry. we ended up being given access in less than 4 minutes just at the mention of francis's name - what we experienced inside can only be described as a scene that one would only see in a movie - it was spectacular!!! what a wild conclusion to a most flavorful evening!!! \n\nwe made a 2nd visit to 'lavo' prior to flying out of vegas, and the ambience along with the food was superior, as it was the first time! i cannot say enough about the customer service they provided, the waitstaff delivers excellence with a smile every time!!\n\nwhen i return to las vegas, i will be going back to 'lavo' as the 1st stop on my list. it was excellent experience that i would recommend to anyone looking for outstanding italian food in las vegas !!!!", 
            "delicious dinner! the wagyu <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark>  is a must order hands down. veal chop and <mark>Penne Seafood Alfredo</mark> were great. fried oreos even if your stuffed, get it. staff was friendly our sever had a great personality they have a paddle they spank you with for your birthday that was different/fun. family had a great time will be back!", 
            "we went off the other reviews and ordered the <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark> and it was excellent!  also ordered the <mark>Spaghetti and Meatballs</mark> and the fried oreos.  all of the food was very good.  i like to add salt to my food and they did not have any on the table.  i felt the spaghetti sauce could have used a little.  the atmosphere was very nice.  we were in and out of there pretty quick.  could have enjoyed a little longer with a bottle of wine."

            "i think i've always had a negative attitude about lavo because it is associated with being a night club and located in a vegas casino.  those two factors alone always seem to always bring my expectation of food down.  lavo proved me wrong.  i was pleasantly surprised with the caliber of food and service at our recent outing as a big bachelorette party group.\n\nthe food:\ngarlic bread (compliementary) - super garlicky and butter and perfectly crispy.  just the way i like it\n\nmeatball - they have a choice of meatballs and i thought that it would be a few meatballs, but this was one huge tasty meatball on a bed of fresh greens and flavorful <mark>Meatball with Salad and Garlic Crostini</mark>\n\n<mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> - refreshing mix of chopped tuna and avocado.  not bad.\n\nkobe stuffed rice balls - aracini stuffed with kobe beef.  interesting, yummy and filling.\n\n<mark>New York Strip</mark> steak - we ordered medium because we were sharing family style.  actually cooked perfectly and delicious\n\nrigatoni sausage bolognese - the rigatoni itself was al dente.  nothing impressive about the sauce.  \n\n<mark>Spinach and Artichoke</mark> pizza - soggy pizza.  enough said.\n\n<mark>Crispy Zucchini</mark> - deep fried shoestring zucchini.  yum!!\n\n<mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark> - .... what garlic?\n\nservice:\nwas it me or were all the servers handsome male models?  the service was actually really attentive.  waters were filled, wine glasses never empty, napkins folded whenever we went off to the restroom.\n\nconclusion:  i would say that the restaurant offers a nice variety of crowd pleasers with some nice service and eye candy.  overall, 3.5 stars because the food was a mix of mediocre to very good food.  definitely not your momma's homemade italian, but good for a fun night out on the strip and you can get a view of treasure island's pirate show's fireworks if you're positioned towards window.", 
            "one of my most favorite places to eat & pourty while in vegas!\n\ni went here last weekend with some gal pals and once again, such a delightful experience.  the food is soo delicious.  i tried to warn my friends that we would get full real fast, but they were starving and excited to eat.  first off, i am not a marinara fan, but the marinara sauce they bring out w/ the garlic bread is definitely the best i've ever had.  it is a great dipping sauce to an even more awesome garlic bread.  for appetizers we got some calamari, and a kobe meatball on top of a arugula <mark>Meatball with Salad and Garlic Crostini</mark>.  after this, we were already so pleased, satisfied, and pretty much full, yet we went forward w/ our entrees.  i got the special ravioli of the night, filled <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark> cheese, soo good.  the other gals got the shrimp scampi and <mark>Penne Seafood Alfredo</mark>.  both were also winners.  \n\nafter we stuffed our face til we just couldn't stuff it no more, we changed into our flats (it's vegas... heels in the club can only last you so long, and you don't want to walk barefoot on those streets either!) and went to the lavo lounge/club portion.  luckily, we were staying at the palazzo, so we were able to bypass the long line and get in para gratis.  the upstairs club  is pretty small, compared to the other ones on the strip, but it was still on and crackin'.  we danced a little, then went back downstairs to the lounge and kicked it outside and danced.  the outside patio is perfect cuz it is right on the strip, and you can watch the sirens show at ti.  it also helps that the weather was about 101 degrees, so it was a beautiful night.  so, we danced the night away outside, inside, upstairs etc.  great selection of music both upstairs and downstairs. \n\nlavo is just fabulous! great food, great service, great music, and possible celebrity sightings... (last time i saw robin leach & a playboy bunny).  definitely a must every time i am in vegas."

            "my sister and i ate dinner at lavo on saturday night. we had 7:15 pm reservations and even though it was a tad early to eat by vegas standards, the restaurant was pretty full. the tables for two are a little close together, but you still feel as if you have your own space and i really didn't overhear either of our neighbor's conversations.\n\nour meal started with two glasses of sauvignon blanc and complimentary garlic bread. the garlic bread portion was huge and a great side for our meals. for entrees, my sister had the <mark>Chicken Parmigiano</mark>, i had the <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, and we split a <mark>Sea Salt Baked Potato</mark>. our waitress graciously mentioned to my sister that her meal did not include pasta in case she wanted to add that (she didn't). once we saw the size of the chicken parm, i can see why it doesn't come with pasta! her piece of chicken was the size of her plate! needless to say she wasn't able to eat the whole thing, but she loved every bite that she did have. my <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, which was a nice thick slice, was cooked to perfection - it was flaky and just melted in my mouth. the <mark>Sea Salt Baked Potato</mark> was a great size (thank goodness we shared it), but could have used just a touch more salt. for dessert, we shared the chocolate cake roll. in keeping with the theme of our meal, it was gigantic. easily four people could have shared that dessert. the cake was delicious and light which was good since we were pretty full from our entrees.\n\nour waitress was very nice and did a great job of checking on us through the night. she also didn't rush us as we took our time with dessert and finishing our wine. the food does come out rather quickly - it couldn't have been more than ten minutes from the time we ordered until the time food appeared at our table. lavo does a great job with table turnover, so even if you walk in without a reservation, you probably won't have to wait too long. prices are actually really reasonable - after tax and tip, my share of the bill was $82.\n\ni would definitely eat at lavo on a future visit and will be recommending it to friends who are traveling to vegas in the near future.", 
            "if your looking for italian food in las vegas i challenge you to find something better than lavo but do yourself a favor and come extra hungry because the portions are not only delicious but massive as well. i had the largest <mark>Chicken Parmigiano</mark> i have ever seen.", 
            "tasty food...try the meatballs.  the price point is really reasonable.  the <mark>Chicken Parmigiano</mark> isn't as good as the one at the palm, which is disappointing since it is a signature dish.  but all in all, the dishes were really good and the service was awesome.  definitely try this place if you want delicious food in a cool atomsphere.", 
            "this is my 6th time here and came with my family and fiance on our vegas trip to celebrate my father's 60th birthday. called a few weeks in advance to book a table, they ask you for a credit card to secure your reservation so be aware of that. requested a table outside and mentioned it was my daddy's 60th birthday.\nwe waited about 30 mins for the table (totally normal at this restaurant) for a table for 6 outside. they said they could seat us immediately inside but it was such a  gorgeous night we waited. we grabbed some drinks at the bar and yummy long bread sticks and stood outside and waited. once our buzzer rang we were seated at a great table with a view of the pirate show at ti. we ate late, around 11pm so we saw the last show of the night. quite loud so be prepared. the restaurant is one of the loudest restaurants (inside) in vegas - super fun. the food here is amazing! so tasty! to start we ordered:\nsun ripened tomato bufala mozzarella $19\n2 orders of the <mark>Eggplant Parmigiano</mark> (the server even warned us that they are huge but i told him we usually order 1 for my fiance and me when we come, they are that good!) you must order this $17\n<mark>Crispy Fried Calamari</mark> $17\n<mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark> $21\nthe men had beers and the ladies split this amazing white pinot grigio, i can't rem the name but it was so tasty and the price was really good!\nfor the mains we ordered:\norganic <mark>Mixed Green</mark> salad $16 \n<mark>Mixed Wild Mushrooms</mark> $11\n<mark>Chicken Parmigiano</mark> $29 (comes with a large side of pasta)\nfour cheese ravioli $24\nchicken & mushroom ravioli $27\nspinach & artichoke brick oven pizza $21\n\neverything was amazing. the only reason i am removing 1 star is because i reminded both the hostess and the server that it was my father's 60th birthday and nothing was done. not even a little candle. they must have forgotten, but i was quite disappointed with that part.\n\nwill return for the tasty food and environment.", 
            "lavo should be known for their meatballs and panna cotta cheesecake!!\n\n*this review is for the restaurant only*\n\nafter hearing that lavo had the best meatballs in town and good food overall, i just had to go and try it for myself. we came here with my good friends from hawaii. i made reservations on a week night when there was no special event going on at the nightclub, hoping it would be less crowded.\n\nat first, service was good. we had 3 different servers who said that they would all be helping us. however, after our drinks were delivered, we got stuck with one server, who was kind of an airhead. i'll be nice and not mention her name, but this is how it went down. we were all obviously ready to order because our menus were closed and stacked nicely on one corner of the table.\nserver: \"are you all ready to order, or do we need a few more minutes?\"\nus: \"we're ready.\"\nserver: \"i'll give you a few more minutes.\"\nus: \"umm, we just said we were ready.\"\nserver: \"oh ok, go ahead.\"\nthen later that night....\nserver: \"are you still working on this or do you want me to take the plate out of your way?\"\nmy friend: \"still working on it.\"\nserver: *reaches out to grab the plate*\nmy friend:\" no, i am still working on it!\"\nserver: \"oh, ok.\"\ngeeez, she had serious issues! also note that we ate here right after they opened, so the place wasn't crazy loud at the time. if she's deaf, she shouldn't be a server. she really needs to get her act together! horrible!\n\nanyway, the food was awesome and we all enjoyed our dinner. we ordered the <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark>. good thing we split it between the 4 of us because it was huge! very flavorful and melted in my mouth! i wanted more, so i ordered the spaghetti with kobe meatballs. my husband ordered the <mark>New York Strip</mark> steak and said it was one of the best steaks he ever had. now i know what to order next time! our friends ordered the <mark>Chicken Parmigiano</mark> (also huge) and some other pasta dish. and now for the best part, dessert!! thanks to my friends, i am now addicted to the panna cotta cheesecake! i don't know how to explain it, except to say that is was a big delicious slice of heavenly, creamy berry goodness! sometimes cheesecakes can be too rich, but this one was light and not overly sweet. slices are big enough for 2 people to share, but i honestly think i could eat the entire thing on my own. i would seriously do a take out order, just for the cheesecake!\n\ndefinitely looking forward to coming back and trying other items on the menu. hopefully, service will be better next time!", 
            "this was the first place we went to once we got to vegas, our 9 pm dinner reservation meant we were starving.\n\nour table wasn't ready when we got there so we opted to get some cocktails, we were just going to go to the bar and get drinks (that's what we do in new orleans), but a cocktail waitress took our order.it took 30 minutes for her to take our order, deliver the drinks, deliver the bills, and to never pick up the receipts. the hostess didn't want to sit us until our bills were picked up, but it was already 930 and they were threatening to give up our reservation. \n\nwe ended up walking over to our table with your drinks and checks in hand.\n\nthe bread and sauce appetizer that is given to the table was delicious (first is free, second was round is charged.)\n\ni opted for the <mark>Chicken Parmigiano</mark> with a side of pasta (the portion is so big you do not need the pasta).\n\nthe chicken was thinly pounded and the size of my face! seriously, iced never seen such a large chicken! i was able to eat about half (my cousin ate the second half later) and took a few bites from my cousins meatballs and spaghetti and <mark>Brussels Sprouts</mark>. everything was delicious and the portions were huge - i wish we would have tried the meatball.",

            "i don't know what lavo's nightclub is like, but based on three dining experiences here, i will keep coming back for the food. the latest outing was to take advantage of some attractive restaurant week offerings. \n\nwe chose patio dining this time, and i was surprised to see that my party of four were seated directly across from the ti show, which we actually saw while we dined. as far as the show is concerned, i liked it better in its earlier sea battle incarnation minus the sexy sirens. \n\nmanagement was much more rigid this year than last when during restaurant week they graciously substituted veal parmesan for chicken parmesan at no additional cost, and agreed to substitute alfredo sauce for marinara sauce to cover a pounded veal cutlet. even though i offered to pay an extra charge if required, the waitress apologetically reported that the manager said that absolutely no substitutions would be allowed on restaurant week menu selections, including changing a sauce. but the requested substitution of one sauce for another was permitted at no extra charge when my wife ordered the veal parmesan from the regular, higher priced menu. this technicality struck me as rather petty--especially since the requested accommodations were made during restaurant week 2010. but at least requested lemon aioli was provided gratis to go with the calamari, and service all night was otherwise excellent. \n\ncomplimentary buttery and crunchy baked garlic bread served with a very mellow marinara sauce was an excellent beginning. and, the blond rings of calamari were all soft, tender, and delicious, whether with just a few added drops of lemon, dipped in the marinara sauce, or dunked in the smooth lemon aioli. \n\na chopped \"louie\" salad served as a first course was probably miscast. this lovely dish was an entree in itself. featuring many pieces of cold shrimp and large hunks of chilled lobster, along with cherry tomatoes, zucchini, red pimento, black olives, celery, and pepperoncini all tossed in a light house vinaigrette dressing, it was a great salad. the salad was presented with an 18-inch cheese stick on top that extended well beyond both sides of the plate. this cheesy bread product was praiseworthy in its own right. \n\n<mark>Brick Oven Salmon Oreganato</mark>, prepared with seasoned breadcrumbs, lemon, white wine, sun-dried tomatoes, and garlic butter, was moist and flavorful. and, it rested atop moist but slightly crunchy julienned vegetables that included zucchini. this was one of the few restaurants i have been where diners are asked whether they would like their fish to be prepared \"medium\" or some other degree of doneness. i stuck to medium, and was happy with the result. \n\npounded veal covered generously with mozzarella cheese and alfredo sauce was also tender and light but a bit too salty. a fellow diner pronounced his <mark>Center Cut <mark>Bone-In Filet Mignon</mark></mark> and the bearnaise sauce that accompanied it \"good.\" the visibly pink inside of the meat was clearly cooked medium rare as ordered. and, glistening <mark>Roasted Rosemary Potatoes</mark> served in a skillet were moist, buttery, and fork tender. they were an excellent choice for a side. \n\ntwo premium desserts shared the stage to complete a memorable repast: tiramisu and strawberry cheese cake. the tiramisu was moist and creamy, and obviously made with mascarpone, chocolate, some alcoholic beverage, and some coffee flavoring. they were respectively marsala wine and espresso. the strawberry cheese cake was delicious but surprisingly light.  its crust was crumbly and tasty. \n\nboth desserts were pretty looking, as well. the bi-level tiramisu reminded me of a log cabin with its six edible lady finger logs glued together with mascarpone. and, the strawberry cheese cake featured white upper and lower layers of <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark> cheese, and a pink middle layer of strawberry cream. its top was adorned with bright red strawberry sauce and three strawberry slices, and resting beside this delectable dessert was a high mound of whipped cream and more oozing strawberry sauce. \n\nit was a great meal, but i dread getting on the scale in the morning!", 
            "meatballs!! that's all you gotta know about lavo (the restaurant) \n\nstaying at the palazzo means having an array or restaurants to choose from. my friend and i wanted something convenient, italian, with outdoor seating availability. we chose lavo. \n\nwe actually took quite a bit of time looking over the menu; having trouble deciding on a pasta dish, meatballs, or a signature dish.  our eyes were definitely bigger than our appetites. after having decided on an order of kobe meatballs <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark>, salmon oreganto, and the chicken and mushroom ravioli, we quickly had a change of heart.  the waiter gave us fair warning that the first two dishes would be sufficient, and boy was he right.  we cancelled the ravioli and ordered: \n\nkobe meatballs <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark> ($22): holy meatball.. this thing was ginormous! the waiter wasn't kidding around, this could easily serve 3-4 people; especially after serving us the complimentary garlic bread. the meatball was juicy and tender, although a bit salty for my taste (i am very senstiive to salty foods) but to anybody else i'm sure it's just the right amount of salty.  perfect when paired with the garlic bread.  definitely something i would come back for in the future. hell, i'd even come, sit at the bar and order just the meatball.\n\n<mark>Brick Oven Salmon Oreganato</mark> ($29): this too was a bit on the saltier side. we honestly probably could have done without this had we known the garlic bread would be so filling.  the fish was pretty good, not too dry and very flavorful.  the cucumber nestled underneath the salmon helped balance the saltiness of the fish and was very refreshing.  \n\n20 layer peanut butter chocolate cake ($13):  this was quite a hefty-sized cake.  pretty good bang for your buck if you're sharing among 4+ people.  between the two of us, we barely made a dent.  it tasted like a peanut butter cup... and i love peanut  butter cups.  i will say, i am not a fan of the chocolate shavings they put on the outside of the cake.. too crunchy and adds to the already over-sweet taste of the dessert.", 
            "been to lavo for both brunch and dinner time.\n\nfyi....lavo isn't a full-on nightclub anymore. it's only open on weekends until 2am as a lounge style. there's still music being played i'm sure, but just don't expect it to be a night out full of visual effects, big djs, dance floor...etc.\n\nrestaurant-wise.....food was delicious. they gave us a basket of garlic bread to start off with. first batch is complimentary. waiter was attentive throughout the night. keep topping off our drinks. \nfor entrees, i ordered:\n<mark>Brick Oven Salmon Oreganato</mark> ($31) -seasoned breadcrumbs, lemon, white wine, garlic butter. i've never been a fan of seafood but wow! this was flavorful,  fresh and cooked to perfection. the salmon with the buttery sauce just melts in your mouth.\nmy boyfriend ordered:\ngrilled tuna with <mark>Grilled Tuna & Roasted Artichokes</mark> ($36) -yellow fin tuna, oven roasted tomatoes, lemon vinaigrette.\nwe both enjoyed our dinner very much....plus that complimentary dessert platter with cheesecake brulee and fried oreos dipped in melted vanilla ice cream was just the icing on the cake to our fabulous dinner date.  =)\n\none thing i do have to mention, the restaurant may be a bit dark and loud to some people. (fobby asian parents come to mind. lol) but this restaurant is a definite repeat. i know there are plenty of other italian restaurants here at the venetian or palazzo...or even las vegas in general, but i would rank lavo over dal toro or b & b restaurante."

            "**restaurant review only**\n\ni met a promoter on facebook who offered to comp me a free dinner for me and a group of my girlfriends for my birthday. of course, i was thrilled and could not pass up an offer to eat at a fine italian restaurant on the strip. \n\ntwo of my girls, my mom, and me arrived at lavo and it was *packed* for a tuesday night! i heard it was \"industry night\", so that could have been the main reason. the main restaurant is part of the nightclub upstairs, and there was a dj spinning a good mixture of house tunes and top 40 remixes. i'm glad he didn't play hip-hop since that's not my thing. the decor was eclectic and unusual, plus i liked the dark, mysterious lighting. because it was so busy, we waited about 20-30 minutes or so, then we were seated.\n\nwe were given a fixed menu of the chef's favorite entrees and we were allowed one free alcoholic beverage each. i wanted to order veuve cliquot, but i could only order sparkling white wine instead, which was fine with me. we started with garlic bread and calamari with marinara sauce, and caesar salad. the salad was so tasty and i am not a big salad girl by any means. it was definitely my favorite appetizer.\n\nnext we had penne pasta, <mark>Chicken Marsala</mark> with spinach, and <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark>. they were all excellent. considering it was all comped, they did not skimp on the portions at all. our waitress was very friendly and attentive, and so were the rest of the staff. our promoter also met us personally and invited us up to the nightclub if we wanted to after dinner, but my friends decided to pass. i totally would have gone dancing if one of my friends was not my ride for the evening. \n\ni was very impressed with lavo. i would definitely go back to the restaurant and the nightclub to party in the near future. kudos to the lavo staff for making this all possible. :-)", 
            "this is a nice little intimate restaurant and i really enjoyed my visit here. my friends and i came here and we had way more to eat than we could handle! for appetizers we got the calamari, garlic bread dip, and caesar salad. the calamari was so yummy, lighted battered and fried, not overly greasy and soggy. both the garlic bread and calamari came with a marinara dipping sauce which was a nice compliment to the dish. then we ordered the crusted baked salmon, thin crust pizza, <mark>Chicken Marsala</mark>, and zucchini strings. the crusted baked salmon and zucchini strings were probably my favorite dishes out of everything. the salmon had a nice crunchy baked crust on the outside and was tender and juicy on the inside. not too bland either, salmon tends to be if you don't prepare it right. i tend to like fried stuff so maybe that's why i was drawn to the zucchini strings. little bits of zucchini lighted fried, i do wish they had a dipping sauce for it, but it was like eating little veggie fries. the <mark>Chicken Marsala</mark> was a bit heavier to eat. it had a lot of sauce and cheese, but the chicken wasn't too dry. the thin crust pizza was a nice addition to our meal. just a simple cheese, marinara, <mark>Spaghetti Fresh Tomato and Basil</mark> pizza on a nice warm crust, yum! this restaurant fits in with the italian feel of the palazzo. you wouldn't think it was an italian restaurant when you first walk in with the lighted candles and fancy modern d\\u00e9cor, you'd probably expect the checked red and white table clothes instead. our table was right by the window so we got a great view of fireworks from the ti show across the street.\n\nthe club is also worth mentioning. the downstairs restaurant becomes a lounge at night and upstairs is a full club. the first time we were there on a saturday night it was way too packed so it was hard to move around and dance without being bumped into. the second time we came on a sunday night it was a better crowd. they aren't as pushy and rude like they are at tao, probably because tao has a younger crowd. they play good music, all of the latest and greatest and more hip hop r&b kind of stuff, i hate it when they play too many techno or trance songs! how do you dance to those? the d\\u00e9cor of the club is very similar to tao in the venetian, very dim and lots of dancers.", 
            "yum!\n\nmy first real meal in vegas was at lavo for dinner. four of us went and were seated quickly (i forget if someone had made a reservation) but it was relatively empty (7pm on a wednesday night) so not too surprising.\n\nmy companion ordered the kobe beef carpaccio as an appetizer for the table, not knowing that carpaccio is raw meat (he was just lured by the word 'kobe' because he loves it). anyway, when that dish came out, the meat was hot pink. i love carpaccio but it seemed unnaturally radioactively pink. it came with a little arugula salad that was nicely dressed and a crisp parmesan cheese wafer that was yummy. the beef was okay, but not the type of carpaccio i'm used to. there were way too many parmesan cheese shavings on the meat itself and too much salt and pepper for my taste.\n\nfor my main dish, i got risotto with braised short ribs. the risotto was creamy and delicious and the short ribs were tender and flavorful. my companion ordered steak, which was really good, but nothing outstanding about it. the other couple ordered the rigatoni with sausage and bolognese sauce and <mark>Chicken Marsala</mark>. i got to try the <mark>Chicken Marsala</mark> and it was really good; flavor was nice and not too overwhelming or salty. however, the portion size for the chicken seemed rather small, but then again, i'm a greedy pig.\n\nfor drinks, i asked for a bellini and the waiter said that they had something called the lavollini (or something using the name of the restaurant) so i got that. there wasn't anything different about it, except the name, because it tasted like a standard bellini.\n\nand just to mention, the waiter we had was in training or something, so he had some tiny girl following him around all night, watching his every move.\n\noverall, a pleasant experience, but nothing bedazzling about it at all.", 
            "had a great meal here the other night .....\n\nthe weather was just about perfect (if not even just a wee bit nippy when the wind blew) and we had a table outside.  the only downfall was the silly pirate show across the street at ti.  luckily, it only goes on for 15 minutes or so, but consider yourself warned that it gets loud when they are doing their thang.  \n\nservice was prompt and our server was nice.  we especially loved him when he brought out freshly baked garlic bread.\n\nsalads were huge and could have easily been eaten as a meal (salad #1 was a <mark>Roasted Beet</mark> salad and salad #2 was a chopped louie).  entrees were <mark>Chicken Marsala</mark> and brick oven salmon - both totally delicious.  oh, and the rock salt roasted potato?  get it if carbs are your friend.  \n\nwe were too full to even entertain the dessert menu, but i'm sure they were just as great!\n\nlavo, we didn't try your meatballs, but maybe next time!", 
            "the food was out of sight.  the bread with the marinara is to die for!  my <mark>Chicken Marsala</mark> was one of the best i have tried.  the fried haricot verts and zuchinni strings were the bomb too.  the music was a bit loud as far as ambiance, otherwise i felt the service and portions were great.  would go again.", 
            "reviewing the restaurant, not the club - \n\ncame here on a friday night with my 6 buddies. we have a 7:30 reservation and were sat immediately. it was a nice night so we chose to sit outside. ended up being a good call because it offers a pretty cool view of the strip. we even got to catch some fireworks from the pirate show over at treasure island.\n\nanyway - our waitress was great. she recommended a bottle of pinot noir which turned out to be very good wine. we had heard that the meatballs were their specialty, so we ordered 3 of them for the table. wow, just like everyone else has said, it was incredible, and the 7 of us housed them in about 2 minutes. for my entree i had the <mark>Chicken Marsala</mark>, which i enjoyed but it was nothing to write home about (kind of a standard dish i suppose, though). for dessert we shared the fried oreos. didn't see much talk of these in the reviews, but oh my god you have to order those as well. \n\noverall a really enjoyable experience and i'd definitely come back next time i'm in vegas.", 
            "try the <mark>Chicken Marsala</mark>! the food was good and the ambiance was nice. i thought it as a bit pricey (but hey, it is vegas), and the service was slow... we had to go to the bar in between drinks to continue getting drinks. \n\nwe went up to the club afterward which was crowded, but there were lots of cheesy things that happened... shooting streamers, etc. wasn't a huge fan of that. i'd go back for the food, but prob not to the club.", 
            "this food...damn good!! the beet salad was beyond good as were the asparagus. we had a party of 30 for my aunt's bday celebration and it was about a six course meal and everything i ate was perfectly cooked, the seasoning were carefully thought out and executed to perfection. the <mark>Chicken Marsala</mark> was thinly done and small, but packed an incredible taste of the mushrooms underneath and sauce drizzled on top. asparagus spears were seasoned with salt, garlic and lemon and sauteed the best i've ever had.\n\nthe service was by far the best we had all weekend. i believe our server was danny a young guy with tattoos on his arm. he was awesome. i sat at the table with my cousins and their kids (it was a younger table but well behaved kids) and he was helped serve the little ones so we could enjoy our meals, who does that? no one ever!! at least not the places i've been to. he was always right there filling our cups up as was the other server, i can't recall his name. i just remember he has a lil girl who was around the same age as my baby cousin and he was showing her pic to them, which we didn't mind and thought it was really cool how intimate they made the whole experience feel for us. \n\nwe stayed at the palazzo and i was not too impressed by the service, but the restaurant and service made up for a lot of it! i would recommend anyone visiting vegas to try this place out and hopefully you get our servers and experience what we did. \n\nthe entire party got the following: kobe beef meatballs (two large ones) in marinara sauce, beet salad with vinagrette dressing (perfection) sauteed asparagus spears in lemon and garlic (awesome) calamari (tied for the best i've had) not greasy at all. italian sausage with pasta and bolognese sauce (a bit salty, but creamy and very good) chicken parm (too greasy so i didn't touch it) didn't look that appetizing. <mark>Chicken Marsala</mark> (already spoke about) and pasta carbonara with bacon (this was on point!) creamy, great taste with every bite, perfectly seasoned and great portions. then we had chocolate cake with peanut butter filling with was too sweet for me but the filling was not your average skippy peanut butter. it was slick, creamy and perfectly sweet. oh yea and the infamous fried oreo. i didn't eat this but everyone said how good it was.", 
            "had dinner here the first night i was in town. i've been hearing about the meatball (note, singular, not plural) so much around the office that i had to find out what it was all about.\n\nbasically, it is a huge ball of meat (bigger than a baseball) that is made with kobe beef. in terms of meatballs: this is the best i have ever tried. also had a seafood mix salad (came with huge chunks of lobster). \n\nthen came the entrees: <mark>Chicken Marsala</mark> and the <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark>. the <mark>Chicken Marsala</mark> left little to be desired: came with spinach and mushrooms and very thin pieces of chicken, topped with a very light rendition of the sauce. the <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was also very, very delicious. the skin was fried perfectly: it stayed together on the plate and just melted in my mouth. comes with a small side argula salad which was pair very well with the fish.\n\nthis is definitely on the pricier side. also, take note: this place can be a bit loud (we sat inside) but i'd definitely be coming back to have the meatball again. perhaps i'll try the balcony next time which faces t.i. and their pirate/syren show.\n\ntip: if you stop here, you would do yourself a disservice if you did not try their meatball!", 
            "what a huge dissappointment!  we were looking for a place to have a nice dinner while sitting outside and getting some fresh air.  although the reviews were mixed, i thought we would try it out anyway, big mistake.  the service was as bad as the food, which was overpriced and either too salty and/or overcooked.  they do know what al dente pasta is, but sauces were bland and way oversalted -- and i love salt.  the <mark>Chicken Marsala</mark> -- i thought it was probably what you would expect from the olive garden.  our server, donnie, was so phony and clearly more interested in the tables with young women.  you would have thought he was in the club rather than serving in the restaurant.  i would also like to add that the ice water served at the table was horrible tasting and we had no choice but to order the sparkling and i found myself wondering if this was intentional as i had not had anything that tasted so discusting in the several other area restaurants we had eaten in previous days.  i specifically also asked that the champagne be iced cold -- generally they put it on ice for a few minutes before and i did add that i was very particular about this -- clearly it came right out of the cooler as it was not cold but cool.  the hostesses and some other servers and staff were very friendly and had sincere smiles -- unlike donnie.  bottom line, there are too many better restauants nearby to choose from to have to settle for this!", 
            "get the meatball! seriously, it is so awesome! we had some <mark>Chicken Marsala</mark> as well, but i could have easily eaten meatballs all night.  the drinks were really good as well, and we sat outside so we could people watch on the strip. we will be here again soon!", 
            "the service here was awesome.  our waiter, a transplant from nyc whom we affectionately called suspenders due to his uniform, was above reproach.  he was funny, personable and patient with our large group of girls out for a night on the town. he cracked jokes with us and showed us pictures of his young son.  also, he wasn't bad to look at.\n\nthe ambiance was of the trendy lounge-cum-restaurant variety.  the same cookie cutter recipe seen over and over in most cities. think exposed brick, low lighting, brushed cement floors and ambient music heavy on the bass and low on vocals.  nothing wrong with it, just nothing to write home about either.  i could walk right now to about 50 places that fit that description.\n\nthe food?  underwhelming.  to say the very least.  i ordered the gnocchi and was warned prior that it was made of semolina, so i should expect it to be denser than what i may be accustomed to. that may have been the only interesting thing about the dish.  the truffle cream was simply adequate, the rabbit ragu was meh and the whole thing came out tepid.  it seems that whomever was doing the timing back in the kitchen should have waited for the chicken dominic that my fellow diners ordered to be nearly done before putting my dish up in the window.  the assessments from the other people in my party (of 7) mirrored my own.  the chicken parmesan was 'okay', the chicken dominic came off as 'something i could make better myself' and the <mark>Chicken Marsala</mark> was actually deemed 'worse than the marsala i made at home last week'.  there was one bright spot in the group: the lobster scampi pizza, which my friend ate up with delight.\n\noverall, i can't say it was the worst place i've ever eaten.  but it was forgettable.  and a little disappointing.  perhaps a little more spice, a little more flavor and some better timing in the kitchen lavo could elevate itself to 4 stars.  but i just don't see that it will ever have the legs to climb the rungs all the way to the top.", 
            "loved it!!! i made dinner reservations for my friends bachelorette party on friday night. we booked the \"lavo feast\" which was served family style. we had the pizza and calamari for appetizers, salad, spaghetti, <mark>Chicken Marsala</mark>, <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark>, asparagus, and dessert. the dessert was just ok and i felt the calamari could have been more crispy, but other then that i thought the food tasted great! the service was attentive and friendly. the atmosphere was perfect for our bachelorette party and after dinner we were able to walk right into tao's night club (bring your dinner receipt). well worth the money. i highly recommend it!!", 
            "horrible service and horrible food. the seafood pasta was under cooked and had a very fishy taste. the <mark>Chicken Marsala</mark> tasted like chicken teriyaki from a cheap chinese restaurant. worst <mark>Chicken Marsala</mark> ever!!!! do not eat here. even their bread came out cold with their cold red sauce for dipping.", 
            "i would have given this place 5 if it wasn't for the horrible server we had. \n\npleasantly surprised here at lavo \n\nambiance was great food was terrific. \n\nmeatball... amazing and so so soft \noctopus ... charred with some sort of lemon    salad. so great. \n\ncarpaccio .... amazing with arugula and parmesan.  \n\ncavatelli with meat sauce and ricotta amazing   \n\n<mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark>- light with a lemon sauce. yum\n\n<mark>Chicken Marsala</mark>... mouth is still watering. \n\n<mark>Penne Seafood Alfredo</mark>. shrimp, scallops, in a light cream sauce. yum! not overtly thick at all! \n\ntiramisu ... no go for me. just too much. \n\n\n\n\ni was wowed.", 
            "we ate here for a work function and we enjoyed the atmosphere and food. everyone in the group was willing to share so we tried several items. we started with the beef carpaccio and calmari. both were flavorful and delicious. the entrees at the table included <mark>Chicken Marsala</mark> and a couple of pastas. every dish had good flavor and the portions were enough without being too much. we finished with the sorbets which were all very good. the atmosphere was very lively and definitely gets more lively as the night goes on.", 
            "my husband and i had dinner with another couple at lavo's on august 21, 2015.  we had seen a show on tv espousing the 1-pound meatball there, and were excited to try it.  we ordered one as an appetizer for the four of us, and it was one of the best meatballs any of us ever had.  \nwhy only 2 stars for this place?  my first objection was that our table of four was served what looked to be about a half loaf of a small italian garlic bread with marinara on the side.  if we had been a party of two i can't imagine they would serve us half that portion.  we all ordered cocktails, salads, and entrees, ( in addition to the 1- lb. meatball that we shared), and while we waited for our food we gobbled down the garlic bread.  so i asked our waiter to bring us more.  he told us he'd be happy to, but there was a $6 charge for a second helping!  what?!!!  if all we had ordered was cocktails and appetizers, maybe i could forgive that!  but that seemed outrageous to us!  however, the plain italian bread with marinara was no extra charge.\nwe asked the waiter to space out the entrees when our salads came on top of the meatball, and he said he would see what he could do.\nthe caesar salad i got was wonderful, but the second thing i disliked was that our entrees arrived before we had even finished the salads!\nthe third thing that disappointed was that i ordered the <mark>Chicken Marsala</mark>, and it was paper thin and tough, very salty, and the mushrooms were overcooked and black with the texture of leather.  i had a few bites and had the waiter take the rest away.  i told him to tell the chef it was not good, and the waiter asked if i would like to speak with management.  i replied no, that i wasn't looking to get a discount on my meal.  i just wanted them to know.  i really hoped he would tell the manager anyway and send him over, but he didn't.  we had ordered more drinks and declined dessert and coffee, and, are you ready for this?!  our waiter asked if we would like to take our drinks into the bar to finish them!  \nwe said no!  please!  we had been seated there for all of one hour!  i don't call that over-staying one's welcome with the money we spent there that night!\nall in all, i don't think a great meatball is worth returning there.", 
            "#food #drinks #fun  and home with @msfitness69 for the night!!! fun was had by all today! @lavolv i had  #<mark>Chicken Marsala</mark> & the most amazing #<mark>Brussels Sprouts</mark> ever .. i loved how the food was not heavy and was unbelievably fresh and savory! . dying ..... want more. yes the #stoliraz & water took the edge off the hour wait!   our server josh made for a delightful evening in #vegas!  upgraded our seating to the big booth we preferred and was very patient as our party arrived a bit later than planned. thank you for your patience! one huge thing i cannot forget to mention is that they provide a phone charging battery pack with a variety of plug attachments.  they need to hold a credit card & id but when your at 3% in #vegas i would have given them my right arm for a charger!!"

            "been to lavo for both brunch and dinner time.\n\nfyi....lavo isn't a full-on nightclub anymore. it's only open on weekends until 2am as a lounge style. there's still music being played i'm sure, but just don't expect it to be a night out full of visual effects, big djs, dance floor...etc.\n\nrestaurant-wise.....food was delicious. they gave us a basket of garlic bread to start off with. first batch is complimentary. waiter was attentive throughout the night. keep topping off our drinks. \nfor entrees, i ordered:\n<mark>Brick Oven Salmon Oreganato</mark> ($31) -seasoned breadcrumbs, lemon, white wine, garlic butter. i've never been a fan of seafood but wow! this was flavorful,  fresh and cooked to perfection. the salmon with the buttery sauce just melts in your mouth.\nmy boyfriend ordered:\ngrilled tuna with <mark>Grilled Tuna & Roasted Artichokes</mark> ($36) -yellow fin tuna, oven roasted tomatoes, lemon vinaigrette.\nwe both enjoyed our dinner very much....plus that complimentary dessert platter with cheesecake brulee and fried oreos dipped in melted vanilla ice cream was just the icing on the cake to our fabulous dinner date.  =)\n\none thing i do have to mention, the restaurant may be a bit dark and loud to some people. (fobby asian parents come to mind. lol) but this restaurant is a definite repeat. i know there are plenty of other italian restaurants here at the venetian or palazzo...or even las vegas in general, but i would rank lavo over dal toro or b & b restaurante."

            "i was there last saturday for dinner and went upstairs to check out the club. for the restaurant, the decor/ ambiance was great if that's what you're looking for. the food was just ok, have tasted better tapas in numerous other places. i tried the kobe beef balls, kobe sliders, grill octopus salad, <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark> and clam linguine. none of those amazed me or stayed in my tongue memory. the chocolate bread pudding was the best part of the whole dinner. \n\ni had fun staring at the people walking back and forth the stairs/ bridge to the club so i checked it out after dinner. it has a bar area and a dance floor area with some booths. i guess it would be ok if you're hanging out with your own group of friends and is looking for something less hectic than the bigger clubs. the crowd cleared out pretty fast because of the size of this place i suppose, and not many people there after 1am on a saturday night.", 
            "if you want to be completely ignored at a restuarant - this is the place for you!  our 8 o'clock reservation was finally seated at 8:45 - which would have been understandable except for the 8 open tables when we reached the dining area.  our waiter was briefly apologetic and attentive - while searching the room continually for a more important matter evidently.  the sad thing about the restaurant -is the food is a 4 or 4 1/2 - the kobe meatballs were fabulous - the miso <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was amazing and the drinks were well concocted.  however - it took 2 full hours between our appetizers and entrees and my dinners guests starting making jokes about being held hostage mid dinner.  in my entire career of entertaining clients (18+ years) i've never been so horrified.  we had already spoken to management 2 times.. they were so busy being beautiful - the could have cared less.  we started making jokes of it - and did our best - but everyone was tired and cranky when we left - not my idea of a successful business dinner on any account... i would never recommend this restaurant - ever - to anyone.", 
            "loved loved loved the food. \n\nmy guy took me here for my bday, and it was amazing.  it helped that we ordered everything on the menu.  here goes the food: \n\ngarlic bread - omg amazing. it was so tasty.  the nice thing is that this was the bread served at the table.  looks like its baked upon being seated.  it was fresh and accompanied with tomato sauce. \n<mark>Spinach and Artichoke</mark> pizza - 2 foot pizza.  it was so tasty and definitely something that can be shared at the table.  it was flaky and full of flavor.\nkobe meatball - okay, i don't eat meat...but i was told this was to die for.  also, our waiter told us that this is one of their signature dishes.  \nceasar salad - definitely large enough to be shared at the table.  we didn't even finish it.  but it was tasty and flavorful.  croutons were well done. \n<mark>Center Cut <mark>Bone-In Filet Mignon</mark></mark> - again, i dont eat meat but i was told it was cooked to perfection. \n<mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark> - yummy, full of flavor, accompanied with tomatos. \n<mark>Polenta Fries</mark> - omg....so good.  i'm still thinking about this today. \noreo filled pastries with ice cream - yummy...how can you go wrong? \n\nless one star because i've been to the club...and it's small, stuffy, and i wasn't too jazzed about it.  \n\nmy new favorite restaurant in vegas!", 
            "on our \"girls night out\", we came to lavo for dinner.  we weren't sure where to go for dinner, so jeff, from vip red carpet, suggested lavo and we werent disappointed.  its located at the palazzo, a short walk from the mirage.  the decor was pretty cool.  it was pretty dim inside, but i really liked their chandeliers and lighting.\n\nanywho, we started with 2 of the <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> and 1 caesar salad, which was more than enough to split amongst us 4 girls.  the caesar was pretty good, and the croutons were huge!  the <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> wasn't that great for me...maybe im just used to fusion, but i was expecting some kind of chip to go with it, and i didnt really like the lemony taste it had.\n\nnext, they brought out some amazing garlic bread that you can dip in marinara sauce...pretty yummy.  they also brought out a pitcher of saggio (kind of like a blueberry mojito)...they suggested the pitcher because it was cheaper than ordering individually...that probably lasted 1.5-2 rounds for us.  i really liked it...it was very light and summery. perfect for those hot summer vegas nights!\n\nfor my entree, i went with my favorite fish, the <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark> accompanied by a breaded/fried portobello. man was that good. i was a little upset that i was getting full and couldnt finish it.  it was cooked perfectly, and the sauce was great.  my friends ordered the grilled swordfish, the penne ala vodka, and the filet...no complaints from any of them.   keep in mind that you have to order trimmings and potatoes separately for $10 each.  i ordered the <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark>, and another friend ordered the <mark>Roasted Rosemary Potatoes</mark>.  its pretty huge, so you can probably split with the table.  i actually could've done without it, it was a little dry and i didnt want to waste whatever room was left in my tummy, on potatoes.\n\nlast, but definitely not least....dessert!!!  we ordered deep fried battered oreos with a side of milkshake to dip them into.  pure heaven!!! it was so good...now im starting to drool again...lol.\n\nthis is definitely a cool place to check out for dinner.  the outside patio has an awesome view of the strip.  the ambience is great, the staff was friendly and they offered a ton of great suggestions.  they also knew we were in kind of a rush, so they happily accomodated.  i would definitely go back again.",

            "while on our wild vacation out to las vegas, my wife and i wanted to try the restaurants in vegas, aside from the well established feeding grounds of buffets and $5 steaks.  we decided to go to lavo  \n\nwhile everyone waits for tao, you can save some headaches and sore legs by going to this sister restaurant.  when we went to lavo however, with a reservation mind you, we still wound up having to wait for half an hour for our table.  however, it wasn't all that bad.  the bar and lounge area are very comfortable and inviting, so we ordered a few drinks and sat around talking and watching the game on the television.  \n\nafter we were seated, i finally noticed how small the dining area actually was, which could have been the reason for delayed seating.  seating was probably limited to approximately 20 - 25 parties inside and some seating outside.  outside seating would be nice, aside from the still blistering heat and trove of cars rolling up and down the strip.  you could also enjoy the show at treasure island across the street.  still, we decided to stay indoor and enjoy the atmosphere of the restaurant itself.\n\nthe waitress, who looked like leslie bibb, immediately came over and went over the menu with us.  she was really nice and assisted us with a wine recommendation with our meal.  the wine turned out to be quite good and matched the equally delicious kobe beef meatball, a must have.  actually, we ordered two, even though one was more than enough.  the tartare was quite delicious as well.  \n\nthe pi\\u00e8ce de r\\u00e9sistance was the <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark>.  cooked just right and tender, the bass was just pure heaven.  never had i had fish that was on any level comparable to the fish i had here.  i would come here every time when i'm in vegas just for it.\n\ndidn't go to the nightclub though, since we head so many negatives about it.  still the restaurant was well worth it and hopefully won't be affected by the reviews of the nightclub.", 
            "this place was gorgeous. i loved the ambiance, kind of reminded me of tao. if you're looking for a place that's lively, loud, kind of loungy but at the same time wanna have a meal this is the place to go. it's not a place you want to go to if you actually want to have conversations with people if you're a group of 4 or more. it's just too loud so you end up only talking to the people right next to you. \n\nservice was lousy! we were famished. we didn't even get complimentary bread until i had to ask for it 45 minutes later. it took an hour to get our food. i can understand if it's 30 minutes but 1 hour for food is long. \n\nthe food was good! but the portions were massive. we ordered the pre fix menu and typically you would think the portions would be smaller if it's a pre fix but not, these portions were just over overwhelmingly huge.  the ceasar salad they gave us could feed 5 people and it was for one person, my rice beef balls were tasty but there were 3 big balls and i was full from just eating that. \n\nnow the entree - the <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was a good portion for one person. no complaints there and it was delish however, the other dishes, like hte chicken parmigan was the size of the entire plate. it was huge. my friend and i were supposed to share it and we couldnt even eat 1/4 of that chicken.  sadly that was a lot of food wasted. \n\nthe dessert was not good! the tiramisu was like hard rolls and again the quantity was just a lot. my recommendation is don't order any pre fix menu from this place.it''ll get very pricey. we paid $85 per person. that's absurdly expensive, i think. i recommend just ordering the individual entrees.", 
            "wow.  lavo love.  this place was great.  first, big points for accommodating a last minute reservation for 15 people.  nice big table in the middle of a energetic restaurant.  i'm sure the restaurant was beautiful too, but frankly i was so focused on the well-prepared and abundant food that i really didn't notice the decor.\n\nwe started off with some amazing garlic bread served with marinara--delicious!  and an amazing looking kobe meatball (i don't eat meat) that easily was an appetizer for 4-6 people.  i had a terrific heirloom tomato bufala mozzarella salad with fig basalmic.  for my main course i decided on a carb fest and ordered a <mark>Spinach and Artichoke</mark> pizza, with black olives and roasted garlic.  the pizza was about 5 inches wide by two feet long, could easily have served 2-3 people and lasted me well into breakfast the next day.  i also tasted their <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark> that was excellent as well.\n\nthe food was plentiful to be sure, but was prepared with style and finesse.  lavo is on my list of restaurants not to miss when visiting vegas!", 
            "restaurant:\nwe had to wait about thirty minutes for a table even with a reservation (but after 20 minutes i went back asking how much longer) and they without a question just gave me two free drinks for waiting.  my friend and i had great specialty drink cocktails.  we had calamari for an appetizer-large portion and totally worth it.  i had the <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark> and my friend had an eggplant pasta dish which was also very tasty.",

            "restaurant review (yelp needs to create separate entries for places that are restaurants and clubs...it's hard to weed through reviews!)\n\nmy friend and i felt like having italian while we were in vegas, so we decided to try lavo.  the service was great, but to the point where it got kind of ridiculous...someone was checking up on us almost every 5 minutes during our meal so it felt like too many interruptions.  \n\nour waiter recommended the meatball appetizer, which turned out to be pretty good...it was the size of a softball and good enough for 4 girls to share.  it was flavorful, but not spectacular.  we were hoping our entrees would turn out better, but things went downhill from there.  i had the <mark>Penne Seafood Alfredo</mark>, which was shrimps and scallops in a light cream alfredo sauce.  it was so incredibly salty that i only finished a fourth of my plate.  my boyfriend ordered the <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark>.  the fish itself was well cooked, but it was lacking in flavor.  we also had an order to <mark>Roasted Rosemary Potatoes</mark> with sweet caramelized onions, which was also salty.", 
            "this review is for the restaurant only. \n\ni got the chef's special (seafood pasta) which was pretty good and my bf got the <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark>---which is to die for!  although my dish was pretty good, his dish was so good that it really overshadowed everything else and i found myself reaching over to help myself more often than not lol.  the <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was so savory and tender; it literally melts in your mouth.  i highly recommend getting this plate when you're there.  \n\nthe cool thing about eating here is you get to cut the line and get in their night club for free!  (just tell your server that you want to go to the nightclub and he'll do the rest.)", 
            "wasn't expecting a great experience at lavo...but was shockingly surprised\n\nfirst lavo is the italian sister to the now famous tao.  it is decorated in a french 1920s bisto type of very elegant way.\n\nfirst the service was top notch as is the drink menu.  the menu is varied with pizza, steaks, pasta and main dishes.  their signature app is their kobe meatball.  i dont eat meat, but when in rome....the meat was fantatstic as was the richness of the sauce\n\nfor the main, i had the pasta, which was fresh with a very good red sauce.  italian restaurants should have a good red sauce.  my colleagues had assorted pork, <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark> and steak dishes and enjoyed them thoroughly(then again i was buying)\n\nfor dessert, i was urged to order the oreo(waitress was awesome, forgot her name, but she just turned 30)  the oreo is underneath a beinet, a french donut...i went to school in new orleans, where these little hunks of fried wonder originate...great choice, great meal", 
            "want a easy way to get into a club without waiting in line and paying cover? hit up lavo for dinner and get a stamp to enter the club for free. my friends and i opted for this route because our guy/girl ratio was not good. the restaurant is pricey, but their food portions are quite large and i thought the food was pretty good. the guys all got the prix fixe meal and there was too much food for everyone even though all the girls only got entrees. i had the <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark> and it was just the right amount of fish (i also had some of the calamari app, the kobe meatball, and tiramisu dessert). the kardashian clan was there too and it wasn't all hectic with fans so we weren't bothered. \n\nthe club was alright, the music wasn't the greatest because i just don't care for house (and the dj kept yelling stuff like \"i can't hear you st. tropez or barcelona\"... it was really weird and random and he would turn off the music to yell stuff)... but when you don't pay cover and you want to get guys in a vegas club, it was perfect. the club wasn't crazy crowded which i liked since i could dance on the dance floor (as opposed to a mosh pit), actually get drinks at the bar and use the restroom without a line. \n\ni would consider going here again",

            "we arrived with a large group & sat at the private table in the back. \n\nthe service was fantastic - they were on top of all our individual drink orders & kept checking back frequently (and remembered what we were each drinking). \nthe food was all excellent!  we had so much (family style), it's hard to pick favorites.  i never saw a menu because food was ordered for us, but some of the standouts were: beet salad, giant meatball, cold seafood tiered plate (with prawns, lobster, crab meat, tuna tartar & oysters), <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, green beans, chicken parmesan and chocolate rolled cake.  \ni'm not a fan of the battered & fried oreos or the tiramisu, but other people at our table enjoyed them.  \n\ni would definitely come back here & look to try the lavo in ny. \n\nps - towards the end of our dinner, we noticed it turning into a club - there were a lot of attractive people hanging around. must be a hot spot.", 
            "my sister and i ate dinner at lavo on saturday night. we had 7:15 pm reservations and even though it was a tad early to eat by vegas standards, the restaurant was pretty full. the tables for two are a little close together, but you still feel as if you have your own space and i really didn't overhear either of our neighbor's conversations.\n\nour meal started with two glasses of sauvignon blanc and complimentary garlic bread. the garlic bread portion was huge and a great side for our meals. for entrees, my sister had the <mark>Chicken Parmigiano</mark>, i had the <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, and we split a <mark>Sea Salt Baked Potato</mark>. our waitress graciously mentioned to my sister that her meal did not include pasta in case she wanted to add that (she didn't). once we saw the size of the chicken parm, i can see why it doesn't come with pasta! her piece of chicken was the size of her plate! needless to say she wasn't able to eat the whole thing, but she loved every bite that she did have. my <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, which was a nice thick slice, was cooked to perfection - it was flaky and just melted in my mouth. the <mark>Sea Salt Baked Potato</mark> was a great size (thank goodness we shared it), but could have used just a touch more salt. for dessert, we shared the chocolate cake roll. in keeping with the theme of our meal, it was gigantic. easily four people could have shared that dessert. the cake was delicious and light which was good since we were pretty full from our entrees.\n\nour waitress was very nice and did a great job of checking on us through the night. she also didn't rush us as we took our time with dessert and finishing our wine. the food does come out rather quickly - it couldn't have been more than ten minutes from the time we ordered until the time food appeared at our table. lavo does a great job with table turnover, so even if you walk in without a reservation, you probably won't have to wait too long. prices are actually really reasonable - after tax and tip, my share of the bill was $82.\n\ni would definitely eat at lavo on a future visit and will be recommending it to friends who are traveling to vegas in the near future.", 
            "this review is for the restaurant.\n\ni'm going to say this now. i have nothing negative to say about this restaurant. the food and service were impeccable. we were seated within 10 minutes and our waiter was very attentive, helpful, and friendly. \n\nwe ordered the kobe rice balls for an appetizer and they were nothing short of delicious. the rice was similar to a risotto. they weren't the japanese rice balls that i had in mind. instead, they were fried and had marinara sauce, but still it was deeee-lish!\n\nfor our entrees my boyfriend had the <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark> and i had the chicken and mushroom ravioli. both were perfect, the fish was extremely juicy and tender and the ravioli was flavored quite nice and the added arugula made for a nice accompaniment.\n\noverall, our meal was spectacular. the only slight and i mean slight downside is that the pricing is a little steep. but then again, you get what you pay for.", 
            "this place was awesome! my boyfriend and i had dinner here over memorial day weekend! our waiter kc was so hospitable, he recommended everything we needed up ordering and we were so delighted with all of his choices! we started with kobe <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark>. my boyfriend had the <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark> (melted in your mouth), i had the <mark>Spaghetti Carbonara</mark> with chicken which was to die for! then we had the fried oreo's with vanilla ice-cream for dessert! kc also recommended a drink that wasn't on the menu that was made or rose wine and some type of blueberry vodka that was just absolutely divine! omg this place is soooo yummy and the service was the definition of impeccable we will definitely be going back to lavo with all our friends on our next vegas trip!", 
            "had a really good experience on a wednesday night at both the restaurant and the club. \n\nit was a nice night, so we sat on the patio which is a very nice spot.  has the potential to get crowded quickly.  started off with the <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark>. ive definitely had better kobe meat balls (sorellina in boston). if i eat there again, i will not order the meat ball. i had <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark> and it was a very good dish with very bright flavors and cooked perfectly. our server was excellent. i believe his name was arthur.   this is not my favorite place in vegas but it was an overall good experience. \n\nmy biggest gripe was how much hell the staff gives you about going up to the night club after you've paid vegas prices to eat there. the bouncers are the worst, unnecessarily rude and on some stupid power trip.  once in the club, we found a good spot right at the bar, closest to the dance floor.  this is a very small club, but they were playing awesome music.", 
            "sister's 21st bday in vegas so i looked for the hot spot to take her to dinner and she said italian so lavo popped up first. made reservations on a saturday night and we were seated right away when we arrived. nice decor, dark and very loud music just a hip modern atmosphere to get our night started. our server was prompt and we started with drinks, now don't ask me to name them off their cocktail list i cant remember the weird italian names but they were good. unfortunately later on the music was so loud my server heard something completely different and brought the wrong drink but it was good and drinkable, she even offered to comp it and bring the correct one but i didn't mind. for appetizers we ordered the oysters and the evenings  special squash blossoms, they arrived quickly and before that we ate some of their delicious garlic read so yummy! the oysters were delicious and fresh but when they came out we thought they were trying to jip us since there were 3 large and 3 extra small so we brought it to our servers attention and she informed us they were different types of oysters ooooooh.... ok we get it now but i dont remember that description in the menu. the squash blossoms were disappointing, heavily deep fried and bland, when i heard it was drizzled with honey truffle i thought they would be amazing but i wouldn't recommend them. for our entrees i asked our server which was more popular the penne <mark>Linguini With Mixed Seafood</mark> or <mark>Spaghetti Carbonara</mark>...she picked the spaghetti and man it was incredible! highly recommend this dish, cannot get it out of my mind my mouth salivates thinking about it. my sister had the shrimp linguine special which was ok not as flavorful as the carbonara, my friend ordered the <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark> which i thought for the price, i've had much better for much less. should have tried the meatballs that everyone talks about, in my reservation i wrote celebrating my sisters birthday and again in front of our server said \" lets start with the birthday girl!\" so i was disappointed when we did not receive the bday dessert i've read about and maybe i should directly asked but i didn't want to be annoying. enjoyed our evening never rushed like at tao and service from hostess to server was good also.", 
            "good food! i had the louis salad (with lobster) and the <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark>. both tasted very fresh. cocktails are good too. then it's noisy and quite dark, but it's part of the fun i guess.", 
            "i literally licked my plate. yes i was a wee bit intoxicated but it was 100% justified.\n\nmy boss and his wife raved about how freaking amazing their kobe meatballs are. i prepared myself for potential over hype, but they lived up to all expectations.\n\ngoing a step back, we arrived on time for our 8pm reservation and had to wait as the place was super busy with it being the last night of ces. a slight nudge and the management did what every restaurant should do, they bought us a round of drinks. just as we were going to sweet talk our way into a 2nd round, our table was ready.\n\nthis place is sexy, though due to ces the male:female ratio was skewed to sausage. it is at this point that my boss taught me a life lesson. rather than deal with the back and forth after asking 'what does everyone feel like eating?', simply tell your server to pick their favourites for you. now this is assuming the server isn't useless. \n\nas i forget the sequence of arrival, here we go:\n\ngreen salad - helped with carb guilt\ncalamari - perfectly cooked, well spiced\na-5 kobe <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark> - what transpired in my mouth was a little intimate. wow^2.\n<mark>Rigatoni Melanzana</mark> - it had a generous dollop of buffalo mozzarella. enough said.\n<mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark> - delicate, butter ocean joy.\n<mark>Bone-In Rib Eye</mark> with a side of garlic herb butter - juicy, tofu-tender, carnivore heaven. i chewed the meat on the bone with pride.\ndeep fried oreos - i thought my boss was joking ordering such a thing at this kind of place, but he insisted. dipped in gelato, they were magical enough for me to lick my plate clean.\n\ni shall return. tongue out.", 
            "came here on a saturday night with a group of 12 people.  we forgot to make reservations but they were able to accommodate us at such short notice.  \n\ni ate here twice for dinner and  i can now say that i am not a fan of their food.  \n\nthe first time i came here i had raw oysters (which i enjoyed- then again i love raw oysters) and their rigatoni sausage pasta dish.  i felt that it was a pretty \"heavy\" choice of a meal since we were going out afterwards.  in italian cuisine, the sauce is what makes the dish,  their tomato sauce lacked a lot of flavor.  this dish tasted like the pastas you can order at the italian fast food joints located in shopping centers/malls.  the second time i came here, i had the roasted chillean <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark> and it was okay.  the portabello mushrooms were over powering the flavor of the dish..unless it were meant to be the \"main\" flavor.   \n\nthe pasta portions are pretty huge, so if you're going to get a pasta dish, you should probably split that with your friend/date.  make sure you pay attention to your bill because they charge for garlic bread.  the waiter brings it out to your table, as if it were free, but it's not. \n\nthe seating is pretty close to each other. i feel like i can sit and hear the conversation of everyone around me. excellent wait staff and pinot grigio.", 
            "had dinner here the first night i was in town. i've been hearing about the meatball (note, singular, not plural) so much around the office that i had to find out what it was all about.\n\nbasically, it is a huge ball of meat (bigger than a baseball) that is made with kobe beef. in terms of meatballs: this is the best i have ever tried. also had a seafood mix salad (came with huge chunks of lobster). \n\nthen came the entrees: <mark>Chicken Marsala</mark> and the <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark>. the <mark>Chicken Marsala</mark> left little to be desired: came with spinach and mushrooms and very thin pieces of chicken, topped with a very light rendition of the sauce. the <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was also very, very delicious. the skin was fried perfectly: it stayed together on the plate and just melted in my mouth. comes with a small side argula salad which was pair very well with the fish.\n\nthis is definitely on the pricier side. also, take note: this place can be a bit loud (we sat inside) but i'd definitely be coming back to have the meatball again. perhaps i'll try the balcony next time which faces t.i. and their pirate/syren show.\n\ntip: if you stop here, you would do yourself a disservice if you did not try their meatball!", 
            "this place is perfect!!!! their food is amazing, the environment is relaxed and perfect for a date;) \n\ni highly recommend the shrimp scampi, <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, or the spaghetti. also recommend the gelato for dessert!\n\nthey also serve garlic bread with marinara sauce complimentary. which is delicious.",

            "decent service but horrible food! this was the only place we could get in on short notice around 10:30 on a monday night. the <mark>Spicy Lobster Bisque</mark> was inedible, the chopped louie salad was 90% onions, 9% <mark>Mixed Green</mark> and 1% lobster and shrimp and the <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was so so. reasonably priced for vegas but definitely not somewhere i would recommend. i'm not sure if it was the alcohol i consumed that night or the food at lavo (probably the food) but it did not sit well and violently came back up the way it went down the next morning. tmi, sorry.",

            "ugh. as if i havent sung this place enough praises, here i am writing another review for it. so, second time in vegas for 4th of july vaca. brought a new group of girls to indulge with me and everything was just as delicious as i last left it. from the time they bring you the garlic bread and marinara, just lean back and unbuckle your belt/corsets to make room, cause everything is so effing delicious. apparently i fell into a trance and started licking the sauce off the table with my fingers. wow. moving on, i had my <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark> with a side of mushrooms, it was perfection as usual. others ordered a risotto, a <mark>Penne Seafood Alfredo</mark>, rave reviews on the texture and freshness for both, a marinara pizza, long classic flavorful, a <mark>Spicy Lobster Bisque</mark>, not my fave, they make theirs taste too gingery i find, but it does have big delish chunks of lobster. but let me bring it back because the mvp of our dinner was the calamari. again, wow, simples done right, nice and crisp tight batter and the meaty perfectly sized hoops, again dunking into that heavenly marinara. once again, i haven't made it as far as desert cause we're always so stuffed before entrees even come, portions are huge, plus the drinks are great, we always enjoy gummi bear shots, and sparkling selections. ugh, just so much winning to do here. service was kind and prompt as usual, last hear we had a really cool brunette guy who comped us some shots, this time we had a lady with a short blunt cut bob, she was very nice and cautious of bringing everything quickly for us, knowing that we had to go somewhere after, and she even comped a dish for a girl who felt the pasta in her alfredo was a little too hard, and brought out a recooked version out of courtesy. thats good service in my book, treat your customers like you truly want them to enjoy their food and experience at all costs, and that keeps us coming back. also, i have another lavo location here in ny that i've dined at before to get a fix for my favorites, but its just nowhere near as delish. they cook with extra love at this vegas location, totally worth flying out 5 hours for! sidenote, i'm disappointed to see they closed their nightclub part. had really good times there last year (retroactive shoutouts to the chocolate cutie who used to work there named noah ;-) now they just have a cocktail/hookah lounge, that was actually closed on the sunday we went so place was pretty quiet and chill. its all good, we had limos and bottles waiting elsewhere to turn up, this dinner was still worth all of our attention!", 
            "food was good, service was great. we started with a salumi platter which had prosciutto, salami, cheeses and bread. i had the <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark> which was wonderfully prepared, crisp seasoned crust on the outside, juicy in the inside with a light sauce and fresh tomatoes. my co-diners had pasta which were giant portions.\n\nwe sat on the outside patio which was really pleasant right on the strip.\n\ngreat drinks too!", 
            "this place is awesome!! this is our second time dining here and it never disappoints. we had the <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, dover sole, shrimp scampi, spaghetti with meatballs which are all terrific. the music playing in the background are upbeat pop sounds. most of the diners that come here wear business casual but i saw some in shorts and flip flops.\n\nwe will definitely go back here..",

(i split the main course with someone else.) seemed like a lot of food even for me. \n\nafter dinner, we made our way to the second level which had a more of a club vibe, great tunes and they gave away free drink to the ladies from 11 to 1, i think. which was great for half our party. definitely a place for bachelorette party. definitely where the ladies are.",

            "this is a nice little intimate restaurant and i really enjoyed my visit here. my friends and i came here and we had way more to eat than we could handle! for appetizers we got the calamari, garlic bread dip, and caesar salad. the calamari was so yummy, lighted battered and fried, not overly greasy and soggy. both the garlic bread and calamari came with a marinara dipping sauce which was a nice compliment to the dish. then we ordered the crusted baked salmon, thin crust pizza, <mark>Chicken Marsala</mark>, and zucchini strings. the crusted baked salmon and zucchini strings were probably my favorite dishes out of everything. the salmon had a nice crunchy baked crust on the outside and was tender and juicy on the inside. not too bland either, salmon tends to be if you don't prepare it right. i tend to like fried stuff so maybe that's why i was drawn to the zucchini strings. little bits of zucchini lighted fried, i do wish they had a dipping sauce for it, but it was like eating little veggie fries. the <mark>Chicken Marsala</mark> was a bit heavier to eat. it had a lot of sauce and cheese, but the chicken wasn't too dry. the thin crust pizza was a nice addition to our meal. just a simple cheese, marinara, <mark>Spaghetti Fresh Tomato and Basil</mark> pizza on a nice warm crust, yum! this restaurant fits in with the italian feel of the palazzo. you wouldn't think it was an italian restaurant when you first walk in with the lighted candles and fancy modern d\\u00e9cor, you'd probably expect the checked red and white table clothes instead. our table was right by the window so we got a great view of fireworks from the ti show across the street.\n\nthe club is also worth mentioning. the downstairs restaurant becomes a lounge at night and upstairs is a full club. the first time we were there on a saturday night it was way too packed so it was hard to move around and dance without being bumped into. the second time we came on a sunday night it was a better crowd. they aren't as pushy and rude like they are at tao, probably because tao has a younger crowd. they play good music, all of the latest and greatest and more hip hop r&b kind of stuff, i hate it when they play too many techno or trance songs! how do you dance to those? the d\\u00e9cor of the club is very similar to tao in the venetian, very dim and lots of dancers.", 
            "we checked out lavo last thursday night and i was pleased with our food, but incredibly disappointed with the service, which is why the rating is 2 stars. \n\nafter being seated and taking our drink orders, we were quickly deserted by our waiter. we sat for several minutes before a woman came over to tell us about the specials and then she disappeared. our waiter eventually came back and took our orders, but we were able to order our appetizers and entrees because we'd been sitting for so long. \n\ni ordered the lavolini - prosecco, passion fruit, st. germain - this was an excellent drink and was very refreshing. \n\nour group started out with orders of the <mark>Crispy Fried Calamari</mark>, spedini ala romano and the kobe beef rice ball. we also ordered the salad special, which was a delicious mix of arugula, heirloom tomatoes and a soft italian cheese (maybe stracchino, but i can't remember and it isn't on the menu).  the table was pleased with our starters. the spedini was delicious and salty, so be warned if you aren't a fan of salt. the calamari was delicate, and for a non-calamari fan, i thought it was good.\n\ni ordered the spaghetti with <mark>Spaghetti Fresh Tomato and Basil</mark>. the <mark>Spaghetti Fresh Tomato and Basil</mark> had me sold as we'd been eating out all week. the spaghetti noodles had a nice bite to them and the <mark>Spaghetti Fresh Tomato and Basil</mark> sauce was excellent. i ate quite a bit on my plate and still had enough to pack up and take back. i definitely could have split this portion with another person and still could have had plenty leftover. \n\nour waiter returned and took plates to pack for leftovers, but forgot about two orders our table wanted packed up to go and threw them out. he did take them off the bill, but those two guests were very disappointed that they didn't get to take their food home. \n\nif we'd had a different waiter, this rating would definitely be higher. not only was he slow, he had the attitude that he was something special and we should be honored to have him serve us. he also didn't take time to observe the table to see who was in charge at the table, and instead of going to that person, he automatically went to the lone man at the table.\n\nso, go for the food and atmosphere, but hope you don't get the same server we had.",

            "came here for drinks & appetizers with some friends and were treated extremely well by the staff, which all looked like models of course. it was sort of an odd hour, after gambling in palazzo, so the place wasn't too happening yet. ambient music was being mixed by an on-site dj so that was cool. we shared a few things... calamari (decent), <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> w/ avacado (refreshing), kobe meatball w/ <mark>Meatball with Sausage Ragu</mark> (amazing), & <mark>Spaghetti Carbonara</mark> (so creamy rich i had to drink something after each bite... but still excellent). great decor but what the real trip was the restroom sinks. my first though walking into the restrooms, \"damn, those are some tall urinals\" hahaha which were actually sinks  but shaped like some sort of rituallistic cyllinders. fyi: they're not motion sensored so stop waving your hands like an idiot and use the foot pedal!",

(this wasn't off-putting for us, since it was a fun atmosphere.)\n\nthe portions are quite large and worth the price. they are known for their giant meatballs, which we unfortunately did not sample. however, they do provide free garlic bread with marinara which the table fought over.\n\nthe ambiance gives off fun vibes, but it is very noisy.\n\nif you dine there, you get free admission to the club upstairs.",

            "great spot!  wish we'd had room for dessert.  \n\nwe had a 10 pm reservation for lavo because we were going to a show first and didn't want to be rushed.  we actually arrived early and the staff was able to seat us a little before 10, we spent the time before that enjoying a drink in the bar.\n\nthe space is great - dark, with djs, good seating and a nice atmosphere.  the staff was very friendly and while the music in the bar was loud, as it should be, it was not too loud at the table.\n\ni would probably have given lavo a 4 which is, ya know, as good as it gets but our server, rina, was amazing.  besides the fact that she was simply adorable and had an awesome personality, she genuinely seemed to enjoy her job.  she made suggestions, asked lots of questions, and checked with the chef on a few things for the gluten-free friend in our group of five.  we also walked out with two restaurant recommendations from her for our next trip to traverse city, mi where i go for work every may.\n\nthree of us ordered off the menu and two got specials.  the red snapper got rave reviews and should probably be put on the menu based on what we heard not only from the person in our party but also rina.  the lamb, while huge, was also amazing.  there was a great deal of tasting going on around our table :)  k and n both got the ravioli and loved it - the portion of this dish was probably the most perfect.  i went with the army surplus sized <mark>Penne Alla Vodka</mark> with prosciuto and peas.  it was incredible (but huge) although i thought the peas were a little hard.  not sure why that would be.  \n\nthe wine list is fantastic and the environment is fun.  we especially loved that even though the space is dark everything is lit from the bottom giving the fresco-ish tiles an ethereal glow.  amazing, amazing, amazing - thank you, rina!", 
            "i visited on a wednesday evening with one guest at 9:30pm. here for restaurant week.\n\nverdict: come here if you want a great italian meal before you bring your expensive entourage of fine ladies to your table at marquee. don't come here if you want to bring kids or to escape the common heathen scene: it's too loud and people look like they're heading to a club.\n\nambiance: 4/5\nyes, it is nice: dark interiors with mediterranean accents set the stage, with each choice lighting proving a visual delight. the house music pumping through the air reminds you that this is also a nightclub. the cons: can be too loud/raunchy to be considered intimate, dark enough to make your eyes strain, and tables are too close together. my guest's seat got run into by a rushing waiter.\n\nservice: 4/5\nreservations process was smooth? check. greeted and seated with a smile? check. genuine and sincere service, even though things were busy? check. table checks throughout the dinner? check. what they missed: in between our table checks our glasses were empty. we were 3/4ths of a way through our entrees, which proved to be heavy-handed on the salt so we needed water to continue. our waiter was either on break or dealing with someone else, but no busser was available. finally got filled 5min. later. not end of the world, but not 5 stars. \n\nfood: 4/5\nkobe carpaccio is all sorts of buttery and yummy: full-bodied yet not salty. the kobe rice balls, while balanced, is reminiscent of risotto. our bread that came at the same time have herbs and butter baked on, with marinara for dipping. my <mark>Penne Alla Vodka</mark> was perfectly al dente. strong bacon flavor. however, salt levels became intolerable. a pity, because it is a well flavored dish but someone was heavy-handed with the salt. dessert: might be an italian thing, but they were quite heavy. tiramisu was too creamy for my preferences, and did not pair with either entree. the cheesecake was large, light, and sweet. kinda like how i like that one guy out of shaolin soccer. btw, food was timely. \n\nvalue: 4/5\nportion sizes are filling. not mcmullan's-ginormous-irish-nachos, but we brought back dessert. plus, you definitely taste the quality of the ingredients. now, i am comparing this place to panevino, trattoria nakamura-ya (yes, i know traditional italian does not have uni, but this is my review and uni pasta is my postmodern italian), cuigino's, and olive garden (lol, i had to): this ranks #3, with trattoria easily leading and this following panevino quite closely. no, olive garden did not rank. thank you for participating in restaurant week! \n\nmood: i'm full. it's been a while since i party-rocked. where's the water and the party?\n\ntotal rating: 3.5/5 base rating, +0.5 for good mood, 4/5", 
            "*** review for spring restaurant week 2014 menu ***\n\nwhat a great way to end restaurant week!  i had a reservation and asked to be seated on the patio (the terrace, the occupancy sign says).  the sun was in my face for about 15 minutes before going before going behind treasure island.  it was a great evening to sit out and enjoy the outstanding las vegas weather.\n\ni was seated a few seconds when my server, casey, came and took my drink order.  my iced tea was delivered quickly.  a different server came to take my order.  there was no restaurant week menu sheet with my regular menu so she just told me some of the choices.  after making my choices, a runner came by with aluminum foil wrapped garlic bread with a dish of marinara on the side.  super garlic bread and very good marinara!\n\nback to ordering.  for course one, i went with <mark>Crispy Fried Calamari</mark>.  it came with a side of the same tasty marinara as the garlic bread.  the serving size was huge.  this would definitely be an appetizer to share with one or two other people.  i sent almost half of it back so as not to fill up on calamari but i could have finished the plate.  lightly breaded and fried lightly, it was very good!\n\ni chose the <mark>Penne Alla Vodka</mark> for course two.  it was a good sized serving and it was very good.  i slowly ate the penne enjoying each bite and forcing myself to have more garlic bread.\n\nfor dessert, i opted for the raspberry cheesecake.  the cheesecake was lightly flavored with raspberry--just barely noticeable.  the top was crisp from lightly torching the top like you would a cr\\u00e8me br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e.  there were several black cherries on the plate that was a good accompaniment for the cheesecake.\n\nservice was excellent.  casey came by often and topped off my iced tea, dishes were removed promptly by bus people, and my check was taken for payment by someone who had not been at my table at all.  it was a case of everyone watching how all the guests were doing."

            "this review is for the restaurant, not the nightclub. \n\nour second night in vegas and i'm in the mood for some italian. the first thing i thought of was lavo, because i had heard they recently opened and are from the same people who brought us tao. wasn't really sure what to expect food-wise, but i figured we might as well try it. \n\nfirst, the atmosphere: definitely a club first and a restaurant second. a dj stood ready off to the side of the bar area, which was obviously going to be the dance floor once they got all the tables out of the way. the decor is like a combination of an old mediterranean villa and a nyc nightclub. one thing that struck me as funny was what the waiters were wearing -- white shirt with an open collar, apron, and black suspenders. it looked like that scene in godfather when clemenza was teaching michael how to make sauce, because everyone in the room was dressed like clemenza. anyway, on to the food...\n\nappetizer: i had a giant caesar salad, which was really enough for two or three people. i only ate about a quarter of it, but it was good. my friend had their signature rice ball, stuffed with kobe beef. i tried a little bit of it and it was absolutely superb. ridiculously good. \n\nmain course: <mark>Rigatoni Melanzana</mark> (rigatoni pasta with eggplant). pretty good, but nothing special. i've had the same type of dish at many other italian places before, and, honestly, it's not the best i've ever had. but not the worst.\n\ndessert: chocolate bread pudding. i can say without a doubt that this might be the best dessert i have ever had. rich, thick bread pudding that looked almost like strips of french toast, infused with chocolate and drizzled with butterscotch. wow. that dessert really made the whole dinner worthwhile. \n\n so all in all, not the best italian place i've ever been to, but the service was quick, the people were nice, and the decor was nice, if not a little amusing. maybe next time i'll go back and see how the club is.",

            "i literally licked my plate. yes i was a wee bit intoxicated but it was 100% justified.\n\nmy boss and his wife raved about how freaking amazing their kobe meatballs are. i prepared myself for potential over hype, but they lived up to all expectations.\n\ngoing a step back, we arrived on time for our 8pm reservation and had to wait as the place was super busy with it being the last night of ces. a slight nudge and the management did what every restaurant should do, they bought us a round of drinks. just as we were going to sweet talk our way into a 2nd round, our table was ready.\n\nthis place is sexy, though due to ces the male:female ratio was skewed to sausage. it is at this point that my boss taught me a life lesson. rather than deal with the back and forth after asking 'what does everyone feel like eating?', simply tell your server to pick their favourites for you. now this is assuming the server isn't useless. \n\nas i forget the sequence of arrival, here we go:\n\ngreen salad - helped with carb guilt\ncalamari - perfectly cooked, well spiced\na-5 kobe <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark> - what transpired in my mouth was a little intimate. wow^2.\n<mark>Rigatoni Melanzana</mark> - it had a generous dollop of buffalo mozzarella. enough said.\n<mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark> - delicate, butter ocean joy.\n<mark>Bone-In Rib Eye</mark> with a side of garlic herb butter - juicy, tofu-tender, carnivore heaven. i chewed the meat on the bone with pride.\ndeep fried oreos - i thought my boss was joking ordering such a thing at this kind of place, but he insisted. dipped in gelato, they were magical enough for me to lick my plate clean.\n\ni shall return. tongue out."

            "the way through my heart is through my tummy and lavo has managed to steal my heart and leave my tummy craving for more. we were looking for a nice place to dine and decided to come here. dinner for two anyone? we began with the baked clam oreganato, delishhh! perfect amount of garlic and spices, and oh so extremely yummy. next was the <mark>Penne Seafood Alfredo</mark>, had the biggest most succulent shrimp i've ever eaten i was glad that the sauce lacked that fishy, shrimpy taste some places tend to have. the penne itself was right on al dente so if you like your pasta a little on the softer side you should def be sure to request it.  the portions were big, so much so we ordered an appetizer, entree, and two sides and had no choice but to skip dessert. we aren't small people the bf and i, we can eat and needless to say we were both full and even had leftovers afterwards. as for the sides we had the baby asparagus, which seemed regular sized to me but hey i'm not complaining they were also good, and the <mark>Mixed Wild Mushrooms</mark> just added to the entire meal. overall my taste buds were please throughout the entire meal course. i would definitely go back, matter of fact i tried to the following day. it was the bf's turn to pick and that i will review next. i also had a cocktail off their menu, i believe it was a sicilian sun. i wasn't too phased by the drink but only because it was more on the stronger side when i was craving fruity and refreshing. the service was excellent, our server was very attentive. i wish i could remember his name to actually give him credit, it might have been alex? idk. i also inquired about the club which takes place later in the evening on the upper part and lounge area of the restaurant and he gladly stamped us so that we'd be able to bypass the admission line/fee later. i was kind of sad i didn't get to try their meatball appetizer, but i will make sure to go back do so the next time around. i heart lavo and if you decide to dine here, i'm sure you will too.", 
            "nice beautiful place. the food was okay.\nappetizers: calamari, beet salad, and <mark>Spicy Lobster Bisque</mark> - total recommend\nentrees: penne ala vodka and <mark>Penne Seafood Alfredo</mark> was under cook.", 
            "restaurant review (yelp needs to create separate entries for places that are restaurants and clubs...it's hard to weed through reviews!)\n\nmy friend and i felt like having italian while we were in vegas, so we decided to try lavo.  the service was great, but to the point where it got kind of ridiculous...someone was checking up on us almost every 5 minutes during our meal so it felt like too many interruptions.  \n\nour waiter recommended the meatball appetizer, which turned out to be pretty good...it was the size of a softball and good enough for 4 girls to share.  it was flavorful, but not spectacular.  we were hoping our entrees would turn out better, but things went downhill from there.  i had the <mark>Penne Seafood Alfredo</mark>, which was shrimps and scallops in a light cream alfredo sauce.  it was so incredibly salty that i only finished a fourth of my plate.  my boyfriend ordered the <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark>.  the fish itself was well cooked, but it was lacking in flavor.  we also had an order to <mark>Roasted Rosemary Potatoes</mark> with sweet caramelized onions, which was also salty.", 
            "one of my most favorite places to eat & pourty while in vegas!\n\ni went here last weekend with some gal pals and once again, such a delightful experience.  the food is soo delicious.  i tried to warn my friends that we would get full real fast, but they were starving and excited to eat.  first off, i am not a marinara fan, but the marinara sauce they bring out w/ the garlic bread is definitely the best i've ever had.  it is a great dipping sauce to an even more awesome garlic bread.  for appetizers we got some calamari, and a kobe meatball on top of a arugula <mark>Meatball with Salad and Garlic Crostini</mark>.  after this, we were already so pleased, satisfied, and pretty much full, yet we went forward w/ our entrees.  i got the special ravioli of the night, filled <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark> cheese, soo good.  the other gals got the shrimp scampi and <mark>Penne Seafood Alfredo</mark>.  both were also winners.  \n\nafter we stuffed our face til we just couldn't stuff it no more, we changed into our flats (it's vegas... heels in the club can only last you so long, and you don't want to walk barefoot on those streets either!) and went to the lavo lounge/club portion.  luckily, we were staying at the palazzo, so we were able to bypass the long line and get in para gratis.  the upstairs club  is pretty small, compared to the other ones on the strip, but it was still on and crackin'.  we danced a little, then went back downstairs to the lounge and kicked it outside and danced.  the outside patio is perfect cuz it is right on the strip, and you can watch the sirens show at ti.  it also helps that the weather was about 101 degrees, so it was a beautiful night.  so, we danced the night away outside, inside, upstairs etc.  great selection of music both upstairs and downstairs. \n\nlavo is just fabulous! great food, great service, great music, and possible celebrity sightings... (last time i saw robin leach & a playboy bunny).  definitely a must every time i am in vegas.",

            "ugh. as if i havent sung this place enough praises, here i am writing another review for it. so, second time in vegas for 4th of july vaca. brought a new group of girls to indulge with me and everything was just as delicious as i last left it. from the time they bring you the garlic bread and marinara, just lean back and unbuckle your belt/corsets to make room, cause everything is so effing delicious. apparently i fell into a trance and started licking the sauce off the table with my fingers. wow. moving on, i had my <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark> with a side of mushrooms, it was perfection as usual. others ordered a risotto, a <mark>Penne Seafood Alfredo</mark>, rave reviews on the texture and freshness for both, a marinara pizza, long classic flavorful, a <mark>Spicy Lobster Bisque</mark>, not my fave, they make theirs taste too gingery i find, but it does have big delish chunks of lobster. but let me bring it back because the mvp of our dinner was the calamari. again, wow, simples done right, nice and crisp tight batter and the meaty perfectly sized hoops, again dunking into that heavenly marinara. once again, i haven't made it as far as desert cause we're always so stuffed before entrees even come, portions are huge, plus the drinks are great, we always enjoy gummi bear shots, and sparkling selections. ugh, just so much winning to do here. service was kind and prompt as usual, last hear we had a really cool brunette guy who comped us some shots, this time we had a lady with a short blunt cut bob, she was very nice and cautious of bringing everything quickly for us, knowing that we had to go somewhere after, and she even comped a dish for a girl who felt the pasta in her alfredo was a little too hard, and brought out a recooked version out of courtesy. thats good service in my book, treat your customers like you truly want them to enjoy their food and experience at all costs, and that keeps us coming back. also, i have another lavo location here in ny that i've dined at before to get a fix for my favorites, but its just nowhere near as delish. they cook with extra love at this vegas location, totally worth flying out 5 hours for! sidenote, i'm disappointed to see they closed their nightclub part. had really good times there last year (retroactive shoutouts to the chocolate cutie who used to work there named noah ;-) now they just have a cocktail/hookah lounge, that was actually closed on the sunday we went so place was pretty quiet and chill. its all good, we had limos and bottles waiting elsewhere to turn up, this dinner was still worth all of our attention!",

            "my sister and i ate dinner at lavo on saturday night. we had 7:15 pm reservations and even though it was a tad early to eat by vegas standards, the restaurant was pretty full. the tables for two are a little close together, but you still feel as if you have your own space and i really didn't overhear either of our neighbor's conversations.\n\nour meal started with two glasses of sauvignon blanc and complimentary garlic bread. the garlic bread portion was huge and a great side for our meals. for entrees, my sister had the <mark>Chicken Parmigiano</mark>, i had the <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, and we split a <mark>Sea Salt Baked Potato</mark>. our waitress graciously mentioned to my sister that her meal did not include pasta in case she wanted to add that (she didn't). once we saw the size of the chicken parm, i can see why it doesn't come with pasta! her piece of chicken was the size of her plate! needless to say she wasn't able to eat the whole thing, but she loved every bite that she did have. my <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, which was a nice thick slice, was cooked to perfection - it was flaky and just melted in my mouth. the <mark>Sea Salt Baked Potato</mark> was a great size (thank goodness we shared it), but could have used just a touch more salt. for dessert, we shared the chocolate cake roll. in keeping with the theme of our meal, it was gigantic. easily four people could have shared that dessert. the cake was delicious and light which was good since we were pretty full from our entrees.\n\nour waitress was very nice and did a great job of checking on us through the night. she also didn't rush us as we took our time with dessert and finishing our wine. the food does come out rather quickly - it couldn't have been more than ten minutes from the time we ordered until the time food appeared at our table. lavo does a great job with table turnover, so even if you walk in without a reservation, you probably won't have to wait too long. prices are actually really reasonable - after tax and tip, my share of the bill was $82.\n\ni would definitely eat at lavo on a future visit and will be recommending it to friends who are traveling to vegas in the near future.",

            "lavo should be known for their meatballs and panna cotta cheesecake!!\n\n*this review is for the restaurant only*\n\nafter hearing that lavo had the best meatballs in town and good food overall, i just had to go and try it for myself. we came here with my good friends from hawaii. i made reservations on a week night when there was no special event going on at the nightclub, hoping it would be less crowded.\n\nat first, service was good. we had 3 different servers who said that they would all be helping us. however, after our drinks were delivered, we got stuck with one server, who was kind of an airhead. i'll be nice and not mention her name, but this is how it went down. we were all obviously ready to order because our menus were closed and stacked nicely on one corner of the table.\nserver: \"are you all ready to order, or do we need a few more minutes?\"\nus: \"we're ready.\"\nserver: \"i'll give you a few more minutes.\"\nus: \"umm, we just said we were ready.\"\nserver: \"oh ok, go ahead.\"\nthen later that night....\nserver: \"are you still working on this or do you want me to take the plate out of your way?\"\nmy friend: \"still working on it.\"\nserver: *reaches out to grab the plate*\nmy friend:\" no, i am still working on it!\"\nserver: \"oh, ok.\"\ngeeez, she had serious issues! also note that we ate here right after they opened, so the place wasn't crazy loud at the time. if she's deaf, she shouldn't be a server. she really needs to get her act together! horrible!\n\nanyway, the food was awesome and we all enjoyed our dinner. we ordered the <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark>. good thing we split it between the 4 of us because it was huge! very flavorful and melted in my mouth! i wanted more, so i ordered the spaghetti with kobe meatballs. my husband ordered the <mark>New York Strip</mark> steak and said it was one of the best steaks he ever had. now i know what to order next time! our friends ordered the <mark>Chicken Parmigiano</mark> (also huge) and some other pasta dish. and now for the best part, dessert!! thanks to my friends, i am now addicted to the panna cotta cheesecake! i don't know how to explain it, except to say that is was a big delicious slice of heavenly, creamy berry goodness! sometimes cheesecakes can be too rich, but this one was light and not overly sweet. slices are big enough for 2 people to share, but i honestly think i could eat the entire thing on my own. i would seriously do a take out order, just for the cheesecake!\n\ndefinitely looking forward to coming back and trying other items on the menu. hopefully, service will be better next time!",

            "loved loved loved the food. \n\nmy guy took me here for my bday, and it was amazing.  it helped that we ordered everything on the menu.  here goes the food: \n\ngarlic bread - omg amazing. it was so tasty.  the nice thing is that this was the bread served at the table.  looks like its baked upon being seated.  it was fresh and accompanied with tomato sauce. \n<mark>Spinach and Artichoke</mark> pizza - 2 foot pizza.  it was so tasty and definitely something that can be shared at the table.  it was flaky and full of flavor.\nkobe meatball - okay, i don't eat meat...but i was told this was to die for.  also, our waiter told us that this is one of their signature dishes.  \nceasar salad - definitely large enough to be shared at the table.  we didn't even finish it.  but it was tasty and flavorful.  croutons were well done. \n<mark>Center Cut <mark>Bone-In Filet Mignon</mark></mark> - again, i dont eat meat but i was told it was cooked to perfection. \n<mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark> - yummy, full of flavor, accompanied with tomatos. \n<mark>Polenta Fries</mark> - omg....so good.  i'm still thinking about this today. \noreo filled pastries with ice cream - yummy...how can you go wrong? \n\nless one star because i've been to the club...and it's small, stuffy, and i wasn't too jazzed about it.  \n\nmy new favorite restaurant in vegas!", 
            "the 4 stars is for their restaurant- not their club. we had a reservation for 7 for my friend's birthday dinner. we ended up waiting for 20 minutes, and the manager apologized and brought us a round of drinks of our choice, which isn't such a shabby way to start dinner. \n\nthe atmosphere is perfect for a group of friends or family on a special occasion- the decor, lighting, and the music is something straight out of your dreams. \n\nwith 7 hungry girls, we shared 6 plates and a salad, with leftovers! the highlight dishes were <mark>Linguini With Mixed Seafood</mark> linguini and rigatoni melenzana (both were so tasty! and huge portions!). i ordered the grilled swordfish which is perfect in every way- light, salty, and citrusy, but the portion is not for sharing. \n\nthe <mark>Spinach and Artichoke</mark> pizza was pretty good, but not memorable, while the ravioli and <mark>Spaghetti Carbonara</mark> were average. \n\ndon't order the fries. just enjoy the complimentary garlic bread instead.", 
            "wow.  lavo love.  this place was great.  first, big points for accommodating a last minute reservation for 15 people.  nice big table in the middle of a energetic restaurant.  i'm sure the restaurant was beautiful too, but frankly i was so focused on the well-prepared and abundant food that i really didn't notice the decor.\n\nwe started off with some amazing garlic bread served with marinara--delicious!  and an amazing looking kobe meatball (i don't eat meat) that easily was an appetizer for 4-6 people.  i had a terrific heirloom tomato bufala mozzarella salad with fig basalmic.  for my main course i decided on a carb fest and ordered a <mark>Spinach and Artichoke</mark> pizza, with black olives and roasted garlic.  the pizza was about 5 inches wide by two feet long, could easily have served 2-3 people and lasted me well into breakfast the next day.  i also tasted their <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark> that was excellent as well.\n\nthe food was plentiful to be sure, but was prepared with style and finesse.  lavo is on my list of restaurants not to miss when visiting vegas!", 
            "i think i've always had a negative attitude about lavo because it is associated with being a night club and located in a vegas casino.  those two factors alone always seem to always bring my expectation of food down.  lavo proved me wrong.  i was pleasantly surprised with the caliber of food and service at our recent outing as a big bachelorette party group.\n\nthe food:\ngarlic bread (compliementary) - super garlicky and butter and perfectly crispy.  just the way i like it\n\nmeatball - they have a choice of meatballs and i thought that it would be a few meatballs, but this was one huge tasty meatball on a bed of fresh greens and flavorful <mark>Meatball with Salad and Garlic Crostini</mark>\n\n<mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> - refreshing mix of chopped tuna and avocado.  not bad.\n\nkobe stuffed rice balls - aracini stuffed with kobe beef.  interesting, yummy and filling.\n\n<mark>New York Strip</mark> steak - we ordered medium because we were sharing family style.  actually cooked perfectly and delicious\n\nrigatoni sausage bolognese - the rigatoni itself was al dente.  nothing impressive about the sauce.  \n\n<mark>Spinach and Artichoke</mark> pizza - soggy pizza.  enough said.\n\n<mark>Crispy Zucchini</mark> - deep fried shoestring zucchini.  yum!!\n\n<mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark> - .... what garlic?\n\nservice:\nwas it me or were all the servers handsome male models?  the service was actually really attentive.  waters were filled, wine glasses never empty, napkins folded whenever we went off to the restroom.\n\nconclusion:  i would say that the restaurant offers a nice variety of crowd pleasers with some nice service and eye candy.  overall, 3.5 stars because the food was a mix of mediocre to very good food.  definitely not your momma's homemade italian, but good for a fun night out on the strip and you can get a view of treasure island's pirate show's fireworks if you're positioned towards window.", 
            "amazing as always. for those who complain about reservations and getting pagers, they can't control when people sit there talking for hours after they're done eating. the experience is worth the 10 minute wait. on a friday night at 9:30pm, we were seated in 2 minutes. \n\nthe restaurant has a live dj, and the atmosphere is a little loud. there was an older couple next to us who really didn't like the music (typical dance music with some 90s remixes), but there was a few bachelorette parties who seemed to enjoy it. \n\ntheir signature drinks are amazing (try the white tiger) or call your own. the bartenders are friendly and have a heavy hand if you put your phone down and talk to them. \n\nfood. beef carpaccio is worth every penny if you're into the raw stuff. after trying it at dozens of restaurants in vegas, i can say hands down, this is the best. the pizzas are to die for, and the <mark>Spinach and Artichoke</mark> is no exception. <mark>Spaghetti and Meatballs</mark> is great to if you want pasta, and the steaks are just as great if you're craving meat. i'm not a seafood person but people i've gone with, rave about the fish as well. the (free) garlic bread they bring you, will fill you up as well because you can't stop eating it. \n\nwhen you're done, try the oreo zeppole and hope you've saved room. they're battered and deep fried and come out very soft. the other desserts are good, but this one is the best - ask your server, it's the most popular. \n\nneedless to say, i will keep coming back.", 
            "our friend heard about the giant kobe beef meatballs so i made an open table reservation within the hour and we walked over from our hotel!  the staff was very friendly and welcoming and we got a booth in the corner which was warm and inviting!  we decided to eat family style and get a taste of everything.  we were served complimentary garlic bread served with a tomato based sauce which was tasty.  we ordered a beet salad and the beets were good but the dressing was a bit on the sour side.  then we had the kobe meatball cut into four and it was humongous, tasty and filling!  good thing we split it.  next was the salmon oregano which was a hearty portion and very moist and delish.  the ending dish was the <mark>Spinach and Artichoke</mark> pizza which was hardy and had tasty mushrooms but nothing spectacular compared to the salmon.  all in all a tasty dining experience.", 
            "incredible, so yum, beautiful i don't know what else to say. reservation for 8 people at 9:00 and sat right down. we were starving so jumped right into to the complimentary garlic bread with marinara dipping sauce.  \n\nlike i said, we were starving and our service was relatively slow so i was getting antsy, but one my seared tuna with sundried tomatoes <mark>Spinach and Artichoke</mark> came out i was happy. food stellar. i'm a pescaterian at the moment so i had to pass on the signature meatballs unfortunately. \n\nwarning-still water comes at a hefty price, we were blinded by the price and needed up getting charged $56 for water. $56 for water is ridiculous. would have like some warning on that one but you live and learn.\n\nthe restaurant was beautiful and the italian infused dishes are so tastes but this only gets 4 stars for some spotty service."

            "i don't know what lavo's nightclub is like, but based on three dining experiences here, i will keep coming back for the food. the latest outing was to take advantage of some attractive restaurant week offerings. \n\nwe chose patio dining this time, and i was surprised to see that my party of four were seated directly across from the ti show, which we actually saw while we dined. as far as the show is concerned, i liked it better in its earlier sea battle incarnation minus the sexy sirens. \n\nmanagement was much more rigid this year than last when during restaurant week they graciously substituted veal parmesan for chicken parmesan at no additional cost, and agreed to substitute alfredo sauce for marinara sauce to cover a pounded veal cutlet. even though i offered to pay an extra charge if required, the waitress apologetically reported that the manager said that absolutely no substitutions would be allowed on restaurant week menu selections, including changing a sauce. but the requested substitution of one sauce for another was permitted at no extra charge when my wife ordered the veal parmesan from the regular, higher priced menu. this technicality struck me as rather petty--especially since the requested accommodations were made during restaurant week 2010. but at least requested lemon aioli was provided gratis to go with the calamari, and service all night was otherwise excellent. \n\ncomplimentary buttery and crunchy baked garlic bread served with a very mellow marinara sauce was an excellent beginning. and, the blond rings of calamari were all soft, tender, and delicious, whether with just a few added drops of lemon, dipped in the marinara sauce, or dunked in the smooth lemon aioli. \n\na chopped \"louie\" salad served as a first course was probably miscast. this lovely dish was an entree in itself. featuring many pieces of cold shrimp and large hunks of chilled lobster, along with cherry tomatoes, zucchini, red pimento, black olives, celery, and pepperoncini all tossed in a light house vinaigrette dressing, it was a great salad. the salad was presented with an 18-inch cheese stick on top that extended well beyond both sides of the plate. this cheesy bread product was praiseworthy in its own right. \n\n<mark>Brick Oven Salmon Oreganato</mark>, prepared with seasoned breadcrumbs, lemon, white wine, sun-dried tomatoes, and garlic butter, was moist and flavorful. and, it rested atop moist but slightly crunchy julienned vegetables that included zucchini. this was one of the few restaurants i have been where diners are asked whether they would like their fish to be prepared \"medium\" or some other degree of doneness. i stuck to medium, and was happy with the result. \n\npounded veal covered generously with mozzarella cheese and alfredo sauce was also tender and light but a bit too salty. a fellow diner pronounced his <mark>Center Cut <mark>Bone-In Filet Mignon</mark></mark> and the bearnaise sauce that accompanied it \"good.\" the visibly pink inside of the meat was clearly cooked medium rare as ordered. and, glistening <mark>Roasted Rosemary Potatoes</mark> served in a skillet were moist, buttery, and fork tender. they were an excellent choice for a side. \n\ntwo premium desserts shared the stage to complete a memorable repast: tiramisu and strawberry cheese cake. the tiramisu was moist and creamy, and obviously made with mascarpone, chocolate, some alcoholic beverage, and some coffee flavoring. they were respectively marsala wine and espresso. the strawberry cheese cake was delicious but surprisingly light.  its crust was crumbly and tasty. \n\nboth desserts were pretty looking, as well. the bi-level tiramisu reminded me of a log cabin with its six edible lady finger logs glued together with mascarpone. and, the strawberry cheese cake featured white upper and lower layers of <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark> cheese, and a pink middle layer of strawberry cream. its top was adorned with bright red strawberry sauce and three strawberry slices, and resting beside this delectable dessert was a high mound of whipped cream and more oozing strawberry sauce. \n\nit was a great meal, but i dread getting on the scale in the morning!", 
            "this review is for the restaurant only. we had reservations to dine here on a friday night. we showed up a few minutes prior and seating promptly at our reservation time. we had a large party of 8. the service was excellent. food was delicious. i had the <mark>Center Cut <mark>Bone-In Filet Mignon</mark></mark> and the asparagus.  i also tried a meatball which was good too. i tried a bite of the deep fried oreos which were to die for and others raved about the strawberry shortcake. we really enjoyed our meal here and would absolutely recommend it for fine dining on the strip.", 
            "my friends and i ate here on a friday night and we all had mixed reviews.  the atmosphere was amazing minus the music.  they had a dj playing nightclub music at 8pm.  it felt strange for an italian restaurant, but not a big deal.  the hostess was a bit standoffish, but our waiter was fabulous. very friendly with lots of recommendations.  our calamari appetizer was amazing and the drinks were all food.  i had the 8oz <mark>Center Cut <mark>Bone-In Filet Mignon</mark></mark> and it did not disappoint. so tender i was able to cut it with a fork.  my husband had the recommended spaghetti and meat balls and he felt it was good, but not great.  chicken parm was ok, ahi tuna good, and the risotto was excellent.  the bill split evenly for 6 people came to $80 a person with tip.  not terrible.  \n\na little disappointing was the fact that the lounge was closed, which we thought odd for a friday night.  but, to compensate, they gave us free admission to their extremely popular tao nightclub.  all in all a decent experience.", 
            "got to finally venture out and try lavo the other night (i tend to stay away from the strip since i work there) and i'm so glad i did! i ordered off the restaurant week menu and got the <mark>Center Cut <mark>Bone-In Filet Mignon</mark></mark> meatballs, chicken parmesan, and dessert for $50.15. the appetizer and entree were delicious! the chicken parmesan was a large portion, definitely worth the value and was seasoned to perfection. great flavor. they also had a really good blueberry cocktail that i recommend! the dessert... ehh i would pass (and dessert is typically my favorite part of a meal). tried 2 different ones and both were average or less i would say. aside from the dessert though, great service and meal!", 
            "this place is awesome, so good the first night we went back the second. amazing meatball, bread and all the food!! our server was jacobo, he was great!\n\nmy wife had the <mark>Center Cut <mark>Bone-In Filet Mignon</mark></mark> two nights in a row, said it was the best steak she's ever had. i had two different pasta dishes that were incredible. we were just in rome a couple month's ago and this was better than anything i had in italy. albeit it's a bit on the pricey side, the food and service is absolutely worth it!", 
            "last night we had dinner at lavo. we were looking for a good italian place and having gone to the night club on several occasions we thought it would be good. the restaurant is beautiful and the staff is awesome... the food however is horrible. every single item we ordered was not only bad it was amateur cooking night at best. i started off with a basic salad which literally tasted like lettuce drenched in a vat of vinegar and red onion. it was so acidic i felt like my tongue had been rubbed on the carpet. i then ordered the buffalo mozzarella and heirloom tomatoes i literally could've gotten better quality at the local grocery store. i almost never salt my food and literally had to because it was bland and flavorless.  my husband ordered the bone in <mark>Center Cut <mark>Bone-In Filet Mignon</mark></mark> which had to be returned because it was so overcooked and dry we couldn't eat it. i ordered the vodka penne pasta which wasn't cooked at all however they left it under a heat lamp for several minutes so when it got brought out it was dry, and stuck together but somehow still not cooked. they were very sorry about the food and brought me a new plate however it was still not correct but i ate it anyways because i was starving. sad that the $50 steak literally had no flavor and the bone was bigger than the meat. whatever you do don't eat here you could sit enjoy the atmosphere and have a cocktail or glass of wine but do not order any food you'll be wasting your money."

            "i think i've always had a negative attitude about lavo because it is associated with being a night club and located in a vegas casino.  those two factors alone always seem to always bring my expectation of food down.  lavo proved me wrong.  i was pleasantly surprised with the caliber of food and service at our recent outing as a big bachelorette party group.\n\nthe food:\ngarlic bread (compliementary) - super garlicky and butter and perfectly crispy.  just the way i like it\n\nmeatball - they have a choice of meatballs and i thought that it would be a few meatballs, but this was one huge tasty meatball on a bed of fresh greens and flavorful <mark>Meatball with Salad and Garlic Crostini</mark>\n\n<mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> - refreshing mix of chopped tuna and avocado.  not bad.\n\nkobe stuffed rice balls - aracini stuffed with kobe beef.  interesting, yummy and filling.\n\n<mark>New York Strip</mark> steak - we ordered medium because we were sharing family style.  actually cooked perfectly and delicious\n\nrigatoni sausage bolognese - the rigatoni itself was al dente.  nothing impressive about the sauce.  \n\n<mark>Spinach and Artichoke</mark> pizza - soggy pizza.  enough said.\n\n<mark>Crispy Zucchini</mark> - deep fried shoestring zucchini.  yum!!\n\n<mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark> - .... what garlic?\n\nservice:\nwas it me or were all the servers handsome male models?  the service was actually really attentive.  waters were filled, wine glasses never empty, napkins folded whenever we went off to the restroom.\n\nconclusion:  i would say that the restaurant offers a nice variety of crowd pleasers with some nice service and eye candy.  overall, 3.5 stars because the food was a mix of mediocre to very good food.  definitely not your momma's homemade italian, but good for a fun night out on the strip and you can get a view of treasure island's pirate show's fireworks if you're positioned towards window.", 
            "lavo should be known for their meatballs and panna cotta cheesecake!!\n\n*this review is for the restaurant only*\n\nafter hearing that lavo had the best meatballs in town and good food overall, i just had to go and try it for myself. we came here with my good friends from hawaii. i made reservations on a week night when there was no special event going on at the nightclub, hoping it would be less crowded.\n\nat first, service was good. we had 3 different servers who said that they would all be helping us. however, after our drinks were delivered, we got stuck with one server, who was kind of an airhead. i'll be nice and not mention her name, but this is how it went down. we were all obviously ready to order because our menus were closed and stacked nicely on one corner of the table.\nserver: \"are you all ready to order, or do we need a few more minutes?\"\nus: \"we're ready.\"\nserver: \"i'll give you a few more minutes.\"\nus: \"umm, we just said we were ready.\"\nserver: \"oh ok, go ahead.\"\nthen later that night....\nserver: \"are you still working on this or do you want me to take the plate out of your way?\"\nmy friend: \"still working on it.\"\nserver: *reaches out to grab the plate*\nmy friend:\" no, i am still working on it!\"\nserver: \"oh, ok.\"\ngeeez, she had serious issues! also note that we ate here right after they opened, so the place wasn't crazy loud at the time. if she's deaf, she shouldn't be a server. she really needs to get her act together! horrible!\n\nanyway, the food was awesome and we all enjoyed our dinner. we ordered the <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark>. good thing we split it between the 4 of us because it was huge! very flavorful and melted in my mouth! i wanted more, so i ordered the spaghetti with kobe meatballs. my husband ordered the <mark>New York Strip</mark> steak and said it was one of the best steaks he ever had. now i know what to order next time! our friends ordered the <mark>Chicken Parmigiano</mark> (also huge) and some other pasta dish. and now for the best part, dessert!! thanks to my friends, i am now addicted to the panna cotta cheesecake! i don't know how to explain it, except to say that is was a big delicious slice of heavenly, creamy berry goodness! sometimes cheesecakes can be too rich, but this one was light and not overly sweet. slices are big enough for 2 people to share, but i honestly think i could eat the entire thing on my own. i would seriously do a take out order, just for the cheesecake!\n\ndefinitely looking forward to coming back and trying other items on the menu. hopefully, service will be better next time!", 
            "lavo brunch:\nhad brunch on the patio at lavo yesterday.  i must say i enjoyed every bit! not only was the weather perfect but everything else was also!  we shared our meal at the table, started out with chopped louie salad and ceasars salad which were both delicious!  next we shared a carne pizza, <mark>Penne Seafood Alfredo</mark>, and the 14oz <mark>New York Strip</mark>.  they were all perfect!  our server sal was attentive but not over bearing!  would love to go back, and i plan on sending guests to dine with you for brunch for sure!", 
            "service was extremely slow. entrees took almost an hour to get on our table. that was a huge turn off for me. taste was really average. <mark>New York Strip</mark> was bland and the sauce tasted like a1. they charge you extra on bread by the way, which is extremely rare. the dessert \"strawberry shortcake\" tasted ok but cream was too heavy. i hated the service whatsoever."

(which was comped, because they forgot to bring it out, yay!) also awesome.\n-fries with their ketchup sorbet (cold ketchup)..weird..never had that before.\n-margherita pizza...which had potatoes...lobster! and caramelized onions. so different.\n\n we didn't end up going to the club upstairs afterwards, but it looked pretty busy and cool.\n\nlike last time.. loved the super modern decor and random decorations..\n\ni want to be there every time i'm in vegas.",

            "i literally licked my plate. yes i was a wee bit intoxicated but it was 100% justified.\n\nmy boss and his wife raved about how freaking amazing their kobe meatballs are. i prepared myself for potential over hype, but they lived up to all expectations.\n\ngoing a step back, we arrived on time for our 8pm reservation and had to wait as the place was super busy with it being the last night of ces. a slight nudge and the management did what every restaurant should do, they bought us a round of drinks. just as we were going to sweet talk our way into a 2nd round, our table was ready.\n\nthis place is sexy, though due to ces the male:female ratio was skewed to sausage. it is at this point that my boss taught me a life lesson. rather than deal with the back and forth after asking 'what does everyone feel like eating?', simply tell your server to pick their favourites for you. now this is assuming the server isn't useless. \n\nas i forget the sequence of arrival, here we go:\n\ngreen salad - helped with carb guilt\ncalamari - perfectly cooked, well spiced\na-5 kobe <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark> - what transpired in my mouth was a little intimate. wow^2.\n<mark>Rigatoni Melanzana</mark> - it had a generous dollop of buffalo mozzarella. enough said.\n<mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark> - delicate, butter ocean joy.\n<mark>Bone-In Rib Eye</mark> with a side of garlic herb butter - juicy, tofu-tender, carnivore heaven. i chewed the meat on the bone with pride.\ndeep fried oreos - i thought my boss was joking ordering such a thing at this kind of place, but he insisted. dipped in gelato, they were magical enough for me to lick my plate clean.\n\ni shall return. tongue out.", 
            "dined here recently. service was adequate. it was very loud and hard to hear people talk. ambiance was upscale but didn't match the type of music they were playing as well as the volume of the music.\n\ngood - the $24 meatballs were amazing. the bone in <mark>Bone-In Rib Eye</mark> was tasty and cooked perfectly medium rare. the deep fried oreos were also really delicious.\n\nbad - any high end italian restaurant that doesn't make all of their own pasta is a rip off. i wanted to order the chicken parm. it was around $29 and did not include pasta. what kind of italian restaurant at any price point doesn't include pasta with chicken parm. when i asked what kind of pasta i could order as a side dish i was told it would be penne which was not homemade. i was also told the $29 plate of spag <mark>Spaghetti and Meatballs</mark> does not have homemade pasta. i can boil noodles at home. i can get boiled dry noodles at olive garden or fazzolis or sbarro and feed the entire family for less than $30.\n\ni only came here because it was on the company dime. i would feel totally ripped off if i was paying.", 
            "i don't know why it's taken me so long to review lavo. i've been about 6 times, most recent being this past weekend with a group of 16 people. \n\ngood service, fantastic food. my faves:\n\n<mark>Grilled Branzino Panzanella</mark> (light, delicious tastes combine in your mouth with small branzino fillets), spaghetti and kobe meatballs (seriously, if you could only eat one dish here, this is it), and then the <mark>Bone-In Rib Eye</mark>, which is done northern italian style, and oh-so good. you can trust these guys to do a good job on your meat. \n\ndon't go without a reservation, and be prepared to wait in the seating area an extra hour if you're dining on the late side, but they do make nice cocktails, so enjoy!\n\nthere's a club upstairs if you're so inclined. \n\nbest casual restaurant in vegas.",

            "the menu is very deceiving. \nif you get a house special don't expect to get pasta with it like you would at a normal italian restaurant. which is what happened to me when i ordered my chicken milanese and my friend who ordered a shrimp scampi. so i guess you can only get \"pasta\" in the pasta section. the <mark>Spaghetti Carbonara</mark> was extremely oily and too salty. \n\nthe service was terrible and it wasn't even a busy night. we went on a monday night around 6:30pm and it was pretty steady not overly crowded so i really don't understand the delay that we had with our meals.the appetizers arrived in a very timely matter, but after that it took about 45 minutes for the entrees to get to our table. the waiter never checked on our table to see if we liked our food until the very end when he knew we were upset. my friend ordered a <mark>Sea Salt Baked Potato</mark> as a side dish that didn't even arrive till the very end of the meal and they didn't even notice that we were missing one. once we mentioned that we were waiting for our side it still took them almost 25 minutes to even bring it out to us, on top of that the <mark>Sea Salt Baked Potato</mark> was cold! by then we were already done with the meal and asked if the potato could be taken off the bill. the only think i can say was good is that i never ran out of water because the bus boy was the only tentative one. i will not be returning.", 
            "my sister and i ate dinner at lavo on saturday night. we had 7:15 pm reservations and even though it was a tad early to eat by vegas standards, the restaurant was pretty full. the tables for two are a little close together, but you still feel as if you have your own space and i really didn't overhear either of our neighbor's conversations.\n\nour meal started with two glasses of sauvignon blanc and complimentary garlic bread. the garlic bread portion was huge and a great side for our meals. for entrees, my sister had the <mark>Chicken Parmigiano</mark>, i had the <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, and we split a <mark>Sea Salt Baked Potato</mark>. our waitress graciously mentioned to my sister that her meal did not include pasta in case she wanted to add that (she didn't). once we saw the size of the chicken parm, i can see why it doesn't come with pasta! her piece of chicken was the size of her plate! needless to say she wasn't able to eat the whole thing, but she loved every bite that she did have. my <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, which was a nice thick slice, was cooked to perfection - it was flaky and just melted in my mouth. the <mark>Sea Salt Baked Potato</mark> was a great size (thank goodness we shared it), but could have used just a touch more salt. for dessert, we shared the chocolate cake roll. in keeping with the theme of our meal, it was gigantic. easily four people could have shared that dessert. the cake was delicious and light which was good since we were pretty full from our entrees.\n\nour waitress was very nice and did a great job of checking on us through the night. she also didn't rush us as we took our time with dessert and finishing our wine. the food does come out rather quickly - it couldn't have been more than ten minutes from the time we ordered until the time food appeared at our table. lavo does a great job with table turnover, so even if you walk in without a reservation, you probably won't have to wait too long. prices are actually really reasonable - after tax and tip, my share of the bill was $82.\n\ni would definitely eat at lavo on a future visit and will be recommending it to friends who are traveling to vegas in the near future.", 
            "great service, great food, amazing music. we decided to start the night getting some grub and a drink. we were a larger group (14 people) and i was only able to eat what was on our side of the table. it did seem like we ordered almost everything from the menu but what i can most distinctly remember are the following. we started with the margherita pizza than had the <mark>Sea Salt Baked Potato</mark> and baby asparagus. and for our main course i had the rigatoni sausage bolognese and the <mark>Fresh Whole Maine Lobster</mark> and an order of the mixed wild mushroom. (i split the main course with someone else.) seemed like a lot of food even for me. \n\nafter dinner, we made our way to the second level which had a more of a club vibe, great tunes and they gave away free drink to the ladies from 11 to 1, i think. which was great for half our party. definitely a place for bachelorette party. definitely where the ladies are.", 
            "i can only speak to my restaurant experiences as i haven't yet taken part in the night club experience (and probably never will).  \n\nthe food on each of my last two visits was terrific. my wife enjoyed the kobe <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark> cheese and i usually lean towards the chicken parm, both of which were delicious. \n\nthe service was a whole different story. it was so bad that it takes what should be a 5 star rating down to what should be less than a \"2\".  \n\nafter checking in for our reservation, we opted to take a seat at the bar and have a drink before dinner (this was mistake #1). we alerted the hostess to this and she said no-problem. we were then greeted by the slowest bar tender on the planet, who struggled to tend to ourselves and 2 other customers she had at her bar (it was early in the evening and the place was nearly empty). after walking past us at least 3 times, she finally decided to stop. seeing the disgust in my face, i immediately detected a bit of an attitude from the gal, when she asked if we needed a drink menu. a while later, another male employee hands us a drink menu. the bar isn't that big - how difficult is it to locate a drink menu? the bartender eventually returns to take our drink order, with my wife getting a glass of pinot and i asked for a coors light. i was immediately told they don't have coors light (yet the palazzo bar across the lobby does). in fact, you can get a coors at darn near any bar in the venetian or palazzo....except at lavo. i thought to myself, \"this is the lavo at the palazzo and they can't walk a few feet for the overpriced beer i requested .... really? the cocktail waitresses throughout the casino can walk hundreds of yards for a customer's free beer and a lousy tip .... but god forbid the staff at lavo walk a few feet for the customer actually paying for their beer.\n\nwe return to the attractive (but not so bright) hostess who greeted us earlier, asking to be seated. she immediately grabs my wife's pinot and pours it into a plastic cup, saying \"you can't leave with the glass\". i point out to her that we're not leaving, instead, asking to be seated at our table. she then catches on to her goof and seats us. \n\non to dinner. again food was terrific but service was marginal. i ordered a <mark>Sea Salt Baked Potato</mark> with my dinner, which arrived with my meal. i asked for 2 portions of butter as i wasn't interested in their spicy butter concoction. the waiter breaks open my potato in such grand fashion and said he'd return with my butter. roughly 10-15 minutes later, our waiter returns and asks if we needed anything. i responded, stating \"yes, the butter i asked for earlier\". realizing his mistake, he hurried off. a few minutes later, i see him at another table taking drink orders. really, my potato is colder than my ice water and he's taking drink orders? eventually, he returns with a rock hard piece of butter (looked like a bar of soap), which never melts on my potato. i didn't eat it as i wanted him and hopefully the manager to see the state of the potato with un-melted butter. \n\nthe bill arrives and the waiter indicates that the $11 potato was removed by his manager, the same manager who was too busy to walk about the restaurant and check on customers??? low class joint. \n\nthe food is very good but the staff and the service they provide was far from venetian or palazzo standards. they should hire fewer \"pretty\" people and more \"skilled\" service professionals. they tout the place as \"fine dining\" but i've gotten 10x better service from the grand lux caf\\u00e9 and the coffee bean in the hotel.\n\nnever returning."

            "we had dinner here for a bachelorette party.  i have mixed feeling about the restaurant part.  since we had such a big group, we had to do a set dinner menu.  the price per person for the menu was about $100.  for the food we got, it was not worth the price.  but in lavo's defense, we picked the food.  so i guess i'd like to go back and try something off of their regular menu.  for what we did have:  mussles in marinara sauce, the sauce was good, but over  1/2 of the mussels were not cooked all the way and did not open.  garlic break and marinara sauce - the flavor was there but the presentation was an f.  they brought out a plate with a bowl of marinara sauce and a loaf of garlic bread wrapped in tin foil.  they put it on the table and i was confused.  also, there was no serving pieces for the sauce or bread.  in a restaurant like this you'd think the presentation would be looked after a bit more.  the flat bread was yummy, served on a baking stone so that was fine.  the dinner (again this was partially not fabulous but only bc of what was choosen by our group): 2 pastas, <mark>Truffled French Fries</mark>, <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark>, broccoli.  what a strange combo, but all i can do is rate each item on its own.  the pastas were cooked al dente and the sauce had a great flavor.  i like al dente so it didn't bother me, but some girls didn't like it.  the starches were good - but how can you mess up fries or <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  the broccoli was steamed - that's about all i can say about that, it's broccoli so how can you really say any more? the service was outstanding - our waiter was super friendly and funny (and cute!) and he kept the wine flowing.  i'd definitely give lavo another try, just because i don't think i got the full experience with our personal tasting menu.  on a plus, they put a personalized menu out for us with our bachelorette's name and the date - a nice keepsake.  i enjoyed the ambiance - it was super upbeat, chic and trendy.  the music was hip hop and everyone was just dancing in their seats having a good time at dinner.  for now i will give lavo a 3, but i have a feeling it is just because i was there for a event that required a set menu and i was thrown off by the garlic bread wrapped in tin foil, lol.  if i return,  hopefully i can give it a 4 or 5.  \n\nthe club - great music, extremely crowded, but drink and shot prices weren't terrible.  the dance pit was insanely crowded. i think if you had vip or table service you would have the roped off area that surrounds the dance floor.  i don't know if that is a good thing though bc the dance floor was so crowded i would feel trapped at your table.  i heard from a waitress that we met at tryst that the night club is notorious for having extremely long lines.  the club was a bit on the smaller side (compared to places like tryst, jet, pure, moon).  for the club, i'd give it a 2 just for the reason that there are so many other fab clubs in vegas.",

            "this restaurant has a super sexy vibe, and awesome food and service. \n\nwe ran about 30 minutes late to our saturday night reservation and i called to let the hostess know.  i was happy to see that the restaurant was right inside the front entrance to palazzo so we didn't have to battle the crowds of the casino on a holiday weekend. when we arrived, i apologized profusely but the hostess told me not to worry and gave me no shade whatsoever, seating us right away. this set the tone as all the waitstaff was friendly and seemed to be having a good time.\n\nthe vibe is awesome.  the design of the space is beautiful and feels really sophisticated.  it doesn't feel tacky or over-designed like other vegas restaurants. the generous candlelight was lovely and romantic (otherwise the restaurant is very dark).  there was a dj playing a really perfect blend house music and pop that was exactly right for right before going out.  if you don't like loud music or are in a group, i'd probably stick to a quieter venue.   \n\nour server, sal, was one of the best i have ever experienced!  i'm used to good service but he was great. he gave us the right amount of time to look over the menu and to relax between courses.  somehow he had that perfect balance of engagement and charm but wasn't too intrusive.  he enthusiastically recommended his favorite dishes and anticipated all of our questions and needs.  his recommendations were right on and our food was fabulous. \n\nwe got the tuna tataki, the black cod, the special truffle risotto, <mark>Sauteed Spinach</mark> and <mark>Brussels Sprouts</mark>.  while everything was above average for, the black cod was so perfectly prepared and flavorful.  all this and a drink, and we got out of there under $100 per person, not left hungry at all.\n\ni feel like when going to vegas it makes sense to try different spots all the time, but i have to say i'll be back to lavo for sure on my next visit!  it's so hard to find this authentic ambiance, expert staff and delicious food anywhere else on the strip!", 
            "#food #drinks #fun  and home with @msfitness69 for the night!!! fun was had by all today! @lavolv i had  #<mark>Chicken Marsala</mark> & the most amazing #<mark>Brussels Sprouts</mark> ever .. i loved how the food was not heavy and was unbelievably fresh and savory! . dying ..... want more. yes the #stoliraz & water took the edge off the hour wait!   our server josh made for a delightful evening in #vegas!  upgraded our seating to the big booth we preferred and was very patient as our party arrived a bit later than planned. thank you for your patience! one huge thing i cannot forget to mention is that they provide a phone charging battery pack with a variety of plug attachments.  they need to hold a credit card & id but when your at 3% in #vegas i would have given them my right arm for a charger!!"

            "note that this is a review for the restaurant and not the club experience. (hey yelp, maybe there should be a way to separate the two for venues that function as both!) \n\nhad dinner at lavo with a large group of friends. \n\nthe interior of the restaurant is beautiful. i don't say this about a lot of restaurants, but ladies, check out the bathroom!!! \n\nthe meal was accompanied by garlic bread with marinara sauce. quite yummy, but there was a bit of controversy when we were given refills and then charged for them. after a friend talked to the servers and argued that we hadn't been told there was a charge for refills, the charge was waived. \n\na friend and i shared the kobe beef carpaccio with black truffle vinaigrette. i like truffle flavoring, but i think the vinaigrette overpowered the beef. past a certain point with truffle-based sauces, less becomes more.\n\nmy entree was risotto with braised short rib. the rice was delicious and the short rib had good flavor, but the meat wasn't soft enough. when i think of braised short rib, i think of tender meat falling off the bone.\n\nwe shared several vegetable sides with the table. pretty standard stuff. the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> was a bit too heavy though, even for <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>. probably our mistake for ordering it in addition to all the food we had.\n\nmy bf ordered a seared tuna entree, which definitely got an a+ for presentation. i tried a bit, and it was tasty. however, he came down with symptoms of food poisoning several hours later. let's be honest though - since we were in vegas, it's hard to tell how much of that was caused or exacerbated by alcohol. \n\nothers at the table enjoyed their pizzas, which looked very large for one person, and pastas. \n\ni was extremely full after the meal. the menu is available on the website for you to evaluate the prices yourself, but i thought $60 for half an appetizer, an entree, and the split cost of a few sides without any drinks or alcohol was a bit high. then again, this is the strip! \n\nto sum it up, lavo is one of the better places i've tried on the strip, after a series of disappointing food experiences. (refer to other reviews if interested.)\n* decent food but with something left to be desired \n* great presentation\n* wonderful interior\n* sufficient seating for large groups\n* slightly high prices", 
            "holy meatballs batman!!!\n\nyes. their meatball was the size of my face. and i enjoyed every bite. nom nom nom nom nom. we got the ricotta one. delish!  i actually gave up being a vegetarian because of one glance at that bad boy. no joke.\n\nthe rest of the food was great. they give out garlic bread with marinera sauce which was heavenly on its own. i got the braised rib special which pretty much melted in my mouth. the bottle of wine we ordered did not disappoint. much better quality than the lavo in nyc. the service was exceptional. my only complaint would be the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>. gross. took one bite and left it there. so really i'd only give it 4.5 stars. hint hint yelp, let's get working on the star ratings.", 
            "we waited 45 mins for our table, even with our reservation. the restaurant was highly recommended, so we were disappointed with the wait. the hostess did offer us a free round of drinks to compensate. we had the pomegranate limonata, which was made well. the restaurant does have a nice ambience upon entering, but looks much bigger than it really is. they had a dj playing good music in the lounge area. once we were finally seated, the restaurant manager came over to apologize for the wait. luckily, the food was very good. we ordered <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark>, beef carpaccio, meatballs <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark>, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> & a 12 oz steak, which was more than enough to split among three people. service was great & attentive. bathrooms were clean, but a little dark inside. we were able to access the nightclub after eating.\n\nas for the nightclub, the music was horrible! it was rap all night. not r&b that you could dance to, but rap that you couldn't understand the words with disgusting lyrics. the dj did not know how to transition from one song to another. there was an older crowd there, so with it comes creeps. the comped drinks we had were not good on anything except beer and champagne. not what i pictured the party scene to be after eating at such a trendy restaurant."

            "i think i've always had a negative attitude about lavo because it is associated with being a night club and located in a vegas casino.  those two factors alone always seem to always bring my expectation of food down.  lavo proved me wrong.  i was pleasantly surprised with the caliber of food and service at our recent outing as a big bachelorette party group.\n\nthe food:\ngarlic bread (compliementary) - super garlicky and butter and perfectly crispy.  just the way i like it\n\nmeatball - they have a choice of meatballs and i thought that it would be a few meatballs, but this was one huge tasty meatball on a bed of fresh greens and flavorful <mark>Meatball with Salad and Garlic Crostini</mark>\n\n<mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> - refreshing mix of chopped tuna and avocado.  not bad.\n\nkobe stuffed rice balls - aracini stuffed with kobe beef.  interesting, yummy and filling.\n\n<mark>New York Strip</mark> steak - we ordered medium because we were sharing family style.  actually cooked perfectly and delicious\n\nrigatoni sausage bolognese - the rigatoni itself was al dente.  nothing impressive about the sauce.  \n\n<mark>Spinach and Artichoke</mark> pizza - soggy pizza.  enough said.\n\n<mark>Crispy Zucchini</mark> - deep fried shoestring zucchini.  yum!!\n\n<mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark> - .... what garlic?\n\nservice:\nwas it me or were all the servers handsome male models?  the service was actually really attentive.  waters were filled, wine glasses never empty, napkins folded whenever we went off to the restroom.\n\nconclusion:  i would say that the restaurant offers a nice variety of crowd pleasers with some nice service and eye candy.  overall, 3.5 stars because the food was a mix of mediocre to very good food.  definitely not your momma's homemade italian, but good for a fun night out on the strip and you can get a view of treasure island's pirate show's fireworks if you're positioned towards window."

            "**restaurant review only**\n\ni met a promoter on facebook who offered to comp me a free dinner for me and a group of my girlfriends for my birthday. of course, i was thrilled and could not pass up an offer to eat at a fine italian restaurant on the strip. \n\ntwo of my girls, my mom, and me arrived at lavo and it was *packed* for a tuesday night! i heard it was \"industry night\", so that could have been the main reason. the main restaurant is part of the nightclub upstairs, and there was a dj spinning a good mixture of house tunes and top 40 remixes. i'm glad he didn't play hip-hop since that's not my thing. the decor was eclectic and unusual, plus i liked the dark, mysterious lighting. because it was so busy, we waited about 20-30 minutes or so, then we were seated.\n\nwe were given a fixed menu of the chef's favorite entrees and we were allowed one free alcoholic beverage each. i wanted to order veuve cliquot, but i could only order sparkling white wine instead, which was fine with me. we started with garlic bread and calamari with marinara sauce, and caesar salad. the salad was so tasty and i am not a big salad girl by any means. it was definitely my favorite appetizer.\n\nnext we had penne pasta, <mark>Chicken Marsala</mark> with spinach, and <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark>. they were all excellent. considering it was all comped, they did not skimp on the portions at all. our waitress was very friendly and attentive, and so were the rest of the staff. our promoter also met us personally and invited us up to the nightclub if we wanted to after dinner, but my friends decided to pass. i totally would have gone dancing if one of my friends was not my ride for the evening. \n\ni was very impressed with lavo. i would definitely go back to the restaurant and the nightclub to party in the near future. kudos to the lavo staff for making this all possible. :-)", 
            "on our \"girls night out\", we came to lavo for dinner.  we weren't sure where to go for dinner, so jeff, from vip red carpet, suggested lavo and we werent disappointed.  its located at the palazzo, a short walk from the mirage.  the decor was pretty cool.  it was pretty dim inside, but i really liked their chandeliers and lighting.\n\nanywho, we started with 2 of the <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> and 1 caesar salad, which was more than enough to split amongst us 4 girls.  the caesar was pretty good, and the croutons were huge!  the <mark>Tuna Tartare</mark> wasn't that great for me...maybe im just used to fusion, but i was expecting some kind of chip to go with it, and i didnt really like the lemony taste it had.\n\nnext, they brought out some amazing garlic bread that you can dip in marinara sauce...pretty yummy.  they also brought out a pitcher of saggio (kind of like a blueberry mojito)...they suggested the pitcher because it was cheaper than ordering individually...that probably lasted 1.5-2 rounds for us.  i really liked it...it was very light and summery. perfect for those hot summer vegas nights!\n\nfor my entree, i went with my favorite fish, the <mark>Roasted Chilean Sea Bass</mark> accompanied by a breaded/fried portobello. man was that good. i was a little upset that i was getting full and couldnt finish it.  it was cooked perfectly, and the sauce was great.  my friends ordered the grilled swordfish, the penne ala vodka, and the filet...no complaints from any of them.   keep in mind that you have to order trimmings and potatoes separately for $10 each.  i ordered the <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark>, and another friend ordered the <mark>Roasted Rosemary Potatoes</mark>.  its pretty huge, so you can probably split with the table.  i actually could've done without it, it was a little dry and i didnt want to waste whatever room was left in my tummy, on potatoes.\n\nlast, but definitely not least....dessert!!!  we ordered deep fried battered oreos with a side of milkshake to dip them into.  pure heaven!!! it was so good...now im starting to drool again...lol.\n\nthis is definitely a cool place to check out for dinner.  the outside patio has an awesome view of the strip.  the ambience is great, the staff was friendly and they offered a ton of great suggestions.  they also knew we were in kind of a rush, so they happily accomodated.  i would definitely go back again.", 
            "we had dinner here for a bachelorette party.  i have mixed feeling about the restaurant part.  since we had such a big group, we had to do a set dinner menu.  the price per person for the menu was about $100.  for the food we got, it was not worth the price.  but in lavo's defense, we picked the food.  so i guess i'd like to go back and try something off of their regular menu.  for what we did have:  mussles in marinara sauce, the sauce was good, but over  1/2 of the mussels were not cooked all the way and did not open.  garlic break and marinara sauce - the flavor was there but the presentation was an f.  they brought out a plate with a bowl of marinara sauce and a loaf of garlic bread wrapped in tin foil.  they put it on the table and i was confused.  also, there was no serving pieces for the sauce or bread.  in a restaurant like this you'd think the presentation would be looked after a bit more.  the flat bread was yummy, served on a baking stone so that was fine.  the dinner (again this was partially not fabulous but only bc of what was choosen by our group): 2 pastas, <mark>Truffled French Fries</mark>, <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark>, broccoli.  what a strange combo, but all i can do is rate each item on its own.  the pastas were cooked al dente and the sauce had a great flavor.  i like al dente so it didn't bother me, but some girls didn't like it.  the starches were good - but how can you mess up fries or <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  the broccoli was steamed - that's about all i can say about that, it's broccoli so how can you really say any more? the service was outstanding - our waiter was super friendly and funny (and cute!) and he kept the wine flowing.  i'd definitely give lavo another try, just because i don't think i got the full experience with our personal tasting menu.  on a plus, they put a personalized menu out for us with our bachelorette's name and the date - a nice keepsake.  i enjoyed the ambiance - it was super upbeat, chic and trendy.  the music was hip hop and everyone was just dancing in their seats having a good time at dinner.  for now i will give lavo a 3, but i have a feeling it is just because i was there for a event that required a set menu and i was thrown off by the garlic bread wrapped in tin foil, lol.  if i return,  hopefully i can give it a 4 or 5.  \n\nthe club - great music, extremely crowded, but drink and shot prices weren't terrible.  the dance pit was insanely crowded. i think if you had vip or table service you would have the roped off area that surrounds the dance floor.  i don't know if that is a good thing though bc the dance floor was so crowded i would feel trapped at your table.  i heard from a waitress that we met at tryst that the night club is notorious for having extremely long lines.  the club was a bit on the smaller side (compared to places like tryst, jet, pure, moon).  for the club, i'd give it a 2 just for the reason that there are so many other fab clubs in vegas.",

            "we had dinner reservations at tao and decided to cancel last minute and try out lavo since we had already been to tao last year.  the space is really cool inside, i loved the music the dj was playing and the outdoor seating area where you can have a drink.  the service was great, from the hostess to our waiter everyone was very fast, professional and nice.  my husband and i were not hungry at all and didn't get to try any of the appetizers, we both ordered lobster and the <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark>, the lobster was great, the <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark> were awesome!! i could not stop eating them, they were a perfect balance of garlic and cheese.  \nafter dinner the hostess asked if we wanted a stamp so that we can you to the nightclub, we said sure and headed out to the nightclub.  after looking at the line we practically ran the other way.  trashy, young...did i say trashy? i know this is vegas but come on girls when you can't walk in your 6 inch stilettos and have to keep pulling your dress down to cover your butt, something is not right!  i would definitely go back for dinner/drink but that's about it!", 
            "i got invited by one of my besties to check out lavo this past week and i am utterly in love with the restaurant, if a bit underwhelmed by the nightclub.\n\nit was a tuesday night and the entire place from the lounge, to the restaurant to the nightclub was packed.  we had martinis to start out and their absolutely delicious garlic bread with marinara was sent out.  wisely we each only had a piece to save room for the food the chef was sending out to us.    we didn't actually order off the menu since we were just sent out a few small plates to taste.  our waiter brought us a margeherita flat bread pizza, spicy egg plant and buffalo mozzarella pasta and <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  all were melt in your mouth yummy, i couldn't stop eating the pasta (to the misfortune of my little cocktail dress) it had the tangy tomato fondue taste with buffalo mozzarella and then this divine after bite of spicy eggplant.  \n\nwe also had dessert, one of lavo's specialties, deep friend oreos. now this is not your typical carnival food.  this was a beignet wrapped around an oreo with a side of cookies and cream ice cream for dipping.  heaven.\n\nthe restaurant had a live dj and it was on the energetic side but the music was at the right volume to easily carry on a conversation.  also, neil, are server was great!  very attentive, knowledgeable and funny.\n\nwe went up to the nightclub after and ehhh...i've been to alot better, most of vegas in fact.  the vibe was alot of fun, they had a good dj spinning house music but the club is too small and far too crowded for me.  i like to actually be able to dance more.", 
            "dinner was fabulous! our group ordered 1) one of the steaks with a huge side of <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark>, 2) the louie salad with lobster and shrimp, 3) <mark>Spaghetti Carbonara</mark>, 4) a bolognese pasta dish and 5) i got the chicken parmagiani. \n\nthe service was top-notch and worthy of an upscale restaurant: they refolded your napkin if you got up to use the restroom or go to the bar, they knew to refill ladies' water glasses first, etc. they even had a restroom attendant to hand you paper towels. they even gave us a free round of drinks for our group of five because they couldn't seat us until 30 minutes after our reservation. (this wasn't off-putting for us, since it was a fun atmosphere.)\n\nthe portions are quite large and worth the price. they are known for their giant meatballs, which we unfortunately did not sample. however, they do provide free garlic bread with marinara which the table fought over.\n\nthe ambiance gives off fun vibes, but it is very noisy.\n\nif you dine there, you get free admission to the club upstairs.", 
            "loved it!!! i made dinner reservations for my friends bachelorette party on friday night. we booked the \"lavo feast\" which was served family style. we had the pizza and calamari for appetizers, salad, spaghetti, <mark>Chicken Marsala</mark>, <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark>, asparagus, and dessert. the dessert was just ok and i felt the calamari could have been more crispy, but other then that i thought the food tasted great! the service was attentive and friendly. the atmosphere was perfect for our bachelorette party and after dinner we were able to walk right into tao's night club (bring your dinner receipt). well worth the money. i highly recommend it!!", 
            "we had a reservation, and were seated right away.  the restaurant is beautiful, very classy looking, and warm, inviting.  the noise level was just right, and the house was full.  our drinks were delicious, as was the bottle of wine we ordered.  it was a birthday/engagement/reunion celebration dinner, and couldn't have been more perfect.  the food was amazing, the <mark>Garlic Mashed Potatoes</mark> have a crust that is divine!  tiramisu for dessert, even the bathrooms are gorgeous- bring a couple bucks for the bathroom attendant!"

            "i don't know what lavo's nightclub is like, but based on three dining experiences here, i will keep coming back for the food. the latest outing was to take advantage of some attractive restaurant week offerings. \n\nwe chose patio dining this time, and i was surprised to see that my party of four were seated directly across from the ti show, which we actually saw while we dined. as far as the show is concerned, i liked it better in its earlier sea battle incarnation minus the sexy sirens. \n\nmanagement was much more rigid this year than last when during restaurant week they graciously substituted veal parmesan for chicken parmesan at no additional cost, and agreed to substitute alfredo sauce for marinara sauce to cover a pounded veal cutlet. even though i offered to pay an extra charge if required, the waitress apologetically reported that the manager said that absolutely no substitutions would be allowed on restaurant week menu selections, including changing a sauce. but the requested substitution of one sauce for another was permitted at no extra charge when my wife ordered the veal parmesan from the regular, higher priced menu. this technicality struck me as rather petty--especially since the requested accommodations were made during restaurant week 2010. but at least requested lemon aioli was provided gratis to go with the calamari, and service all night was otherwise excellent. \n\ncomplimentary buttery and crunchy baked garlic bread served with a very mellow marinara sauce was an excellent beginning. and, the blond rings of calamari were all soft, tender, and delicious, whether with just a few added drops of lemon, dipped in the marinara sauce, or dunked in the smooth lemon aioli. \n\na chopped \"louie\" salad served as a first course was probably miscast. this lovely dish was an entree in itself. featuring many pieces of cold shrimp and large hunks of chilled lobster, along with cherry tomatoes, zucchini, red pimento, black olives, celery, and pepperoncini all tossed in a light house vinaigrette dressing, it was a great salad. the salad was presented with an 18-inch cheese stick on top that extended well beyond both sides of the plate. this cheesy bread product was praiseworthy in its own right. \n\n<mark>Brick Oven Salmon Oreganato</mark>, prepared with seasoned breadcrumbs, lemon, white wine, sun-dried tomatoes, and garlic butter, was moist and flavorful. and, it rested atop moist but slightly crunchy julienned vegetables that included zucchini. this was one of the few restaurants i have been where diners are asked whether they would like their fish to be prepared \"medium\" or some other degree of doneness. i stuck to medium, and was happy with the result. \n\npounded veal covered generously with mozzarella cheese and alfredo sauce was also tender and light but a bit too salty. a fellow diner pronounced his <mark>Center Cut <mark>Bone-In Filet Mignon</mark></mark> and the bearnaise sauce that accompanied it \"good.\" the visibly pink inside of the meat was clearly cooked medium rare as ordered. and, glistening <mark>Roasted Rosemary Potatoes</mark> served in a skillet were moist, buttery, and fork tender. they were an excellent choice for a side. \n\ntwo premium desserts shared the stage to complete a memorable repast: tiramisu and strawberry cheese cake. the tiramisu was moist and creamy, and obviously made with mascarpone, chocolate, some alcoholic beverage, and some coffee flavoring. they were respectively marsala wine and espresso. the strawberry cheese cake was delicious but surprisingly light.  its crust was crumbly and tasty. \n\nboth desserts were pretty looking, as well. the bi-level tiramisu reminded me of a log cabin with its six edible lady finger logs glued together with mascarpone. and, the strawberry cheese cake featured white upper and lower layers of <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark> cheese, and a pink middle layer of strawberry cream. its top was adorned with bright red strawberry sauce and three strawberry slices, and resting beside this delectable dessert was a high mound of whipped cream and more oozing strawberry sauce. \n\nit was a great meal, but i dread getting on the scale in the morning!", 
            "a friend and i had dinner here and was treated great by sal. \nthe music sucks! so not for this setting! come on guys! really? so loud at points.\nwe both ordered things to share. \nmeatball, tender , pretty good,\nlobster ravioli, very good.\n(another pasta  dish) forgettable! pasta was was undercooked, when we mention it - was told oh it's typical for it's a thick pasta; really? i disagree. they did offer to make another and or replace.\nwe ordered 2 side veggies, asparagus and <mark>Roasted Rosemary Potatoes</mark> =  nothing great about these, just what it is, but way small portions and way over priced!\nhad some great cocktails. \ndessert =  20 layer cake , really good, rich  but good worth it.\nfried oreo z's. amazing! a must try. \ni think over all i'd give these guys a  another try, just different items next time. \nnote: if your going to charge that much,  make it worth it including the ambiance. just was off with that crazy music you played.\nbeautiful decor, just whole place didn't blend, off?", 
            "while my most recent dining experience at lavo was not as stunning as before, i and my party enjoyed an excellent meal.  as an opener, <mark>Baked Clams Oreganato</mark> yielded very garlicky clams but they were accompanied in their shells by a very tasty sauce.  and, the buttery garlic bread that came with the meal was so good that i sought and received another loaf--and, after its arrival, polished off most of it myself.  a caesar salad was an excellent caesar, with unusual pesto croutons and requested anchovies.\n\nthis time for my chosen entree i went more rustic, and, opting for some fine peasant cuisine, ordered spaghetti with kobe meatballs, which featured large meaty balls, a superior thick tomato-based sauce, and <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark> and parmigiano cheese.  the dish was quite satisfying, as was a side of <mark>Roasted Rosemary Potatoes</mark>.  diane also enjoyed her well-pounded veal parm.\n\nservice was excellent and attentive.  the only discordant note was really the too loud driving music played nonstop by the dj.  it did not harmonize well with digesting food or trying to carry on a conversation with one's spouse and friends across a dining table.   \n\nloss of a half-step, and so a half-star, this outing.  a 4-1/2-star experience overall!"

            "the way through my heart is through my tummy and lavo has managed to steal my heart and leave my tummy craving for more. we were looking for a nice place to dine and decided to come here. dinner for two anyone? we began with the baked clam oreganato, delishhh! perfect amount of garlic and spices, and oh so extremely yummy. next was the <mark>Penne Seafood Alfredo</mark>, had the biggest most succulent shrimp i've ever eaten i was glad that the sauce lacked that fishy, shrimpy taste some places tend to have. the penne itself was right on al dente so if you like your pasta a little on the softer side you should def be sure to request it.  the portions were big, so much so we ordered an appetizer, entree, and two sides and had no choice but to skip dessert. we aren't small people the bf and i, we can eat and needless to say we were both full and even had leftovers afterwards. as for the sides we had the baby asparagus, which seemed regular sized to me but hey i'm not complaining they were also good, and the <mark>Mixed Wild Mushrooms</mark> just added to the entire meal. overall my taste buds were please throughout the entire meal course. i would definitely go back, matter of fact i tried to the following day. it was the bf's turn to pick and that i will review next. i also had a cocktail off their menu, i believe it was a sicilian sun. i wasn't too phased by the drink but only because it was more on the stronger side when i was craving fruity and refreshing. the service was excellent, our server was very attentive. i wish i could remember his name to actually give him credit, it might have been alex? idk. i also inquired about the club which takes place later in the evening on the upper part and lounge area of the restaurant and he gladly stamped us so that we'd be able to bypass the admission line/fee later. i was kind of sad i didn't get to try their meatball appetizer, but i will make sure to go back do so the next time around. i heart lavo and if you decide to dine here, i'm sure you will too.", 
            "although we originally decided to eat here because of the convenience factor (we were staying at the palazzo), it was probably the best meal me my friends and i had while in vegas. \n\nthe night started off with a great server who helped us choose a few things to share, warning us of how big the serving sizes were. and this is a rare quality to have in a server as they usually roll their eyes and get annoyed about people splitting dishes (i know... i used to serve too!)\n\nbetween 6 girls, we had 2 salads, the cacciatore pizza, <mark>Spaghetti Carbonara</mark>(yum!) and the spaghetti with kobe meatballs. we added a side of <mark>Mixed Wild Mushrooms</mark>. the bread that they bring out with cheese/garlic topping and a side of marinara sauce was un-real. \n\noverall, great service and food made for a great night in vegas!", 
            "this is my 6th time here and came with my family and fiance on our vegas trip to celebrate my father's 60th birthday. called a few weeks in advance to book a table, they ask you for a credit card to secure your reservation so be aware of that. requested a table outside and mentioned it was my daddy's 60th birthday.\nwe waited about 30 mins for the table (totally normal at this restaurant) for a table for 6 outside. they said they could seat us immediately inside but it was such a  gorgeous night we waited. we grabbed some drinks at the bar and yummy long bread sticks and stood outside and waited. once our buzzer rang we were seated at a great table with a view of the pirate show at ti. we ate late, around 11pm so we saw the last show of the night. quite loud so be prepared. the restaurant is one of the loudest restaurants (inside) in vegas - super fun. the food here is amazing! so tasty! to start we ordered:\nsun ripened tomato bufala mozzarella $19\n2 orders of the <mark>Eggplant Parmigiano</mark> (the server even warned us that they are huge but i told him we usually order 1 for my fiance and me when we come, they are that good!) you must order this $17\n<mark>Crispy Fried Calamari</mark> $17\n<mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark> $21\nthe men had beers and the ladies split this amazing white pinot grigio, i can't rem the name but it was so tasty and the price was really good!\nfor the mains we ordered:\norganic <mark>Mixed Green</mark> salad $16 \n<mark>Mixed Wild Mushrooms</mark> $11\n<mark>Chicken Parmigiano</mark> $29 (comes with a large side of pasta)\nfour cheese ravioli $24\nchicken & mushroom ravioli $27\nspinach & artichoke brick oven pizza $21\n\neverything was amazing. the only reason i am removing 1 star is because i reminded both the hostess and the server that it was my father's 60th birthday and nothing was done. not even a little candle. they must have forgotten, but i was quite disappointed with that part.\n\nwill return for the tasty food and environment.", 
            "really good food and service!\n\n(this review is for the restaurant only.)\n\nwe rarely venture out of the cosmo or encore for food when in vegas, but we had some friends staying at the palazzo this go around so we decided to give a new restaurant a try.  we decided on lavo due to its location and becuase it seemed to have a cool vibe.\n\nhalf of our party arrived fairly late, but the restaurant was very polite about it.  we hung out at the bar and watched the hawks lose to the bruins.  the bartender was nice and friendly as were the other patrons at the bar.  i didn't check out the bar too much as i was too caught up in the game so can't really comment on that portion of my visit.\n\nthe remainder of our party finally arrived and we were seated at a nice round table in the middle of the restaurant.  we had awesome views of the entire place...including the upstairs area which i assume is used for the nightclub (???).  our waiter, scott r., was super nice and funny...cracking jokes with us the whole night.\n\nour table ordered the <mark>Meatball with Fresh Whipped Ricotta</mark>, calamari, mixed salad, carbonara, 8oz filet, 3 peas risotto, spaghetti with meatballs, <mark>Mixed Wild Mushrooms</mark>, and the 20 layer cake.  everything was delicious!  the portions were huge so everyone kind of just shared everything.  \n\nwe got the check and i and my husband decided to pick the bill up for the table to say thanks to our friends.  i am in charge of payments and tips in our house so when i looked at the bill and saw $354.20 for 6 people i was thinking we had gotten off cheap (that's like $59.00 per person with drinks and coffees, espressos, etc.).  we had a great time and thought scott r. was awesome...so we left him an appropriate tip.  as we were leaving, scott r.  came over and stopped my husband and told him that a 20% gratuity was included in the $354.20 total and that he did not have to leave an additional tip (i apparently missed that on the check...doh!).  my husband was blown away by his honesty and decided to leave him a small portion of the additional tip we had intended on giving.  so...that means our check was even less that i had thought...great food at a decent price...in vegas...what???\n\nso, in summary...the food is good, service is amazing, servers are honest, and the food is decently priced.  we will definitely be returning to lavo...perhaps to even check out the nightclub."

            "so, i get to vegas 2 or 3 times a year, to relax and enjoy good food.  overall, i would have to say the most mediocre dining experience i have had has been at lavo.  to even be in the same complex as bouchon is a travesty. \n\nso we enter (party of 2) 10 min early for our reservation, and were greeted, given a pager, and asked to wait - no problem, good start.\n\nsit down in the waiting area, too a while, but ordered a drink - ok no issues there.\n\nbuzzer goes off, i walk back to the hostess station, and say 'i have ordered drinks, but they haven't arrived yet' - the answer - 'ok, go back, and wait to settle the bill and come back when you get your drinks'.  really?  how about sending them to the table. seriously?  go back and wait and do a transaction?  fine, so we go back and wait for the drinks.  drinks arrive, i have to do the back and forth dance settling the transaction - go get bill, deposit cash, wait for change, etc....so i go back to the hostess station and they say - \"ok, it will be a minute\".  so i am standing there with a beer, and my dining partner has a full to the brim martini waiting....\n\nthe hostess now navigates us to the table.  we were packed in there,  like have to move the tables around so your aren't bumping into people around you.  not only is it packed but it is extremely loud.  i mean really really loud, barely able to hear the person across from you.  i am all for hip joints that have a buzz, but some conversation would be nice.  maybe this is the spot to take the 'professional help' out to so you don't actually have to fake a conversation?\n\nmenu seemed nice, nothing omg.\n\nordered 1/2 doz oysters, asked varieties, told they had kushis (my fav) and the ricotta topped meatball to start.  split a pasta main (eggplant and buffalo mozzarella) and have to sides of <mark>Sauteed Spinach</mark> and mushrooms.\n\nthe meatball and pasta were pretty darned good.  not awesome, but good.\n\noysters - they arrived - not kushis but kumomotos - didn't make a fuss, no bigs.  eat 3 of them, go for a 4th and once it hist the mouth, instantly know it is bad, the omg don't puke bad.  try to gracefully spit it out.\n\nwaiter comes, i comment to him that the oysterman should keep an eye out, i got a bad one, and usually they travel in clumps - response 'sorry'.  that was it, 'sorry'.  not \"gee thanks for the heads up, sorry if you would have drowned that oyster in cocktail sauce and swallowed it you would have blown chunks all over - man i am glad you didn't do that, gee what can we do to help out\" - nada, nothing.\n\nspinach - i love garlic.  i really love the stinking rose - but you have to cook it.  this was covered in raw garlic.  i mean loaded with raw garlic - basically an inedible 11 dollar side dish of spinach.\n\nmushrooms - they were hammered and burnt.  if you like almost dried out crunchy mushrooms with a great burnt taste, sure why not.\n\ni mention both to the waiter, get the same \"sorry\".\n\nat this point i must sound like an annoying d nozzle where this post would end up on whitewine.com, but honestly i am a pretty relaxed guy and can roll with the punches.  i get yelled at by customers all day, and can appreciate that a negative experience is an outstanding opportunity to build loyalty based on how you handle the situation...\n\nso i get the bill - nothing addressed, full price, rotten oysters, inedible spinach, and burnt mushrooms and all.\n\nthe only good news is that is was so farking noisy in the place, i couldn't even express my frustration to my dinner partner.\n\ndid i mention the couple next to us?  arrived as we placed our 'water' order.  he ordered soup, both had a main - his was ravioli and hers was a baseball fillet (requested medium).\n\nthey got their food when we were paying our bill.  fillet - yup you guessed it, on the rare side of medium rare (i was thinking self, that looks perfect, wonder if she wants to trade for inedible spinach and burnt mushrooms).  had to send it back.  really - a fillet?  you cant even get a fillet order right?\n\ni am sure lavo is the too cool for school place to hang out and show off your black mini-dress, pay premium price for food that is wildly inconsistent.  order drinks - sure!  order the meatball and drinks at the bar and then do some more walking - sure!  have a nice dinner where you can talk to your partner and actually eat a 3 course meal - not so much.  \n\ni think you get my drift", 
            "this restaurant has a super sexy vibe, and awesome food and service. \n\nwe ran about 30 minutes late to our saturday night reservation and i called to let the hostess know.  i was happy to see that the restaurant was right inside the front entrance to palazzo so we didn't have to battle the crowds of the casino on a holiday weekend. when we arrived, i apologized profusely but the hostess told me not to worry and gave me no shade whatsoever, seating us right away. this set the tone as all the waitstaff was friendly and seemed to be having a good time.\n\nthe vibe is awesome.  the design of the space is beautiful and feels really sophisticated.  it doesn't feel tacky or over-designed like other vegas restaurants. the generous candlelight was lovely and romantic (otherwise the restaurant is very dark).  there was a dj playing a really perfect blend house music and pop that was exactly right for right before going out.  if you don't like loud music or are in a group, i'd probably stick to a quieter venue.   \n\nour server, sal, was one of the best i have ever experienced!  i'm used to good service but he was great. he gave us the right amount of time to look over the menu and to relax between courses.  somehow he had that perfect balance of engagement and charm but wasn't too intrusive.  he enthusiastically recommended his favorite dishes and anticipated all of our questions and needs.  his recommendations were right on and our food was fabulous. \n\nwe got the tuna tataki, the black cod, the special truffle risotto, <mark>Sauteed Spinach</mark> and <mark>Brussels Sprouts</mark>.  while everything was above average for, the black cod was so perfectly prepared and flavorful.  all this and a drink, and we got out of there under $100 per person, not left hungry at all.\n\ni feel like when going to vegas it makes sense to try different spots all the time, but i have to say i'll be back to lavo for sure on my next visit!  it's so hard to find this authentic ambiance, expert staff and delicious food anywhere else on the strip!"
