            "the one thing i love about this place is the fact that it's off the strip, and it serves up <mark>The Classic</mark> homey style feel, rather than the over-glamorized you would expect in vegas. yeah you come this city hoping to escape into another reality, but it's nice to come down from the clouds once in a while.\n\nthe one thing i have to admire is there amazing variety of amazing egg selections. i decided on going with their chile relleno omelette, which was on the money, but their <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> is the thing to get. \n\nlisten, if you feel like wondering off the strip for some good home eatin', why not here??", 
            "liliana provided excellent service for our breakfast visit. my wife had <mark>The Classic</mark> breakfast and said the bacon was very good. i had a special, the hobo scramble, which was exactly what the description said and really hit the spot. their potatoes are <mark>Deli</mark> seasoned. we both also had their tasty sourdough toast. had already had coffee so can't speak to that but the <mark><mark>Raspberry Iced Tea</mark></mark> was good. it was memorial day so there was a pretty good line but it moved quickly, only about a 15 minute wait. hostesses were great, too!", 
            "great food; i got <mark>The Classic</mark> and added avocado to the toast! fast service and everything was tasty and our server carole ann was awesome!!! :)", 
            "ambiance: 4 - it was okay inside, kind of a cross between homey restaurant, diner and cafeteria. it was bright inside, lots of families, and it felt nice in there..like when you went out for breakfast in the 90s on a bright sunday morning.\n\nservice: 4 - i thought that the service was good. the servers are always smiling and genuinely kind. they are constantly concerned about your food and if everything is tasting good. \n\nfood: 3 - my disclaimer: i really only came here to eat eggs. i did not want any meat other than bacon. i strictly came here for really, really plain ol' breakfast food, and not anything else.\n\ni got a really boring item called \"<mark>The Classic</mark>\", but i really wanted just eggs and bacon, so that's what i went with. my over easy eggs were cooked perfectly. i mean, they were absolutely perfect. some cooks leave the yolk barely runny on the inside, but they are experts at eggs here..and i have no com<mark>Plain</mark>. \n\nthe <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> was soft and moist, but i just didn't like the taste of it. i think i'm just picky, but the banana in the muffin tasted a little ripe. the potatoes were good, but they weren't great. the bacon was a little overcooked and a little too hard for me. \n\ni totally forgot to check yelp before ordering, but next time, i'll order a healthy omelet and see how that goes!!", 
            "probably one of the best breakfast places i've ever had in las vegas! my husband and i ate here on a friday morning but thought we would have to wait awhile because it was full, however, we got seated right away and our food came out fast. i ordered <mark>The Classic</mark> and it was very good. our server chance was very nice and made us feel welcome. their bus boys are very efficient as well, as soon as people left they cleaned the tables in no time so that people who were waiting didn't have to wait long. overall, very happy experience :)", 
            "found this place on yelp. what a great place! a big  menu, friendly staff, and great food!! my wife had <mark>The Classic</mark> breakfast. <mark>Two Eggs</mark>, bacon, <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark>, and choice <mark>Side of Toast</mark> or a <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>.  the waitress recommended the works omelet - stuffed with <mark>Bacon, Ham, Sausage</mark>, <mark>Veggie</mark> and topped <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark>. very good!!!  we even got a free muffin for checking in there on yelp! check this place out. it's off the strip west on sahara ave.", 
            "had <mark>The Classic</mark> burrito and <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>. muffin was <mark>Deli</mark>! burrito came with a side of potatoes that was yummy. didn't care much for the sauce that came with the burrito. the service was great!", 
            "first time here and what have we been waiting for!?! we were seated quickly and our server alexa was great. very helpful with the menu and she even made a point to get the kids' food out first. (big plus for parents with kids that get bored quickly) the food was great. <mark>The Classic</mark> eggs benny was amazing (best canadian bacon i have had in as long as i can remember). we'll be back... soon!", 
            "i come to this place every time i come to vegas, no matter whom i'm with. they definitely have the traditional breakfast diner feel and the newspaper menus add to that feel. the waiters and waitresses are always friendly and conversationalists. the food is flavorful and you get a lot of it. i normally get <mark>The Classic</mark> eggs (with cheddar jack cheese), bacon (it's crispy!), their country potatoes, and 9 grain toast. if i don't order that then i order their parfait. i know, parfait sounds lame but their parfait comes in a big old school <mark>Milk</mark> glass with yogurt, granola, and a mix of fresh fruits. i actually couldn't even finish it last time. \n\nthis place is packed on the weekends and they do not take reservations. \n\nthey always have a deal a groupon, it's worth it!", 
            "came here for brunch on a saturday. waited 15-20 min for a table for two, and ended up with a nice spot in their shady outdoor patio with water misters. out server, amanda, was really sweet and we enjoyed the service. however, the table next to us had some interesting service...they asked a server for silverware and were told there was none left!!!! what?!?! they also waited a long time for cups to pour their beers into and were eventually told the restaurant was out of cups? what?!\n\nfood was great though! got <mark>The Classic</mark> with <mark>Two Eggs</mark>, toast, and <mark>Deli</mark> potatoes!\n\nthe paying process was annoying. you pay afterwards at the register, but it took us ten minutes to wait through the line just to pay!",

            "first, no cream for my coffee. they didn't ask or bring. checked menu on line before we went, but this location did not have the crabcake benny. my daughter ordered a coke, they brought diet. yuck! food came but no forks to eat it with. i got the <mark>Works Veggie Benny</mark>. too much lemon in the hollandaise. probably would have been great with the crabcakes. my daughter got the buttermilk pancakes. chewy?  and they said that can happen when you add syrup. really? doesn't happen at i hop. the manager was very concerned we didn't like our meal and took off the pancakes since they weren't eaten. the only reason i gave 2 stars. we did have 2 servers, and the 2nd was better,  but i won't be back.",

            "i am not a big fan of rachael ray, but she doesn't get on my nerves nearly as much as she did when she was all unfiltered perkiness. now that she has been homogenized and oprah-sized and puts on make-up like jack nicholson as the joker, i am somewhat sympathetic to her insatiable need to be the people's home cook, the pint-sized paula deen. maybe that's why i was rather turned off by one of her tasty travels recommendations, the egg & i on the corner of a strip mall out on sahara drive in vegas. \n\neven though it doesn't have the a-frame roof, it's really an ihop with a country kitchen vibe that seems to draw the who's who of the convoy-and-trailer-park set. rachael was giving her thumbs up to this place for all the egg dishes they offer. that i won't argue as the menu went on with variations of omelettes and skillet breakfasts that span the globe and stretch the pocketbook. jamie w. was being very good and ordered the <mark>Original <mark>Cabo Breakfast Burrito</mark></mark> (see photo). however, it was quite a log that came out with a flour tortilla stuffed with four eggs, diced bacon, bell peppers onions, potatoes, cheddar and jack cheese. it came on top of a plate of cubed ranch potatoes and some salsa. \n\nit honestly tasted like any <mark>Original <mark>Cabo Breakfast Burrito</mark></mark>, just more of it to justify the entree-level price. i went all self-indulgent and ordered the <mark>Blackened Prime Rib Benny</mark>, an eggs benedict variation which had little cubes of prime rib (whether it was blackened or even prime rib was quite arguable), sauteed spinach, roasted red bell peppers all chopped over what looked like a slice of texas toast. two poached eggs lay on top, and i asked for the hollandaise sauce on the side (see photo). thank goodness since it was the congealed variety that clogs arteries faster than drano cleans them out. it was on the meh side with nothing hofbrau-ish about the meat at all.\n\nthe dish came with the same cubed, packaged-looking potatoes jamie got, and neither of us had any desire to finish them out. when you order coffee here, you actually get a little pot so they can charge $2.25 for it. jamie had a glass of milk but it was $2 for just six ounces. hell, i would have lactated myself for that price. service was efficient, and even though they have a little egg sign you can flip over to get a waitress' attention, there was no need for it since they seemed interested in turning over tables lightning fast. i'm afraid i will need to second-guess rachael ray's judgments on what amounts to good eats on her travels, or else i may be doomed to high-calorie intakes of mediocrity. \n\nfood - 2.5 stars....just thought the dishes were just too generic despite the abundance...it didn't seem human hands touched those ranch potatoes \nambiance - 2.5 stars...country kitchen quaint if that's your idea of charming \nservice - 2.5 stars...efficient if rather impersonal, no need to flip that egg sign over on a busy morning \ntotal - 2 stars....right on the border between 2 and 3 stars, but i need to go with my bulbous, post-benny gut on this one", 
            "eggs & i is a popular brunch spot for locals in las vegas.  we had to drop by the airport and chose eggs & i as our go-to food spot afterwards.\n\nthe menu consists of a variety of eggs benedict dishes, omelettes, hash, and other breakfast items.\n\nservice is homey and the vibe is definitely casual here.  the menu comes out printed on newspaper stock so perhaps their items change frequently.\n\nwe started out with their signature <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> which accompanies many of their dishes.  light, soft, fluffy, and not too sweet, the banana nut bread was a hit and a great starter.\n\nour entrees included a mish-mash of their popular dishes:\n\n<mark>Blackened Prime Rib Benny</mark> (or benedict) - the highlight dish entree was an eggs benedict version made up of prime rib.  it replaces the traditional muffin with a croissant and is definitely a large portion so was plenty to share.\n\nflorentine benedict - a version made with spinach and ham.  pretty good.\n\nchicken <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark> - i only had a few bites, but i liked it.  it's a calorie killer though.\n\nkay's omelette - another signatuer omelette, it had plentiful cheese, ham, and egg.  kinda plain and not sure why this is so popular.  you could make similar omelettes at home.\n\nbrad's chili - wasn't sure which chili to order and was recommended this one.  it came out lukewarm, had a bland flavor and was generally forgetabble. \n\neggs & i is a decent brunch spot, but i wouldn't go out of my way to go here.  they take credit cards, including american express.", 
            "spent a few days in vegas and wasn't feeling like a \"buffet\" style breakfast or our normal hash house a go go meal. found egg and i in a coupon book given to us at our hotel. \n\nlocated in a strip mall with a lot of parking, there was no wait on a weekday morning, but the place was full of patrons. took a while for our server to take our order and asked us twice what we wanted to drink (amnesia maybe ?..no she was just busy, trying to tend to everyone), so after about 10 minutes, my husband flipped the sign with the un-happy egg, to show we needed attention. the sweet lady at the register quickly came to us and asked what we needed. our server quickly came to us and apologized for the wait and also brought each of us the best <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> ever !!! \n\ni had the blackend <mark>Blackened Prime Rib Benny</mark>, a grilled croissant with  prime rib, sauteed spinach and roasted red bell peppers, two poached eggs, then covered with hollandaise sauce. also came with home fries and 2 slices of fruit. this dish was amazing ! all the flavors tied together so well and that <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> will make me a return customer ! the hubby had crepes filled w/ mushrooms, that i take was also <mark>Deli</mark>, since  i didn't get to taste it ! \n\nthe coupon for a \"buy one meal get the other for half off\" made the whole experience even better.\n\n we'll be back in 2 mos..egg and i but this time we won't be alone.",

            "just for reference, i don't write 5 star reviews unless they're very well deserved.  but this place consistently rates high with us.  this was out third visit.  we recently visited egg & i for breakfast with a group of six.  we arrived about 10:30 in the morning.  there was a considerable waiting line.  however, the hostess was very sweet and efficient. the estimated 20 minutes wait was actually more like 10 minutes.  our waitress (sadly i didn't get her name) was incredible, attentive without being overbearing, quick and efficient.  once our orders were taken, the food arrived fairly quickly, no mistakes or wrong items.  we pretty much all ordered something different.  i had the house made (not canned) <mark>Homemade Corn Beef Hash</mark> and eggs.  excellent.  can't remember what everybody had but all raved about their food.\navoid the strip with it's lines <mark>Cheese <mark>Ham, Bacon or Sausage <mark>Mushroom and Cheese</mark></mark></mark> buffets and overpriced breakfasts and check this place out.  just a short drive from the strip.  mostly locals and a few visitors.  a gem!",

            "an early arrival to vegas gives us an opportunity to go off the strip and enjoy a couple of breakfast eateries. the egg and i has a cute name and an old cowboy ranch feel to it. the menus are newspapers and the servers are friendly!\n\nfood (4 stars): i ordered the corned <mark>Homemade Corn Beef Hash</mark> with over medium eggs and the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>. i'm usually not a banana nut fan, but this muffin changed my mind. it was full of spice and flavor, you can definitely taste the banana. the corned <mark>Homemade Corn Beef Hash</mark> was pretty good with the shredded style corned beef. the seasoned potatos were <mark>Deli</mark> and i wish i could've had more.\n\nwe ordered the cinncinati 4 way plate with onions. it is pretty much spaghetti pasta with chili and onions on top. our group was intrgued by the ingredients so we ordered it. it was amazing!!! who knew that chili and spaghetti pasta can go together so well?? topped <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> and onions, this is my dish!\n\nwe couldn't finish all of our food due to the large portions, so definitely come with an appetite. the food is still good after being reheated.\n\nservice (4 stars): our cute server was friendly and humorous. she frequently checked up on us and refilled our cups, she even got us another table because ours was cramped.\n\nbottom line: hungover? hungry? feeling like stuffinf your face? egg ans i will satisfy it all.", 
            "i came here not once, but three times during my week's vacation with my fiance. we couldn't get enough!\n\nbesides the amazing food, there's always great service! i love the little egg signs on the tables--flip the happy face to sad and the servers can all see that you need attention and someone comes along. none of that trying to wave someone down, hand signal, awkwardness going on here. we flipped ours only once and got our refill within like 20 seconds...it's absolutely amazing. (note that using this doesn't mean you're an unhappy guest, just that you need attention...)\n\nwe were served by three great servers during our breakfasts here this week: john (i think he's new), thaynara (sp?), and erin; all did a fantastic job bringing extra napkins, getting refills, answering questions about the menu, etc. they were quick and attentive and just all around fantastic. \n\nso, the food. amazing. i'm not a breakfast person. usually eggs kinda gross me out if they aren't cooked right, and i'm kind of picky, i know. so why did i go to a breakfast joint and get eggs every time? because they know how to cook them! between the omelet, scrambled, and over medium, all were cooked perfectly!! not that i doubted a place with \"egg\" in the name couldn't get it right, but every meal i had was executed to perfection. eggs weren't dry or overcooked, nor were they runny or watery. just right, every time.\n\nout of the six things we ordered over our three visits, i got the coffee every time. it was piping hot and <mark>Deli</mark>, and was a perfect compliment to the breakfast... they bring the caraffe to your table so you don't have to wait for refills on the coffee, either. you've got to ask for the fancy creamers, but they'll bring some out for you no problem! (they had caramel and french vanilla, and i thinkkkk the irish cream flavor too.) \n\nthey have some awesome works potatoes (i have always called these home fries) that are seasoned and chopped into cute little cubes (more surface area = more crispy potato!) that are super tasty. side note: if you don't want the potatoes, or just not a huge helping of them, you can ask to sub fresh fruit, or do 1/2 fruit, 1/2 potatoes, as my fiance and i did a couple of times. the fruit they have is fresh and sweet, from cantaloupe, honeydew, watermelon, grapefruit, and pineapple. \n\nthey also have these to-die-for <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>. these muffins are homemade and so soft and moist! utterly delectable--i definitely recommend them over the toast option offered with most breakfast plates.\n\nwe've tried the corned <mark>Homemade Corn Beef Hash</mark> (no canned meat products here!) and the <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark> as well as the biscuits and gravy; all were keepers. the biscuits are two whole ones, not one cut in half (big servings), and i like that they cut up the steak in the skillet, makes it so much easier to eat. we also tried the works omelet and <mark>Brad's Scramble</mark>. there is so much on this menu that is tasty! \n\ni did mark the price range as $$ because most of the plates are around $10-11, plus a drink, per person is kind of expensive. we were on vacation, which was why we splurged, but if you're a local this is still a lovely breakfast-brunch place to hit up for some great food. \n\nside note the second: the decor is really cute! it looks like hand-painted farmland all over the restaurant, and they have merch available to buy with their logo at the front (i.e. a baby onesie with \"just hatched\" on it or something) and they sell loaves of that <mark>Deli</mark> banana nut bread to go, too!\n\nrecap: everything is <mark>Deli</mark>, huge portions, perfect eggs, fantastic service, great experience. will definitely return and recommend. :d",

            "thank you yelp!  we were looking for a place to have a good breakfast before heading out on the road back to phoenix.  we had been in vegas for four nights and were looking for something other than the options around our hotel.  i found the egg & i using my awesome yelp iphone app.  everyone agreed to give it a shot and we were all singing praises to both egg & i and to yelp at the end of the meal.\n\nthe special <mark>Homemade Soup of the Day</mark> was the prime rib skillet, prime rib over breakfast potatoes, cheese, and eggs any way you want em.  two people at our table of six went for the special.  other meals included a <mark>Brad's Scramble</mark>, two chicken <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark> skillets, and mine was the kay's omelette (four egg spinach omelette stuffed with a blend of artichoke hearts, swiss cheese, parmesan, garlic <mark>Waffle with Fruit and Whipped Cream</mark> cheese. topped with fresh tomatoes and feta cheese.)  everyone was raving about their breakfast, except for one.\n\none friend does not like mushrooms and did not realize they were in her skillet.  she started to pick them out and when the waitress same to check on us, she noticed the pile of mushrooms and offered to have them remake the dish.  very nice customer service.  my friend didn't want to wait, so she declined, but it was still very nice of the server to notice and offer a new dish.\n\nthe standout of the meal was the breakfast potatoes with their special seasoning.  these are the best breakfast potatoes that i have ever had, and i love breakfast potatoes!  the seasoning had a really good flavor and the potatoes were in the perfect bite-sized chunks.\n\nthere are plenty of great reviews for this place, so i don't need to go on and on.  just one more final thought.  when i am coming home from a trip i always like to look back and think about what i learned during the trip.  on this trip, i learned a few things . . .\n\n1 - don't hold your new cell phone over a pint of guinness, chances are it may fall in.\n2 - cash out at roulette once you have doubled your original bet.  even if you just walk right back and put down the original bet again.\n3 - add the egg & i to the \"must-have\" list anytime i'm in vegas!",

Country Gravy</mark> all over it.  they have a chicken fries <mark>Chicken Fried Steak Skillet</mark> that is potatoes topped with chopped up <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark>, topped with gravy, topped with eggs however u want, it is awesome.  they also won some awards for their <mark>Works or Cincy Chili</mark> burger but i have never had it.   \n\nmy good friend and fellow yelper used to think cracked egg was the best place in town and refused to eat here for some stupid reason.  well we ate here and he was mad at himself for missing out on this place for all these years, don't make the same mistake.",

            "i know there's a lot of other breakfast places 2 eat at, especially the buffets in vegas but i can only take so much of all u can places.  that's y we chose here, w the help of yelp of course!  it's kinda \"retro\" in there.  the waitress we had wuz nice.  she kept coming back & giving me coffee refills.  i ordered chicken <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark>.  it came w 2 eggs, ranch potatoes & the best <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>.  omg, it wuz 2 die 4!!! that wuz yummy!!!  the place gets busy so try 2 come early.  located off the strip.  i love breakfast places like this!!!", 
            "a groupon and good reviews lead me to try this place in vegas. normally, i do not go off the strip to eat. i don't think this place is as good as the reviews lead it to be... the place was packed when i went though, around 11am. it took about 30 minutes or so for a table. looking at the menu, lots of stuff looked good and i had trouble deciding what to eat. the menu is a newpaper, which is actually really cute and different; also, there is a lot of word-play on the menu which i thought was cleaver. i ended up getting <mark>The Crazy Chicken</mark> <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark> skillet and my brother got the carnitas skillet. both did taste good, but i did not think it was spectacular. portions were a good size, a bit larger than average. my chicken steak was tender and crispy and the gravy was good... but the house potatoes it came with was way too salty. i mixed everything together to try to lessen the salt taste, but in the end, i couldn't finish all the potatoes because, well, it was just too much salt. i think they need to put less of the seasoned salt on it. i'm a total potato lover and i couldn't finish my potatoes. my skillet also came with 2 eggs, anyway you want and a muffin or toast. i chose the muffin. it was good-average. i tried a bit of the carnitas skillet... but i'm not a big mexican food fan... so it wasn't to my liking really, but my brother liked it. his did not come with a muffin or toast though. i also ordered coffee, thinking it was going to come in the interesting cup i see posted... it came in the ugly typical diner coffee cup...\n\npersonally, i think hash house a go-go has much better food and better prices... and way bigger portions!! my brother agrees with me too. \n\ni don't think this place is worth the wait... it didn't stand out in my mind. just an average breakfast place. prices are fair... my <mark>Chicken Fried Steak Skillet</mark> was $10.50 and the carnitas skillet was about $11. \n\ngo to hash house a go-go if you want special yummy breakfast food... this place is just average.", 
            "our friday morning breakfast club seems to be expanding and we ventured out to the egg and i with a few new members. looking back, we should have chosen a different location to welcome new members. i was not impressed with the waitress, who seemed to cop an attitude when reminded she sh<mark>Hot or Herbal Tea</mark> us a water. of course i got <mark>The Crazy Chicken</mark> <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark>, but was met with resistance when trying to substitute a pancake for my choice of bread. i was told i could not substitute, even if paying an up charge, and would have to actually get an order of pancakes. this is the first time i have run into this problem. she also told us we could not get separate checks at the table and would have to take care of that at the register. this turned out to be a fustercluck and inconvenienced the customers behind us at the register. the cfs itself was good, as were the potatoes. the eggs were eggs. i was leaning towards two stars, but the quality of the food helped to compensate for the difficult waitress.", 
            "i am very please with this place. i ordered the chile relleno omelette & i could not believe how <mark>Deli</mark> it was. a lot of places take a wack at mexican which usually ends up tasting like nothing more than pace picante tossed on top; not this plate! i can't call it authentic but it's pretty close! we also tried <mark>The Crazy Chicken</mark> <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark> & eggs, yummy!! it was nice to sit outside on their patio and enjoy <mark>Homemade Soup of the Day</mark> i'll be back!", 
            "2nd time eating here today.1st time was great but now i dont think so. my husband ordered chicken <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark>. the gravey tasted very strange. he scraped most of it off & continued 2eat. i ate1/2half of 1 of his hashbrown paties which had some gravey on it . w/in 30 mins i threw up ,w/in 1hr he also did the same & has not stoped all day vomiting.  i finally called & spoke 2a manager, the lady was nice &suggested  i call the operarions manager. i said no . but u need thow that gravey shit away!!", 
            "we went here twice on our last visit to vegas. overall 4 stars, one visit was earlier saturday the other was later sunday.\n\nfor our first visit, we went for breakfast. we were immediately seated, no waiting. wait staff were prompt and friendly, however, not very efficient. i noticed on 4 different occasions of them taking food orders to incorrect tables.\naside from that the food was awesome. the wife and i both had breakfast skillets, they were cooked perfectly and portions were spot on. we left full and happy!\n\nfor our sunday visit, we showed up closer to 11am. told the wait was about 25mins, which it was. staff were friendly and appeared to be much more efficient this visit. the wife ordered breakfast, chicken <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark> and it was very <mark>Deli</mark>! i had the <mark>Works Beef Dip</mark>, which was average at best. the beef and au jus just didn't have enough flavor and the fries were soggy. so, i'd say 3 stars this visit, close to 5 the first, would be an easy 4 overall.\n\non sunday this place was literally a zoo, people packed everywhere, kids screaming/crying, rude people in the parking lot. i'd rx going early to avoid the rush if you are the type of person that gets anxious easily.", 
            "with this review i will say that everything is relative.  when you consider other options in vegas for a good breakfast for a reasonable price, this is one of the best.  if you have read my other post you know i love chicken <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark> and of course that was my order here.  the steak was seasoned very good and had a lot of flavor.... really good!  i will be back to get it again in the future.  the gravy was good but not great in my opinion.  i really liked their breakfast potatoes as well as they were season with extra season and were better than i expected.  the eggs are eggs and nothing special there.  also their <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> is really good.  it is a bit greasy and not for anyone on a diet but you talking to someone that eats fried meats for breakfast.", 
            "best breakfast place i've ever been to! i'm visiting vegas from hawaii and travel a lot so have tried a lot of different places. but this has seriously got to be the best! \n\nour server was awesome, service was fast friendly and she cracked some jokes with us too! she provided great recommendations to the menu and was quick on the refills.\n\ni ordered <mark>The Crazy Chicken</mark> <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark>. it was amazing! the muffin that gets offered with the meal is a must! it was <mark>Deli</mark>! \n\nthe atmosphere of this place is just perfect. it has a diner feel, like a real diner feel, not some ihop or denny's crap. at the end of our meal, we got coffee and the served left us with a refill pitcher since we were drinking it so fast. even though we were just drinking coffee and done eating, our server still engaged in conversation, joked around and stopped by. she got a huge tip to say the least.\n\nthis place is the bomb!", 
            "came back a month later and had an awesome time! place was packed but got sat right away, our server was erin, aka freakin awesome! for was awesome just like i remembered. <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark> was crispy, gravy was perfectly seasoned! the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> was great too. \n\nfor some reason, this places coffee hits the spot. and they give a bowl of french vanilla creamers! awesome! my partner in crime had the corned <mark>Homemade Corn Beef Hash</mark> and she said it was <mark>Deli</mark>! \n\nerin was always right there refilling waters and left a coffee thermos at our table. bonus points! \n\nbottom line is that if you're on vegas, you have to eat here for breakfast. it is awesome! and erin is the bomb!", 
            "i came here not once, but three times during my week's vacation with my fiance. we couldn't get enough!\n\nbesides the amazing food, there's always great service! i love the little egg signs on the tables--flip the happy face to sad and the servers can all see that you need attention and someone comes along. none of that trying to wave someone down, hand signal, awkwardness going on here. we flipped ours only once and got our refill within like 20 seconds...it's absolutely amazing. (note that using this doesn't mean you're an unhappy guest, just that you need attention...)\n\nwe were served by three great servers during our breakfasts here this week: john (i think he's new), thaynara (sp?), and erin; all did a fantastic job bringing extra napkins, getting refills, answering questions about the menu, etc. they were quick and attentive and just all around fantastic. \n\nso, the food. amazing. i'm not a breakfast person. usually eggs kinda gross me out if they aren't cooked right, and i'm kind of picky, i know. so why did i go to a breakfast joint and get eggs every time? because they know how to cook them! between the omelet, scrambled, and over medium, all were cooked perfectly!! not that i doubted a place with \"egg\" in the name couldn't get it right, but every meal i had was executed to perfection. eggs weren't dry or overcooked, nor were they runny or watery. just right, every time.\n\nout of the six things we ordered over our three visits, i got the coffee every time. it was piping hot and <mark>Deli</mark>, and was a perfect compliment to the breakfast... they bring the caraffe to your table so you don't have to wait for refills on the coffee, either. you've got to ask for the fancy creamers, but they'll bring some out for you no problem! (they had caramel and french vanilla, and i thinkkkk the irish cream flavor too.) \n\nthey have some awesome works potatoes (i have always called these home fries) that are seasoned and chopped into cute little cubes (more surface area = more crispy potato!) that are super tasty. side note: if you don't want the potatoes, or just not a huge helping of them, you can ask to sub fresh fruit, or do 1/2 fruit, 1/2 potatoes, as my fiance and i did a couple of times. the fruit they have is fresh and sweet, from cantaloupe, honeydew, watermelon, grapefruit, and pineapple. \n\nthey also have these to-die-for <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>. these muffins are homemade and so soft and moist! utterly delectable--i definitely recommend them over the toast option offered with most breakfast plates.\n\nwe've tried the corned <mark>Homemade Corn Beef Hash</mark> (no canned meat products here!) and the <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark> as well as the biscuits and gravy; all were keepers. the biscuits are two whole ones, not one cut in half (big servings), and i like that they cut up the steak in the skillet, makes it so much easier to eat. we also tried the works omelet and <mark>Brad's Scramble</mark>. there is so much on this menu that is tasty! \n\ni did mark the price range as $$ because most of the plates are around $10-11, plus a drink, per person is kind of expensive. we were on vacation, which was why we splurged, but if you're a local this is still a lovely breakfast-brunch place to hit up for some great food. \n\nside note the second: the decor is really cute! it looks like hand-painted farmland all over the restaurant, and they have merch available to buy with their logo at the front (i.e. a baby onesie with \"just hatched\" on it or something) and they sell loaves of that <mark>Deli</mark> banana nut bread to go, too!\n\nrecap: everything is <mark>Deli</mark>, huge portions, perfect eggs, fantastic service, great experience. will definitely return and recommend. :d", 
            "having read the reviews on yelp, i just had to see for myself what all the fuss was about. well, i'm a big breakfast guy, and this place more than lived up to its reputation. i went with the <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark>, which had the perfect combination of crispy and tender. i'm more of a hash brown fan, but their cubed breakfast potatoes were very tasty. and i have to pay tribute to the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>; i don't even like <mark>Banana</mark>, but this was fantastic. to top it all off, my server staci was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. highly recommended.",

            "this was probably the best spot we hit on a recent trip to vegas.  it's always a good sign when a place is packed midweek. \nwe were sat immediately and there was no wait to receive drinks and menus. \nour waitress was chance and quite honestly one of the best servers i've had in a long time. she knew her menu and was open to giving suggestions. she was also very attentive and upbeat in general. during a pretty good breakfast rush, mind you!\nfirstly, as i said before, it's busy. but you never have to flag down a waitress or ask when your order is coming. there's a little sign on the table which lets you flip between a happy egg and a frowny egg. if the frowny egg is showing, the waitress/waiter is supposed to help you right away. i never had to use this sign because the service was so prompt. \nfirst thing i loved was the bottomless cup of coffee. you're given a full thermos pitcher of coffee all for your table and there's plenty of sugar (or substitutes) <mark>Waffle with Fruit and Whipped Cream</mark> at hand. \ni usually ask for a recommendation on what to order when traveling and chance was eager to help. she told me about the chile relleno benedict and said that it's not normally on the menu (special days only) but that it really was a must try. honestly, i'm not huge on chile relleno but hey she seemed enthusiastic and i went ahead and ordered it. \nit was amazing. and it should be an everyday menu item. i'll go into both dishes and what was so awesome about them below. \nchile relleno benedict:\nwow. the dish was amazing. benedicts make just about anything better but this was no joke. really well thought out and balanced. first thing i noticed was that the eggs were perfectly poached. the whites were soft but not slimey or runny. there was zero cooked yoke. it was warm and ran smooth just the way god intended. \ni don't know what was breaded in the dish but it was either the chile itself or the thinly sliced (and tender as all hell) <mark>Chicken Breast</mark>. the breading was really what made the dish i think. it added just enough saltiness that i didn't need to add salt or pepper to my breakfast. i always add salt and pepper (unless i get chicken <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark>) and that was a pleasant surprise. the chile and <mark>The Crazy Chicken</mark> were topped off with the poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. there were home fries on the side which also needed no seasoning beside what was already there but honestly i would have been ok just eating the chile relleno benedict. it was really that good. \nmy gf ordered the <mark>Grilled Veggie Pesto Sandwich</mark> with <mark>Habla Diablo Cajun Seasoned Fries</mark>. i didn't try the sandwich itself but she said the bread was very tender and the pesto was really tasty. i did sneak a few fries however and loved them. thinly cut shoestring style potatoes covered in seasoning. another instance where salt was not necessary. really they would have been fine without ketchup. \ni fully intend on visiting this place every time i head to las vegas and can't say enough good things about it. thank you chance for the awesome recommendation and thank you egg & i for turning out exceptional food and service at a great price!", 
            "wish this place was in california! gotta get the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>. i've only had the <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark> here, but refuse to get anything else. the potatoes are so bomb here, airways finish it! service is great and is always crowded. the 4.5 stars on yelp are definitely deserved!",

            "this place was horrible! did we come on a bad day or what? \n\nthe 4 of us decided to stop in here for breakfast before making the 10 hour trip back home. we decided to give this place a try as it had really good reviews. \n\nwe got in and got seated pretty fast, there was quite a few people. i ordered a vanilla latte coffee whatever and it was way too sweet. i feel like i might have gotten diabetes from that coffee. \n\naftwr looking at the newspaper menu for a few minutes i decided on <mark>The Crazy Chicken</mark> <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark> skillet since i am a big fan of all things chicken friend. the 3 others got the mexican omelet, i believe that is what it was called. \n\nthe food came out pretty quick, first glance at my <mark>Chicken Fried Steak Skillet</mark> made me queesy but i was hungry and i thought it can't be that bad. the <mark>2oz. Country Gravy</mark> was gelatinous. it was weird. like a slime blob of gravy exploded all over my food. whatever. give it a try. \n\nit didn't taste that bad but it didn't taste good. it was very salty and i just couldn't get over the slime gravy so i stopped eating. everyone else with their mexican omelet had tears streaming down their face. apparently the omelet was too spicy to even enjoy. my partner is mexican and loves her spicy foods. she is obsessed with all things spicy, tears will be streaking down her face and she will still say it isn't spicy enough, but even she struggled with the omelet. maybe not that it was too spicy but that it tasted like crap spicy. \n\nanyways, about 10 minutes after trying to eat my slime it hit me like a brick, i made a beeline to the bathroom and was in there for about 10 minutes only to return 5 more times. \n\nas you can imagine the 10 hour car ride home was horrible. never again.",

            "my family and i decided to try this place on the morning we were headed home from vegas. we got it off of the triple d website and have had great experiences in the past so it seemed like a great choice. while it was not a terrible experience, it was certainly a disappointing one and here is why:\n\nmy mother and i both have a food allergy to monosodium glutamate more commonly known as msg. it is a flavor enhancer/ preservative often found in foods like doritos, cheetos, and all of those other junk foods you shouldn't be eating (but let's face it, sometimes we just need some junk food). for me, a little is ok, but my mother can't eat it at all. \n\nwhen we sat down at the table, we asked if they used msg more out of habit than anything else; why would a breakfast spot need a preservative? our waitress, who was very nice, informed us that it was in most of the food, but not the eggs. my mother, who had originally decided on the highly rated chicken <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark>, had to change her order. both of chose the <mark>Sunrise Mountain</mark> and decided to order fruit rather than take our chances with the <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark> that came with 90% of the breakfast options.\n\nwhen the food came out it looked <mark>Deli</mark>, but one bite changed our opinion. while it was plentiful, it was bland. even the blanket of cheese over the top could not help it.\n\nmy father, who does not share my msg allergy, ordered a skillet. mom and i both took a bite of the <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark> from his plate and they were <mark>Deli</mark>. crunchy and flavorful, i would have loved to be able to eat them, but they were covered in stomach pain inducing msg. and the only option besides the potatoes was fruit (which was very nice, but did nothing for the dish itself).\n\ni gave this place two stars because the service was good and the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> <mark>Deli</mark>. now if only they could learn how to cook with flavor rather than chemicals...",

            "my favorite breakfast joint in vegas!\n\nthank the yelp gods for throwing this gem into my search for brunch.  best part is that it's off strip--meaning that the price is reasonable and not completely inflated and ridonkulous.  it's not too far off strip where it's a drag to get to, but you'll definitely have to drive or take a cab.\n\nwe've only visited during the week, so we haven't really ever had to wait for a table, but i can imagine that weekends can get pretty hectic.\n\nfood for days!  portion sizes are pretty large + with most breakfast entrees, you'll receive a choice <mark>Side of Toast</mark> or their incredible <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>.  if you choose against getting the muffin, you're bsc!  their muffin is the shyyyyza, plus they currently have a yelp check in offer for a free muffin!  double muffin!  i haven't strayed away from my favorite (chicken <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark> with their perfect potatoes), but their menu is quite extensive, and i'm pretty confident you'll be able to find something that you'll love on there.  but seriously, what's in those potatoes?  you've got me addicted, egg & i!\n\nthe servers are attentive and friendly, but the tables also have a small egg sign to get their attention.  it's a yellow, sad egg when you need assistance (so cute).  every time we've gone, we've never had to utilize this, since their waitstaff are so great.\n\negg & i will always be on our list for breakfast eats when we're vacationing in vegas!",

            "more like 2.5 stars.  this place is ok.  nothing special.  a bit pricey.  \n\nwent here with my cousin and a bunch of friends on one of many vegas trips.  my cousin was super excited because she had seen it on rachel ray.  i've never watched rachel ray, but if this is the kind of place she recommends, then i cannot trust her opinion.\n\nthis was another one of those \"it's more about saying you've been there, rather than the food\" type of places.  a lot of things on the menu sounded great.  \n got the <mark>Chicken Enchilada</mark> omelet.  it was ok.\ni forgot what my girlfriend ordered, but it sounded fantastic on the menu.  it was ok.\nmy friend ordered <mark>Seasoned Center Cut Pork Chops</mark> and eggs.  looked great.  he said it was ok.\nmy cousin and her hubby ordered whatever it was that rachel ray had ordered.  she was spouting off about how great it was, but honestly, it didn't even look that good.  her enthusiasm seemed forced.\nthe other members of our party weren't very pleased with their breakfasts either.\n\nthis place is only open until 2 pm.  so you better get there early.  don't worry about me holding up your table though, because i won't be back.  i'll be at blueberry hill, on flamingo rd., enjoying a very good breakfast for about half the price.",

            "i have to say, this was a outstanding breakfast, right down to the coffee. i had <mark>Seasoned Center Cut Pork Chops</mark> and eggs that was so tender. we also had the corned <mark>Homemade Corn Beef Hash</mark> which was outstanding. wherever you are at in vegas, this is worth the drive. it is now a must have when i come into town. i was outstanding", 
            "i wanted to try something new for breakfast. i had no idea where to go or what to eat. i came to yelp like i normally do. mostly everyone had something positive to say about this place, so my friend and i packed up and headed 15 minutes away to get some good breakfast.\n\nwhen we arrived, we could tell that it was going to be a long wait and a headache. i sent my friend in, ahead of me, so that i could park. as soon as she walked in, she called me. she said that the place was a mess and she was going to have to come out and wait the 15 minutes it was going to take to be seated. nevertheless, the hostess pointed out some empty benches, around the corner. so, i walked in to wait.\n\nupon entering, i was discouraged because a lot of people were standing around waiting. i just knew it was going to take 30+ minutes. surprisingly, it only took 15 minutes before we were called and seated.\n\nthe place is really small and packed to capacity, so i was thankful that we got to sit around the corner where there were only about 4-5 tables. we had plenty space.\n\nthe server came around fast to take our drink order. she was quick to bring our drinks back too. she asked us if we were ready to order and we said, \"no, we're looking at yelp pictures and we need some more time.\" i did ask about the stuff <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> dish that someone shared on yelp. she smiled and pointed it out and said that it's a popular dish. then she left and took orders for people that was around us.\n\nas soon as she walked away, we decided what we wanted, but it took her about 6 minutes to make eye contact again. when she did stop back by, she asked if we were still looking at pictures or if we were ready to order. we went ahead and ordered. it totally slipped my mind to check in and get a free muffin for myself. the waitress said, \"you were on yelp, did you check in to get the free muffin?\" i was happy she reminded me to do that.\n\nshe came back a couple minutes later and brought 2 muffins. i don't even like <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> but i took it anyways because it was free. i took a bite of it and fell in love. it was so warm and yummy lol. my friend got emotional lol. she said it reminded her of childhood, when her mother used to make them. they were just <mark>Deli</mark>.\n\nabout 12-15 minutes later, our food started to roll out. i order the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> with eggs, cheese and sausage on it. it also came with <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark>. it looked incredible. my friend ordered the 2 <mark>Seasoned Center Cut Pork Chops</mark> that came with 2 eggs, the muffin, that she had already ate, and the <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark>. her's looked <mark>Deli</mark> too.\n\ni love potatoes so i ate those first. i put ketchup all over them and had a ball. my friend didn't like hers, because they were kind of crunchy, so she gave them to me. i put ketchup on them and finished them off too lol.\n\nnext, i started in on my <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> sandwiches. i didn't like the sandwiches. the sausages, eggs <mark>Cheese <mark>Ham, Bacon or Sausage <mark>Mushroom and Cheese</mark></mark></mark> didn't have much flavor. i thought i made a big mistake. being that i'm so smart, i thought to scrape the sausages and eggs off the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> and season the filling myself. i did, and it was 90% better. i ate the filling separately, and ever so often, i would dip the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> in the warm syrup that came with my food.\n\nmy friend said that the <mark>Seasoned Center Cut Pork Chops</mark> were just okay. they were really thin, for sure. i don't know why, but we were expecting some big juicy chops vs the breakfast chops. i wanted to taste the chops for myself, so she took a bite of mine and i took a bite of hers. they tasted as if onions were the main and secondary seasoning. she was right. they were just okay. she did enjoy my mixture of filling and seasoning though.\n\nthe good thing is, we got really full and still had a bunch of food left. i'm sure it has something to do with a humongous portion of potatoes we got and the muffin we were served in the beginning.\n\nthe service was like a 3/5 because there was a little piece of hair in my water when the server dropped it off. i asked for another one and she just stared at my full cup for like 10 seconds. i guess she couldn't understand my reason behind needing another one. i didn't even mention it because it wasn't a big deal and i didn't want anyone to make a big deal over water.\n\nbut also, i took some points off service, because it took my sever a long time to refill my water, once i had actually finished it. it took her maybe 4 or 5 minutes to check on us, after we finished eating too. we just wanted a box to pack up leftovers. when she did stop back by, we asked for the box, she quickly picked one up, dropped it off and walked away. she came back around maybe 3 or 4 minutes later and told us to pay upfront. we were just sitting there, waiting for her to come back by so that we could pay and leave. i'm glad she did stop back by because we probably would have been sitting there for a while.\n\nalthough i'm in love with the potatoes and muffins, i probably won't go back because the rest of the food was just average."

Sour Cream</mark>. yummm! my husband had our usual...eggs benedict...and that was very <mark>Deli</mark> as well. the portions are huge! my husband eats like a beast...and i, like a man...and we still couldn't finish our food. our waitress was very sweet and attentive. she came back periodically to tend to us with a huge smile on her face. also, the food came out very fast! my tasty and fulfilling brunch definitely prepared me for a long and crazy day-night on the strip.",

            "let's be honest here: the whole vegas breakfast buffet phenomenon gets really old really fast.  yes, it's all you can eat for $9.99, but how much can you really eat?  and how much do you want to eat every single morning?  don't you want someone to bring you food instead of trying not to spill your bowl of oatmeal on a slow 80-year-old grandma in an \"i live to bingo\" sweater?\n\nif you do, take a short drive down w. sahara ave to egg and i.  you will not be disappointed.  inconspicuously located in a nondescript strip mall, egg and i provides a perfectly casual, hearty and homey breakfast without the pompousness and the hoopla of the strip.\n\nby now you're probably wondering what \"egg\" looks like.  well, egg looks kind of like humpty dumpty, and \"i\" looks just like \"egg.\"  just look on their website.  might as well call the whole place \"2 eggs,\" although it would probably detract from the restaurant's country kitchen charm.  \n\nwe came in around 9:30 am on saturday morning, and the place was absolutely packed.  we got a table right away, but every party that came in after 9:45 had to wait a little.  we had just gotten into town, and i was glad they brought us a whole pot of coffee.  you'd better believe i took advantage of the proximity and the unlimited availability of good coffee.  even the yellow cups with the company logo were cute enough to use at home.\n\nwe couldn't quite decide on what to order, and our waitress graciously waited, while offering valuable suggestions along the way.  the menu is extensive and the portions are huge, so....  also, breakfast is the most important meal <mark>Homemade Soup of the Day</mark>, so you don't want to make this decision lightly.\n\nthere was nothing light about my breakfast, however.  the ultimate skillet is not for the weak...that much i know.  a generous layer of breakfast potatoes had a cajun flavor to it.  paprika and something else gave those potatoes a light crunch and a reddish hue - pretty and <mark>Deli</mark>.  the ultimate skillet also featured mounds of sausage, ham and bacon, mixed in with bell peppers, onions <mark>Cheese <mark>Ham, Bacon or Sausage <mark>Mushroom and Cheese</mark></mark></mark>.  the skillet wouldn't be complete with 2 scrambled eggs on top.  wow.  \n\nwe also ordered one large pancake to share, but after getting through 3/4 of the skillet, i wasn't hankering for a pancake.  i did try it, and it was fluffy and sweet, but it was just too much.  i was ready to throw in the towel, which almost never happens to me.  on any other day, i can finish any breakfast, and have some of yours, too, but the ultimate skillet proved to be a bit much.  order at your own risk.  that's a lot of food for $9.95.\n\ngreat breakfast in a quaint setting?  i will be sure to make it my regular vegas breakfast destination.",

so my friend and i packed up and headed 15 minutes away to get some good breakfast.\n\nwhen we arrived, we could tell that it was going to be a long wait and a headache. i sent my friend in, ahead of me, so that i could park. as soon as she walked in, she called me. she said that the place was a mess and she was going to have to come out and wait the 15 minutes it was going to take to be seated. nevertheless, the hostess pointed out some empty benches, around the corner. so, i walked in to wait.\n\nupon entering, i was discouraged because a lot of people were standing around waiting. i just knew it was going to take 30+ minutes. surprisingly, it only took 15 minutes before we were called and seated.\n\nthe place is really small and packed to capacity, so i was thankful that we got to sit around the corner where there were only about 4-5 tables. we had plenty space.\n\nthe server came around fast to take our drink order. she was quick to bring our drinks back too. she asked us if we were ready to order and we said, \"no, we're looking at yelp pictures and we need some more time.\" i did ask about the stuff <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> dish that someone shared on yelp. she smiled and pointed it out and said that it's a popular dish. then she left and took orders for people that was around us.\n\nas soon as she walked away, we decided what we wanted, but it took her about 6 minutes to make eye contact again. when she did stop back by, she asked if we were still looking at pictures or if we were ready to order. we went ahead and ordered. it totally slipped my mind to check in and get a free muffin for myself. the waitress said, \"you were on yelp, did you check in to get the free muffin?\" i was happy she reminded me to do that.\n\nshe came back a couple minutes later and brought 2 muffins. i don't even like <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> but i took it anyways because it was free. i took a bite of it and fell in love. it was so warm and yummy lol. my friend got emotional lol. she said it reminded her of childhood, when her mother used to make them. they were just <mark>Deli</mark>.\n\nabout 12-15 minutes later, our food started to roll out. i order the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> with eggs, cheese and sausage on it. it also came with <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark>. it looked incredible. my friend ordered the 2 <mark>Seasoned Center Cut Pork Chops</mark> that came with 2 eggs, the muffin, that she had already ate, and the <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark>. her's looked <mark>Deli</mark> too.\n\ni love potatoes so i ate those first. i put ketchup all over them and had a ball. my friend didn't like hers, because they were kind of crunchy, so she gave them to me. i put ketchup on them and finished them off too lol.\n\nnext, i started in on my <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> sandwiches. i didn't like the sandwiches. the sausages, eggs <mark>Cheese <mark>Ham, Bacon or Sausage <mark>Mushroom and Cheese</mark></mark></mark> didn't have much flavor. i thought i made a big mistake. being that i'm so smart, i thought to scrape the sausages and eggs off the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> and season the filling myself. i did, and it was 90% better. i ate the filling separately, and ever so often, i would dip the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> in the warm syrup that came with my food.\n\nmy friend said that the <mark>Seasoned Center Cut Pork Chops</mark> were just okay. they were really thin, for sure. i don't know why, but we were expecting some big juicy chops vs the breakfast chops. i wanted to taste the chops for myself, so she took a bite of mine and i took a bite of hers. they tasted as if onions were the main and secondary seasoning. she was right. they were just okay. she did enjoy my mixture of filling and seasoning though.\n\nthe good thing is, we got really full and still had a bunch of food left. i'm sure it has something to do with a humongous portion of potatoes we got and the muffin we were served in the beginning.\n\nthe service was like a 3/5 because there was a little piece of hair in my water when the server dropped it off. i asked for another one and she just stared at my full cup for like 10 seconds. i guess she couldn't understand my reason behind needing another one. i didn't even mention it because it wasn't a big deal and i didn't want anyone to make a big deal over water.\n\nbut also, i took some points off service, because it took my sever a long time to refill my water, once i had actually finished it. it took her maybe 4 or 5 minutes to check on us, after we finished eating too. we just wanted a box to pack up leftovers. when she did stop back by, we asked for the box, she quickly picked one up, dropped it off and walked away. she came back around maybe 3 or 4 minutes later and told us to pay upfront. we were just sitting there, waiting for her to come back by so that we could pay and leave. i'm glad she did stop back by because we probably would have been sitting there for a while.\n\nalthough i'm in love with the potatoes and muffins, i probably won't go back because the rest of the food was just average.",

            "this was probably the best spot we hit on a recent trip to vegas.  it's always a good sign when a place is packed midweek. \nwe were sat immediately and there was no wait to receive drinks and menus. \nour waitress was chance and quite honestly one of the best servers i've had in a long time. she knew her menu and was open to giving suggestions. she was also very attentive and upbeat in general. during a pretty good breakfast rush, mind you!\nfirstly, as i said before, it's busy. but you never have to flag down a waitress or ask when your order is coming. there's a little sign on the table which lets you flip between a happy egg and a frowny egg. if the frowny egg is showing, the waitress/waiter is supposed to help you right away. i never had to use this sign because the service was so prompt. \nfirst thing i loved was the bottomless cup of coffee. you're given a full thermos pitcher of coffee all for your table and there's plenty of sugar (or substitutes) <mark>Waffle with Fruit and Whipped Cream</mark> at hand. \ni usually ask for a recommendation on what to order when traveling and chance was eager to help. she told me about the chile relleno benedict and said that it's not normally on the menu (special days only) but that it really was a must try. honestly, i'm not huge on chile relleno but hey she seemed enthusiastic and i went ahead and ordered it. \nit was amazing. and it should be an everyday menu item. i'll go into both dishes and what was so awesome about them below. \nchile relleno benedict:\nwow. the dish was amazing. benedicts make just about anything better but this was no joke. really well thought out and balanced. first thing i noticed was that the eggs were perfectly poached. the whites were soft but not slimey or runny. there was zero cooked yoke. it was warm and ran smooth just the way god intended. \ni don't know what was breaded in the dish but it was either the chile itself or the thinly sliced (and tender as all hell) <mark>Chicken Breast</mark>. the breading was really what made the dish i think. it added just enough saltiness that i didn't need to add salt or pepper to my breakfast. i always add salt and pepper (unless i get chicken <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark>) and that was a pleasant surprise. the chile and <mark>The Crazy Chicken</mark> were topped off with the poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. there were home fries on the side which also needed no seasoning beside what was already there but honestly i would have been ok just eating the chile relleno benedict. it was really that good. \nmy gf ordered the <mark>Grilled Veggie Pesto Sandwich</mark> with <mark>Habla Diablo Cajun Seasoned Fries</mark>. i didn't try the sandwich itself but she said the bread was very tender and the pesto was really tasty. i did sneak a few fries however and loved them. thinly cut shoestring style potatoes covered in seasoning. another instance where salt was not necessary. really they would have been fine without ketchup. \ni fully intend on visiting this place every time i head to las vegas and can't say enough good things about it. thank you chance for the awesome recommendation and thank you egg & i for turning out exceptional food and service at a great price!",

            "this place was horrible! did we come on a bad day or what? \n\nthe 4 of us decided to stop in here for breakfast before making the 10 hour trip back home. we decided to give this place a try as it had really good reviews. \n\nwe got in and got seated pretty fast, there was quite a few people. i ordered a vanilla latte coffee whatever and it was way too sweet. i feel like i might have gotten diabetes from that coffee. \n\naftwr looking at the newspaper menu for a few minutes i decided on <mark>The Crazy Chicken</mark> <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark> skillet since i am a big fan of all things chicken friend. the 3 others got the mexican omelet, i believe that is what it was called. \n\nthe food came out pretty quick, first glance at my <mark>Chicken Fried Steak Skillet</mark> made me queesy but i was hungry and i thought it can't be that bad. the <mark>2oz. Country Gravy</mark> was gelatinous. it was weird. like a slime blob of gravy exploded all over my food. whatever. give it a try. \n\nit didn't taste that bad but it didn't taste good. it was very salty and i just couldn't get over the slime gravy so i stopped eating. everyone else with their mexican omelet had tears streaming down their face. apparently the omelet was too spicy to even enjoy. my partner is mexican and loves her spicy foods. she is obsessed with all things spicy, tears will be streaking down her face and she will still say it isn't spicy enough, but even she struggled with the omelet. maybe not that it was too spicy but that it tasted like crap spicy. \n\nanyways, about 10 minutes after trying to eat my slime it hit me like a brick, i made a beeline to the bathroom and was in there for about 10 minutes only to return 5 more times. \n\nas you can imagine the 10 hour car ride home was horrible. never again.", 
            "the egg and i, and chicken <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark>!\n\nexperience:  i met some friends for early lunch or late breakfast.  it was pretty busy for 11:00 on a thursday.  \n\nfacility:  fairly good size place with a dinner atmosphere. there were murals on the walls,  and typical tables and chairs with some half booth seating too. \n\nservice:  not the best service i ever had, but not the worst. doesn't seem to be one set waitress per table...this can be a good or bad thing. it took a good 10 minutes before someone took my drink order, we had to flag someone a few times, and after the food came, no one did the check back to make sure we didn't need anything else....but when they did help us, they were friendly and quick. \n\nfood:  a girlfriend and i decided to split two meals, so we could try more.  we ordered the \"chili relleno eggs benedict\" special, and we got the \"chicken <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark> with over easy eggs and <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>.\"  \nthe muffin came out warm and it was pretty tasty.  would have been perfect if they served some butter with it. \nthe benedict was good. i love the chili taste that cut the richness of the benedict. \n<mark>The Crazy Chicken</mark> <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark> was good, but not the best i ever had. it was crispy outside and a nice southern white gravy on the side to dip it in. i really did enjoy the hash brown potatoes on the side.  when they first came out, i thought i wouldn't like them because they looked to have too much seasoning on them.  however, they actually had just the right amount, and it had a lawrys season salt flavor. \n\noverall:  i would definitely come back here again. they have so many good things in the menu i want to try.  see yah soon!!",

            "thank you yelp!  we were looking for a place to have a good breakfast before heading out on the road back to phoenix.  we had been in vegas for four nights and were looking for something other than the options around our hotel.  i found the egg & i using my awesome yelp iphone app.  everyone agreed to give it a shot and we were all singing praises to both egg & i and to yelp at the end of the meal.\n\nthe special <mark>Homemade Soup of the Day</mark> was the prime rib skillet, prime rib over breakfast potatoes, cheese, and eggs any way you want em.  two people at our table of six went for the special.  other meals included a <mark>Brad's Scramble</mark>, two chicken <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark> skillets, and mine was the kay's omelette (four egg spinach omelette stuffed with a blend of artichoke hearts, swiss cheese, parmesan, garlic <mark>Waffle with Fruit and Whipped Cream</mark> cheese. topped with fresh tomatoes and feta cheese.)  everyone was raving about their breakfast, except for one.\n\none friend does not like mushrooms and did not realize they were in her skillet.  she started to pick them out and when the waitress same to check on us, she noticed the pile of mushrooms and offered to have them remake the dish.  very nice customer service.  my friend didn't want to wait, so she declined, but it was still very nice of the server to notice and offer a new dish.\n\nthe standout of the meal was the breakfast potatoes with their special seasoning.  these are the best breakfast potatoes that i have ever had, and i love breakfast potatoes!  the seasoning had a really good flavor and the potatoes were in the perfect bite-sized chunks.\n\nthere are plenty of great reviews for this place, so i don't need to go on and on.  just one more final thought.  when i am coming home from a trip i always like to look back and think about what i learned during the trip.  on this trip, i learned a few things . . .\n\n1 - don't hold your new cell phone over a pint of guinness, chances are it may fall in.\n2 - cash out at roulette once you have doubled your original bet.  even if you just walk right back and put down the original bet again.\n3 - add the egg & i to the \"must-have\" list anytime i'm in vegas!", 
            "loved the <mark>Ciabatta Breakfast Sandwich</mark> <mark>Brad's Scramble</mark> special!  service was great and food came in a timely manner.  jose did great and deserves to meet the mau5!", 
            "i came here not once, but three times during my week's vacation with my fiance. we couldn't get enough!\n\nbesides the amazing food, there's always great service! i love the little egg signs on the tables--flip the happy face to sad and the servers can all see that you need attention and someone comes along. none of that trying to wave someone down, hand signal, awkwardness going on here. we flipped ours only once and got our refill within like 20 seconds...it's absolutely amazing. (note that using this doesn't mean you're an unhappy guest, just that you need attention...)\n\nwe were served by three great servers during our breakfasts here this week: john (i think he's new), thaynara (sp?), and erin; all did a fantastic job bringing extra napkins, getting refills, answering questions about the menu, etc. they were quick and attentive and just all around fantastic. \n\nso, the food. amazing. i'm not a breakfast person. usually eggs kinda gross me out if they aren't cooked right, and i'm kind of picky, i know. so why did i go to a breakfast joint and get eggs every time? because they know how to cook them! between the omelet, scrambled, and over medium, all were cooked perfectly!! not that i doubted a place with \"egg\" in the name couldn't get it right, but every meal i had was executed to perfection. eggs weren't dry or overcooked, nor were they runny or watery. just right, every time.\n\nout of the six things we ordered over our three visits, i got the coffee every time. it was piping hot and <mark>Deli</mark>, and was a perfect compliment to the breakfast... they bring the caraffe to your table so you don't have to wait for refills on the coffee, either. you've got to ask for the fancy creamers, but they'll bring some out for you no problem! (they had caramel and french vanilla, and i thinkkkk the irish cream flavor too.) \n\nthey have some awesome works potatoes (i have always called these home fries) that are seasoned and chopped into cute little cubes (more surface area = more crispy potato!) that are super tasty. side note: if you don't want the potatoes, or just not a huge helping of them, you can ask to sub fresh fruit, or do 1/2 fruit, 1/2 potatoes, as my fiance and i did a couple of times. the fruit they have is fresh and sweet, from cantaloupe, honeydew, watermelon, grapefruit, and pineapple. \n\nthey also have these to-die-for <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>. these muffins are homemade and so soft and moist! utterly delectable--i definitely recommend them over the toast option offered with most breakfast plates.\n\nwe've tried the corned <mark>Homemade Corn Beef Hash</mark> (no canned meat products here!) and the <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark> as well as the biscuits and gravy; all were keepers. the biscuits are two whole ones, not one cut in half (big servings), and i like that they cut up the steak in the skillet, makes it so much easier to eat. we also tried the works omelet and <mark>Brad's Scramble</mark>. there is so much on this menu that is tasty! \n\ni did mark the price range as $$ because most of the plates are around $10-11, plus a drink, per person is kind of expensive. we were on vacation, which was why we splurged, but if you're a local this is still a lovely breakfast-brunch place to hit up for some great food. \n\nside note the second: the decor is really cute! it looks like hand-painted farmland all over the restaurant, and they have merch available to buy with their logo at the front (i.e. a baby onesie with \"just hatched\" on it or something) and they sell loaves of that <mark>Deli</mark> banana nut bread to go, too!\n\nrecap: everything is <mark>Deli</mark>, huge portions, perfect eggs, fantastic service, great experience. will definitely return and recommend. :d",

            "this is a great breakfast option off the strip. took my family here for breakfast recently and had enjoyable experience. \n\nit's about a 10 minute drive from main casinos, located in strip mall. popular dining spot for locals and gets packed on weekends. luckily, we arrived early before the breakfast rush and were seated immediately. good thing too, 20 minutes after a bus load of people arrived and place was full.\n\ncountry style atmosphere and d\\u00e9cor provide the perfect backdrop for their food. both indoor and outdoor patio seating is available. old-fashioned breakfasts are the specialty here, including huge omelet platters, pancakes, eggs benedict and a large selection of house specialties. prices are reasonable and large portions. i highly recommend trying their famous <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>. omg, so good! super moist and the flavor profile is off the charts. i got mine free with my yelp check-in. you can also substitute the toast that comes with your breakfast entr\\u00e9es for a muffin. \n\nwe ordered \"the works\" scramble, <mark><mark>Fresh Veggie</mark></mark> omelet and the hawaiian breakfast spam and eggs. everything was fantastic! served in large skillet, the scramble was yummy. it's loaded with sausage, ham, bacon, onions, tomatoes, green bell peppers and mushrooms, served with <mark>Hash Browns</mark> and topped with the fluffiest scramble eggs. enough for 2, i literally devoured everything and no regrets. i loved the taste and texture of the <mark>Hash Browns</mark>, lightly crisp and tender. i usually prefer shredded kind, but this was equally nice. of course, who doesn't love spam and eggs for breakfast? simple hawaiian-pinoy breakfast done well here, served with steam rice. just the way us locals love them.\n\nmost of the time we usually dine along the strip because it's convenient. egg and i was definitely worth the drive and waking up early for. service was excellent too. our server did a phenomenal job, friendly and refilled our coffee regularly. still thinking about those <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>. looking forward to coming back."

Country Gravy</mark> all over it.  they have a chicken fries <mark>Chicken Fried Steak Skillet</mark> that is potatoes topped with chopped up <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark>, topped with gravy, topped with eggs however u want, it is awesome.  they also won some awards for their <mark>Works or Cincy Chili</mark> burger but i have never had it.   \n\nmy good friend and fellow yelper used to think cracked egg was the best place in town and refused to eat here for some stupid reason.  well we ate here and he was mad at himself for missing out on this place for all these years, don't make the same mistake.",

            "i really enjoy breakfast food but going to breakfast eateries, they just give so much food.  \n\nanyway gotta eat breakfast so we came here.  typical breakfast shop.  i ordered the fiesta skillet which was a layer of their ranch potatoes topped with a mixture of green <mark>Chili</mark>, onions, and salsa.  on top of that was a layer of melted cheese and <mark>Two Eggs</mark> over-easy.  the skillet was accompanied by two slices of wheat toast and two slices of fruit.  it was pretty tasty.  i really like the ranch potatoes, eggs were cooked correctly, no brown spots and yolks were runny.\n\nthere were three different types of <mark><mark>2oz. Habla Diablo Original Salsa</mark> or Habla Diablo Tomatillo Salsa or Homemade Enchilada Sauce</mark> on the table original, chipotle, and verde.  so if you need a little spice in your breakfast you can choose your pain.  well not really since none of them are that spicy.  \n\noverall  i enjoyed breakfast.  i have tried other items at their other locations they all taste good.  would definitely be up there on the list of breakfast places to go.", 
            "searching for a breakfast joint, we took these reviews to heart and checked out egg & i.  we were anything but disappointed.  the coffee/toast/butter aroma wafting throughout the restaurant was inviting in itself.  our terrific server, lindsey, volunteered i could have a 1/2 order of anything, as i was not up to 4 eggs.  i chose the <mark>Chili Rellenos Omelette</mark> - perfect - and a 1/2 order was more than i could handle!  my husband had the bandit scramble - <mark>Deli</mark>.  loved that a carafe of coffee was left on my table, so i could serve myself when i wanted more.  loved that the cost was less than a hotel buffet -- and i didn't have to serve myself!  it is now our fave.", 
            "such an amazing place for brunch! call ahead and ask if there is a wait just because when we got there, there was quite a line. waited for about 15-20 mins, not bad for a sunday, specially for mother's day. \n\nambiance is a homey relaxed vibe. they serve a variety of eggs, pancakes and <mark>Chili</mark>. they have a lot of options and vegetarians too so check out the menu! \n\nprice is about comparable to denny's or ihop. \n\ni ordered chile relleno omelet with banana but bread and the hubby got 'the works,' with toast. we enjoyed our food and both finished it in no time. \n\nwill definitely come back. \n\nour server erin is very upbeat and personable, made our dining experience a little extra special!",

            "yes there will always be a line, but you know that usually means where the good foods are. and the wait is so worth it for this place!!! the line moves very fast, and you will be sitting down with a yummy warm <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>. portions are big, and you will be stuffed. i tried the <mark>Works or Cincy Chili</mark> for the first time. it's an all meat chili with a sweeter taste. then i had the best <mark>Loco Moco</mark> ever! instead of the usual brown gravy, they use <mark>2oz. Country Gravy</mark>. and their homemade hamburger patty has so much flavor, and cooked to perfection.", 
            "i was fortunate to hit it off with the gm's father at the poker table and he hooked me up with a free lunch here so i decided to check it out.  i'm not letting that bias my review though. if i think food sucks i always let my fellow yelpers know.\n\nthe place was packed but fortunately there were some seats available.  the menu was gigantic...so many choices, what to get?!? i ended up getting the <mark>Chili Rellenos Omelette</mark>.  i love chili rellenos and i like omelettes so why not?  fantastic choice!!!  this was just a flavor explosion in my mouth.  it's covered in some sort of enchilada type sauce.  yummmmmm.  i can say without question this was the both the best chili relleno and the best omelette i've ever had.  i had lots of options for bread and went with a bagel.  both that and the fruit i had were fine.\n\nno com<mark>Plain</mark> with my first trip!  my main course was not just good it was superb.  i don't give out 5-stars lightly.  i'll be back!"

(the actual price of a cab not lost from the strip is about $12) we were seated in 15 minutes of arriving....and our server was sweet and good. i love anyplace that brings you not just a cup of coffee but a whole carafe....let me start off by saying i am not a breakfast eater but others in my group loves breakfast. \n\ni ordered the oatmeal which was oatmeal and it came with milk and brown sugar. i also ordered a side of bacon which was perfectly done. my husband had the waffles which were huge and came with strawberries <mark>Waffle with Fruit and Whipped Cream</mark>, eggs and bacon it was really good. i tasted from everyone's respective egg plates and they were all amazing. i believe there was a vegetable skillet and a little piggy at the table and those were divine. there were two <mark>Works <mark>Small Fruit Plate</mark></mark> that came with cantalope, blueberries, strawberries and some other fruits. the ranch potatoes were amazing just the right mix of crispy and soft....i wish that i liked breakfast...one of my friends said that the pancakes here were the best she has ever had and she is a bit of a pancake snob. the portions were huge and the prices were right. you cannot go wrong with hitting up the egg and i if you are into breakfast or with a bunch of people who are into breakfast. they also had other menu items available...burgers, salads, sandwiches. on my next trip to vegas i will be sure to head off the strip for some of this eggy goodness!!",

            "hello hungry people!! yes, i'm back (again)!  let's dig in...\n\nso, my local bestie recommended this place to a friend and i who were in lv and i'm so happy she did!  this quaint little gem is amazeballs!!  they give you menus that look like newspapers and bright yellow mugs, awaiting your coffee, adorn the tables.  of course, as the name suggests, eggs are their specialty, but they offer much much more!\n\nthe waitress suggested i try the \"<mark>Loco Moco</mark>\" and i was not disappointed!! it was a beautifully, <mark>Deli</mark> symphony on my tongue!! <mark>Sticky White Rice</mark>, eggs (any way you like), hamburger patty, and brown gravy. \n\n i know what you're thinking...\"is this chick pregnant?!\" rest assured, i'm not (any more) and this dish really made sense once i took a bite!! just wonderfully cooked and seasoned and all the different components played nice together in the tummy!\n (there's a party in my tummy...so yummy, so yummy yummy)\n\nit's not in the nicest part of lv, but that's why i love finding these \"off-the-beaten-path\" joints!  what they lack in environment, they make up for in taste and ambiance!", 
            "egg & i has become a recent tradition with the future in-laws.\n\nit's a nice change-of-pace versus the strip and a mere ten minute drive but not worth the added expense if you plan on cabbing.\n\nparking is plentiful and there is a <mark>Deli</mark> bakery with some of the stickiest baklavas in the same strip mall to warmup while you wait (ranging from 10 to 30 min).\n\nprices are reasonable, service is shoddy, and luckily one cannot mess up eggs.  food wasn't greasy for whatever's thats worth.\n\nas you may have guessed menu is egg-centric but fear not.  i decided to change things up during my latest visit and ordered hawaiian food.  yep, you read that right and my internal organs as of a week later remain intact.  they offer: <mark>Loco Moco</mark>, spam and eggs and portuguese sausage and eggs.  ordered both the spam and portuguese sausage and had no regrets.  forgot the name of the <mark>Original <mark>Cabo Breakfast Burrito</mark></mark> with the chorizo but it was dense af and subsequently awesome.\n\ntheir homefries are also a must.", 
            "i really like this place.  casual, cheap and good breakfast.  most of your breakfast dishes come with a choice <mark>Side of Toast</mark> or <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>.  get the muffin.  their are so many choices, it's hard to make a decision.  i've had the <mark>Loco Moco</mark>, pancakes, omelettes, <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark>, country style breakfasts.  popular place so you will wait for your tables.  parking is abundant.", 
            "great local breakfast restaurant.\nfantastic service, selection and prices.\n\nanything from basic steak and eggs to a selection of benedicts to <mark>Loco Moco</mark>.  all filling and oh so good.\n\nnext time you are visiting vegas, take a little drive and get out of the overpriced resort restaurants.", 
            "i would give the food 5 stars; my wife would give it a 3.  we had to wait 20 minutes for a server and crystal came to our rescue.  it was not her station and she was a star once she knew we hadn't been served.  \n\ni went there for <mark>Loco Moco</mark> but ordered the <mark>Island Favorite</mark>; portuguese sausage, eggs and <mark>Sticky White Rice</mark> with a slice of fresh pineapple.  it was a real treat!   i have used kikkoman soy sauce all my life and was pleasantly surprised by \"aloha soy sauce\" that crystal brought to the table.  it is slightly sweet and was a nice change.  \n\nmy wife said the biscuits and gravy were good but did not enjoy the \"works potatoes: which looked like diced potatoes, deep friend and seasoned with lawry's seasoning salt.  she had a side of bacon which was really good.", 
            "this place is a must stop every time i go to vegas.  i go to vegas at least once a year, more if i can and anyone who goes with me know that we will go here.  it is still pretty busy in the late morning even if it is off the strip, but if you go early (cause you're still on e. coast time), or later, it isn't so bad.  \nat home we have a place with this name, but it is not the same place.  this place is epic good.  my favorites are the <mark>Chicken Enchilada</mark> omelet, the strawberry <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark>, the banana nut <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark>, and the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> here is out of this world.  \nafter a 2008 trip to hawaii i became obsessed with hawaiian breakfast and they have both your traditional breakfast of eggs, rice and spam or portuguese sausage, but they also have <mark>Loco Moco</mark>!  if you've never had <mark>Loco Moco</mark> it is crazy good.  rice, steak, and eggs with gravy dumped on top.  yummy!", 
            "this place is usually busy, but the wait isn't to bad.  they have indoor and outdoor seating.  \n\nthe service is great, the wait staff is friendly and they use an egg flip system on your table to help with the service.  if you don't need help, the egg shows a smile.  if you do need assistance, flip the egg and it shows a sad yellow egg to alert your server.  \n\nthey know how to cook eggs here!  it's hard to find a place that knows how to do a proper soft scramble and egg & i does it right.  they have a great fresh fruit waffle and their crepes are really good.  they also have a hawaiian menu with <mark>Loco Moco</mark>, <mark>Portugese Sausage</mark>, spam, eggs and rice (the real sticky kine) and aloha shoyu!  \n\ntip:  try the banana nut bread...ono!", 
            "food was good service was uh-may-zing!...30 people and fast friendly and efficient service. stacie rocks!\n\noh yeah they got <mark>Loco Moco</mark> and portuguese sausage island style!", 
            "egg-cellent food & service. i ordered the <mark>Loco Moco</mark>, a hawaiian stapled & gravy is the secret. great job guys. karla was super friendly & patient w/ our massive group during prime time brunch on sunday. she was soo kind as to anticipate our needs, service was efficient & everything came out hot & correct! good work guys. will stop by on our next visit soon!", 
            "our server arlene was eggceptional!! and my haole <mark>Loco Moco</mark> was so so good. reminded me of oahu!  thank you for a great experience!", 
            "we used to come years ago more often, but since we've moved to the nw i just seem to never be around this area when it is open so we made a trip to come eat here. \n\nso i saw they had <mark>Loco Moco</mark> on their menu which is something i wasn't expecting. i decided to order it anyways though i wasnt sure about ordering a item at a non hawaiian spot. it was actually really good, even better than most of the fast food style hawaiian places as everything tasted much fresher and the gravy had good flavor. \n\nthe fiance got a <mark>Chicken Apple Walnut</mark> chicken sandwich which he seemed to enjoy. i took a bite and it's solid as far as cold <mark>Bbq <mark>Tossed Balsamic Glazed Chicken Salad</mark></mark> sandwiches go. \n\nthe thing i like is they are always friendly here. i really liked our server as she was just chipper. \n\nit's always busy here so i avoid the peak times to not have to wait, but if you go later in the afternoon like we did, there's no one there. 1 hour wait for breakfast time or no wait for breakfast at lunch....i'll pick the no wait! \n\nit's been a long hiatus, but my next visit won't be so far off again.", 
            "i love the egg and i. this is my families favorite breakfast spot. i love the chile <mark>Chili Rellenos Omelette</mark> and  my husband always orders the <mark>Loco Moco</mark>. the ranch potatos are so <mark>Deli</mark>. we've had the skillets with eggs and meat. pretty much anything you order from here is going to taste good. \n\nour server breeanndra was very nice. she was fast and friendly. anytime we needed something she was right there ready to help. i love this place it gets packed on the weekends in the morning rush so make sure to bring a book or magazine while you wait. its worth it!", 
            "yes there will always be a line, but you know that usually means where the good foods are. and the wait is so worth it for this place!!! the line moves very fast, and you will be sitting down with a yummy warm <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>. portions are big, and you will be stuffed. i tried the <mark>Works or Cincy Chili</mark> for the first time. it's an all meat chili with a sweeter taste. then i had the best <mark>Loco Moco</mark> ever! instead of the usual brown gravy, they use <mark>2oz. Country Gravy</mark>. and their homemade hamburger patty has so much flavor, and cooked to perfection.", 
            "at a little before 7am on a sunday morning, the place was almost deserted.  this was a little worrisome, but we soon realized that this said far more about the vegas population than it did about the quality of the breakfast.  here's the best recommendation i can give about the food: i came back for breakfast the next day!  and we would have come back the third morning except that we had to be on the road before they opened at 6am!\n\nwe got off to a good start.  when the waitress found out this was our first visit, she brought us a warm <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> to try.  it's a house special and well worth getting.\n\nwhen you open up the newspaper-like menu, the first thing you'll notice is the words habla diablo in blazing red appearing in the descriptions of at least half the dishes.  my wife wanted the <mark>Spinach Benny</mark>, but was concerned about the <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark> because the name sounded spicy and she's a self-proclaimed spice wimp.  the waitress ex<mark>Plain</mark> that it wasn't spicy at all, that habla diablo is the owner's side company and he had just redone the menu to emphasize his products.  my wife went ahead with her <mark>Spinach Benny</mark> and i got the <mark>Loco Moco</mark>, with an extra side of the <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark>.  (it turns out that the habla diablo seasoning is a lot like lawry's seasoned salt.)\n\nmy wife really liked her <mark>Spinach Benny</mark>, but didn't care for the potatoes.  (but she's not a big fan of breakfast potatoes to begin with.)  i liked the potatoes and finished most of hers in addition to mine.  plus the <mark>Loco Moco</mark> was the best i've had on the mainland!\n\nthe next day, i came back on my own, but with orders to bring back something good to my wife in the hotel.  this time i had the biscuits & gravy, which were great.  but, fair warning, they were pretty salty -- well within my tolerance, but if you are sensitive to salt, you might want to steer clear.   then i picked out the <mark>California Crepe</mark> for my wife, which the waitress was happy to pack up for me to take back.  i asked to substitute some fruit for the <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark>, and she packed up a huge container of fresh fruit.  my wife loved the <mark>California Crepe</mark>, except for one thing -- it was way too big for her to finish!", 
            "this is an egg-cellent choice for breakfast off the strip. don't forget to check-in on yelp to get your free <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>! \n\nthere were 5 of us and despite it being busy they seated us in less then 5 minutes. i had the <mark>Mashed Potato Omelette</mark> which was <mark>Deli</mark>. little pieces of bacon in the potatoes made the dish complete. other people at my table were satisfied with their omelettes and <mark>Loco Moco</mark>.\n\nthey have a sad egg face you can display if you need service immediately, but we didn't have to use it since our waitress genesis was on the ball. \n\nfor 5 people to eat, grab juices and coffee it was under $80, a true bargain compared to our other meals in vegas. \n\neat here and make your belly happy  :-)", 
            "i woke up with a massive hangover and needed breakfast food stat! buffet wasn't going to cut it... i needed comfort food. we came here on a whim and now it's on my list of must go to spots in vegas. it's your typical breakfast joint... no more than a 20 min wait even when the  masses are outside the front entrance. there's a plethora of breakfast dishes... american style, mexican style and even islander style! oh yes... <mark>Loco Moco</mark>. i know aloha kitchen is just right there... but when hubs wants hawaiian and i want mexican... well then, you gotta find some way to compromise. egg & i did not fall short with their <mark>Loco Moco</mark>... it definitely hit the spot... and so did that side of spam!", 
            "great breakfast joint off sahara btwn arville and decatur\n\nthink this was the original, they have a number of them in vegas now\n\nbuddy had the <mark>Chicken Enchilada</mark> omelette, which he said was pretty good\nfor some reason though, their <mark>Hash Browns</mark> are now patties, like you get at mcdonalds....no biggie, still looked good\n\ni had the <mark>Loco Moco</mark>, which was good, not anything to write home about though\nit was basic hamburger patty over rice with brown gravy and 2 sunny side up eggs on top....funny the waiter asked how i would like the eggs prepared, didn't know there was a choice with <mark>Loco Moco</mark>!  in retrospect, probably should have gone with standard breakfast fare or my go to <mark>Key Largo Crepe</mark>\nsometimes you shouldn't try new things\nit wasn't bad, i just think their normal breakfast items are a lot better\n\nnoticed they have added quite a few southern/spanish dishes, maybe to cater to changing tastes? i will have to try next time...i know, stick with what you like, but have to let you guys know right?", 
            "this is our second time here and i must say it's <mark>Deli</mark>! allan has ordered the <mark>Loco Moco</mark> from day one and says it's the best he has had. their food has a lot of flavor. the staff is awesome! sunshine thank you for always welcoming us with a smile! she's the best manager ever! see you again in a few weeks.", 
            "food, okay. service, good. \n\nwith the long wait/line, i had high expectations. \n\nthe server, darla, was on it, as was the rest of the staff. however, that is where the \"wow\" factor ended for me. \n\nbeing from hawaii, an order of the <mark>Loco Moco</mark> was placed, along with the ranch club.\n\nthe <mark>Seasoned <mark>Ground Beef</mark></mark> on the <mark>Loco Moco</mark> was hard and a bit bland. the club was okay and unfortunately, the <mark>Onion Rings</mark> were average, at best, as i am used to panko <mark>Onion Rings</mark> which make it flaky crispy.\n\ni can't say it was bad, but not what i had expected based on the reviews and the long line outside."

            "my wife and i visit vegas at least once a year.  until i found this place (and others) on yelp, we used to just have breakfast/brunch in the hotel's anonymous coffee shop.  meh.\n\n now that yelp has opened my eyes, we've tried different places.  the egg & i is one of our favorites for breakfast (actually brunch since we don't leave the hotel until 10 a.m. or so).  we eat here most often because there is a plethora of different items on their menu to choose from and they are all good!  breakfast is my favorite meal to eat when i'm away from home, so this is important to me.\n\nto be honest it is pretty difficult to screw up a basic breakfast centered on eggs and breakfast meat.  however, the egg & i is head and shoulders above the others with various <mark>Deli</mark> potato and egg treatments, their muffins, and friendly service staff.  needless to say, we don't eat in hotel coffee shops anymore.  not only do you get huge quantities of food at the egg & i, it all tastes great, and what a variety!  if you're not into eggs, they also have waffles, pancakes and <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark>, as well as salads and sandwiches.  also free wifi so you can catch up on news from home & messages while eating.\n\nif you are like my wife and insist on staying in a big-name strip resort hotel, do yourself a favor and drive a short distance off the strip to have breakfast and some really tasty food.  catch a glimpse of what the rest of the city of las vegas looks like, and taste real food, not the bland stuff the corporate chains dish out.  you might realize, like i did, that the strip is not the final destination of your trip to vegas.\n\nthere are fine dinner restaurants off the strip as well!  yelp is here for you.",

so my friend and i packed up and headed 15 minutes away to get some good breakfast.\n\nwhen we arrived, we could tell that it was going to be a long wait and a headache. i sent my friend in, ahead of me, so that i could park. as soon as she walked in, she called me. she said that the place was a mess and she was going to have to come out and wait the 15 minutes it was going to take to be seated. nevertheless, the hostess pointed out some empty benches, around the corner. so, i walked in to wait.\n\nupon entering, i was discouraged because a lot of people were standing around waiting. i just knew it was going to take 30+ minutes. surprisingly, it only took 15 minutes before we were called and seated.\n\nthe place is really small and packed to capacity, so i was thankful that we got to sit around the corner where there were only about 4-5 tables. we had plenty space.\n\nthe server came around fast to take our drink order. she was quick to bring our drinks back too. she asked us if we were ready to order and we said, \"no, we're looking at yelp pictures and we need some more time.\" i did ask about the stuff <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> dish that someone shared on yelp. she smiled and pointed it out and said that it's a popular dish. then she left and took orders for people that was around us.\n\nas soon as she walked away, we decided what we wanted, but it took her about 6 minutes to make eye contact again. when she did stop back by, she asked if we were still looking at pictures or if we were ready to order. we went ahead and ordered. it totally slipped my mind to check in and get a free muffin for myself. the waitress said, \"you were on yelp, did you check in to get the free muffin?\" i was happy she reminded me to do that.\n\nshe came back a couple minutes later and brought 2 muffins. i don't even like <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> but i took it anyways because it was free. i took a bite of it and fell in love. it was so warm and yummy lol. my friend got emotional lol. she said it reminded her of childhood, when her mother used to make them. they were just <mark>Deli</mark>.\n\nabout 12-15 minutes later, our food started to roll out. i order the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> with eggs, cheese and sausage on it. it also came with <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark>. it looked incredible. my friend ordered the 2 <mark>Seasoned Center Cut Pork Chops</mark> that came with 2 eggs, the muffin, that she had already ate, and the <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark>. her's looked <mark>Deli</mark> too.\n\ni love potatoes so i ate those first. i put ketchup all over them and had a ball. my friend didn't like hers, because they were kind of crunchy, so she gave them to me. i put ketchup on them and finished them off too lol.\n\nnext, i started in on my <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> sandwiches. i didn't like the sandwiches. the sausages, eggs <mark>Cheese <mark>Ham, Bacon or Sausage <mark>Mushroom and Cheese</mark></mark></mark> didn't have much flavor. i thought i made a big mistake. being that i'm so smart, i thought to scrape the sausages and eggs off the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> and season the filling myself. i did, and it was 90% better. i ate the filling separately, and ever so often, i would dip the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> in the warm syrup that came with my food.\n\nmy friend said that the <mark>Seasoned Center Cut Pork Chops</mark> were just okay. they were really thin, for sure. i don't know why, but we were expecting some big juicy chops vs the breakfast chops. i wanted to taste the chops for myself, so she took a bite of mine and i took a bite of hers. they tasted as if onions were the main and secondary seasoning. she was right. they were just okay. she did enjoy my mixture of filling and seasoning though.\n\nthe good thing is, we got really full and still had a bunch of food left. i'm sure it has something to do with a humongous portion of potatoes we got and the muffin we were served in the beginning.\n\nthe service was like a 3/5 because there was a little piece of hair in my water when the server dropped it off. i asked for another one and she just stared at my full cup for like 10 seconds. i guess she couldn't understand my reason behind needing another one. i didn't even mention it because it wasn't a big deal and i didn't want anyone to make a big deal over water.\n\nbut also, i took some points off service, because it took my sever a long time to refill my water, once i had actually finished it. it took her maybe 4 or 5 minutes to check on us, after we finished eating too. we just wanted a box to pack up leftovers. when she did stop back by, we asked for the box, she quickly picked one up, dropped it off and walked away. she came back around maybe 3 or 4 minutes later and told us to pay upfront. we were just sitting there, waiting for her to come back by so that we could pay and leave. i'm glad she did stop back by because we probably would have been sitting there for a while.\n\nalthough i'm in love with the potatoes and muffins, i probably won't go back because the rest of the food was just average.",

            "i wanted to try something new for breakfast. i had no idea where to go or what to eat. i came to yelp like i normally do. mostly everyone had something positive to say about this place, so my friend and i packed up and headed 15 minutes away to get some good breakfast.\n\nwhen we arrived, we could tell that it was going to be a long wait and a headache. i sent my friend in, ahead of me, so that i could park. as soon as she walked in, she called me. she said that the place was a mess and she was going to have to come out and wait the 15 minutes it was going to take to be seated. nevertheless, the hostess pointed out some empty benches, around the corner. so, i walked in to wait.\n\nupon entering, i was discouraged because a lot of people were standing around waiting. i just knew it was going to take 30+ minutes. surprisingly, it only took 15 minutes before we were called and seated.\n\nthe place is really small and packed to capacity, so i was thankful that we got to sit around the corner where there were only about 4-5 tables. we had plenty space.\n\nthe server came around fast to take our drink order. she was quick to bring our drinks back too. she asked us if we were ready to order and we said, \"no, we're looking at yelp pictures and we need some more time.\" i did ask about the stuff <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> dish that someone shared on yelp. she smiled and pointed it out and said that it's a popular dish. then she left and took orders for people that was around us.\n\nas soon as she walked away, we decided what we wanted, but it took her about 6 minutes to make eye contact again. when she did stop back by, she asked if we were still looking at pictures or if we were ready to order. we went ahead and ordered. it totally slipped my mind to check in and get a free muffin for myself. the waitress said, \"you were on yelp, did you check in to get the free muffin?\" i was happy she reminded me to do that.\n\nshe came back a couple minutes later and brought 2 muffins. i don't even like <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> but i took it anyways because it was free. i took a bite of it and fell in love. it was so warm and yummy lol. my friend got emotional lol. she said it reminded her of childhood, when her mother used to make them. they were just <mark>Deli</mark>.\n\nabout 12-15 minutes later, our food started to roll out. i order the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> with eggs, cheese and sausage on it. it also came with <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark>. it looked incredible. my friend ordered the 2 <mark>Seasoned Center Cut Pork Chops</mark> that came with 2 eggs, the muffin, that she had already ate, and the <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark>. her's looked <mark>Deli</mark> too.\n\ni love potatoes so i ate those first. i put ketchup all over them and had a ball. my friend didn't like hers, because they were kind of crunchy, so she gave them to me. i put ketchup on them and finished them off too lol.\n\nnext, i started in on my <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> sandwiches. i didn't like the sandwiches. the sausages, eggs <mark>Cheese <mark>Ham, Bacon or Sausage <mark>Mushroom and Cheese</mark></mark></mark> didn't have much flavor. i thought i made a big mistake. being that i'm so smart, i thought to scrape the sausages and eggs off the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> and season the filling myself. i did, and it was 90% better. i ate the filling separately, and ever so often, i would dip the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> in the warm syrup that came with my food.\n\nmy friend said that the <mark>Seasoned Center Cut Pork Chops</mark> were just okay. they were really thin, for sure. i don't know why, but we were expecting some big juicy chops vs the breakfast chops. i wanted to taste the chops for myself, so she took a bite of mine and i took a bite of hers. they tasted as if onions were the main and secondary seasoning. she was right. they were just okay. she did enjoy my mixture of filling and seasoning though.\n\nthe good thing is, we got really full and still had a bunch of food left. i'm sure it has something to do with a humongous portion of potatoes we got and the muffin we were served in the beginning.\n\nthe service was like a 3/5 because there was a little piece of hair in my water when the server dropped it off. i asked for another one and she just stared at my full cup for like 10 seconds. i guess she couldn't understand my reason behind needing another one. i didn't even mention it because it wasn't a big deal and i didn't want anyone to make a big deal over water.\n\nbut also, i took some points off service, because it took my sever a long time to refill my water, once i had actually finished it. it took her maybe 4 or 5 minutes to check on us, after we finished eating too. we just wanted a box to pack up leftovers. when she did stop back by, we asked for the box, she quickly picked one up, dropped it off and walked away. she came back around maybe 3 or 4 minutes later and told us to pay upfront. we were just sitting there, waiting for her to come back by so that we could pay and leave. i'm glad she did stop back by because we probably would have been sitting there for a while.\n\nalthough i'm in love with the potatoes and muffins, i probably won't go back because the rest of the food was just average.",

            "ok...so the food here is awesome! i would give it more stars if the customer service had been better; the egg & i getting 2 stars is over the most ridiculous thing! a couple weeks ago we went there and i have been there a lot, i enjoy their food. my friend and i both ordered sandwiches; we asked to skip the bacon and bread for a healthier meal of course. we all know even though you skip stuff off the meal ordered, you end up paying full price which is fine. well we asked if we both add avocado to both our meals in place of bread and bacon considering those items are priced higher. after going back and forth with our server who claimed it was against their policy to sub, a veggie/fruit item for a meat/bread item, she brought out the manager. the manager ex<mark>Plain</mark> that they have two different accounts where they order meats/breads from and where they order <mark>Veggie</mark>/fruit from and they could not, in fact they refused to sub it. we got over it, added the avocado and enjoyed our meal. it wasn't about having to spend the money for it, it was the principal. i bring a lot of friends and family to this place, therefore i expected them to sub it out for me because in the end, it was actually more cost effective for them. i thought it was silly and ridiculous, she actually looked slightly stupid for coming out and to explain the reasoning as to why we couldn't sub it. i actually laughed. so although the food might be at least 4 stars, their service and policies were not and i doubt it was worth it for them to do that to my friend and i earning this some-what bad review. there are a lot of great breakfast spots in las vegas so i will hunt down one to take people where they don't fret over silly substitutions on sandwiches. i am very open-minded and understanding; in fact i have ran a restaurant for yrs in the past and know when it is worth it to suck it up and do the substitution.", 
            "first time there food was good, service was good, and i thought i would bring my family back. next day we went back and not so much.\nservice was terrible. our waitress, wendy, was inattentive, didn't know the menu or \"what they have back in the kitchen\", and curt with us on the few occasions she did come by the table.\nat one point i located the manager and told him about our frustrations and he too acted agitated, but stayed within his duties by apologizing and asking what we needed, but in such a way as to convey his dissatisfaction with being bothered by a frustrated customer.\nthen when our waitress brought the check back by, it was obvious that she heard about our concerns because she literally dropped the check on the table as she walked by and said to take it up front to cash out. that was her fourth time coming by, including greeting us and bringing drinks at the beginning. on our check was a charge for something that we did not get (yes we ordered it but it never came and our waitress never came by to check on our table), so i asked the manager about this matter and he literally snatched the check out of my hand, crumpled it up and said, \"there! i will take care of it, is there anything else?\" and started to walk away in a huff. so i confronted him about his attitude and asked what his issue was and he ex<mark>Plain</mark> to me that it was my tone of voice that put him off and he just wanted me to leave. for the record, up to that point i had not cursed, yelled, pointed a finger or anything else that may constitute aggression. after that, well that was a different story needless to say, if we were in the old west i probably would have whipped his butt on principle.\nin summation, we were looking forward to a local breakfast joint that we could take our family and friends to a couple times a month. but this won't be it.", 
            "friendly folks, lots of seating, good food and coffee - my only com<mark>Plain</mark> was that the potatoes were very salty.  other than that, tasty and good - it was great to get away from the strip on our trip and just be with the locals.  our server was lovely and it was an overall great breakfast experience.  would definitely return.", 
            "this place is horrible. there was five in our party and four of us got waffles and the other one got biscuits and gravy. this gravy was so salty that she couldn't eat it. the potatoes are way too overly season salted also. it tasted like they dumped that whole container of salt in the gravy but when we com<mark>Plain</mark> about it to them they didn't apologize or anything, three different wait staff just simply said, \"oh we get that a lot. \" one even said that everyone that gets it com<mark>Plain</mark> but no one here is going to actually tell the owner/cook that it tastes horrible and that no one likes it except the owner.  service was slow, we had to ask several times for some items. not sure why this place gets so many stars.", 
            "i'll preface this review with the fact that i am not a breakfast person. i don't love anything about it. except when i visit the egg & i. and let me tell you ... it became a weekly event after a while.\n\ni can't turn down fresh squeezed oj. this restaurant has <mark>Deli</mark> oj. you should try it at least once. i love their menu. they have interesting combinations, like chicken, pesto, and eggs, and <mark>Deli</mark> twists on common breakfast dishes, like <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark>. i love the scrambles the most, and would  often get the veggie scramble sitting atop ranch potatoes. slather that mound with hot sauce and call it a day. expect an exhilerating food coma to follow. the portions are big. i also recommend trying their complimentary <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> at least once. i don't like muffins or <mark>Banana</mark>, seriously, but i like theirs. be adventurous, don't order eggs and a side of bacon. live it up a little...\n\nsuper awesome service. expect to wait on the weekends for breakfast/brunch, but they have a quick turn-around and great waiters/waitresses. a nice perk to the crowded atmosphere is an egg on the table that you can flip when you require service. on a very busy day it's very helpful to the staff, and don't be afraid to use it! i've always had friendly, impeccable service here ... no com<mark>Plain</mark>. i've brought every out-of-town guest here for breakfast, and we've always left happy. stop in and give it a try!", 
            "another wonderful breakfast at my favorite lv breakfast spot. server alyssa was <mark>Deli</mark>. try the chili omelet. my only com<mark>Plain</mark>: they should make a real dairy product available on the table for coffee instead of your having to ask for it. they serve real butter, so why non-dairy creamer? spock and i consider this \"illogical\". still always 5 stars for me and i've been coming here since the 80's.", 
            "amazing, amazing experience here. the food and service was top notch here. they were able to accommodate our party of 10. regardless of our party size, they provided amazing service. we gave them a big fat tip. their <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> were to die for and possibly the best one i've ever had. i got the <mark>Spinach Benny</mark> and it was <mark>Deli</mark>. the other foods looked good and none of us had any com<mark>Plain</mark> during our meal. i think i will need to visit this place every time i'm in vegas. it's <mark>Deli</mark> with amazing service. can't go wrong!", 
            "this restaurant really does not live up to all of its fabulous reviews. the service was very slow and the waitress with colorful hair  ignored us when we told her we were not satisfied with our food. our orders did not come with all of their sides and they ignored our com<mark>Plain</mark> about that. also, the toast was burnt and they tried to hide that by placing the burnt sides on top of each other. i will never come back here. rude staff and terrible service!!!!!!!!",

            "not too shabby. only com<mark>Plain</mark> i have is the wait, it's rather insane. the food is excellent, i recommend the <mark>Works Veggie Benny</mark> for any vegetarians. their potatoes rule!!!", 
            "ambiance: 4 - it was okay inside, kind of a cross between homey restaurant, diner and cafeteria. it was bright inside, lots of families, and it felt nice in there..like when you went out for breakfast in the 90s on a bright sunday morning.\n\nservice: 4 - i thought that the service was good. the servers are always smiling and genuinely kind. they are constantly concerned about your food and if everything is tasting good. \n\nfood: 3 - my disclaimer: i really only came here to eat eggs. i did not want any meat other than bacon. i strictly came here for really, really plain ol' breakfast food, and not anything else.\n\ni got a really boring item called \"<mark>The Classic</mark>\", but i really wanted just eggs and bacon, so that's what i went with. my over easy eggs were cooked perfectly. i mean, they were absolutely perfect. some cooks leave the yolk barely runny on the inside, but they are experts at eggs here..and i have no com<mark>Plain</mark>. \n\nthe <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> was soft and moist, but i just didn't like the taste of it. i think i'm just picky, but the banana in the muffin tasted a little ripe. the potatoes were good, but they weren't great. the bacon was a little overcooked and a little too hard for me. \n\ni totally forgot to check yelp before ordering, but next time, i'll order a healthy omelet and see how that goes!!",

            "we came as a group of 7 on friday around 1:30pm and only had to wait for about 15minutes. thank goodness the wait wasn't too long because by now we've been on the road for 5+ hours and we're starving!!! \n\ni have a feeling that this place is super busy all the time--the restaurant is packed with people and the service is also super duper speedy, like the servers here are always on their toes to get people in and out as quickly as possible. but they're still super friendly, so i'm not com<mark>Plain</mark> because i love the efficiency of this place. \n\nf o o d:\nhonestly the food here was a pretty big disappointment. for some reason the food here was very very salty--the ham, the sauce, everything. eating this makes me feel super gross and pretty terrible about myself. especially because the portion sizes here are huge! my friend and i shared the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> and we couldn't finish it (sorry potatoes :( ). so i recommend sharing just one thing between you and a friend or you can always take it to-go. i thought the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> was really <mark>Deli</mark> because it wasn't salty at all, but our friends that got the eggs benedict dishes weren't so lucky :( \n\np a r k i n g:\nthere is a parking lot right out front so no worries about parking! \n\ndon't forget to check in for the free <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>! it's warm, it's wonderful, it's amazingly good!",

            "at a little before 7am on a sunday morning, the place was almost deserted.  this was a little worrisome, but we soon realized that this said far more about the vegas population than it did about the quality of the breakfast.  here's the best recommendation i can give about the food: i came back for breakfast the next day!  and we would have come back the third morning except that we had to be on the road before they opened at 6am!\n\nwe got off to a good start.  when the waitress found out this was our first visit, she brought us a warm <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> to try.  it's a house special and well worth getting.\n\nwhen you open up the newspaper-like menu, the first thing you'll notice is the words habla diablo in blazing red appearing in the descriptions of at least half the dishes.  my wife wanted the <mark>Spinach Benny</mark>, but was concerned about the <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark> because the name sounded spicy and she's a self-proclaimed spice wimp.  the waitress ex<mark>Plain</mark> that it wasn't spicy at all, that habla diablo is the owner's side company and he had just redone the menu to emphasize his products.  my wife went ahead with her <mark>Spinach Benny</mark> and i got the <mark>Loco Moco</mark>, with an extra side of the <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark>.  (it turns out that the habla diablo seasoning is a lot like lawry's seasoned salt.)\n\nmy wife really liked her <mark>Spinach Benny</mark>, but didn't care for the potatoes.  (but she's not a big fan of breakfast potatoes to begin with.)  i liked the potatoes and finished most of hers in addition to mine.  plus the <mark>Loco Moco</mark> was the best i've had on the mainland!\n\nthe next day, i came back on my own, but with orders to bring back something good to my wife in the hotel.  this time i had the biscuits & gravy, which were great.  but, fair warning, they were pretty salty -- well within my tolerance, but if you are sensitive to salt, you might want to steer clear.   then i picked out the <mark>California Crepe</mark> for my wife, which the waitress was happy to pack up for me to take back.  i asked to substitute some fruit for the <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark>, and she packed up a huge container of fresh fruit.  my wife loved the <mark>California Crepe</mark>, except for one thing -- it was way too big for her to finish!",

            "spent a few days in vegas and wasn't feeling like a \"buffet\" style breakfast or our normal hash house a go go meal. found egg and i in a coupon book given to us at our hotel. \n\nlocated in a strip mall with a lot of parking, there was no wait on a weekday morning, but the place was full of patrons. took a while for our server to take our order and asked us twice what we wanted to drink (amnesia maybe ?..no she was just busy, trying to tend to everyone), so after about 10 minutes, my husband flipped the sign with the un-happy egg, to show we needed attention. the sweet lady at the register quickly came to us and asked what we needed. our server quickly came to us and apologized for the wait and also brought each of us the best <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> ever !!! \n\ni had the blackend <mark>Blackened Prime Rib Benny</mark>, a grilled croissant with  prime rib, sauteed spinach and roasted red bell peppers, two poached eggs, then covered with hollandaise sauce. also came with home fries and 2 slices of fruit. this dish was amazing ! all the flavors tied together so well and that <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> will make me a return customer ! the hubby had crepes filled w/ mushrooms, that i take was also <mark>Deli</mark>, since  i didn't get to taste it ! \n\nthe coupon for a \"buy one meal get the other for half off\" made the whole experience even better.\n\n we'll be back in 2 mos..egg and i but this time we won't be alone.",

            "my sister and i had been pretty excited about coming here after reading all about it on yelp.  it seemed to be really busy with lots of people waiting outside (on a sunday afternoon), but we luckily only had to wait about 10 minutes before we were seated.  \n\nour server was super nice.  she really helped elevate the entire experience.  when we asked for <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> to go with our entrees, she asked if it was our first time there.  we told her yes and she said the muffins were free for first timers!  hope that's true and i'm not getting anyone in trouble by posting that info here.  \n\ni ordered the eggs benedict florentine & it came with those little (obviously frozen) and highly <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark>.  overall i enjoyed the dish, but there was so much hollandaise sauce that the english muffin got pretty soggy and the ham was really quite bad.  it was cut in thick slices and was very rubbery.  it almost tasted canned or something.  i took the ham off and it was much better that way.  however, the whole thing was a runny, saucy mess.  the poached eggs were cooked perfectly though.  my sister unfortunately didn't enjoy her blueberry pancakes too much.  this might sound strange, but they were way too fluffy for both of us & just didn't taste that great.  we both loved the muffins though.  that very well may have been the best part of the whole meal.  \n\ndespite the rubbery ham, i'd definitely come back.  the service was excellent and i feel confident that we'll both be able to find other dishes on the menu that suit us better.  plus.... those <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>!  you'd be a fool not to try one.",

            "my first impression was, \"cute sad and happy egg people everywhere!\"\n\nthe decor of this breakfast house really caught my attention as i first walked in. eggs are featured on everything from their tableware, to their menu, and their walls. it's too adorable. the menu looks like a real newspaper which is also a nice little touch to the theme of this restaurant. bright yellow everywhere is a great way to brighten up and start your day in vegas!\n\nwe went to egg & i for brunch and i can say it loud and proud, this is the best american breakfast i have ever had. hearty, filling, innovative, more than just eggs and waffles. egg & i has taken breakfast foods to a whole different level. i ordered the eggs benedict florentine (featured on rachel ray) which had  spinach, canadian bacon, two poached eggs on a grilled english muffin, with hollandaise sauce. we also ordered an omelette, both served with ranch potatoes...by far the best breakfast potatoes on this planet. i forgot the name of <mark>The Works Omelette</mark>, but i know for sure i'd order the eggs benedict florentine and extra <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> on the side. the complimentary <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> are made fresh in house, and they are so good. the service was just as bubbly and friendly as this restaurant is. if you want to start your day right in vegas, this is definitely one of your options.\n\nthe lasting impression? \"love my breakfast, let's get it on country style at egg & i!\"", 
            "<mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> & their potato hash is the business!!!\n\nthis place only serves breakfast & i believe they close at 3pm. the menu looks like a morning's newspaper, they have tons of yummy items to choose from. the trick to getting your waiter's attention: first you'd have to look at the smiley egg that holds the condiments on your table and when you flip the egg to a frown, you'll be serviced in no time. unless they are super busy and most of the time they are so just wait patiently. \n\nthe food portion size is big, i would say that thee portion is adult men's size who is damn hungry in the morning because i never finish and always pack it home.\n\nevery time i order unlimited coffee, it always taste old (drink @ your own risk) :\\ so i never get coffee unless i absolutely need it. \n\noverall, i love this place! mainly i give them a 5 for <mark>Homemade Soup of the Day</mark> food...it's just too damn good.", 
            "my expectations were high after seeing and reading the reviews on yelp. \n\nthe inside was clean and cozy looking and they had several flat screens. \n\nmy order the corn beef with scrambled eggs and the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>. \n\nthe food didn't wow me. the corn beef was average although it was home made, muffin was cold and the potatoes tasted deep fried with a to much seasoned salt. the pineapple slice and honeydue were juicy and a nice extra to the plate.\n\nservice was good and attentive here but i probably would not return here.", 
            "it's a cab ride off the strip, but worth it!\n\ni'm in vegas two of three times a year, and egg and i has become one of my regular stops. the kay's special omelet will change your life.\n\nand the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> will have you believing in a higher power, no matter how you've done at the tables.",

            "this place was a big letdown. i guess b/c i had such a great experience with egg works their sister place i had put this place on such a high pedestal and they fell off... and no all the kings horses and all the kings men couldnt put this bk together again. \n\nentree: my bf got the franciscan scramble. sounded really good and he's a professional order-er. its amazing to watch him work. everything he orders always comes out spectacular and the best tasting dish at the table. not me.  i had a the tostada last time and i had really wanted the <mark>Southwestern Cobb Salad</mark> but was torn. so this time <mark>Southwestern Cobb Salad</mark> was my only request. \ndisguisting. \n\ncobb: i love <mark>Southwestern Cobb Salad</mark>. this was just plain gross. they probably gave me 3-4 lbs of iceburg lettuce. really? iceburg? gross.  the croutons were the 99 cent croutons with the green specks on it. they gave me 1/4 of an egg... at a a place with the word egg in it.. i was very disappointed. you'd think theyere 'd be at least a full egg? maybe 2. no.\non top of my salad was a lil bit of shredded cheese, and some deli sliced sandwich meat turkey and ham (not even cubes) and the box of sprouts sittong on top of my salad. i ordered blue cheese dressing, they brought me ranch. anything that could go wrong did. 2nd worst meal i've had in las vegas since i've lived here. \n\nmaybe its my fault? my fault for ordering anything that wasnt scrambled so early in the morning. i take some responsibility in that i guess. my bf's omelet was <mark>Deli</mark>. the potatoes were good.. so was his <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>.. (while my bran muffin was gross) it was just the perfect yin/yang of good vs. evil... , er mavs vs the heat, the cowboys vs the 49ers, egg works vs egg & i... and yes good food vs. bad food. \n\nthe only reason i gave them 2stars was b/c of the bfs food was 4 stars cancelled out by my zero stars.. to equal 2. :) \nhere's hoping you gleam something from my review... please do not order a salad at egg & i.",

            "so my brother and my best friend and i decided to have breakfast here. was a bit disappointed that this location doesn't serve alcohol but oh well. so we walk in and request an outside table and were seated in a timely manner. the hostess seated us that had the tip still on the table and i thought that maybe she didn't see so i let her know oh the tip is still on the table and she had a bit of an attitude while telling me the server would grab it. the server, amanda, came over to us and greeted us and we told her what happened. i wasn't that upset but i just thought it was kind of ridiculous. anyways our server was really great! bubbly and cute and super friendly. she even sent the manager over after we had told her about the tip thing and they gave us a free round of muffins! i love that! i guess it's company policy they leave the tip on the table due to bussers stealing tips. \n\nso on to the food. i got what i always do, it's just a platter with potatoes sausage toast and eggs and it's always <mark>Deli</mark>. my brother got banana but <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> and biola got regular <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> and it was fricking fantastic.  \n\nonce again i'd just like to say how amazing our server was! thanks amanda! also i hope you win that trip to disneyland!", 
            "just moved to vegas and heard great things about this place. went for the first time and they offered a <mark>Deli</mark> <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>, complimentary, since it was our first time! it was great. \nour food, however, was not. the server said our potatoes were fresh, but they didn't taste nor look fresh. they put wayyyy too much cheese on everything and it completely covered up the taste of everything else. so we decided to give it another try.\ncame back on a saturday morning, had the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> that tasted stale, again, way too much cheese and our food took forever! i don't know why i thought this place would use fresher ingredients... definitely disappointing.", 
            "i'll preface this review with the fact that i am not a breakfast person. i don't love anything about it. except when i visit the egg & i. and let me tell you ... it became a weekly event after a while.\n\ni can't turn down fresh squeezed oj. this restaurant has <mark>Deli</mark> oj. you should try it at least once. i love their menu. they have interesting combinations, like chicken, pesto, and eggs, and <mark>Deli</mark> twists on common breakfast dishes, like <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark>. i love the scrambles the most, and would  often get the veggie scramble sitting atop ranch potatoes. slather that mound with hot sauce and call it a day. expect an exhilerating food coma to follow. the portions are big. i also recommend trying their complimentary <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> at least once. i don't like muffins or <mark>Banana</mark>, seriously, but i like theirs. be adventurous, don't order eggs and a side of bacon. live it up a little...\n\nsuper awesome service. expect to wait on the weekends for breakfast/brunch, but they have a quick turn-around and great waiters/waitresses. a nice perk to the crowded atmosphere is an egg on the table that you can flip when you require service. on a very busy day it's very helpful to the staff, and don't be afraid to use it! i've always had friendly, impeccable service here ... no com<mark>Plain</mark>. i've brought every out-of-town guest here for breakfast, and we've always left happy. stop in and give it a try!", 
            "my husband and i just came across this place last weekend and i must say although we waited 30mins to get seated it was well worth it. after a long weekend in vegas we wanted to get away from the strip and long behold....was the egg and i. the service was good and the breakfast was <mark>Deli</mark>. they have the best <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>! we ended up ordering a few for the trip back home!",

            "with this review i will say that everything is relative.  when you consider other options in vegas for a good breakfast for a reasonable price, this is one of the best.  if you have read my other post you know i love chicken <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark> and of course that was my order here.  the steak was seasoned very good and had a lot of flavor.... really good!  i will be back to get it again in the future.  the gravy was good but not great in my opinion.  i really liked their breakfast potatoes as well as they were season with extra season and were better than i expected.  the eggs are eggs and nothing special there.  also their <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> is really good.  it is a bit greasy and not for anyone on a diet but you talking to someone that eats fried meats for breakfast.", 
            "this place never disappoints. the only thing disappointing is the long wait, which only means one thing. parking is also difficult. it's definitely worth the wait. the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> is a must. i think the menu was made for hangovers. anything you get on the menu would mend it. the only thing on my last visit i had an issue with was my potatoes. they were really salty. it wasn't just my potato it was also with my group. everyone's potato was salty. other than that everything was eggcelent.",

            "came to vegas for a week and decided to eat off the strip and found this place through yelp.  i was excited to see they served spam, egg and rice.  came on monday, june 9th for breakfast and from the time we walked in to the time we walked out we had exceptional customer service by gia the manager and our waitress, carole ann.   they were both very personable.\n\nwe we're seated promptly in the back next to the kitchen by gia.  carole ann came by to acknowledge us but would be right back because she had to sing happy birthday at a table.  no biggie as we were on vacation and wasn't in a rush to go anywhere.  \n\ngia came by and apologized but no need to apologize for the delay.  she came out with two <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> for us while we waited and took our drink orders and came out with it.  those muffins were <mark>Deli</mark>.  carole ann came back and took our order.  i ordered the spam and egg over rice.  that came with a muffin or toast and since we already got the muffin i thought that was it.  but she offered me toast or another muffin to take home, but i declined.   my other half ordered a chorizo skillet.  \n\nthe food and service was great and i would have def gone back but my intentions while i was in vegas was to visit a different restaurant everyday.  \n\nthey don't take american express, not sure if it's just at this location. \n\nthank you carole ann for great customer service, keep it up and i hope you get to meet mickey mouse!!!", 
            "i came here not once, but three times during my week's vacation with my fiance. we couldn't get enough!\n\nbesides the amazing food, there's always great service! i love the little egg signs on the tables--flip the happy face to sad and the servers can all see that you need attention and someone comes along. none of that trying to wave someone down, hand signal, awkwardness going on here. we flipped ours only once and got our refill within like 20 seconds...it's absolutely amazing. (note that using this doesn't mean you're an unhappy guest, just that you need attention...)\n\nwe were served by three great servers during our breakfasts here this week: john (i think he's new), thaynara (sp?), and erin; all did a fantastic job bringing extra napkins, getting refills, answering questions about the menu, etc. they were quick and attentive and just all around fantastic. \n\nso, the food. amazing. i'm not a breakfast person. usually eggs kinda gross me out if they aren't cooked right, and i'm kind of picky, i know. so why did i go to a breakfast joint and get eggs every time? because they know how to cook them! between the omelet, scrambled, and over medium, all were cooked perfectly!! not that i doubted a place with \"egg\" in the name couldn't get it right, but every meal i had was executed to perfection. eggs weren't dry or overcooked, nor were they runny or watery. just right, every time.\n\nout of the six things we ordered over our three visits, i got the coffee every time. it was piping hot and <mark>Deli</mark>, and was a perfect compliment to the breakfast... they bring the caraffe to your table so you don't have to wait for refills on the coffee, either. you've got to ask for the fancy creamers, but they'll bring some out for you no problem! (they had caramel and french vanilla, and i thinkkkk the irish cream flavor too.) \n\nthey have some awesome works potatoes (i have always called these home fries) that are seasoned and chopped into cute little cubes (more surface area = more crispy potato!) that are super tasty. side note: if you don't want the potatoes, or just not a huge helping of them, you can ask to sub fresh fruit, or do 1/2 fruit, 1/2 potatoes, as my fiance and i did a couple of times. the fruit they have is fresh and sweet, from cantaloupe, honeydew, watermelon, grapefruit, and pineapple. \n\nthey also have these to-die-for <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>. these muffins are homemade and so soft and moist! utterly delectable--i definitely recommend them over the toast option offered with most breakfast plates.\n\nwe've tried the corned <mark>Homemade Corn Beef Hash</mark> (no canned meat products here!) and the <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark> as well as the biscuits and gravy; all were keepers. the biscuits are two whole ones, not one cut in half (big servings), and i like that they cut up the steak in the skillet, makes it so much easier to eat. we also tried the works omelet and <mark>Brad's Scramble</mark>. there is so much on this menu that is tasty! \n\ni did mark the price range as $$ because most of the plates are around $10-11, plus a drink, per person is kind of expensive. we were on vacation, which was why we splurged, but if you're a local this is still a lovely breakfast-brunch place to hit up for some great food. \n\nside note the second: the decor is really cute! it looks like hand-painted farmland all over the restaurant, and they have merch available to buy with their logo at the front (i.e. a baby onesie with \"just hatched\" on it or something) and they sell loaves of that <mark>Deli</mark> banana nut bread to go, too!\n\nrecap: everything is <mark>Deli</mark>, huge portions, perfect eggs, fantastic service, great experience. will definitely return and recommend. :d", 
            "what an amazing find! we wanted the breakfast buffet at our hotel on the strip, but found out that the price doubled on the weekend. so on our way out of town to the grand canyon, we did a quick yelp search and found this gem. being in vegas, we thought it was funny that there were 777 reviews for this place, averaging 4.5 stars. it lived up to the hype! \n\ndefinitely ask for the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>, they are amazing. as are the potatoes. as are <mark>The Works Omelette</mark>...heck, it was all great! i ordered the chile relleno omelette (yes you read that right) and it was dee-lish. \n\nour server, alyssa, was friendly and made sure everything was to our liking and topped off. the manager, gia, stopped by our table to check in on us and ended up giving us some great ideas of places to check out on our road trip.\n\nafter the crazy hustle and bustle and falseness of the strip, it was great to eat at a down-home style diner. i liked it so much i wanted to buy a t-shirt, but they were out of the tie-dye one that i wanted. which is probably the only non-five-star thing i can say about this place. we will definitely be back here again the next time we're in town!", 
            "this place is a must stop every time i go to vegas.  i go to vegas at least once a year, more if i can and anyone who goes with me know that we will go here.  it is still pretty busy in the late morning even if it is off the strip, but if you go early (cause you're still on e. coast time), or later, it isn't so bad.  \nat home we have a place with this name, but it is not the same place.  this place is epic good.  my favorites are the <mark>Chicken Enchilada</mark> omelet, the strawberry <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark>, the banana nut <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark>, and the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> here is out of this world.  \nafter a 2008 trip to hawaii i became obsessed with hawaiian breakfast and they have both your traditional breakfast of eggs, rice and spam or portuguese sausage, but they also have <mark>Loco Moco</mark>!  if you've never had <mark>Loco Moco</mark> it is crazy good.  rice, steak, and eggs with gravy dumped on top.  yummy!", 
            "this was a very impressive breakfast restaurant!\n\ni came here with 4 of my other friends while we were in vegas and all of us had a positive experience.  both the food and the service were \"egg-cellent.\"  \n\nanyhow, i try to be a little bit pun-ny at times and this is one of them.\n\nfirst off, the service was great.  we came in around noon time and the restaurant was mostly crowded but our group of 5 was seated as soon as we walked in the door.  we were greeted by the hostess with a big smile and much enthusiasm.  what's interesting is that their menu is in the form of a newspaper, which is very creative and something i've never seen before.  our waitress, amanda, was very energetic and did a wonderful job.  she was very helpful with her recommendations, very quick, and very genuinely friendly.  i love it when the people at a restaurant enjoy what they do.  \n\nas for the food, my friends and i ordered different dishes but everyone enjoyed their meal.  i ordered a hawaiian dish that came with rice, eggs, and spam.  you could also have your choice of sausage.  now, i know it sounds plain from the description but it was probably the best breakfast of those items i\"ve ever had.  everything was prepared perfectly and also presented well.  i had <mark>Two Eggs</mark> that were made over-well, hot and juicy sausage that was perfectly seasoned and two mounds of perfectly scooped rice.  also, before our dishes were served, we were given complimentary appetizers in the form of a <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>.  it was the best <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> i've ever tasted because it came out warm and seemed to be freshly made.\n\nmy other friends ordered the country fried <mark>Chicken Breast</mark> skillet as well as a turkey sandwich that they happily shared with me.  i got to try it and it was just as excellent tasting as my dish.  the portion sizes were generous and all of us were stuffed by the end of the meal.\n\nwhat i found interesting was that they had a little sign in the shape of an egg that had two sides.  it was used to signal our waitress if we were in need of some help.  one side of the sign had a smiling egg and another had an egg with a sad face.  apparently you are supposed to flip it to the sad facing egg side if you needed service.  anyhow, the last part might not make sense until you actually go there...but it beats any breakfast place on the strip that i've been too!\n\nlastly, the price is extremely affordable.  an entire meal for one person was about $9-$10 before tax and tip.  i sort of wish they had one in orange county but i'll definitely come back here with friends the next time i visit vegas.", 
            "great bfast after a nite of boozing. the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> was spectacular. they have half portions which is great if you are not super hungry or are watching your figure. service was top notch. ask to sit in thaynara's section. she was one of the best servers we have ever had!",

            "i would easily say that we received the most amazing service from the most incredible server in the world.  i only wished  i lived in vegas to get the chance to have brunch here at least once/week.  the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> was very fresh. the <mark>Chocolate Chip</mark> pumpkin pancakes were perfectly fluffy and pumpkin was fresh, and teh <mark>Chocolate Chip</mark> were just right (not too much, not to few).  the <mark>Chicken Fried Steak Skillet</mark> was also amazing!. cooked just right, with a thick <mark>Waffle with Fruit and Whipped Cream</mark> gravy, with perfectly cooked potatoes, and an egg, just how i asked for it. even the oj carafe tasted fresh, and it probably wasn't though, but it had me fooled.\nagain the prices, service and quality of food were amazing. (only thing is that this particular egg&i restaurant was a bit far from our hotel on the strip, but definitely worth the cab ride). even the general manager came by our table  a few times to ask how everything was.

            "having read the reviews on yelp, i just had to see for myself what all the fuss was about. well, i'm a big breakfast guy, and this place more than lived up to its reputation. i went with the <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark>, which had the perfect combination of crispy and tender. i'm more of a hash brown fan, but their cubed breakfast potatoes were very tasty. and i have to pay tribute to the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>; i don't even like <mark>Banana</mark>, but this was fantastic. to top it all off, my server staci was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. highly recommended.",

Sour Cream</mark>.  i would've liked some salsa with it but it didn't need it.  my partner got the garlic mashed potato omelet.  it was enormous.  she could only eat half of it to which our server, karla suggested getting the half order next time!  shoot, we didn't know you could do a half order.  but, my partner said she wouldn't gotten a half anyway because the portions would be all wrong.  we both loved the old bay <mark><mark>Habla Diablo Cajun Seasoned Fries</mark></mark> potatoes.  as we waddled out, it was great that the front desk called a cab for us.  very nice.  oh, and there's a little egg face on the table that you can flip revealing a sad egg face if you happen to need anything.  that's a brilliant idea!  karla was awesome and if we lived in the area, it would be our go to place!",

            "i was really enthusiastic to try this place, based on the good yelp reviews.  what i found was a nice coffee shop.  the service was very attentive, but the food was mediocre.  maybe we missed the point, because neither my wife nor i wanted a breakfast consisting of \"hot sauce with something under it,\" which seems to be the specialty of the house.  so, for example, we both ordered ordinary <mark>Hash Browns</mark> instead of the potatoes \"diablo\" (or something like that).  the <mark>Hash Browns</mark> we got were clearly pre-frozen patties - not quite as good as the ones you get a trader joe's.  my <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark>, and my wife's eggs benedict were very ordinary.  and the prices were at the higher end of the reasonable range.\n\ni can't see any reason for us to go back to this place.  for now, our three favorite breakfasts on the west side remain the black bear diner, hash house a go go, and the buffet at orleans.",

            "arrived worrying about too much salt and msg (via previous yelp reviews). but right away i knew i'd be disappointed when i learned that they didn't have real maple syrup for their pancakes. its regular customer must be some one who likes the artificial sugar syrup they serve at cheap restaurants. it wasn't even an option for an additional charge.\n\nto be fair, my kids didn't care their mickey mouse pancakes came with sugar syrup. and the prices for everything were reasonable. while i didn't find their eggs benedict too salty (i am not salt sensitive), the msg in the hollindaise was palpable and the famous <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark> were \"meh\" (and i like spicy!). on the plus side, their <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> were <mark>Deli</mark>, as advertised.", 
            "so glad i ate here... our server was excellent! she must've had like 12 tables and still treated us like we were the only ppl in the restaurant. i had the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark>... omg! to die for! search no more. you don't need to go to the strip for breakfast. the egg and i nailed it!", 
            "5 stars does not even come close to how amazing this food is!  i highly recommend ordering their <mark>Pork Carnitas</mark> rancheros with a side of work potatoes!  it is consistently busy,  but service is very fast and efficient!  also, for your sweet tooth cravings try one of their homemade <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>!  it's just heavenly!", 
            "really great place for breakfast. they have really cute newspaper menus and give you free <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> for your first visit! these were the best muffins i've ever had, i'm usually not a fan of banana nut but these blew me away. i also really liked their potatoes, they were crispy and seasoned really well. the bacon and avocado omelette was also to die for! it was our first time there and the waiter was really nice and helpful.",

            "dragged an unwilling family to try a new breakfast place while we were in vegas. i was able to convince them on the basis of the high yelp ratings/reviews.  unfortunately, the experience did not meet expectations.  \n\nthe wait was about 20 minutes on a weekday, at around 10:30am.  not too bad.  a testament to the efficient staff and their ability to keep things moving.  but:  pancakes were doughy/floury and heavy.  neither of my kids could eat more than 1/3-1/2 even with coaxing and bribery.  i ordered eggs benedict but it was nothing special. worst part is there was a distinct fake butter/margarine aftertaste (which is a pet peeve of mine).  it was a definite disappointment.  my husband had some sort of corned <mark>Homemade Corn Beef Hash</mark> but his lack of commentary tells me it wasn't great.  maybe we ordered the wrong menu items?  \n\nthe free <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> for checking in on yelp was nice and the staff were friendly and efficient. too bad the food didn't match.  we don't understand the hype...",

            "at a little before 7am on a sunday morning, the place was almost deserted.  this was a little worrisome, but we soon realized that this said far more about the vegas population than it did about the quality of the breakfast.  here's the best recommendation i can give about the food: i came back for breakfast the next day!  and we would have come back the third morning except that we had to be on the road before they opened at 6am!\n\nwe got off to a good start.  when the waitress found out this was our first visit, she brought us a warm <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> to try.  it's a house special and well worth getting.\n\nwhen you open up the newspaper-like menu, the first thing you'll notice is the words habla diablo in blazing red appearing in the descriptions of at least half the dishes.  my wife wanted the <mark>Spinach Benny</mark>, but was concerned about the <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark> because the name sounded spicy and she's a self-proclaimed spice wimp.  the waitress ex<mark>Plain</mark> that it wasn't spicy at all, that habla diablo is the owner's side company and he had just redone the menu to emphasize his products.  my wife went ahead with her <mark>Spinach Benny</mark> and i got the <mark>Loco Moco</mark>, with an extra side of the <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark>.  (it turns out that the habla diablo seasoning is a lot like lawry's seasoned salt.)\n\nmy wife really liked her <mark>Spinach Benny</mark>, but didn't care for the potatoes.  (but she's not a big fan of breakfast potatoes to begin with.)  i liked the potatoes and finished most of hers in addition to mine.  plus the <mark>Loco Moco</mark> was the best i've had on the mainland!\n\nthe next day, i came back on my own, but with orders to bring back something good to my wife in the hotel.  this time i had the biscuits & gravy, which were great.  but, fair warning, they were pretty salty -- well within my tolerance, but if you are sensitive to salt, you might want to steer clear.   then i picked out the <mark>California Crepe</mark> for my wife, which the waitress was happy to pack up for me to take back.  i asked to substitute some fruit for the <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark>, and she packed up a huge container of fresh fruit.  my wife loved the <mark>California Crepe</mark>, except for one thing -- it was way too big for her to finish!", 
            "had <mark>The Classic</mark> burrito and <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>. muffin was <mark>Deli</mark>! burrito came with a side of potatoes that was yummy. didn't care much for the sauce that came with the burrito. the service was great!", 
            "we love the egg and i every time we eat there. they have an extensive menu and large portions. today i had something that wasn't even on the menu. my nephew said the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> was the best he has had. we had a great server named carole ann. she was as accommodating as the servers we have had at the cracker barrel, and they have the very best servers.",

            "eggsellent service! get it? get it?!!? this place is very popular, and there was a 20 minute wait when we arrived. it's in a small strip mall off sahara ave, and it is definitely worth going. they have a choice of various toasts or their famous <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> to start. they keep the bottomless coffee cup tradition going. to top it off, their eggs are all perfectly cooked! i got the hashbrown skillet, and it was fantastic. the potatoes were a little dry, but they had a nice seasoning. the prices are very reasonable, and the portion sizes are a bit on the large size.", 
            "for those who are super hungry and craving for eggs, this would be a good place.\n\nthis restaurant is packed even on a monday morning. it sells every breakfast dish that has to do with eggs. we ordered grandma's biscuits & gravy and <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark>. both tasted good and homemade.  service was excellent (thanks jessica!), portions are humongous, and price was reasonable.\n\nwill definitely return if in the area again.", 
            "great breakfast spots are my favorite and this is one of the best i've ever found, thanks to yelp.  one of the most innovative breakfast menu's i've seen and particularly impressive is the ability to execute so many offerings to perfection.  service was outstanding, our waitress, jessica, was fast and efficient.  \n\nthe feature here is undoubtedly their <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>.  they were excellent, rivaling the best homemade i've ever tasted.  what amazed me is how they can produce as many as they have to do to supply this very busy and fairly large restaurant.   they were warm and obviously very fresh and tasted as good as most any homemade.  they have a slight gingerbread taste to them so i suspect molasses is a part of the recipe.   i know how much work they are to make homemade which is why i really admire their dedication to featuring this treat.    the food was really good as well, because they wouldn't earn any points from my son who doesn't eat anything with <mark>Banana</mark> in it.  i feel my opinion was well founded and based on a total of three <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>- mine, my son's, and a free one as a yelp check-in bonus.  i carried two out and enjoyed them later in <mark>Homemade Soup of the Day</mark>.\n\ni had the three little pigs omelet which was great.  the potatoes were done to perfection- crisp on the outside, evenly done throughout with a nice seasoning on the outside.  my son had a western omelet with tomatoes substituted for the potatoes.  a nice patio is outside with misters to help battle the vegas temps and low humidity.\n\nit's no question this is a premier spot to enjoy a wonderful breakfast in las vegas with just a little drive from the downtown strip.",

            "i went to the egg and i for a much needed breakfast. it came recommended with good ratings. i found to be off the beaten path a bit was hopeful it would be worth it. well outside of the coffee and <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>, i found my meal to be sub par at best. i ordered a lot of side dishes so we could taste as much as possible. let me start with grandma's sausage gravy. it was very weak in taste and quality. it was clear in appearance and lacked sausage chunks as i make mine at home. i have eaten all over the country and know good food when i taste it. the <mark>Sausage - 3 Links or 2 Patties</mark> on a side plate were more like a frozen patty than anything handmade. the eggs benedict was not up to snuff either. the canadian bacon tasted like a processed meat with way too much liquid smoke injected into it. i removed the bacon and continued to eat my poached eggs and english muffin in hollandaise sauce. the hollandaise sauce left a lot to be desired as well. clear in appearance and lacking flavor. i would think you could make a much better sauce yourself. the server dropped off our check and walked away from my empty coffee mug and water glass. when my wife and i realized they were done with our table. we got up and left. this place is way too busy for food of this quality. i guess the choices are limited here? the next day we had breakfast at the mon ami gabi and was blown away! what a difference one day makes. save your money and go else where.", 
            "we came to this place based on all the good reviews...and i'm glad we did! i ordered the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> and substituted the <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark> for cooked spinach. it was a very filling meal! i think by ordering the spinach i was able to clear my plate. i also had a tea, which came with a plate of lemons and honey containers. \n\nour server raul was amazing! he had us laughing and was on top of our orders! we had him split our table into 5 checks, and he did it with a smile. he made our first time visit here that much better! he also have us all free muffins as it was our first visit.\n\nplenty of parking and there is a large outside patio. the inside is decently large, cozy and homie feeling. very nice :)\n\ni recommend coming here if you want a filling and good meal. the menu is huge, there are so many options. you're bound to find something you'll enjoy.",

            "the place was ok...we went on a tuesday afternoon around 12pm. we waited about 30 mins. they sat other folks who arrived after us with the same # of party. i had to go back and question the hostess, they sat us right away. we wanted to sit outside because inside of the restaurant was a lil small and not enough ventilation. i did not want to smell like food.\n\nnow we waited an additional 20 mins just to place an order and then another 20 mins for our food. omg i was so hungry, when my food came out, i only took 3 bites. \n\nbut our server karen (i think that's her name) she was very nice and friendly. she did bring us 3 <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> which were yummy! my friend's breakfasts were much better then mind. the server also took my order off since it was not that great.\n\nover all, i would not have any interest in going there again.", 
            "i wanted to try something new for breakfast. i had no idea where to go or what to eat. i came to yelp like i normally do. mostly everyone had something positive to say about this place, so my friend and i packed up and headed 15 minutes away to get some good breakfast.\n\nwhen we arrived, we could tell that it was going to be a long wait and a headache. i sent my friend in, ahead of me, so that i could park. as soon as she walked in, she called me. she said that the place was a mess and she was going to have to come out and wait the 15 minutes it was going to take to be seated. nevertheless, the hostess pointed out some empty benches, around the corner. so, i walked in to wait.\n\nupon entering, i was discouraged because a lot of people were standing around waiting. i just knew it was going to take 30+ minutes. surprisingly, it only took 15 minutes before we were called and seated.\n\nthe place is really small and packed to capacity, so i was thankful that we got to sit around the corner where there were only about 4-5 tables. we had plenty space.\n\nthe server came around fast to take our drink order. she was quick to bring our drinks back too. she asked us if we were ready to order and we said, \"no, we're looking at yelp pictures and we need some more time.\" i did ask about the stuff <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> dish that someone shared on yelp. she smiled and pointed it out and said that it's a popular dish. then she left and took orders for people that was around us.\n\nas soon as she walked away, we decided what we wanted, but it took her about 6 minutes to make eye contact again. when she did stop back by, she asked if we were still looking at pictures or if we were ready to order. we went ahead and ordered. it totally slipped my mind to check in and get a free muffin for myself. the waitress said, \"you were on yelp, did you check in to get the free muffin?\" i was happy she reminded me to do that.\n\nshe came back a couple minutes later and brought 2 muffins. i don't even like <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> but i took it anyways because it was free. i took a bite of it and fell in love. it was so warm and yummy lol. my friend got emotional lol. she said it reminded her of childhood, when her mother used to make them. they were just <mark>Deli</mark>.\n\nabout 12-15 minutes later, our food started to roll out. i order the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> with eggs, cheese and sausage on it. it also came with <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark>. it looked incredible. my friend ordered the 2 <mark>Seasoned Center Cut Pork Chops</mark> that came with 2 eggs, the muffin, that she had already ate, and the <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark>. her's looked <mark>Deli</mark> too.\n\ni love potatoes so i ate those first. i put ketchup all over them and had a ball. my friend didn't like hers, because they were kind of crunchy, so she gave them to me. i put ketchup on them and finished them off too lol.\n\nnext, i started in on my <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> sandwiches. i didn't like the sandwiches. the sausages, eggs <mark>Cheese <mark>Ham, Bacon or Sausage <mark>Mushroom and Cheese</mark></mark></mark> didn't have much flavor. i thought i made a big mistake. being that i'm so smart, i thought to scrape the sausages and eggs off the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> and season the filling myself. i did, and it was 90% better. i ate the filling separately, and ever so often, i would dip the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> in the warm syrup that came with my food.\n\nmy friend said that the <mark>Seasoned Center Cut Pork Chops</mark> were just okay. they were really thin, for sure. i don't know why, but we were expecting some big juicy chops vs the breakfast chops. i wanted to taste the chops for myself, so she took a bite of mine and i took a bite of hers. they tasted as if onions were the main and secondary seasoning. she was right. they were just okay. she did enjoy my mixture of filling and seasoning though.\n\nthe good thing is, we got really full and still had a bunch of food left. i'm sure it has something to do with a humongous portion of potatoes we got and the muffin we were served in the beginning.\n\nthe service was like a 3/5 because there was a little piece of hair in my water when the server dropped it off. i asked for another one and she just stared at my full cup for like 10 seconds. i guess she couldn't understand my reason behind needing another one. i didn't even mention it because it wasn't a big deal and i didn't want anyone to make a big deal over water.\n\nbut also, i took some points off service, because it took my sever a long time to refill my water, once i had actually finished it. it took her maybe 4 or 5 minutes to check on us, after we finished eating too. we just wanted a box to pack up leftovers. when she did stop back by, we asked for the box, she quickly picked one up, dropped it off and walked away. she came back around maybe 3 or 4 minutes later and told us to pay upfront. we were just sitting there, waiting for her to come back by so that we could pay and leave. i'm glad she did stop back by because we probably would have been sitting there for a while.\n\nalthough i'm in love with the potatoes and muffins, i probably won't go back because the rest of the food was just average.",

            "if you want some pretty awesome breakfast food with great portions and a friendly staff, then this spot is just for you.  i ordered the <mark>Blackened Prime Rib Benny</mark> and was more than satisfied at how generous the portion was along with how <mark>Deli</mark> it tasted!  now i know a <mark>Blackened Prime Rib Benny</mark> isn't something that sounds all too familiar to anyone who hasn't been to this restaurant, so picture this:  juicy and flavorful pieces of blackened prime rib chopped up with poached eggs crowning an open faced buttery croissant, which is then drizzled with a rich <mark>Waffle with Fruit and Whipped Cream</mark> hollandaise sauce.  it's like what traditional egg benedicts dream to be some day basically.  regular eggs benedict is carlton banks, <mark>Blackened Prime Rib Benny</mark> is will smith.  you get the picture.\n\nbesides the entr\\u00e9e itself, my order of oj was fresh squeezed and just right.  their lemonade was great too, which is a definite plus in my book.  i also had a taste of their french fries and portuguese sausage, which my cousins ordered and both were very tasty, too!  the fries were thin, crispy and flavorful.  while the portuguese sausage was not overly oily and fatty and was cooked just right.\n\nservice was verygood, as our waiter was attentive, friendly and always available.  they have this nifty little feature on your table where there's a sign of a sad face and on the other side of it, a sign of a happy face.  when you want your server's attention, you just flip the sign to show the sad face and you'll be helped right away.  i found this to be a very memorable and smart way of the restaurant going the extra mile to offer as much quality service to its patrons.", 
            "<mark>Deli</mark> food, the reviews are no lie! came here for brunch while passing through vegas on a cross-country road trip. tried the:\n\n1) <mark>The Crazy Chicken</mark> omelette: very good! <mark>The Crazy Chicken</mark> was tender, there was a good ratio of guacamole and mushrooms, and <mark>The Works Omelette</mark> was smothered in cheese and <mark>2oz. Sour Cream</mark>. ranch potatoes on the side were fantastic, as expected.\n2) sausage gravy + sausage patty: a little on the salty side, but i thought it had a good balance of chunkiness <mark>Waffle with Fruit and Whipped Cream</mark>. i'm a bit of a sausage gravy aficionado (haha) though, so it may be that my standards are oddly high.\n3) <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>: needs it's own category, even if it's a side! <mark>Deli</mark> <mark>Deli</mark>. moist and warm, not too sweet.\n\ni would come back! the service was great too. even though we came right at brunch time and the place was packed, there was only a 5 min wait for two.", 
            "we were in vegas this past weekend for a very short trip. of course there are bazillion places to eat on the strip, but i wanted to check out some place off strip, to get away from the craziness of driving in bumper to bumper traffic, waiting for tons of people to cross the streets and then to wait to eat. \n\negg & i is located off strip, east of the 15 off of the sahara exit. its located in a strip mall with plenty of parking. there is indoor and outdoor seating. there were a few people waiting when we arrived but we were quickly seated. the place was full with a few tables empty. we were expecting to wait but it was already about 10am by the time we went. \n\ni ordered the strawberry <mark>Waffle with Fruit and Whipped Cream</mark> <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> which was thick slices of soft <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> with a strawberry <mark>Waffle with Fruit and Whipped Cream</mark> cheese and strawberry preserves on top. it was pretty good. i liked that it wasnt too sweet like most <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark>/waffles with fruit toppings at other restaurants.\n\nthe bf ordered the fiesta skillet with chorizo. it had green chili, onions and salsa. i thought it was gonna be sausage type of chorizo but it was the ground kind. if you've ever cooked or bought it at the market you know what im talking about. when you cook it, it pretty much just melts. so the skillet was as if it had chili on top. it was pretty heavy and greasy. i could probably do without the chorizo next time.\n\nthe bfs bro ordered the <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark> skillet. this had chopped chunks of <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark> with their homestyle potatoes and eggs with white gravy on top. it was pretty good. it tasted just like a regular <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark> plate but all chopped up for you, if you dont mind your food touching (i know some people who dont, like my 5 yr old nephew...).\n\nbfs bro's fiance ordered the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark>. this was two pieces of their thick sliced fluffy <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> with an omelet in between. the eggs had lots of bits of bacon in it which made it tasty but it was pretty firm. i felt like it was over cooked. maybe it was all the cheese. it tasted good though. it tasted good with either the syrup and/or ketchup. sweet or savory, whichever you prefer. \n\nwe had also had a side of the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>, which was pretty good. it was large on top. it wasnt too sweet which was nice. it came out moist and warm. yum!\n\nthe service was good. everyone was pretty friendly and the food came out fast. we had ordered coffee and they gave us a pitcher of coffee. they take credit card but you have to show your id and pay at the front.", 
            "great selection of traditional <mark>Waffle with Fruit and Whipped Cream</mark> new dishes for breakfast. service was fast and friendly. we sat down ordered and had our food within 5 minutes. i ordered the kay special it was super cheesy and tasty along with their <mark><mark>Habla Diablo Cajun Seasoned Fries</mark></mark>.. my friend had the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> which according to her was amazing!!",

            "eggcellent! we've been twice and enjoyed every bit of this great breakfast place! the place is packed and there is always a wait, but 15 minutes of my time is fine by me as long as i am going to enjoy the food. if you know my reviewing you will see that service, and location are not heavy factors in my rating. i am a total foody, so what is most important is the taste, the quality, and selection of foods offered. what i ordered this time was the bandito omelette, i enjoyed it. the last time i ordered the chile relleno omelette, it was <mark>Deli</mark>! i liked it more than the bandito. it came with a banana but muffin, which i finished even i told myself to fight the temptation. my kids ordered the strawberry <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark>, i forget the name of it but it was stuffed <mark>Waffle with Fruit and Whipped Cream</mark> cheese and strawberries. they wanted to lick the plate. when we go to vegas we won't have to think twice about it, we will be there.", 
            "my wife and i went for breakfast and were so pleased with our wonderful meal, and great service from bree!  we are both teachers and we love coming here when we visit las vegas during our vacations.  this was our fourth time here, and we've loved it each time!  we shared a <mark>Deli</mark> spinach, artichoke hearts, and feta cheese fritatta, and their unique harvest pancakes with blueberries (in the batter, and in a terrific compote topping).  i've ordered these pancakes each time we've gone to the egg & i because i love the pumpkin-spice and fresh fruit flavor combination.  \n\nwe also love the cute <mark>Waffle with Fruit and Whipped Cream</mark> system this restaurant uses to help with customer service (using a smiling egg or frowning egg placard on each table to request service).  as teachers, we are planning to adapt this system to our classrooms for students to request help.", 
            "another breakfast review.... well i just had too as we found another local joint in las vegas which just hits the top notch mark. i found this place while yelping and i'm sure glad we did...  great customer service, great food and wonderful staff..  a big high five and huge thank you to our server lindsey (hope i spelled your name correctly) as she was amazing first of all as well as everyone else in the place. treated us like their best friends... the food came out hot and fresh and tasted wonderful. not to mention those amazing muffins they treated us too for free for being first timers!!  now that is customer service!! talk about making an instant impression <mark>Waffle with Fruit and Whipped Cream</mark> an instant loyal customer... thank you to all of the staff at egg & i for treating us so well to our visit to vegas... we will definitely come back to see you again!", 
            "i would easily say that we received the most amazing service from the most incredible server in the world.  i only wished  i lived in vegas to get the chance to have brunch here at least once/week.  the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> was very fresh. the <mark>Chocolate Chip</mark> pumpkin pancakes were perfectly fluffy and pumpkin was fresh, and teh <mark>Chocolate Chip</mark> were just right (not too much, not to few).  the <mark>Chicken Fried Steak Skillet</mark> was also amazing!. cooked just right, with a thick <mark>Waffle with Fruit and Whipped Cream</mark> gravy, with perfectly cooked potatoes, and an egg, just how i asked for it. even the oj carafe tasted fresh, and it probably wasn't though, but it had me fooled.\nagain the prices, service and quality of food were amazing. (only thing is that this particular egg&i restaurant was a bit far from our hotel on the strip, but definitely worth the cab ride). even the general manager came by our table  a few times to ask how everything was. (my receipt says the  server is mandy but i believe her real name was thiereny (shes getting married soon)).\nand they have an amazing giveaway trip to disney", 
            "in search of that last good meal before heading back to california, i decided to give the egg and i a try due to recommendation of a family member.  yes there were people waiting outside to eat due to this place being so popular for breakfast.  the wait was 15 minutes which wasn't that bad.  i tried the <mark>Waffle Works</mark>, which consisted of a huge belgian waffle with 2 pieces of bacon and 2 eggs.  i did request <mark>Waffle with Fruit and Whipped Cream</mark> on the waffle, which made it taste even better.  the waffle was huge.  i enjoyed every bite.  the portions were very generous for the price.  worth every penny.  the server lindsey was wonderful and made sure i had the meal of a lifetime.  \n\n     the egg and i taught me a lesson that the best places to eat are not always on the strip or downtown las vegas.  there are good places to eat all over las vegas and you have to dig deep into your soul for the best food possible.  the egg and i has a small town feel to it which provides an intimate dining experience.  this is one of the few places in las vegas you can eat at everyday and not get tired of it but wouldn't do so simply due to the fact that you don't want to spoil yourself.  this will become my new go-to spot in need of a good breakfast while visiting.  as far as the food quality and atmosphere goes. the egg and i destroys denny's and ihop by all leaps and bounds imaginable.", 
            "this was probably the best spot we hit on a recent trip to vegas.  it's always a good sign when a place is packed midweek. \nwe were sat immediately and there was no wait to receive drinks and menus. \nour waitress was chance and quite honestly one of the best servers i've had in a long time. she knew her menu and was open to giving suggestions. she was also very attentive and upbeat in general. during a pretty good breakfast rush, mind you!\nfirstly, as i said before, it's busy. but you never have to flag down a waitress or ask when your order is coming. there's a little sign on the table which lets you flip between a happy egg and a frowny egg. if the frowny egg is showing, the waitress/waiter is supposed to help you right away. i never had to use this sign because the service was so prompt. \nfirst thing i loved was the bottomless cup of coffee. you're given a full thermos pitcher of coffee all for your table and there's plenty of sugar (or substitutes) <mark>Waffle with Fruit and Whipped Cream</mark> at hand. \ni usually ask for a recommendation on what to order when traveling and chance was eager to help. she told me about the chile relleno benedict and said that it's not normally on the menu (special days only) but that it really was a must try. honestly, i'm not huge on chile relleno but hey she seemed enthusiastic and i went ahead and ordered it. \nit was amazing. and it should be an everyday menu item. i'll go into both dishes and what was so awesome about them below. \nchile relleno benedict:\nwow. the dish was amazing. benedicts make just about anything better but this was no joke. really well thought out and balanced. first thing i noticed was that the eggs were perfectly poached. the whites were soft but not slimey or runny. there was zero cooked yoke. it was warm and ran smooth just the way god intended. \ni don't know what was breaded in the dish but it was either the chile itself or the thinly sliced (and tender as all hell) <mark>Chicken Breast</mark>. the breading was really what made the dish i think. it added just enough saltiness that i didn't need to add salt or pepper to my breakfast. i always add salt and pepper (unless i get chicken <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark>) and that was a pleasant surprise. the chile and <mark>The Crazy Chicken</mark> were topped off with the poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. there were home fries on the side which also needed no seasoning beside what was already there but honestly i would have been ok just eating the chile relleno benedict. it was really that good. \nmy gf ordered the <mark>Grilled Veggie Pesto Sandwich</mark> with <mark>Habla Diablo Cajun Seasoned Fries</mark>. i didn't try the sandwich itself but she said the bread was very tender and the pesto was really tasty. i did sneak a few fries however and loved them. thinly cut shoestring style potatoes covered in seasoning. another instance where salt was not necessary. really they would have been fine without ketchup. \ni fully intend on visiting this place every time i head to las vegas and can't say enough good things about it. thank you chance for the awesome recommendation and thank you egg & i for turning out exceptional food and service at a great price!", 
            "the place has a \"cute\" charm to it right down to the animated <mark>Waffle with Fruit and Whipped Cream</mark> named food menu. choices that could easily satisfy the appetites of any family. service was excellent from the hostess to our waitress chance! she helped us make the perfect selections and checked in with us frequently.  my 13 year old said we need to come back tomorrow to try all the yummy sounding dishes.", 
            "a great place to bring the family for breakfast. they gave great servings for my plate, i got the <mark>Waffle Works</mark> with extra banana and it has a big piece of ham, great amount of eggs and a enormous waffle topped <mark>Waffle with Fruit and Whipped Cream</mark> and <mark>Banana</mark>.",

            "i  love a good breakfast!!! my bf had read a few great reviews about the egg and i recently and suggested we try it after sitting in out dr. office appt. for 2 hours; needless to say it made us hungry.  <mark>Homemade Soup of the Day</mark> was warm and not too windy so we opted to sit outside on the patio.  nothing impressive but it did just fine.  the newspaper style menu was fun and different.  right away i saw about 6 items i would like to try.  as did my hungry man.  i finally decided on the <mark>Original <mark>Cabo Breakfast Burrito</mark></mark>.  and he picked this little piggy omelet.  our food came very quickly and looked great!! the burrito was huge and looked great.  there was 4 scrambled eggs, cheese, peppers, onions and huge side of   their breakfast potatoes.  there was also a side of salsa that was tasty and not too spicy.  my bf food looked yummy as well, i knew this when he ate it all with few words.  \nthe only thing that could have been better was a more attentive server.  we had to look around for a water and soda refill.  i hate that.  she was however very sweet and seemed a little new.  i will defiantly be going back to try some of the other dishes that made my mouth water.  overall, the egg and i is a sure fire great breakfast experience.", 
            "so, after a crazy weekend in vegas whats the first thing your body needs before you hit the traffic on i -15?  an iv, close... breakfast.  the egg & i is not to far off the strip, only about a mile depending on where you stay.  we took the back roads from <mark>Caesar</mark> and our eta was about 5 minutes. \n\nthe coolest thing is their \"happy egg, sad egg\" stand at the edge of the table.  whenever you need something like a drink refill, or if you have a problem with anything, just flip the egg from the happy black face to the sad yellow face.  we tested this unique method of customer service and within seconds we had our waitress back at the table asking if we needed anything.  even without flipping the egg the waitress was very attentive.\n\nafter you get your drinks the waitress will bring you a fresh baked <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>.  my buddy thought he was flirting with the waitress, and they totally were, so he made us all thank him graciously for the 2 muffins.  then after 30 seconds of looking around, you realize everyone gets a muffin.  *sad egg face jordan, sorry :^(   but the muffin is warm and <mark>Deli</mark>.  \n\nwe had a party of 4 and we all got something different and it was all great.  i got chicken <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark> covered in gravy atop a mound of ranch potatoes with 3 fried eggs on top, and the best part about it was... they cut it up for you!  this is when i found out i am lazy because you know you're lazy when you get excited about your food coming pre-cut.  <mark>The Crazy Chicken</mark> breast was moist and the outside was perfectly crisp, and with every bite the batter unleashed a flurry of flavor.  mouth watering.  the hype about their ranch potatoes is true.  they are really good and live up to the expectations other yelpers have set fourth.  i haven't had anything quite like them ever before.  my plate also came with a side of fresh seasonal fruit and a biscuit for gravy dunking. \n\nthe rest of the gang ordered: eggs benedict, the <mark>Original <mark>Cabo Breakfast Burrito</mark></mark>, and a plain jane 2-egg breakfast with bacon.  all of which was worth the wait on a sunday morning.\n\n5-stars for the overall experience.  the waitress was cute and friendly even if she didn't give jordan a muffin because he was \"special,\" their happy egg / sad egg system works well when you need something in a pinch, the superior quality of the food and the prices are great especially after losing a couple g's at the tables in vegas.",

(while my bran muffin was gross) it was just the perfect yin/yang of good vs. evil... , er mavs vs the heat, the cowboys vs the 49ers, egg works vs egg & i... and yes good food vs. bad food. \n\nthe only reason i gave them 2stars was b/c of the bfs food was 4 stars cancelled out by my zero stars.. to equal 2. :) \nhere's hoping you gleam something from my review... please do not order a salad at egg & i."

            "let's be honest here: the whole vegas breakfast buffet phenomenon gets really old really fast.  yes, it's all you can eat for $9.99, but how much can you really eat?  and how much do you want to eat every single morning?  don't you want someone to bring you food instead of trying not to spill your bowl of oatmeal on a slow 80-year-old grandma in an \"i live to bingo\" sweater?\n\nif you do, take a short drive down w. sahara ave to egg and i.  you will not be disappointed.  inconspicuously located in a nondescript strip mall, egg and i provides a perfectly casual, hearty and homey breakfast without the pompousness and the hoopla of the strip.\n\nby now you're probably wondering what \"egg\" looks like.  well, egg looks kind of like humpty dumpty, and \"i\" looks just like \"egg.\"  just look on their website.  might as well call the whole place \"2 eggs,\" although it would probably detract from the restaurant's country kitchen charm.  \n\nwe came in around 9:30 am on saturday morning, and the place was absolutely packed.  we got a table right away, but every party that came in after 9:45 had to wait a little.  we had just gotten into town, and i was glad they brought us a whole pot of coffee.  you'd better believe i took advantage of the proximity and the unlimited availability of good coffee.  even the yellow cups with the company logo were cute enough to use at home.\n\nwe couldn't quite decide on what to order, and our waitress graciously waited, while offering valuable suggestions along the way.  the menu is extensive and the portions are huge, so....  also, breakfast is the most important meal <mark>Homemade Soup of the Day</mark>, so you don't want to make this decision lightly.\n\nthere was nothing light about my breakfast, however.  the ultimate skillet is not for the weak...that much i know.  a generous layer of breakfast potatoes had a cajun flavor to it.  paprika and something else gave those potatoes a light crunch and a reddish hue - pretty and <mark>Deli</mark>.  the ultimate skillet also featured mounds of sausage, ham and bacon, mixed in with bell peppers, onions <mark>Cheese <mark>Ham, Bacon or Sausage <mark>Mushroom and Cheese</mark></mark></mark>.  the skillet wouldn't be complete with 2 scrambled eggs on top.  wow.  \n\nwe also ordered one large pancake to share, but after getting through 3/4 of the skillet, i wasn't hankering for a pancake.  i did try it, and it was fluffy and sweet, but it was just too much.  i was ready to throw in the towel, which almost never happens to me.  on any other day, i can finish any breakfast, and have some of yours, too, but the ultimate skillet proved to be a bit much.  order at your own risk.  that's a lot of food for $9.95.\n\ngreat breakfast in a quaint setting?  i will be sure to make it my regular vegas breakfast destination.", 
            "because of rachel ray's visit here, i decided to try it out. besides, breakfast is my favorite meal <mark>Homemade Soup of the Day</mark>.\n\ni walked in and there was a very polite older lady sitting behind the register that greeted me. then she started story telling about the place, since i told her that it was my first time. what a nice lady, very concerned to answer any questions i had and got me seated immediately. the server was also friendly and i did like the feel of the place, like a refined ol' south country diner. i promptly ordered their corned <mark>Homemade Corn Beef Hash</mark> (it wasn't the canned stuff) and <mark>Fresh Orange or Grapefruit Juice</mark>. \n\nabout a minute later, the server comes with this delectable looking muffin. it was a <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>.. hhhhmmmmm?! it was warm and smelled like it fell from the hands of a banana angel!! i took a bite and i got in a blissful state for a few seconds.. i mean this thing was insanely, out of this galaxy, the mother of all mother <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>!! this thing will give mimi's cafe's muffins a run for their money! in regards to the corned beef, it had a good flavor (bit salty for my taste), the potatoes were great, the overeasy eggs were overeasy eggs but did make everything else taste much better. decent size dish but tasted average. \n\ngreat service and price. you must try  their <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>!!!!!", 
            "after indulging us too much <mark>Homemade Soup of the Day</mark> before at the bellagio buffet, we looked for a nice and decent original coffee shop - or such. <mark>Homemade Soup of the Day</mark> before my lady had found a voucher in a tourist magazine together with the notion of a review that this place (i.e. both) we're very liked with the community and the reviewers, in fact best liked.\n\nbeing a no brainer it turned up trumps in reality: the place was very busy (which we took as a good sign to start with) yet being seated only took a moment and the service was very fast and attentive. food variety on the menue is almost too big ;-) so i quite took my time to decide. got an italian influenced omelette which turned out to be very tasty. \none more thing about the service: our little boy didn't like his fries because they came spiced (paprika or the likes)... they were replaced with plain ones in no time - comped !\n\na little before the food arrived a nice and cheerful lady of the staff came over and chatted us up a bit. her expert eye didn't fail to note that we were out-of-towners. later, i found out that she was actually the manager (owner?) and had the same first name as my darling ! when she heard that i failed to order the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> (house specialty) she had one sent to our table immediately - again, complementary !\n\ni guess i don't need to say more. prices very reasonable, yummy food with a lot of variety...wish we had breakfast places like that in berlin lol.\n\nsince i guess we will return to las vegas at some point in our lives i can clearly see us going there again !", 
            "i heard of this place through a friend of mine whose friend recommended it.  so what's the first thing i do?  check it out on yelp, of course!  \n\nyes, there is a wait.  but like everyone says, the line goes really quickly and i think we were seated within 15-20 minutes, which is not bad considering it was a saturday at peak brunch time.  \n\ni loved their newspaper style menus and all the great descriptions to help decide what to order.  first thing i have to mention is the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>.  yes, i know everyone mentions it but it is so worth mentioning!  it's so moist and <mark>Deli</mark>, i actually now crave <mark>Homemade Soup of the Day</mark> thing!  \n\ni ordered a corned <mark>Homemade Corn Beef Hash</mark> with eggs and instead of their potatoes, i ordered rice.  the corned <mark>Homemade Corn Beef Hash</mark> was okay, i like mine on the crispier side but it was still good.  the eggs were cooked perfectly.  not too many places can make the perfect over-medium where it's a little cooked but just enough runnyness to get some yolk without it spewing all over the plate like an over-easy.  i tried my girlfriend's potatoes and should've stuck with it.  it was almost like little bites of french fries.  so <mark>Deli</mark>!  i'm definitely heading back there next chance i get to, until then, i shall see the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> in my dreams...", 
            "i  love a good breakfast!!! my bf had read a few great reviews about the egg and i recently and suggested we try it after sitting in out dr. office appt. for 2 hours; needless to say it made us hungry.  <mark>Homemade Soup of the Day</mark> was warm and not too windy so we opted to sit outside on the patio.  nothing impressive but it did just fine.  the newspaper style menu was fun and different.  right away i saw about 6 items i would like to try.  as did my hungry man.  i finally decided on the <mark>Original <mark>Cabo Breakfast Burrito</mark></mark>.  and he picked this little piggy omelet.  our food came very quickly and looked great!! the burrito was huge and looked great.  there was 4 scrambled eggs, cheese, peppers, onions and huge side of   their breakfast potatoes.  there was also a side of salsa that was tasty and not too spicy.  my bf food looked yummy as well, i knew this when he ate it all with few words.  \nthe only thing that could have been better was a more attentive server.  we had to look around for a water and soda refill.  i hate that.  she was however very sweet and seemed a little new.  i will defiantly be going back to try some of the other dishes that made my mouth water.  overall, the egg and i is a sure fire great breakfast experience.", 
            "<mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> & their potato hash is the business!!!\n\nthis place only serves breakfast & i believe they close at 3pm. the menu looks like a morning's newspaper, they have tons of yummy items to choose from. the trick to getting your waiter's attention: first you'd have to look at the smiley egg that holds the condiments on your table and when you flip the egg to a frown, you'll be serviced in no time. unless they are super busy and most of the time they are so just wait patiently. \n\nthe food portion size is big, i would say that thee portion is adult men's size who is damn hungry in the morning because i never finish and always pack it home.\n\nevery time i order unlimited coffee, it always taste old (drink @ your own risk) :\\ so i never get coffee unless i absolutely need it. \n\noverall, i love this place! mainly i give them a 5 for <mark>Homemade Soup of the Day</mark> food...it's just too damn good.",

            "husband and i came here for a quick bite <mark>Homemade Soup of the Day</mark> we left las vegas heading to the airport. the parking lot was packed to the brim, but we only waited maybe 15 minutes at most. service was fast, waitresses were kind and quick. husband ordered the hash skillet it was amazing, like, mouthgasm amazing. when it came to the table it didn't look like it was going to be that good, but wow. i ordered a chicken <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark> breakfast with over easy eggs, gravy was portioned well, not overly done, steak fried perfectly, not greasy, but crispy even with the layer of gravy. their potatoes are pretty interesting diced/cubed with like a season salt, have a nice crunch to them. the portion sizes here are absurdly large, i think we could've easily shared one of these breakfasts plates and been satisfied. we both weren't able to finish either plate. they also come with a <mark>Side of Toast</mark> or a muffin. only downside i'd say is the coffee price is a bit on the steep side, but they do leave you a jug, at your table so you don't need to flag someone down and you're supplied with all your needs at your table.",

            "great breakfast spots are my favorite and this is one of the best i've ever found, thanks to yelp.  one of the most innovative breakfast menu's i've seen and particularly impressive is the ability to execute so many offerings to perfection.  service was outstanding, our waitress, jessica, was fast and efficient.  \n\nthe feature here is undoubtedly their <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>.  they were excellent, rivaling the best homemade i've ever tasted.  what amazed me is how they can produce as many as they have to do to supply this very busy and fairly large restaurant.   they were warm and obviously very fresh and tasted as good as most any homemade.  they have a slight gingerbread taste to them so i suspect molasses is a part of the recipe.   i know how much work they are to make homemade which is why i really admire their dedication to featuring this treat.    the food was really good as well, because they wouldn't earn any points from my son who doesn't eat anything with <mark>Banana</mark> in it.  i feel my opinion was well founded and based on a total of three <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>- mine, my son's, and a free one as a yelp check-in bonus.  i carried two out and enjoyed them later in <mark>Homemade Soup of the Day</mark>.\n\ni had the three little pigs omelet which was great.  the potatoes were done to perfection- crisp on the outside, evenly done throughout with a nice seasoning on the outside.  my son had a western omelet with tomatoes substituted for the potatoes.  a nice patio is outside with misters to help battle the vegas temps and low humidity.\n\nit's no question this is a premier spot to enjoy a wonderful breakfast in las vegas with just a little drive from the downtown strip.",

            "very good breakfast food. waitress was very friendly and the food came out quick and hot. i had the bacon and avocado omelette which was great but the best part was that <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> to go which i ate later in <mark>Homemade Soup of the Day</mark> and was still melt in your mouth good!"

Sour Cream</mark>) and not only was it <mark>Deli</mark>, it was more than enough food to last me through lunch.  i wanted to try the pancakes as well but i couldn't get it as a side so i tried the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> that other reviewers had recommended - it was good but not great, but i'm not a big fan of banana nut in the first place so others may enjoy it, i don't know.  \n\nthe overall price was reasonable and i prefer quality over quantity and other than a handful of a few breakfast places on the strip the egg and i is one of the best breakfast places around vegas.  highly recommended!",

            "this is by far my favorite place to have breakfast and now lunch in vegas. their banana nut bread/ muffin is amazing!! the best! very moist and nutty.\n\nthis was my first time ordering off the lunch menu and i got the cinci chili burger.  it was <mark>Deli</mark>!  great tasty chili with the ranch potatoes on the side.  comes in an open bun with a large pickle, lettuce, and tomatoes.   i was very satifised with it.  \n\nusually the service is pretty good and friendly except when they're super busy.  then it gets a little quick and snappy.  but overall, i definitely look forward to coming here whenever i go to vegas.  and if you like the muffin, definitely buy a loaf to go and put it in the fridge.  it lasts for a while in there and its always moist and soft.",

            "are you tired of waiting in lines that look like you're at disney just to eat buffet food?  then do i have an off the strip place that you'll will like.  my cousin told me about the egg & i.  boy am i glad that he did.  the food was really good.  there was a 10-15 minute wait but did not compare to those monstrous lines in the casino hotels.  \n\nafter glancing through their newspaper styled menu, i decided to have a four egg omelette.  which was more than <mark>Deli</mark> when it arrived.  accompanying this wonderful omelette was their famous ranch potatoes.  these bad boys were orgasmic good.  they were seasoned with some spices that gave it a lil bit of a kick.  but if you aren't into spicy then i advise you put some ketchup on them to dull the fire.  all in all the meal was <mark>Deli</mark>.\n\nthe service was pretty good as well.  they have a system where there is a napkin holder and on top are two pictures of eggs.  if you need some assistance then you just flip the egg to yellow.  now i may be butchering the explanation of this process but long story short the wait staff is very attentive and helpful.\n\nso give it a shot if you are tired of long buffet lines.  it also gives you a chance to see the other parts of vegas.",

            "let's be honest here: the whole vegas breakfast buffet phenomenon gets really old really fast.  yes, it's all you can eat for $9.99, but how much can you really eat?  and how much do you want to eat every single morning?  don't you want someone to bring you food instead of trying not to spill your bowl of oatmeal on a slow 80-year-old grandma in an \"i live to bingo\" sweater?\n\nif you do, take a short drive down w. sahara ave to egg and i.  you will not be disappointed.  inconspicuously located in a nondescript strip mall, egg and i provides a perfectly casual, hearty and homey breakfast without the pompousness and the hoopla of the strip.\n\nby now you're probably wondering what \"egg\" looks like.  well, egg looks kind of like humpty dumpty, and \"i\" looks just like \"egg.\"  just look on their website.  might as well call the whole place \"2 eggs,\" although it would probably detract from the restaurant's country kitchen charm.  \n\nwe came in around 9:30 am on saturday morning, and the place was absolutely packed.  we got a table right away, but every party that came in after 9:45 had to wait a little.  we had just gotten into town, and i was glad they brought us a whole pot of coffee.  you'd better believe i took advantage of the proximity and the unlimited availability of good coffee.  even the yellow cups with the company logo were cute enough to use at home.\n\nwe couldn't quite decide on what to order, and our waitress graciously waited, while offering valuable suggestions along the way.  the menu is extensive and the portions are huge, so....  also, breakfast is the most important meal <mark>Homemade Soup of the Day</mark>, so you don't want to make this decision lightly.\n\nthere was nothing light about my breakfast, however.  the ultimate skillet is not for the weak...that much i know.  a generous layer of breakfast potatoes had a cajun flavor to it.  paprika and something else gave those potatoes a light crunch and a reddish hue - pretty and <mark>Deli</mark>.  the ultimate skillet also featured mounds of sausage, ham and bacon, mixed in with bell peppers, onions <mark>Cheese <mark>Ham, Bacon or Sausage <mark>Mushroom and Cheese</mark></mark></mark>.  the skillet wouldn't be complete with 2 scrambled eggs on top.  wow.  \n\nwe also ordered one large pancake to share, but after getting through 3/4 of the skillet, i wasn't hankering for a pancake.  i did try it, and it was fluffy and sweet, but it was just too much.  i was ready to throw in the towel, which almost never happens to me.  on any other day, i can finish any breakfast, and have some of yours, too, but the ultimate skillet proved to be a bit much.  order at your own risk.  that's a lot of food for $9.95.\n\ngreat breakfast in a quaint setting?  i will be sure to make it my regular vegas breakfast destination.",

(while my bran muffin was gross) it was just the perfect yin/yang of good vs. evil... , er mavs vs the heat, the cowboys vs the 49ers, egg works vs egg & i... and yes good food vs. bad food. \n\nthe only reason i gave them 2stars was b/c of the bfs food was 4 stars cancelled out by my zero stars.. to equal 2. :) \nhere's hoping you gleam something from my review... please do not order a salad at egg & i.",

            "wow!  decided to eat away from the tourist spot.  i found a coupon in one of the lv booklets you get at the hotel, it was buy one get one free breakfast. this place is definitely worth going to.  it's about 10mins from the strip.\n\nfood:  corned <mark>Homemade Corn Beef Hash</mark> and eggs, eggs benedict florentine,  <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>.\n\ncorned <mark>Homemade Corn Beef Hash</mark>:  husband really enjoyed the \"real\" corned beef in the hash!\n\neggs benedict florentine:  yummy!  the sauce was <mark>Deli</mark>, i think i would stick with the original eggs benedict.  the spinach was served fresh and not saut\\u00e9ed which i was expecting.\n\n<mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>:  this is what they are known for!  must get them!! they were so good, we ordered 6 to take back to the hotel!\n\nthe service was awesome too :)", 
            "damn this <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> is <mark>Deli</mark>. and for the portions, sizes, and service, it's quick, and inexpensive. whether you're coming in hung over, or looking to feed and fuel up... do it. i love this place for their courteousness and most importantly their <mark>Deli</mark> breakfast. also, if the wait gets too long, go across the plaza and hit up zia records and check out their vinyl, cds, dvds, whatever you're into :)", 
            "there is definitely a reason why there is always a wait for this place...it is totally worth it!!!\n\ni got one of the egg & i specials - chicken <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark>  which consist of 2 eggs, ranch potatoes, and a <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> which you can totally share with 2 people except for the muffin. please dont share that. get your own, damn it. its too good to be shared!\n\nwait a minute! did i say ranch potatoes???!!! oh hell yeah!!! its the best tasting season potatoes ever! they are not like french fries nor tots but they are cubed shaped fries. i almost died when i put one in my mouth. this is why i scored this place a 5. \n\nthe potatoes and <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> totally suckered me in for life! i dont even like banana nut flavored anything or muffins and this muffin was the bomb!!!\n\nmy chicken <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark> was huge and just perfect. its not oily at all, just plump and juicy. \n\n5 star in my book. i think the service was good...i think the wait wasnt too bad... shit, i dont remember, i zoned out after my first bite of those <mark>Deli</mark> potato fries!", 
            "good breakfast food off the strip of vegas. price is reasonable (around $10 per plate) and they give you a lot. enough for you to take back home unless you are coping with a hangover and need all the carbs you can get. \n\nthe <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> is really as good as everyone says it is; especially with the spread. you can tell they bake it fresh as there is no complex presentation to it. it is just simply muffin off the pan. i ordered the egg-ceptional omelette and it was decent. definitely worth the money but, not mind blowing. i would try their other items if i go again. my friend got the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> and that looked very good. however, the ranch potato side were <mark>Deli</mark> and exactly what i needed after a long weekend in vegas. \n\ntheir high selling point is their super nice staff. they give you the perfect amount of chit chat and leave you alone time.\n\nuse their egg signs. yellow egg means you need attention; black egg means leave me alone.",

            "came to vegas for a week and decided to eat off the strip and found this place through yelp.  i was excited to see they served spam, egg and rice.  came on monday, june 9th for breakfast and from the time we walked in to the time we walked out we had exceptional customer service by gia the manager and our waitress, carole ann.   they were both very personable.\n\nwe we're seated promptly in the back next to the kitchen by gia.  carole ann came by to acknowledge us but would be right back because she had to sing happy birthday at a table.  no biggie as we were on vacation and wasn't in a rush to go anywhere.  \n\ngia came by and apologized but no need to apologize for the delay.  she came out with two <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> for us while we waited and took our drink orders and came out with it.  those muffins were <mark>Deli</mark>.  carole ann came back and took our order.  i ordered the spam and egg over rice.  that came with a muffin or toast and since we already got the muffin i thought that was it.  but she offered me toast or another muffin to take home, but i declined.   my other half ordered a chorizo skillet.  \n\nthe food and service was great and i would have def gone back but my intentions while i was in vegas was to visit a different restaurant everyday.  \n\nthey don't take american express, not sure if it's just at this location. \n\nthank you carole ann for great customer service, keep it up and i hope you get to meet mickey mouse!!!", 
            "i came here not once, but three times during my week's vacation with my fiance. we couldn't get enough!\n\nbesides the amazing food, there's always great service! i love the little egg signs on the tables--flip the happy face to sad and the servers can all see that you need attention and someone comes along. none of that trying to wave someone down, hand signal, awkwardness going on here. we flipped ours only once and got our refill within like 20 seconds...it's absolutely amazing. (note that using this doesn't mean you're an unhappy guest, just that you need attention...)\n\nwe were served by three great servers during our breakfasts here this week: john (i think he's new), thaynara (sp?), and erin; all did a fantastic job bringing extra napkins, getting refills, answering questions about the menu, etc. they were quick and attentive and just all around fantastic. \n\nso, the food. amazing. i'm not a breakfast person. usually eggs kinda gross me out if they aren't cooked right, and i'm kind of picky, i know. so why did i go to a breakfast joint and get eggs every time? because they know how to cook them! between the omelet, scrambled, and over medium, all were cooked perfectly!! not that i doubted a place with \"egg\" in the name couldn't get it right, but every meal i had was executed to perfection. eggs weren't dry or overcooked, nor were they runny or watery. just right, every time.\n\nout of the six things we ordered over our three visits, i got the coffee every time. it was piping hot and <mark>Deli</mark>, and was a perfect compliment to the breakfast... they bring the caraffe to your table so you don't have to wait for refills on the coffee, either. you've got to ask for the fancy creamers, but they'll bring some out for you no problem! (they had caramel and french vanilla, and i thinkkkk the irish cream flavor too.) \n\nthey have some awesome works potatoes (i have always called these home fries) that are seasoned and chopped into cute little cubes (more surface area = more crispy potato!) that are super tasty. side note: if you don't want the potatoes, or just not a huge helping of them, you can ask to sub fresh fruit, or do 1/2 fruit, 1/2 potatoes, as my fiance and i did a couple of times. the fruit they have is fresh and sweet, from cantaloupe, honeydew, watermelon, grapefruit, and pineapple. \n\nthey also have these to-die-for <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>. these muffins are homemade and so soft and moist! utterly delectable--i definitely recommend them over the toast option offered with most breakfast plates.\n\nwe've tried the corned <mark>Homemade Corn Beef Hash</mark> (no canned meat products here!) and the <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark> as well as the biscuits and gravy; all were keepers. the biscuits are two whole ones, not one cut in half (big servings), and i like that they cut up the steak in the skillet, makes it so much easier to eat. we also tried the works omelet and <mark>Brad's Scramble</mark>. there is so much on this menu that is tasty! \n\ni did mark the price range as $$ because most of the plates are around $10-11, plus a drink, per person is kind of expensive. we were on vacation, which was why we splurged, but if you're a local this is still a lovely breakfast-brunch place to hit up for some great food. \n\nside note the second: the decor is really cute! it looks like hand-painted farmland all over the restaurant, and they have merch available to buy with their logo at the front (i.e. a baby onesie with \"just hatched\" on it or something) and they sell loaves of that <mark>Deli</mark> banana nut bread to go, too!\n\nrecap: everything is <mark>Deli</mark>, huge portions, perfect eggs, fantastic service, great experience. will definitely return and recommend. :d", 
            "my wife and i went for breakfast and were so pleased with our wonderful meal, and great service from bree!  we are both teachers and we love coming here when we visit las vegas during our vacations.  this was our fourth time here, and we've loved it each time!  we shared a <mark>Deli</mark> spinach, artichoke hearts, and feta cheese fritatta, and their unique harvest pancakes with blueberries (in the batter, and in a terrific compote topping).  i've ordered these pancakes each time we've gone to the egg & i because i love the pumpkin-spice and fresh fruit flavor combination.  \n\nwe also love the cute <mark>Waffle with Fruit and Whipped Cream</mark> system this restaurant uses to help with customer service (using a smiling egg or frowning egg placard on each table to request service).  as teachers, we are planning to adapt this system to our classrooms for students to request help.",

            "this spot has become a regular part of my vegas experience! \n\ntheir <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> are insane and their egg skillet meals are huge enough to keep you full for the rest <mark>Homemade Soup of the Day</mark>, easily. boyfriend once finished a full chicken <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark> skillet and i feared for his cardiovascular health for a hot minute. as an added bonus, the coffee is <mark>Deli</mark> and i absolutely recommend the <mark>Bacon & <mark>Sliced Avocado</mark></mark> omelette and banana nut <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark>. \n\nservice is excellent and we always feel cared for when we visit. our server today, bree, was awesome and attentive!\n\nambiance is charming. this place isn't great for huge groups, but it is totally perfect for the family. expect a line in the morning -- but the wait is worth it!", 
            "breakfasted here on july 7, 2015.\n\nthe menu is about 8 pages long, so if you don't explore it before entering, be prepared to spend some time examining it.\n\ni had decided on steak and eggs before i went, so i ordered right away and had time to look at the rest of the menu before the order was <mark>Deli</mark>.  \n\na pretty diverse menu, really, but it is tailored to a breakfast offering for the most part.  \n\nthey boast a dog friendly patio dining area, and i will be back with my pup for lunch after the temperature drops a bit.\n\nthe steak and eggs were excellent.  the steak (ordered medium) was medium.  the eggs were perfectly over easy!\n\n<mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark> were only so-so.  i was expecting heat with the name, not chili powder, so i asked for some of the <mark>2oz. Habla Diablo Original Salsa</mark>.  more chili powder.\n\nservice was prompt, friendly and efficient.  checkout was easy and they asked for a photo id to accompany the credit card.\n\nby the way, if you remember the horrific accident here a few years ago, they have placed some pretty big rocks between sahara and the patio/dining area.  it would take a vehicle doing over 60 to move them.  then again, the speed limit there is 45 and metro almost always spots you 10mph, so there might still be a risk.\n\nrecommended for breakfast for sure.", 
            "my family and i decided to try this place on the morning we were headed home from vegas. we got it off of the triple d website and have had great experiences in the past so it seemed like a great choice. while it was not a terrible experience, it was certainly a disappointing one and here is why:\n\nmy mother and i both have a food allergy to monosodium glutamate more commonly known as msg. it is a flavor enhancer/ preservative often found in foods like doritos, cheetos, and all of those other junk foods you shouldn't be eating (but let's face it, sometimes we just need some junk food). for me, a little is ok, but my mother can't eat it at all. \n\nwhen we sat down at the table, we asked if they used msg more out of habit than anything else; why would a breakfast spot need a preservative? our waitress, who was very nice, informed us that it was in most of the food, but not the eggs. my mother, who had originally decided on the highly rated chicken <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark>, had to change her order. both of chose the <mark>Sunrise Mountain</mark> and decided to order fruit rather than take our chances with the <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark> that came with 90% of the breakfast options.\n\nwhen the food came out it looked <mark>Deli</mark>, but one bite changed our opinion. while it was plentiful, it was bland. even the blanket of cheese over the top could not help it.\n\nmy father, who does not share my msg allergy, ordered a skillet. mom and i both took a bite of the <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark> from his plate and they were <mark>Deli</mark>. crunchy and flavorful, i would have loved to be able to eat them, but they were covered in stomach pain inducing msg. and the only option besides the potatoes was fruit (which was very nice, but did nothing for the dish itself).\n\ni gave this place two stars because the service was good and the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> <mark>Deli</mark>. now if only they could learn how to cook with flavor rather than chemicals...", 
            "arrived worrying about too much salt and msg (via previous yelp reviews). but right away i knew i'd be disappointed when i learned that they didn't have real maple syrup for their pancakes. its regular customer must be some one who likes the artificial sugar syrup they serve at cheap restaurants. it wasn't even an option for an additional charge.\n\nto be fair, my kids didn't care their mickey mouse pancakes came with sugar syrup. and the prices for everything were reasonable. while i didn't find their eggs benedict too salty (i am not salt sensitive), the msg in the hollindaise was palpable and the famous <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark> were \"meh\" (and i like spicy!). on the plus side, their <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> were <mark>Deli</mark>, as advertised.",

            "i went to the egg & i after a night of debauchery in las vegas (recovery breakfast) and i have zero regrets. i was excited to pull up and see roughly 40 ppl waiting outside as that generally means <mark>Deli</mark> awairs. after a 20 minute wait,  my friend and i were sat in amanda's section. amanda was a very knowledgeable, amiable and capable waitress. she got our orders correct and our food came out promptly. \n\nspeaking of food, i ordered the <mark>Mashed Potato Omelette</mark> and my friend got <mark>The Crazy Chicken</mark> <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark> skillet. whoever though about putting garlic mash inside of a bacon omelette is a genius. either that or they have grandmothers chained up in the back putting elbows and feet in the food. absolutely amazing!! will definitely come back when in the lv area.",

            "<mark>Deli</mark> i loved it big portions great prices we all got skillets and you get a free muffin which is also <mark>Deli</mark>", 
            "i wanted to try something new for breakfast. i had no idea where to go or what to eat. i came to yelp like i normally do. mostly everyone had something positive to say about this place, so my friend and i packed up and headed 15 minutes away to get some good breakfast.\n\nwhen we arrived, we could tell that it was going to be a long wait and a headache. i sent my friend in, ahead of me, so that i could park. as soon as she walked in, she called me. she said that the place was a mess and she was going to have to come out and wait the 15 minutes it was going to take to be seated. nevertheless, the hostess pointed out some empty benches, around the corner. so, i walked in to wait.\n\nupon entering, i was discouraged because a lot of people were standing around waiting. i just knew it was going to take 30+ minutes. surprisingly, it only took 15 minutes before we were called and seated.\n\nthe place is really small and packed to capacity, so i was thankful that we got to sit around the corner where there were only about 4-5 tables. we had plenty space.\n\nthe server came around fast to take our drink order. she was quick to bring our drinks back too. she asked us if we were ready to order and we said, \"no, we're looking at yelp pictures and we need some more time.\" i did ask about the stuff <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> dish that someone shared on yelp. she smiled and pointed it out and said that it's a popular dish. then she left and took orders for people that was around us.\n\nas soon as she walked away, we decided what we wanted, but it took her about 6 minutes to make eye contact again. when she did stop back by, she asked if we were still looking at pictures or if we were ready to order. we went ahead and ordered. it totally slipped my mind to check in and get a free muffin for myself. the waitress said, \"you were on yelp, did you check in to get the free muffin?\" i was happy she reminded me to do that.\n\nshe came back a couple minutes later and brought 2 muffins. i don't even like <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> but i took it anyways because it was free. i took a bite of it and fell in love. it was so warm and yummy lol. my friend got emotional lol. she said it reminded her of childhood, when her mother used to make them. they were just <mark>Deli</mark>.\n\nabout 12-15 minutes later, our food started to roll out. i order the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> with eggs, cheese and sausage on it. it also came with <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark>. it looked incredible. my friend ordered the 2 <mark>Seasoned Center Cut Pork Chops</mark> that came with 2 eggs, the muffin, that she had already ate, and the <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark>. her's looked <mark>Deli</mark> too.\n\ni love potatoes so i ate those first. i put ketchup all over them and had a ball. my friend didn't like hers, because they were kind of crunchy, so she gave them to me. i put ketchup on them and finished them off too lol.\n\nnext, i started in on my <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> sandwiches. i didn't like the sandwiches. the sausages, eggs <mark>Cheese <mark>Ham, Bacon or Sausage <mark>Mushroom and Cheese</mark></mark></mark> didn't have much flavor. i thought i made a big mistake. being that i'm so smart, i thought to scrape the sausages and eggs off the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> and season the filling myself. i did, and it was 90% better. i ate the filling separately, and ever so often, i would dip the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> in the warm syrup that came with my food.\n\nmy friend said that the <mark>Seasoned Center Cut Pork Chops</mark> were just okay. they were really thin, for sure. i don't know why, but we were expecting some big juicy chops vs the breakfast chops. i wanted to taste the chops for myself, so she took a bite of mine and i took a bite of hers. they tasted as if onions were the main and secondary seasoning. she was right. they were just okay. she did enjoy my mixture of filling and seasoning though.\n\nthe good thing is, we got really full and still had a bunch of food left. i'm sure it has something to do with a humongous portion of potatoes we got and the muffin we were served in the beginning.\n\nthe service was like a 3/5 because there was a little piece of hair in my water when the server dropped it off. i asked for another one and she just stared at my full cup for like 10 seconds. i guess she couldn't understand my reason behind needing another one. i didn't even mention it because it wasn't a big deal and i didn't want anyone to make a big deal over water.\n\nbut also, i took some points off service, because it took my sever a long time to refill my water, once i had actually finished it. it took her maybe 4 or 5 minutes to check on us, after we finished eating too. we just wanted a box to pack up leftovers. when she did stop back by, we asked for the box, she quickly picked one up, dropped it off and walked away. she came back around maybe 3 or 4 minutes later and told us to pay upfront. we were just sitting there, waiting for her to come back by so that we could pay and leave. i'm glad she did stop back by because we probably would have been sitting there for a while.\n\nalthough i'm in love with the potatoes and muffins, i probably won't go back because the rest of the food was just average.",

            "review - egg & i\n\n\nif i were looking for a reason to move to las vegas the egg & i would be the reason.  funny thing to say when speaking about a location that has something to offer for everyone and a few of the best dining experiences that money can buy. \n\nthe egg & i is simply a great place to enjoy breakfast and that's because it is simple.  everyone who knows me knows that i love breakfast and can almost always be found at my favorite breakfast place in corona, ca every saturday morning without fail.\n\nthe egg & i is a place that locals visit and has a lot of regulars.  it's located in a small strip mall that is way off the strip.    the interior is what you would expect in a diner that intended for locals.  it's a large open space with lots of tables and country-ish decorations on the walls\n\nthe menu is consists of many different egg dishes, pancakes, waffles and some incredible looking skillets.  on my first visit i tried the works omelet, which as you would expect has a list of ingredients including <mark>Bacon, Ham, Sausage</mark>, ham, onions, tomatoes, green bell peppers, mushrooms, cheese and <mark>2oz. Sour Cream</mark>.  it is served with <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark> and a choice <mark>Side of Toast</mark> or a house made <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>.    \n\nthe omelet was cooked to perfection.  it was served hot, light and fluffy. the cacophony of ingredients came together to form the perfect symphony of <mark>Deli</mark>.   my preference for breakfast potatoes is <mark>Hash Browns</mark>.  i love them!  the <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark> were a treat and a nice departure from the hash brown rut i'd been in.  the high point of the meal was however was the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>(s).   they serve one almost like an appetizer when sit down before you order.  you get a free one with a yelp check in.   it told our waitress, chance (awesome las vegas name) how much i liked them and she sent me home with a couple of extra.  bless her!  i'm not a huge fan of <mark>Banana</mark>.  in fact i hate everything about them but the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> here changed my mind.  it's worth a trip to egg & i just for muffins.\n\nto summarize, great food, fun local ambience, extremely friendly staff.  i'd repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat...", 
            "we drove up and saw a horde of people waiting to be seated.. thats how you know foods on point! when i checked in at the front desk, i realized no one was sitting outside(it was like 50 degrees maybe thats why lol) so i told them we dont mind! even though it was effin cold! coffee warmed you up anyways so its okay, we ordered 2 <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark> plates and some blue berry pancakes, the steak plates were <mark>Deli</mark> i was so full i skipped lunch and had dinner at night lol! the pancakes were good very filling!! overall this place is good, and the best part was when your ready to pay just go up to the front desk! last but not least those <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> are the best!!!!!! make sure to try them with a yelp checkin its free!!",

            "1st visit, good choice yelpers! sausage & biscuits were good, short on sausage in the gravy so they brought out a complimentary plate of sausage to take care of that, very thoughtful & much appreciated. our waitress amanda was very sweet & intent on making sure we were enjoying our breakfast. fiesta skillet was perfect, great flavors, not too spicy w a lot of cheese, green chiles, & perfectly cooked eggs.\nall those raving about the banana wal<mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> were right, it is <mark>Deli</mark>, dark brown (molasses added?), moist and perfectly cooked. almost glad my wife is allergic to walnuts so i could eat it all! very large portions, we ate a little more than 1/2 of each of our meals & were more than full. \nway better than the casinos & a lot better value. enjoy!!", 
            "first things first, i have to recognize our server, amanda. she was, by far, the best server i've ever had. i'll be asking for her section next time we come here. my husband and i decided to come here, last minute, after seeing a picture of their grandma's biscuits and gravy on google. while neither of us ordered that specific dish, we did order some <mark>Deli</mark> meals. my husband ordered the <mark>Original <mark>Cabo Breakfast Burrito</mark></mark> which was absolutely amazing. i ordered the <mark>Chicken Enchilada</mark> skillet. oh my goodness... so good! i already can't wait for our next visit to egg & i!!!",

            "this was probably the best spot we hit on a recent trip to vegas.  it's always a good sign when a place is packed midweek. \nwe were sat immediately and there was no wait to receive drinks and menus. \nour waitress was chance and quite honestly one of the best servers i've had in a long time. she knew her menu and was open to giving suggestions. she was also very attentive and upbeat in general. during a pretty good breakfast rush, mind you!\nfirstly, as i said before, it's busy. but you never have to flag down a waitress or ask when your order is coming. there's a little sign on the table which lets you flip between a happy egg and a frowny egg. if the frowny egg is showing, the waitress/waiter is supposed to help you right away. i never had to use this sign because the service was so prompt. \nfirst thing i loved was the bottomless cup of coffee. you're given a full thermos pitcher of coffee all for your table and there's plenty of sugar (or substitutes) <mark>Waffle with Fruit and Whipped Cream</mark> at hand. \ni usually ask for a recommendation on what to order when traveling and chance was eager to help. she told me about the chile relleno benedict and said that it's not normally on the menu (special days only) but that it really was a must try. honestly, i'm not huge on chile relleno but hey she seemed enthusiastic and i went ahead and ordered it. \nit was amazing. and it should be an everyday menu item. i'll go into both dishes and what was so awesome about them below. \nchile relleno benedict:\nwow. the dish was amazing. benedicts make just about anything better but this was no joke. really well thought out and balanced. first thing i noticed was that the eggs were perfectly poached. the whites were soft but not slimey or runny. there was zero cooked yoke. it was warm and ran smooth just the way god intended. \ni don't know what was breaded in the dish but it was either the chile itself or the thinly sliced (and tender as all hell) <mark>Chicken Breast</mark>. the breading was really what made the dish i think. it added just enough saltiness that i didn't need to add salt or pepper to my breakfast. i always add salt and pepper (unless i get chicken <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark>) and that was a pleasant surprise. the chile and <mark>The Crazy Chicken</mark> were topped off with the poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. there were home fries on the side which also needed no seasoning beside what was already there but honestly i would have been ok just eating the chile relleno benedict. it was really that good. \nmy gf ordered the <mark>Grilled Veggie Pesto Sandwich</mark> with <mark>Habla Diablo Cajun Seasoned Fries</mark>. i didn't try the sandwich itself but she said the bread was very tender and the pesto was really tasty. i did sneak a few fries however and loved them. thinly cut shoestring style potatoes covered in seasoning. another instance where salt was not necessary. really they would have been fine without ketchup. \ni fully intend on visiting this place every time i head to las vegas and can't say enough good things about it. thank you chance for the awesome recommendation and thank you egg & i for turning out exceptional food and service at a great price!"

            "this was a very impressive breakfast restaurant!\n\ni came here with 4 of my other friends while we were in vegas and all of us had a positive experience.  both the food and the service were \"egg-cellent.\"  \n\nanyhow, i try to be a little bit pun-ny at times and this is one of them.\n\nfirst off, the service was great.  we came in around noon time and the restaurant was mostly crowded but our group of 5 was seated as soon as we walked in the door.  we were greeted by the hostess with a big smile and much enthusiasm.  what's interesting is that their menu is in the form of a newspaper, which is very creative and something i've never seen before.  our waitress, amanda, was very energetic and did a wonderful job.  she was very helpful with her recommendations, very quick, and very genuinely friendly.  i love it when the people at a restaurant enjoy what they do.  \n\nas for the food, my friends and i ordered different dishes but everyone enjoyed their meal.  i ordered a hawaiian dish that came with rice, eggs, and spam.  you could also have your choice of sausage.  now, i know it sounds plain from the description but it was probably the best breakfast of those items i\"ve ever had.  everything was prepared perfectly and also presented well.  i had <mark>Two Eggs</mark> that were made over-well, hot and juicy sausage that was perfectly seasoned and two mounds of perfectly scooped rice.  also, before our dishes were served, we were given complimentary appetizers in the form of a <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>.  it was the best <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> i've ever tasted because it came out warm and seemed to be freshly made.\n\nmy other friends ordered the country fried <mark>Chicken Breast</mark> skillet as well as a turkey sandwich that they happily shared with me.  i got to try it and it was just as excellent tasting as my dish.  the portion sizes were generous and all of us were stuffed by the end of the meal.\n\nwhat i found interesting was that they had a little sign in the shape of an egg that had two sides.  it was used to signal our waitress if we were in need of some help.  one side of the sign had a smiling egg and another had an egg with a sad face.  apparently you are supposed to flip it to the sad facing egg side if you needed service.  anyhow, the last part might not make sense until you actually go there...but it beats any breakfast place on the strip that i've been too!\n\nlastly, the price is extremely affordable.  an entire meal for one person was about $9-$10 before tax and tip.  i sort of wish they had one in orange county but i'll definitely come back here with friends the next time i visit vegas.", 
            "this was probably the best spot we hit on a recent trip to vegas.  it's always a good sign when a place is packed midweek. \nwe were sat immediately and there was no wait to receive drinks and menus. \nour waitress was chance and quite honestly one of the best servers i've had in a long time. she knew her menu and was open to giving suggestions. she was also very attentive and upbeat in general. during a pretty good breakfast rush, mind you!\nfirstly, as i said before, it's busy. but you never have to flag down a waitress or ask when your order is coming. there's a little sign on the table which lets you flip between a happy egg and a frowny egg. if the frowny egg is showing, the waitress/waiter is supposed to help you right away. i never had to use this sign because the service was so prompt. \nfirst thing i loved was the bottomless cup of coffee. you're given a full thermos pitcher of coffee all for your table and there's plenty of sugar (or substitutes) <mark>Waffle with Fruit and Whipped Cream</mark> at hand. \ni usually ask for a recommendation on what to order when traveling and chance was eager to help. she told me about the chile relleno benedict and said that it's not normally on the menu (special days only) but that it really was a must try. honestly, i'm not huge on chile relleno but hey she seemed enthusiastic and i went ahead and ordered it. \nit was amazing. and it should be an everyday menu item. i'll go into both dishes and what was so awesome about them below. \nchile relleno benedict:\nwow. the dish was amazing. benedicts make just about anything better but this was no joke. really well thought out and balanced. first thing i noticed was that the eggs were perfectly poached. the whites were soft but not slimey or runny. there was zero cooked yoke. it was warm and ran smooth just the way god intended. \ni don't know what was breaded in the dish but it was either the chile itself or the thinly sliced (and tender as all hell) <mark>Chicken Breast</mark>. the breading was really what made the dish i think. it added just enough saltiness that i didn't need to add salt or pepper to my breakfast. i always add salt and pepper (unless i get chicken <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark>) and that was a pleasant surprise. the chile and <mark>The Crazy Chicken</mark> were topped off with the poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. there were home fries on the side which also needed no seasoning beside what was already there but honestly i would have been ok just eating the chile relleno benedict. it was really that good. \nmy gf ordered the <mark>Grilled Veggie Pesto Sandwich</mark> with <mark>Habla Diablo Cajun Seasoned Fries</mark>. i didn't try the sandwich itself but she said the bread was very tender and the pesto was really tasty. i did sneak a few fries however and loved them. thinly cut shoestring style potatoes covered in seasoning. another instance where salt was not necessary. really they would have been fine without ketchup. \ni fully intend on visiting this place every time i head to las vegas and can't say enough good things about it. thank you chance for the awesome recommendation and thank you egg & i for turning out exceptional food and service at a great price!",

            "ok...so the food here is awesome! i would give it more stars if the customer service had been better; the egg & i getting 2 stars is over the most ridiculous thing! a couple weeks ago we went there and i have been there a lot, i enjoy their food. my friend and i both ordered sandwiches; we asked to skip the bacon and bread for a healthier meal of course. we all know even though you skip stuff off the meal ordered, you end up paying full price which is fine. well we asked if we both add avocado to both our meals in place of bread and bacon considering those items are priced higher. after going back and forth with our server who claimed it was against their policy to sub, a veggie/fruit item for a meat/bread item, she brought out the manager. the manager ex<mark>Plain</mark> that they have two different accounts where they order meats/breads from and where they order <mark>Veggie</mark>/fruit from and they could not, in fact they refused to sub it. we got over it, added the avocado and enjoyed our meal. it wasn't about having to spend the money for it, it was the principal. i bring a lot of friends and family to this place, therefore i expected them to sub it out for me because in the end, it was actually more cost effective for them. i thought it was silly and ridiculous, she actually looked slightly stupid for coming out and to explain the reasoning as to why we couldn't sub it. i actually laughed. so although the food might be at least 4 stars, their service and policies were not and i doubt it was worth it for them to do that to my friend and i earning this some-what bad review. there are a lot of great breakfast spots in las vegas so i will hunt down one to take people where they don't fret over silly substitutions on sandwiches. i am very open-minded and understanding; in fact i have ran a restaurant for yrs in the past and know when it is worth it to suck it up and do the substitution.",

            "i absolutely love this place!! i always come here whenever i'm in vegas. the service is excellent and super fast, it literally took 5-10 mins for our food to come! my favorite is the <mark>Works Veggie Benny</mark>. the potatoes are so <mark>Deli</mark>! definitely recommend coming here, if you haven't been here, you're missing out!!", 
            "this is a great breakfast option off the strip. took my family here for breakfast recently and had enjoyable experience. \n\nit's about a 10 minute drive from main casinos, located in strip mall. popular dining spot for locals and gets packed on weekends. luckily, we arrived early before the breakfast rush and were seated immediately. good thing too, 20 minutes after a bus load of people arrived and place was full.\n\ncountry style atmosphere and d\\u00e9cor provide the perfect backdrop for their food. both indoor and outdoor patio seating is available. old-fashioned breakfasts are the specialty here, including huge omelet platters, pancakes, eggs benedict and a large selection of house specialties. prices are reasonable and large portions. i highly recommend trying their famous <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>. omg, so good! super moist and the flavor profile is off the charts. i got mine free with my yelp check-in. you can also substitute the toast that comes with your breakfast entr\\u00e9es for a muffin. \n\nwe ordered \"the works\" scramble, <mark><mark>Fresh Veggie</mark></mark> omelet and the hawaiian breakfast spam and eggs. everything was fantastic! served in large skillet, the scramble was yummy. it's loaded with sausage, ham, bacon, onions, tomatoes, green bell peppers and mushrooms, served with <mark>Hash Browns</mark> and topped with the fluffiest scramble eggs. enough for 2, i literally devoured everything and no regrets. i loved the taste and texture of the <mark>Hash Browns</mark>, lightly crisp and tender. i usually prefer shredded kind, but this was equally nice. of course, who doesn't love spam and eggs for breakfast? simple hawaiian-pinoy breakfast done well here, served with steam rice. just the way us locals love them.\n\nmost of the time we usually dine along the strip because it's convenient. egg and i was definitely worth the drive and waking up early for. service was excellent too. our server did a phenomenal job, friendly and refilled our coffee regularly. still thinking about those <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>. looking forward to coming back."

            "i really enjoy breakfast food but going to breakfast eateries, they just give so much food.  \n\nanyway gotta eat breakfast so we came here.  typical breakfast shop.  i ordered the fiesta skillet which was a layer of their ranch potatoes topped with a mixture of green <mark>Chili</mark>, onions, and salsa.  on top of that was a layer of melted cheese and <mark>Two Eggs</mark> over-easy.  the skillet was accompanied by two slices of wheat toast and two slices of fruit.  it was pretty tasty.  i really like the ranch potatoes, eggs were cooked correctly, no brown spots and yolks were runny.\n\nthere were three different types of <mark><mark>2oz. Habla Diablo Original Salsa</mark> or Habla Diablo Tomatillo Salsa or Homemade Enchilada Sauce</mark> on the table original, chipotle, and verde.  so if you need a little spice in your breakfast you can choose your pain.  well not really since none of them are that spicy.  \n\noverall  i enjoyed breakfast.  i have tried other items at their other locations they all taste good.  would definitely be up there on the list of breakfast places to go.", 
            "this was a very impressive breakfast restaurant!\n\ni came here with 4 of my other friends while we were in vegas and all of us had a positive experience.  both the food and the service were \"egg-cellent.\"  \n\nanyhow, i try to be a little bit pun-ny at times and this is one of them.\n\nfirst off, the service was great.  we came in around noon time and the restaurant was mostly crowded but our group of 5 was seated as soon as we walked in the door.  we were greeted by the hostess with a big smile and much enthusiasm.  what's interesting is that their menu is in the form of a newspaper, which is very creative and something i've never seen before.  our waitress, amanda, was very energetic and did a wonderful job.  she was very helpful with her recommendations, very quick, and very genuinely friendly.  i love it when the people at a restaurant enjoy what they do.  \n\nas for the food, my friends and i ordered different dishes but everyone enjoyed their meal.  i ordered a hawaiian dish that came with rice, eggs, and spam.  you could also have your choice of sausage.  now, i know it sounds plain from the description but it was probably the best breakfast of those items i\"ve ever had.  everything was prepared perfectly and also presented well.  i had <mark>Two Eggs</mark> that were made over-well, hot and juicy sausage that was perfectly seasoned and two mounds of perfectly scooped rice.  also, before our dishes were served, we were given complimentary appetizers in the form of a <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>.  it was the best <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> i've ever tasted because it came out warm and seemed to be freshly made.\n\nmy other friends ordered the country fried <mark>Chicken Breast</mark> skillet as well as a turkey sandwich that they happily shared with me.  i got to try it and it was just as excellent tasting as my dish.  the portion sizes were generous and all of us were stuffed by the end of the meal.\n\nwhat i found interesting was that they had a little sign in the shape of an egg that had two sides.  it was used to signal our waitress if we were in need of some help.  one side of the sign had a smiling egg and another had an egg with a sad face.  apparently you are supposed to flip it to the sad facing egg side if you needed service.  anyhow, the last part might not make sense until you actually go there...but it beats any breakfast place on the strip that i've been too!\n\nlastly, the price is extremely affordable.  an entire meal for one person was about $9-$10 before tax and tip.  i sort of wish they had one in orange county but i'll definitely come back here with friends the next time i visit vegas.", 
            "awesome place!!  we were undecided between the egg & i and another place we saw on yelp with great reviews.  we'd gotten rid of our rental car <mark>Homemade Soup of the Day</mark> before so we'd have to take a taxi to either.  at the spur of the moment, we picked the egg & i.  yay for us for picking an awesome joint.  we waited only about 10-15 minutes before being seated.  once seated, we flipped through the newspaper menu.  i'd read so much about the muffins, we ordered a couple to start our meal.  they were <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>.  we both ate the entire thing.  so good.  and with a great cup of coffee, we could've stopped right there.  but we didn't!  since breakfast is not my favorite meal, i love it when i find a place that has lunch style breakfast.  there were so many options i had to choose from.  i was stuck between the stuffed pepper and the <mark>Taco</mark> rancheros.  i chose the <mark>Taco</mark> rancheros.  it was a tortilla topped <mark>Flour or Corn Tortilla Layered with <mark>Refried Beans</mark></mark>, ground hamburger, <mark>Two Eggs</mark> (which i got fried) and topped <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> and <mark>2oz. Sour Cream</mark>.  i would've liked some salsa with it but it didn't need it.  my partner got the garlic mashed potato omelet.  it was enormous.  she could only eat half of it to which our server, karla suggested getting the half order next time!  shoot, we didn't know you could do a half order.  but, my partner said she wouldn't gotten a half anyway because the portions would be all wrong.  we both loved the old bay <mark><mark>Habla Diablo Cajun Seasoned Fries</mark></mark> potatoes.  as we waddled out, it was great that the front desk called a cab for us.  very nice.  oh, and there's a little egg face on the table that you can flip revealing a sad egg face if you happen to need anything.  that's a brilliant idea!  karla was awesome and if we lived in the area, it would be our go to place!",

            "to start off, this place has been on my list of stuff to try for a couple of months solely based on the name.. and after reading through the rave yelp reviews my expectations for the quality of food slowly started to grow. \n\ni planned to head back to socal early this morning and wanted to be the first one in the restaurant. i arrived at around 5:45 am and fidgeted in my rental car while checking the \"closed sign.\" suddenly another car pulled up next to me, the driver walked out and headed straight into the restaurant - the sign was magically on open. wtf... \n\nthe hostess/waitress was so friendly (and at the buttcrack <mark>Homemade Soup of the Day</mark> thats pretty impressive) that i think this partly made me enjoy not only the food but much of the rest of my day.\n\nthe front lobby is decorated with articles and reviews and pictures of eggs in action shots which i found pretty amusing (sometimes it doesnt take much) but the main eating area is pretty diner-y so i kind of zoned out till the food arrived. ordered the fender bender egg crepe with avocado and sprouts and something else in it and it came out surrounded by a mountain of <mark>Deli</mark> <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark> and the softest, freshest muffin i've ever had. the egg crepe is in a league of its own compared with any kind of omelet you can get at ihop or denny's or some drive by diner. \n\ni sat there for a good half hour savoring the meal. at the end it was all gone - the muffin, potatoes, egg crepe and the bucket of coffee. for the amount of food i had, it was very very light and felt quite healthy. i didn't get hit by the food coma train on the way home which is a big plus.\n\nas a heavy consumer of all things chicken, i recommend this place to everyone. unless you don't have taste buds...then go to your local diner where your $4.99 omelet brings you to orgasm every sunday morning. if you have taste buds - go eat here. pay a little extra. its worth it. i would guess that this is the best \"cheap\" breakfast i've ever had.",

            "this is currently my favorite place for breakfast in town and i have a feeling it will stay that way! they have a huge menu and i want to come back many times to try all of the tasty-looking options.\n\ni had a gigantic omelet full of avocado and bacon. it doesn't get any richer or more fattening than that but it's okay because there's no way i could have finished that thing (despite its yumminess). my husband got this ridiculous <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> monstrosity- stuffed not with marscapone cheese, or some fruity filling, or whatever else you'd expect <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> to be stuffed with, but with eggs and sausage! it was hugely filling but <mark>Deli</mark>.\n\nthey have good coffee, too, and the prices are right, and the heavily <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark> are probably loaded with sodium but who cares because they're <mark>Deli</mark>.",

            "my family and i decided to try this place on the morning we were headed home from vegas. we got it off of the triple d website and have had great experiences in the past so it seemed like a great choice. while it was not a terrible experience, it was certainly a disappointing one and here is why:\n\nmy mother and i both have a food allergy to monosodium glutamate more commonly known as msg. it is a flavor enhancer/ preservative often found in foods like doritos, cheetos, and all of those other junk foods you shouldn't be eating (but let's face it, sometimes we just need some junk food). for me, a little is ok, but my mother can't eat it at all. \n\nwhen we sat down at the table, we asked if they used msg more out of habit than anything else; why would a breakfast spot need a preservative? our waitress, who was very nice, informed us that it was in most of the food, but not the eggs. my mother, who had originally decided on the highly rated chicken <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark>, had to change her order. both of chose the <mark>Sunrise Mountain</mark> and decided to order fruit rather than take our chances with the <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark> that came with 90% of the breakfast options.\n\nwhen the food came out it looked <mark>Deli</mark>, but one bite changed our opinion. while it was plentiful, it was bland. even the blanket of cheese over the top could not help it.\n\nmy father, who does not share my msg allergy, ordered a skillet. mom and i both took a bite of the <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark> from his plate and they were <mark>Deli</mark>. crunchy and flavorful, i would have loved to be able to eat them, but they were covered in stomach pain inducing msg. and the only option besides the potatoes was fruit (which was very nice, but did nothing for the dish itself).\n\ni gave this place two stars because the service was good and the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> <mark>Deli</mark>. now if only they could learn how to cook with flavor rather than chemicals...", 
            "arrived worrying about too much salt and msg (via previous yelp reviews). but right away i knew i'd be disappointed when i learned that they didn't have real maple syrup for their pancakes. its regular customer must be some one who likes the artificial sugar syrup they serve at cheap restaurants. it wasn't even an option for an additional charge.\n\nto be fair, my kids didn't care their mickey mouse pancakes came with sugar syrup. and the prices for everything were reasonable. while i didn't find their eggs benedict too salty (i am not salt sensitive), the msg in the hollindaise was palpable and the famous <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark> were \"meh\" (and i like spicy!). on the plus side, their <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> were <mark>Deli</mark>, as advertised.", 
            "the <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark> are great, especially crispy. toast is nice and chewy. good choices",

            "at a little before 7am on a sunday morning, the place was almost deserted.  this was a little worrisome, but we soon realized that this said far more about the vegas population than it did about the quality of the breakfast.  here's the best recommendation i can give about the food: i came back for breakfast the next day!  and we would have come back the third morning except that we had to be on the road before they opened at 6am!\n\nwe got off to a good start.  when the waitress found out this was our first visit, she brought us a warm <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> to try.  it's a house special and well worth getting.\n\nwhen you open up the newspaper-like menu, the first thing you'll notice is the words habla diablo in blazing red appearing in the descriptions of at least half the dishes.  my wife wanted the <mark>Spinach Benny</mark>, but was concerned about the <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark> because the name sounded spicy and she's a self-proclaimed spice wimp.  the waitress ex<mark>Plain</mark> that it wasn't spicy at all, that habla diablo is the owner's side company and he had just redone the menu to emphasize his products.  my wife went ahead with her <mark>Spinach Benny</mark> and i got the <mark>Loco Moco</mark>, with an extra side of the <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark>.  (it turns out that the habla diablo seasoning is a lot like lawry's seasoned salt.)\n\nmy wife really liked her <mark>Spinach Benny</mark>, but didn't care for the potatoes.  (but she's not a big fan of breakfast potatoes to begin with.)  i liked the potatoes and finished most of hers in addition to mine.  plus the <mark>Loco Moco</mark> was the best i've had on the mainland!\n\nthe next day, i came back on my own, but with orders to bring back something good to my wife in the hotel.  this time i had the biscuits & gravy, which were great.  but, fair warning, they were pretty salty -- well within my tolerance, but if you are sensitive to salt, you might want to steer clear.   then i picked out the <mark>California Crepe</mark> for my wife, which the waitress was happy to pack up for me to take back.  i asked to substitute some fruit for the <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark>, and she packed up a huge container of fresh fruit.  my wife loved the <mark>California Crepe</mark>, except for one thing -- it was way too big for her to finish!", 
            "this breakfast joint is a must have for anyone visiting vegas. when i go on trips that involve vegas, i've started planning the itinerary to let me go to eggs & i for breakfast. it is a slight trek from the strip, but totally worth it.\n\nfor my most recent visit i got the <mark>Ensenada Burrito</mark> and my wife got the banana bread <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark>. the <mark>Ensenada Burrito</mark> was a recommendation from my server amanda and i'm so glad i listened to her. the burrito was <mark>Deli</mark>. tasty meat and eggs in the burrito and topped with a healthy amount of cheese. plus, it came with a side of their potatoes (what they call <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark>) which are some of my favorite breakfast potatoes. so good. my wife's <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> was sweet and <mark>Deli</mark>. the service was top notch. amanda (our server) was cheerful and seemed genuinely excited to help us figure out what to eat.\n\noh, and they have this black/yellow egg heads on each table to notify the staff if you need help (black smiley face = you're ok, yellow frowny face = need assistant). the staff watches this like hawks. each time we flipped it, a staff member (not just your server) is right there to help. we were in a rush and needed the check... flipped it... 5 seconds later a staff member was there... 30 seconds later our server gave us our check. it was awesome.\n\noverall, i can't say enough about this place. it is one of the best breakfast places in vegas (if not the best). the wait is quick, the service is great, and the food is top notch.",

            "i wanted to try something new for breakfast. i had no idea where to go or what to eat. i came to yelp like i normally do. mostly everyone had something positive to say about this place, so my friend and i packed up and headed 15 minutes away to get some good breakfast.\n\nwhen we arrived, we could tell that it was going to be a long wait and a headache. i sent my friend in, ahead of me, so that i could park. as soon as she walked in, she called me. she said that the place was a mess and she was going to have to come out and wait the 15 minutes it was going to take to be seated. nevertheless, the hostess pointed out some empty benches, around the corner. so, i walked in to wait.\n\nupon entering, i was discouraged because a lot of people were standing around waiting. i just knew it was going to take 30+ minutes. surprisingly, it only took 15 minutes before we were called and seated.\n\nthe place is really small and packed to capacity, so i was thankful that we got to sit around the corner where there were only about 4-5 tables. we had plenty space.\n\nthe server came around fast to take our drink order. she was quick to bring our drinks back too. she asked us if we were ready to order and we said, \"no, we're looking at yelp pictures and we need some more time.\" i did ask about the stuff <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> dish that someone shared on yelp. she smiled and pointed it out and said that it's a popular dish. then she left and took orders for people that was around us.\n\nas soon as she walked away, we decided what we wanted, but it took her about 6 minutes to make eye contact again. when she did stop back by, she asked if we were still looking at pictures or if we were ready to order. we went ahead and ordered. it totally slipped my mind to check in and get a free muffin for myself. the waitress said, \"you were on yelp, did you check in to get the free muffin?\" i was happy she reminded me to do that.\n\nshe came back a couple minutes later and brought 2 muffins. i don't even like <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> but i took it anyways because it was free. i took a bite of it and fell in love. it was so warm and yummy lol. my friend got emotional lol. she said it reminded her of childhood, when her mother used to make them. they were just <mark>Deli</mark>.\n\nabout 12-15 minutes later, our food started to roll out. i order the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> with eggs, cheese and sausage on it. it also came with <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark>. it looked incredible. my friend ordered the 2 <mark>Seasoned Center Cut Pork Chops</mark> that came with 2 eggs, the muffin, that she had already ate, and the <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark>. her's looked <mark>Deli</mark> too.\n\ni love potatoes so i ate those first. i put ketchup all over them and had a ball. my friend didn't like hers, because they were kind of crunchy, so she gave them to me. i put ketchup on them and finished them off too lol.\n\nnext, i started in on my <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> sandwiches. i didn't like the sandwiches. the sausages, eggs <mark>Cheese <mark>Ham, Bacon or Sausage <mark>Mushroom and Cheese</mark></mark></mark> didn't have much flavor. i thought i made a big mistake. being that i'm so smart, i thought to scrape the sausages and eggs off the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> and season the filling myself. i did, and it was 90% better. i ate the filling separately, and ever so often, i would dip the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> in the warm syrup that came with my food.\n\nmy friend said that the <mark>Seasoned Center Cut Pork Chops</mark> were just okay. they were really thin, for sure. i don't know why, but we were expecting some big juicy chops vs the breakfast chops. i wanted to taste the chops for myself, so she took a bite of mine and i took a bite of hers. they tasted as if onions were the main and secondary seasoning. she was right. they were just okay. she did enjoy my mixture of filling and seasoning though.\n\nthe good thing is, we got really full and still had a bunch of food left. i'm sure it has something to do with a humongous portion of potatoes we got and the muffin we were served in the beginning.\n\nthe service was like a 3/5 because there was a little piece of hair in my water when the server dropped it off. i asked for another one and she just stared at my full cup for like 10 seconds. i guess she couldn't understand my reason behind needing another one. i didn't even mention it because it wasn't a big deal and i didn't want anyone to make a big deal over water.\n\nbut also, i took some points off service, because it took my sever a long time to refill my water, once i had actually finished it. it took her maybe 4 or 5 minutes to check on us, after we finished eating too. we just wanted a box to pack up leftovers. when she did stop back by, we asked for the box, she quickly picked one up, dropped it off and walked away. she came back around maybe 3 or 4 minutes later and told us to pay upfront. we were just sitting there, waiting for her to come back by so that we could pay and leave. i'm glad she did stop back by because we probably would have been sitting there for a while.\n\nalthough i'm in love with the potatoes and muffins, i probably won't go back because the rest of the food was just average.",

Sour Cream</mark>.  it is served with <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark> and a choice <mark>Side of Toast</mark> or a house made <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>.    \n\nthe omelet was cooked to perfection.  it was served hot, light and fluffy. the cacophony of ingredients came together to form the perfect symphony of <mark>Deli</mark>.   my preference for breakfast potatoes is <mark>Hash Browns</mark>.  i love them!  the <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark> were a treat and a nice departure from the hash brown rut i'd been in.  the high point of the meal was however was the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>(s).   they serve one almost like an appetizer when sit down before you order.  you get a free one with a yelp check in.   it told our waitress, chance (awesome las vegas name) how much i liked them and she sent me home with a couple of extra.  bless her!  i'm not a huge fan of <mark>Banana</mark>.  in fact i hate everything about them but the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> here changed my mind.  it's worth a trip to egg & i just for muffins.\n\nto summarize, great food, fun local ambience, extremely friendly staff.  i'd repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat..."

            "i hate to do it, but i need to knock this down just one star. every time i'm here, while the service is great and friendly, the place is just packed and i find the breakfast to be lackluster, compared to egg works.\n\nthe seating is pretty crammed, even when you get there early. we're often bumped by servers and patrons as they're making their way to tables.\n\ni also don't love how they *only* have those season-salty potatoes and not fresh <mark>Hash Browns</mark>. they have them, but only those frozen hashbrown patties. meh. i like homestyle potatoes, but these really seem like they're dumped out of an ore-ida bag.\n\nthe last time we went, i asked for my poached eggs well in my eggs benedict and they came back *very* runny both times. i can handle a little runny, but these were like, runny to the point of being almost chilly inside the yolk.  it's a texture thing and it skeeves me. i know i'm not the only one. \n\nthey were really great when i sent it back the first time, but the second time, i felt like a total pain in the ass and was embarrassed having to ask them to redo it, even though it wasn't my fault. they were gracious and took it off our bill and the 2nd time they made it, the eggs were cooked well enough. (yes, we tipped on the full cost of the bill.) \n\ni also am not wild about how they completely drown their eggs benedict in hollandaise to the point you can't even see the bottom and the english muffin gets really soggy. \n\nmy boyfriend's blueberry pancakes weren't that awesome either.  kind of spongey and flavorless.\n\nfor the hype this location gets, it wouldn't be my first choice. but i know it's popular and beloved, so if someone else wanted to go, i'd go, but otherwise, i'd recommend one of their other locations.",

            "my husband & i visited this place once while we were visiting las vegas & after eating there we wished we had known about that place sooner so we could've had breakfast there every morning while there. the second we walked in we were greeted by the hostess & given a table right away (it was really early so it wasn't that crowded yet) and a couple of mins later our server amanda greeted us & took our drink order. the menu had a huge selection of items and after minutes deciding my husband ordered the <mark>Ciabatta Breakfast Sandwich</mark> & i ordered the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> <mark>Ciabatta Breakfast Sandwich</mark>     (both sandwich came with a side of potatoes) and we were pleased with our selections. not only were the portions big but they were <mark>Deli</mark>! their potatoes are super good too, my husband isn't a potato guy he prefers <mark>Hash Browns</mark> but he really liked those potatoes. a good restaurant with good food is nothing if they don't have good service & our server amanda was great! she was very attentive, she made us feel like locals which we loved because when traveling we don't like to be treated like tourists. over all, i give this place 5 stars because of their <mark>Deli</mark> food & great costumer service! when visiting las vegas, this is must try spot!!!", 
            "i was really enthusiastic to try this place, based on the good yelp reviews.  what i found was a nice coffee shop.  the service was very attentive, but the food was mediocre.  maybe we missed the point, because neither my wife nor i wanted a breakfast consisting of \"hot sauce with something under it,\" which seems to be the specialty of the house.  so, for example, we both ordered ordinary <mark>Hash Browns</mark> instead of the potatoes \"diablo\" (or something like that).  the <mark>Hash Browns</mark> we got were clearly pre-frozen patties - not quite as good as the ones you get a trader joe's.  my <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark>, and my wife's eggs benedict were very ordinary.  and the prices were at the higher end of the reasonable range.\n\ni can't see any reason for us to go back to this place.  for now, our three favorite breakfasts on the west side remain the black bear diner, hash house a go go, and the buffet at orleans.",

            "really not that great of food. the seasoned <mark>Hash Browns</mark> were pretty good, but definitely very salty. portion sizes were absurd. my friend from korea said everything was too salty, the menu was way too big, and they gave us way too much food. he really didn't like it at all. i felt everything was just ok personally. the server was pretty clueless. overall i felt i made a mistake taking them here, and provided them a negative experience with the us. wouldn't recommend it.", 
            "this is a great breakfast option off the strip. took my family here for breakfast recently and had enjoyable experience. \n\nit's about a 10 minute drive from main casinos, located in strip mall. popular dining spot for locals and gets packed on weekends. luckily, we arrived early before the breakfast rush and were seated immediately. good thing too, 20 minutes after a bus load of people arrived and place was full.\n\ncountry style atmosphere and d\\u00e9cor provide the perfect backdrop for their food. both indoor and outdoor patio seating is available. old-fashioned breakfasts are the specialty here, including huge omelet platters, pancakes, eggs benedict and a large selection of house specialties. prices are reasonable and large portions. i highly recommend trying their famous <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>. omg, so good! super moist and the flavor profile is off the charts. i got mine free with my yelp check-in. you can also substitute the toast that comes with your breakfast entr\\u00e9es for a muffin. \n\nwe ordered \"the works\" scramble, <mark><mark>Fresh Veggie</mark></mark> omelet and the hawaiian breakfast spam and eggs. everything was fantastic! served in large skillet, the scramble was yummy. it's loaded with sausage, ham, bacon, onions, tomatoes, green bell peppers and mushrooms, served with <mark>Hash Browns</mark> and topped with the fluffiest scramble eggs. enough for 2, i literally devoured everything and no regrets. i loved the taste and texture of the <mark>Hash Browns</mark>, lightly crisp and tender. i usually prefer shredded kind, but this was equally nice. of course, who doesn't love spam and eggs for breakfast? simple hawaiian-pinoy breakfast done well here, served with steam rice. just the way us locals love them.\n\nmost of the time we usually dine along the strip because it's convenient. egg and i was definitely worth the drive and waking up early for. service was excellent too. our server did a phenomenal job, friendly and refilled our coffee regularly. still thinking about those <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>. looking forward to coming back.",

Sour Cream</mark>.  it is served with <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark> and a choice <mark>Side of Toast</mark> or a house made <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>.    \n\nthe omelet was cooked to perfection.  it was served hot, light and fluffy. the cacophony of ingredients came together to form the perfect symphony of <mark>Deli</mark>.   my preference for breakfast potatoes is <mark>Hash Browns</mark>.  i love them!  the <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark> were a treat and a nice departure from the hash brown rut i'd been in.  the high point of the meal was however was the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>(s).   they serve one almost like an appetizer when sit down before you order.  you get a free one with a yelp check in.   it told our waitress, chance (awesome las vegas name) how much i liked them and she sent me home with a couple of extra.  bless her!  i'm not a huge fan of <mark>Banana</mark>.  in fact i hate everything about them but the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> here changed my mind.  it's worth a trip to egg & i just for muffins.\n\nto summarize, great food, fun local ambience, extremely friendly staff.  i'd repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat..."

Sour Cream</mark>.  i would've liked some salsa with it but it didn't need it.  my partner got the garlic mashed potato omelet.  it was enormous.  she could only eat half of it to which our server, karla suggested getting the half order next time!  shoot, we didn't know you could do a half order.  but, my partner said she wouldn't gotten a half anyway because the portions would be all wrong.  we both loved the old bay <mark><mark>Habla Diablo Cajun Seasoned Fries</mark></mark> potatoes.  as we waddled out, it was great that the front desk called a cab for us.  very nice.  oh, and there's a little egg face on the table that you can flip revealing a sad egg face if you happen to need anything.  that's a brilliant idea!  karla was awesome and if we lived in the area, it would be our go to place!",

            "this was probably the best spot we hit on a recent trip to vegas.  it's always a good sign when a place is packed midweek. \nwe were sat immediately and there was no wait to receive drinks and menus. \nour waitress was chance and quite honestly one of the best servers i've had in a long time. she knew her menu and was open to giving suggestions. she was also very attentive and upbeat in general. during a pretty good breakfast rush, mind you!\nfirstly, as i said before, it's busy. but you never have to flag down a waitress or ask when your order is coming. there's a little sign on the table which lets you flip between a happy egg and a frowny egg. if the frowny egg is showing, the waitress/waiter is supposed to help you right away. i never had to use this sign because the service was so prompt. \nfirst thing i loved was the bottomless cup of coffee. you're given a full thermos pitcher of coffee all for your table and there's plenty of sugar (or substitutes) <mark>Waffle with Fruit and Whipped Cream</mark> at hand. \ni usually ask for a recommendation on what to order when traveling and chance was eager to help. she told me about the chile relleno benedict and said that it's not normally on the menu (special days only) but that it really was a must try. honestly, i'm not huge on chile relleno but hey she seemed enthusiastic and i went ahead and ordered it. \nit was amazing. and it should be an everyday menu item. i'll go into both dishes and what was so awesome about them below. \nchile relleno benedict:\nwow. the dish was amazing. benedicts make just about anything better but this was no joke. really well thought out and balanced. first thing i noticed was that the eggs were perfectly poached. the whites were soft but not slimey or runny. there was zero cooked yoke. it was warm and ran smooth just the way god intended. \ni don't know what was breaded in the dish but it was either the chile itself or the thinly sliced (and tender as all hell) <mark>Chicken Breast</mark>. the breading was really what made the dish i think. it added just enough saltiness that i didn't need to add salt or pepper to my breakfast. i always add salt and pepper (unless i get chicken <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark>) and that was a pleasant surprise. the chile and <mark>The Crazy Chicken</mark> were topped off with the poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. there were home fries on the side which also needed no seasoning beside what was already there but honestly i would have been ok just eating the chile relleno benedict. it was really that good. \nmy gf ordered the <mark>Grilled Veggie Pesto Sandwich</mark> with <mark>Habla Diablo Cajun Seasoned Fries</mark>. i didn't try the sandwich itself but she said the bread was very tender and the pesto was really tasty. i did sneak a few fries however and loved them. thinly cut shoestring style potatoes covered in seasoning. another instance where salt was not necessary. really they would have been fine without ketchup. \ni fully intend on visiting this place every time i head to las vegas and can't say enough good things about it. thank you chance for the awesome recommendation and thank you egg & i for turning out exceptional food and service at a great price!",

Habla Diablo Original Salsa</mark> or Habla Diablo Tomatillo Salsa or Homemade Enchilada Sauce</mark> on the table original, chipotle, and verde.  so if you need a little spice in your breakfast you can choose your pain.  well not really since none of them are that spicy.  \n\noverall  i enjoyed breakfast.  i have tried other items at their other locations they all taste good.  would definitely be up there on the list of breakfast places to go.",

Habla Diablo Original Salsa</mark>.  more chili powder.\n\nservice was prompt, friendly and efficient.  checkout was easy and they asked for a photo id to accompany the credit card.\n\nby the way, if you remember the horrific accident here a few years ago, they have placed some pretty big rocks between sahara and the patio/dining area.  it would take a vehicle doing over 60 to move them.  then again, the speed limit there is 45 and metro almost always spots you 10mph, so there might still be a risk.\n\nrecommended for breakfast for sure.",

            "review - egg & i\n\n\nif i were looking for a reason to move to las vegas the egg & i would be the reason.  funny thing to say when speaking about a location that has something to offer for everyone and a few of the best dining experiences that money can buy. \n\nthe egg & i is simply a great place to enjoy breakfast and that's because it is simple.  everyone who knows me knows that i love breakfast and can almost always be found at my favorite breakfast place in corona, ca every saturday morning without fail.\n\nthe egg & i is a place that locals visit and has a lot of regulars.  it's located in a small strip mall that is way off the strip.    the interior is what you would expect in a diner that intended for locals.  it's a large open space with lots of tables and country-ish decorations on the walls\n\nthe menu is consists of many different egg dishes, pancakes, waffles and some incredible looking skillets.  on my first visit i tried the works omelet, which as you would expect has a list of ingredients including <mark>Bacon, Ham, Sausage</mark>, ham, onions, tomatoes, green bell peppers, mushrooms, cheese and <mark>2oz. Sour Cream</mark>.  it is served with <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark> and a choice <mark>Side of Toast</mark> or a house made <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>.    \n\nthe omelet was cooked to perfection.  it was served hot, light and fluffy. the cacophony of ingredients came together to form the perfect symphony of <mark>Deli</mark>.   my preference for breakfast potatoes is <mark>Hash Browns</mark>.  i love them!  the <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark> were a treat and a nice departure from the hash brown rut i'd been in.  the high point of the meal was however was the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>(s).   they serve one almost like an appetizer when sit down before you order.  you get a free one with a yelp check in.   it told our waitress, chance (awesome las vegas name) how much i liked them and she sent me home with a couple of extra.  bless her!  i'm not a huge fan of <mark>Banana</mark>.  in fact i hate everything about them but the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> here changed my mind.  it's worth a trip to egg & i just for muffins.\n\nto summarize, great food, fun local ambience, extremely friendly staff.  i'd repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat..."

            "oh yelp, you really are awesome.  finding a restaurant with over 1k+ reviews and a 4.5 rating is pretty rare.  but a tourist destination like vegas is a yelper's paradise.  with so many restaurants and so many reviews, it's hard to make a decision in just where to eat.  luckily, the wife and i are rock, paper and scissor people.  paper won again.  why? because my wife is predictable. \n\nso we walk in to a bustling and crowded restaurant.  we are third in line and we're prepared to wait.  surprisingly, the line moved fast and we were seated within five minutes.  yay!\n\nonce we sat down we felt a bit rushed.  coffee was fresh and prompt but missing half and half to make it happen.  with such a large menu we really needed more time to check things out.  our waitress seemed irritable and terse with her responses so after her second inquiry within two minutes, we settled rather hastily on our meals.  \n\nthe wife chose the original: <mark>Two Eggs</mark>, three strips of bacon and <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark>.  i ordered off the \"specials\" menu at the entrance: potato skins topped with scrambled eggs, chopped bacon with a side of fresh fruit.  \n\nwell, the moment of truth arrived at or table faster than we expected.  my four potato skins were smaller than i expected and less than \"special.\" flavor was nothing to write home about and the fresh fruit was the best part of the meal.  a little more effort could make this meal shine.  i'd suggest some <mark>Bacon & <mark>Sliced Avocado</mark></mark> or fresh guacamole and at least two options of fresh salsa.   nothing like a dried out deep fried potato halves to suck up all the flavor and moisture. \n\nmy wife's meal was also less than stellar.  the <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark> tasted like they had been brined in the great salt lake then tossed at the salt factory.  does the chef here own stock in the seasoning salt?!  someone definitely went ape shit with the seasoning and the over powering flavor ruined her meal and she left most of them behind.  i snuck my fork in there a few times and she wasn't lying.  at least her eggs were cooked perfectly!!  if you order this meal, see if they can skip the seasoning or give it to you on the side.  trust me, your blood pressure will thank me.  the bacon was your average store bought thin slices bulk product.  but hey, that <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> was really good!\n\nluckily the service improved as our meal went on and our waitress eased up a bit.  i could tell that she was stressed and no doubt dealing with all these customers is not an easy task.  i won't mention any names as i don't want to ruin her chances at a free trip to disneyland as stated in their receipt.  :)\n\noverall the egg and i didn't live up to the yelp hype. maybe we just got really unlucky or ordered the wrong things?  guess i'll never know!",

            "i wanted to try something new for breakfast. i had no idea where to go or what to eat. i came to yelp like i normally do. mostly everyone had something positive to say about this place, so my friend and i packed up and headed 15 minutes away to get some good breakfast.\n\nwhen we arrived, we could tell that it was going to be a long wait and a headache. i sent my friend in, ahead of me, so that i could park. as soon as she walked in, she called me. she said that the place was a mess and she was going to have to come out and wait the 15 minutes it was going to take to be seated. nevertheless, the hostess pointed out some empty benches, around the corner. so, i walked in to wait.\n\nupon entering, i was discouraged because a lot of people were standing around waiting. i just knew it was going to take 30+ minutes. surprisingly, it only took 15 minutes before we were called and seated.\n\nthe place is really small and packed to capacity, so i was thankful that we got to sit around the corner where there were only about 4-5 tables. we had plenty space.\n\nthe server came around fast to take our drink order. she was quick to bring our drinks back too. she asked us if we were ready to order and we said, \"no, we're looking at yelp pictures and we need some more time.\" i did ask about the stuff <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> dish that someone shared on yelp. she smiled and pointed it out and said that it's a popular dish. then she left and took orders for people that was around us.\n\nas soon as she walked away, we decided what we wanted, but it took her about 6 minutes to make eye contact again. when she did stop back by, she asked if we were still looking at pictures or if we were ready to order. we went ahead and ordered. it totally slipped my mind to check in and get a free muffin for myself. the waitress said, \"you were on yelp, did you check in to get the free muffin?\" i was happy she reminded me to do that.\n\nshe came back a couple minutes later and brought 2 muffins. i don't even like <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> but i took it anyways because it was free. i took a bite of it and fell in love. it was so warm and yummy lol. my friend got emotional lol. she said it reminded her of childhood, when her mother used to make them. they were just <mark>Deli</mark>.\n\nabout 12-15 minutes later, our food started to roll out. i order the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> with eggs, cheese and sausage on it. it also came with <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark>. it looked incredible. my friend ordered the 2 <mark>Seasoned Center Cut Pork Chops</mark> that came with 2 eggs, the muffin, that she had already ate, and the <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark>. her's looked <mark>Deli</mark> too.\n\ni love potatoes so i ate those first. i put ketchup all over them and had a ball. my friend didn't like hers, because they were kind of crunchy, so she gave them to me. i put ketchup on them and finished them off too lol.\n\nnext, i started in on my <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> sandwiches. i didn't like the sandwiches. the sausages, eggs <mark>Cheese <mark>Ham, Bacon or Sausage <mark>Mushroom and Cheese</mark></mark></mark> didn't have much flavor. i thought i made a big mistake. being that i'm so smart, i thought to scrape the sausages and eggs off the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> and season the filling myself. i did, and it was 90% better. i ate the filling separately, and ever so often, i would dip the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> in the warm syrup that came with my food.\n\nmy friend said that the <mark>Seasoned Center Cut Pork Chops</mark> were just okay. they were really thin, for sure. i don't know why, but we were expecting some big juicy chops vs the breakfast chops. i wanted to taste the chops for myself, so she took a bite of mine and i took a bite of hers. they tasted as if onions were the main and secondary seasoning. she was right. they were just okay. she did enjoy my mixture of filling and seasoning though.\n\nthe good thing is, we got really full and still had a bunch of food left. i'm sure it has something to do with a humongous portion of potatoes we got and the muffin we were served in the beginning.\n\nthe service was like a 3/5 because there was a little piece of hair in my water when the server dropped it off. i asked for another one and she just stared at my full cup for like 10 seconds. i guess she couldn't understand my reason behind needing another one. i didn't even mention it because it wasn't a big deal and i didn't want anyone to make a big deal over water.\n\nbut also, i took some points off service, because it took my sever a long time to refill my water, once i had actually finished it. it took her maybe 4 or 5 minutes to check on us, after we finished eating too. we just wanted a box to pack up leftovers. when she did stop back by, we asked for the box, she quickly picked one up, dropped it off and walked away. she came back around maybe 3 or 4 minutes later and told us to pay upfront. we were just sitting there, waiting for her to come back by so that we could pay and leave. i'm glad she did stop back by because we probably would have been sitting there for a while.\n\nalthough i'm in love with the potatoes and muffins, i probably won't go back because the rest of the food was just average.",

            "i wanted to try something new for breakfast. i had no idea where to go or what to eat. i came to yelp like i normally do. mostly everyone had something positive to say about this place, so my friend and i packed up and headed 15 minutes away to get some good breakfast.\n\nwhen we arrived, we could tell that it was going to be a long wait and a headache. i sent my friend in, ahead of me, so that i could park. as soon as she walked in, she called me. she said that the place was a mess and she was going to have to come out and wait the 15 minutes it was going to take to be seated. nevertheless, the hostess pointed out some empty benches, around the corner. so, i walked in to wait.\n\nupon entering, i was discouraged because a lot of people were standing around waiting. i just knew it was going to take 30+ minutes. surprisingly, it only took 15 minutes before we were called and seated.\n\nthe place is really small and packed to capacity, so i was thankful that we got to sit around the corner where there were only about 4-5 tables. we had plenty space.\n\nthe server came around fast to take our drink order. she was quick to bring our drinks back too. she asked us if we were ready to order and we said, \"no, we're looking at yelp pictures and we need some more time.\" i did ask about the stuff <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> dish that someone shared on yelp. she smiled and pointed it out and said that it's a popular dish. then she left and took orders for people that was around us.\n\nas soon as she walked away, we decided what we wanted, but it took her about 6 minutes to make eye contact again. when she did stop back by, she asked if we were still looking at pictures or if we were ready to order. we went ahead and ordered. it totally slipped my mind to check in and get a free muffin for myself. the waitress said, \"you were on yelp, did you check in to get the free muffin?\" i was happy she reminded me to do that.\n\nshe came back a couple minutes later and brought 2 muffins. i don't even like <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> but i took it anyways because it was free. i took a bite of it and fell in love. it was so warm and yummy lol. my friend got emotional lol. she said it reminded her of childhood, when her mother used to make them. they were just <mark>Deli</mark>.\n\nabout 12-15 minutes later, our food started to roll out. i order the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> with eggs, cheese and sausage on it. it also came with <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark>. it looked incredible. my friend ordered the 2 <mark>Seasoned Center Cut Pork Chops</mark> that came with 2 eggs, the muffin, that she had already ate, and the <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark>. her's looked <mark>Deli</mark> too.\n\ni love potatoes so i ate those first. i put ketchup all over them and had a ball. my friend didn't like hers, because they were kind of crunchy, so she gave them to me. i put ketchup on them and finished them off too lol.\n\nnext, i started in on my <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> sandwiches. i didn't like the sandwiches. the sausages, eggs <mark>Cheese <mark>Ham, Bacon or Sausage <mark>Mushroom and Cheese</mark></mark></mark> didn't have much flavor. i thought i made a big mistake. being that i'm so smart, i thought to scrape the sausages and eggs off the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> and season the filling myself. i did, and it was 90% better. i ate the filling separately, and ever so often, i would dip the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> in the warm syrup that came with my food.\n\nmy friend said that the <mark>Seasoned Center Cut Pork Chops</mark> were just okay. they were really thin, for sure. i don't know why, but we were expecting some big juicy chops vs the breakfast chops. i wanted to taste the chops for myself, so she took a bite of mine and i took a bite of hers. they tasted as if onions were the main and secondary seasoning. she was right. they were just okay. she did enjoy my mixture of filling and seasoning though.\n\nthe good thing is, we got really full and still had a bunch of food left. i'm sure it has something to do with a humongous portion of potatoes we got and the muffin we were served in the beginning.\n\nthe service was like a 3/5 because there was a little piece of hair in my water when the server dropped it off. i asked for another one and she just stared at my full cup for like 10 seconds. i guess she couldn't understand my reason behind needing another one. i didn't even mention it because it wasn't a big deal and i didn't want anyone to make a big deal over water.\n\nbut also, i took some points off service, because it took my sever a long time to refill my water, once i had actually finished it. it took her maybe 4 or 5 minutes to check on us, after we finished eating too. we just wanted a box to pack up leftovers. when she did stop back by, we asked for the box, she quickly picked one up, dropped it off and walked away. she came back around maybe 3 or 4 minutes later and told us to pay upfront. we were just sitting there, waiting for her to come back by so that we could pay and leave. i'm glad she did stop back by because we probably would have been sitting there for a while.\n\nalthough i'm in love with the potatoes and muffins, i probably won't go back because the rest of the food was just average.",

(the actual price of a cab not lost from the strip is about $12) we were seated in 15 minutes of arriving....and our server was sweet and good. i love anyplace that brings you not just a cup of coffee but a whole carafe....let me start off by saying i am not a breakfast eater but others in my group loves breakfast. \n\ni ordered the oatmeal which was oatmeal and it came with milk and brown sugar. i also ordered a side of bacon which was perfectly done. my husband had the waffles which were huge and came with strawberries <mark>Waffle with Fruit and Whipped Cream</mark>, eggs and bacon it was really good. i tasted from everyone's respective egg plates and they were all amazing. i believe there was a vegetable skillet and a little piggy at the table and those were divine. there were two <mark>Works <mark>Small Fruit Plate</mark></mark> that came with cantalope, blueberries, strawberries and some other fruits. the ranch potatoes were amazing just the right mix of crispy and soft....i wish that i liked breakfast...one of my friends said that the pancakes here were the best she has ever had and she is a bit of a pancake snob. the portions were huge and the prices were right. you cannot go wrong with hitting up the egg and i if you are into breakfast or with a bunch of people who are into breakfast. they also had other menu items available...burgers, salads, sandwiches. on my next trip to vegas i will be sure to head off the strip for some of this eggy goodness!!",

            "i dig the atmosphere of this seemingly mom and pop breakfast joint. the food is good but nothing to write home about. it was packed with a line out the door on the saturday morning we went.\n\ni was able to try the combo meat skillet, <mark>Homemade Corn Beef Hash</mark> skillet, and the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark>. everything tasted homemade which places it above chain breakfast restaurants, but i think all cities have some sort of a joint that serves similar tasting dishes.\n\none thing that stood out was their <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>. choose it over the toast, when asked what you prefer. this was the only thing that was better than anywhere else i have tried. i'm not a big fan of bnut, but if it tasted like the ones here, i would choose it every time.\n\ndecent breakfast joint, decent prices. i might hit it again to try out different dishes to see if anything that can knock my socks off.", 
            "very yummy.  the menu is many pages long and it includes many items i've never seen before like the <mark>Chicken Enchilada</mark> omelet or the fiesta skillet.  we ordered both of these items and they were so very good.  the enchilada omelet had a ton <mark>Choice of Meat <mark><mark>2oz. Habla Diablo Original Salsa</mark> or Habla Diablo Tomatillo Salsa or Homemade Enchilada Sauce</mark></mark> <mark>Cheese <mark>Ham, Bacon or Sausage <mark>Mushroom and Cheese</mark></mark></mark>, a wonderful way to eat eggs!  the skillet had chorizo, chiles and a ton of cheese too, highly recommend ordering it.  the coffee was also piping hot and strong.  the service was ok, it took two tries to get glasses of water.  and yes i did try the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> as others indicated and it was awesome with butter, only minus was the size, needs to be bigger!  i so wanted to give this place 5 stars but i couldn't because of the potatoes, here they fail because they have cut them it small cubes and they are hard but the worst part is the seasoning on them, super salty.  it bummed me because all the other food items were <mark>Deli</mark>.  i will be back and will just get a <mark>Works <mark>Small Fruit Plate</mark></mark> instead of potatoes.",

Sour Cream</mark>) and not only was it <mark>Deli</mark>, it was more than enough food to last me through lunch.  i wanted to try the pancakes as well but i couldn't get it as a side so i tried the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> that other reviewers had recommended - it was good but not great, but i'm not a big fan of banana nut in the first place so others may enjoy it, i don't know.  \n\nthe overall price was reasonable and i prefer quality over quantity and other than a handful of a few breakfast places on the strip the egg and i is one of the best breakfast places around vegas.  highly recommended!",

            "after an interesting night of debauchery, my stomach was hungering for a good, full breakfast.  apart from having the cutest name ever, egg & i has the best <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> i've ever had in my life.  so moist, so warm.  so <mark>Deli</mark>.  their bacon, avocado <mark>Cheese <mark>Ham, Bacon or Sausage <mark>Mushroom and Cheese</mark></mark></mark> omelet had just the right balance of cheese and fillings, although a little more bacon could never hurt anybody... <mark>Fresh Orange or Grapefruit Juice</mark> was freshly squeezed and a bit pulpy, which a nice surprise :)\n\na nice, comfortable, and homey place to recover with generous portions and awesome staff.  definitely recommended.", 
            "came back here because i had a dream that i was in heaven munchin' on their <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>....zzzzzzzzzzz.. \n\ncame by for breakfast to try one of my favorite breakfast dishes, chicken <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark>. i had \"brad's corned <mark>Homemade Corn Beef Hash</mark>\" the first time, kinda salty..\n\nand of course, it wasn't hard to choose, \"toast or <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>\".. is this a trick question? haha, <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>, please! muffin was awesome just not as warm and moist as the first time. there were many more customers dining this day and maybe they were a little busy and in a rush making them? \n\nchicken <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark>: nice portion with a good amount of gravy, i went with egg whites only and their <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark>. the steak had the right crunchy skin, meat was perfect and their sausage gravy was mild and heart warming. in my opinion, much better dish than their corned <mark>Homemade Corn Beef Hash</mark>.\n\nupped the rating to 4 stars because they deserve it.", 
            "huge portions, plates are enough for two. definitely get the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> as a side (comes with most entrees). great coffee, very friendly staff. and yes, the ranch potatoes are awesome, don't substitute it with fries no matter what your kids say.", 
            "after indulging us too much <mark>Homemade Soup of the Day</mark> before at the bellagio buffet, we looked for a nice and decent original coffee shop - or such. <mark>Homemade Soup of the Day</mark> before my lady had found a voucher in a tourist magazine together with the notion of a review that this place (i.e. both) we're very liked with the community and the reviewers, in fact best liked.\n\nbeing a no brainer it turned up trumps in reality: the place was very busy (which we took as a good sign to start with) yet being seated only took a moment and the service was very fast and attentive. food variety on the menue is almost too big ;-) so i quite took my time to decide. got an italian influenced omelette which turned out to be very tasty. \none more thing about the service: our little boy didn't like his fries because they came spiced (paprika or the likes)... they were replaced with plain ones in no time - comped !\n\na little before the food arrived a nice and cheerful lady of the staff came over and chatted us up a bit. her expert eye didn't fail to note that we were out-of-towners. later, i found out that she was actually the manager (owner?) and had the same first name as my darling ! when she heard that i failed to order the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> (house specialty) she had one sent to our table immediately - again, complementary !\n\ni guess i don't need to say more. prices very reasonable, yummy food with a lot of variety...wish we had breakfast places like that in berlin lol.\n\nsince i guess we will return to las vegas at some point in our lives i can clearly see us going there again !",

            "<mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>, will you marry me?  my husband may object, but that's ok.  we won't tell him.\n\nthe wait on a sunday morning was 25 minutes.  obviously, it's a good place if people are waiting.  we didn't mind the wait at all.\n\nwe shared the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> (stuffed with eggs, cheese, bacon) and the collision course (a cross between a crepe and omelet).  mine came with a <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>.\n\nmy coffee was never empty.\n\nyou know the food is good when you are so full and you keep eating.  you know you're going to get sick, but you just don't care.", 
            "i came here for breakfast with a few people the other day. the restaurant was packed and we had to wait about 10-15 minutes. i ordered the corned <mark>Homemade Corn Beef Hash</mark> which was homemade. good flavor and lots of it! my niece really liked it and ended up eating about half of it. my niece actually ordered the waffle with <mark>Banana</mark> on top (strawberries were out of season). this girl can eat but is skinny as a stick. kids! one of the other ladies had portuguese sausage, rice and eggs. they give you a whole sausage and it's pretty big. whoa now, i'm talking about food! the other lady had spam & eggs which she really liked. we all got the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> with our meals. yum! we had a good breakfast and may be back again when we're in vegas.", 
            "we wanted to get off the lv strip and eat at a local place for breakfast so after reading the reviews i chose the egg & i.\ni was not disappointed as the food was fresh and the menu selection for breakfast was excellent. i ordered the veggie omelette and it was served with a huge portion of home fires. as others have commented the home fries are highly seasoned with seasoning salt so i enjoyed them. the veggie omelette had a generous amount of chopped <mark>Veggie</mark> inside and they melt jack and cheddar cheese over the top. the meal is served with toast or their famous <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> and the muffin is light and packed with flavor. i was very hungry today but i left very full and satisfied. the prices are very reasonable and my breakfast inlcuding a drink came to a toal of $10.00. i will definitely be back on my next trip to lv.", 
            "went to vegas this past weekend. all i have to say is thank you my fellow yelpers for giving this place decent reviews, for had it not been for you, i would have broken down and paid 30 or 40 bucks for brunch.  because of you, i have now found my go to breakfast joint every time i go to vegas.\n\nlet me start of by saying, if you are staying at the stratosphere, this is the perfect place for you because its only about 3 miles away. getting right into the joint, it's always a good sign when you step into a restaurant, and its jammed packed with patrons, and an even better sign when you can smell nothing but breakfast goodness as you pull into the parking lot.\n\nwait time for our party of 9 was probably about an hour, but it was okay since 7 stragglers in my party were still packing back at their hotels. the coffee, was shite to be perfectly honest, but when you are nursing a hangover, brownie points are scored because they bring you the coffee in the carafe, almost one per coffee drinker, so you never have to look around for a waitress to refill your cup.\n\ni had the brad's corned <mark>Homemade Corn Beef Hash</mark>, and it was heavenly! i recommend getting the half order because with their kick ass potatoes (cubed and superbly seasoned with season salt) and <mark>Two Eggs</mark>, it ends up being a hell of a lot of food, especially after eating their freshly baked <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>. major points for the corned <mark>Homemade Corn Beef Hash</mark>  being made from scratch. my wife had some kind of pork chile verde skillet, and she wasn't disappointed, and neither was my mother in law who ordered a spinach, cheese, onion and tomato scramble. blueberry pancakes were a little off as they were extremely dense, but we'll see what happens next time we go.\n\nthe biggest plus for this restaurant is the fact that their service is impeccable. i can honestly say that i wish every restaurant had service as awesome as egg and i's. their entire staff is friendly, attentive and make you feel like you were a regular customer! see you in may egg and i!", 
            "i heard of this place through a friend of mine whose friend recommended it.  so what's the first thing i do?  check it out on yelp, of course!  \n\nyes, there is a wait.  but like everyone says, the line goes really quickly and i think we were seated within 15-20 minutes, which is not bad considering it was a saturday at peak brunch time.  \n\ni loved their newspaper style menus and all the great descriptions to help decide what to order.  first thing i have to mention is the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>.  yes, i know everyone mentions it but it is so worth mentioning!  it's so moist and <mark>Deli</mark>, i actually now crave <mark>Homemade Soup of the Day</mark> thing!  \n\ni ordered a corned <mark>Homemade Corn Beef Hash</mark> with eggs and instead of their potatoes, i ordered rice.  the corned <mark>Homemade Corn Beef Hash</mark> was okay, i like mine on the crispier side but it was still good.  the eggs were cooked perfectly.  not too many places can make the perfect over-medium where it's a little cooked but just enough runnyness to get some yolk without it spewing all over the plate like an over-easy.  i tried my girlfriend's potatoes and should've stuck with it.  it was almost like little bites of french fries.  so <mark>Deli</mark>!  i'm definitely heading back there next chance i get to, until then, i shall see the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> in my dreams...", 
            "this is the quintessential breakfast spot. i got the corned beef & hash with eggs. & of course the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>. simply perfect. the place is clean & inviting. perfect for a couple. i was alone. maybe next time.", 
            "i ordered the corned <mark>Homemade Corn Beef Hash</mark> with the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>. i've been hearing about how great their <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> and it truly does live up to the hype. it was light and fluffy and the banana flavor was subtle. \n\nthe corned <mark>Homemade Corn Beef Hash</mark> comes with ranch potatoes (think tommys style fries with that red seasoning only diced up), eggs, and a side of watermelon and pineapple. the hash was served under scrambled eggs in a skillet. the ranch potatoes were crisp and flavorful. i just wish the hash was a bit crispier. since the hash was made with a mixture of potatoes, the texture remained soft and did not create any contrast with the scrambled eggs. it had good flavor though. \n\nlastly, the customer service is top notch. all the waitresses were happy to help and near the end of brunch, the owner/manager came over just to chit chat, which i appreciated.", 
            "i had a great dining experience at egg & i. the server was quite friendly and attentive. this is a great place to have breakfast at an affordable price. i had the vegetarian skillet and added some bacon (i know...crazy). the dish was quite tasty. and it's true what everyone says about the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>. they are to die for!!", 
            "love egg and i. we needed a pick-me-up after a bad doctors office visit. took 2 hours for 2 mins of doc attention so we were pretty annoyed. this lifted our spirits, because we both love breakfast foods. we drove a few miles to go to egg and i simply because i wanted to try it based on the great yelp reviews.\nwe were not disappointed. everything was great for my first time ever eating here.\nwe walked in at 1215 and were immediately seated on a thursday lunch hour. there were plenty of tables inside and out, and since it was a sunny calm day we decided it'd be nice to get out and get a little sun after being stuck in the doc office.\ni went with the \"this little piggy\" omelet and it was just the way i like it. lots of egg, lots of cheese, and plenty of meats. it comes with chopped up bacon, chopped up sausage, and chopped up chunks of ham, folded in half and smothered with about a half pound of cheese!!!! also comes with the country potatoes which i was expecting to be orgasmic based on reviews, but let me down just a little bit. don't get me wrong they were really good, but maybe my batch just wasn't quite cooked long enough and they were a little softer than i like em. also i got the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> with my meal, (this thing was out-friggen-standing) and she brought it out before the meal, which i thought to be a little strange. but i was really hungry so it was just fine with me.\nmy honey got a <mark>Original <mark>Cabo Breakfast Burrito</mark></mark> and she said it was really good, looked to me like it had a ton of peppers, which isn't my favorite thing in the world, but she enjoyed it. had to take half of it home because she couldn't finish it all, this thing was pretty big and also came with the country potatoes.\nthis was a great breakfast experience and can understand how this place can get pretty busy at times. we were very happy with the food and mostly happy with the service, she was just a little slow a couple times and we were only there for about 45 minutes. i.e. forgot to get a sprite, and never really came back to ask us if we needed anything after our food was brought out and if it was cooked ok. after she brought the check we decided to get a refill to go since the sprite was $2.50 and brought late and we waited for a few minutes to see her but never did. in the end it worked out, when we paid we asked the cashier if she could help us in getting the to-go refill and she politely went and took care of that for us with a smile. :)\nthanks egg and i, we will be back for sure!", 
            "still great all these years after the rachel ray review. i ventured to the hawaiian section at the back of the menu. the portuguese sausage with eggs, <mark>Sticky White Rice</mark>, and a <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> (of course!) was <mark>Deli</mark>. the sausage was juicy and well grilled. it's a great off-the-strip brunch spot.\n\n...and i'm writing this at the restaurant using their free wifi!", 
            "my husband and i didn't realize how far this place was from the strip. a little too expensive of a fare for breakfast! however, this place is super yummy. we did have a wait for about 40 minutes upon arrival as well. a local favorite. combine tourists like us with locals, you got a busy place! look in the 24/7 guide for a buy 1, get 1 entree free coupon. the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> is served warm and is a must eat. we both got omelets - love the unique variety! the homestyle potatoes are super tasty and you get a generous portion. fresh squeezed <mark>Fresh Orange or Grapefruit Juice</mark> - a plus! the little black/yellow egg flipper as a service indicator is fun and helpful. within seconds of flipping it to the black egg (meaning we needed service) the manager was over at our table asking what we needed and joking with us. everyone here is friendly, upbeat and happy you stopped in. good place, good people. go.", 
            "so my boyfriend is a taxi driver and he gets all kinds of coupons, deals and freebies. he got a coupon for egg & i.  i was so excited to try it because we're never awake for normal breakfast time. they stop seating people at 3pm, which is when we usually get there. \n\nthe food is great. the chili relleno omelet was amazing. i'm not a fan of the ranch potatoes. i think they are a good filler though. same about the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>. but the meal i dream about is benedict's garden. it's a 'vegetarian' version of eggs benedict. english muffin topped with guacamole and tomato, poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. it's the greatest thing!\n\nservice is great. everyone is friendly. waitresses are attentive but if you need anything, just flip the egg on the condiment caddy.", 
            "spent a few days in vegas and wasn't feeling like a \"buffet\" style breakfast or our normal hash house a go go meal. found egg and i in a coupon book given to us at our hotel. \n\nlocated in a strip mall with a lot of parking, there was no wait on a weekday morning, but the place was full of patrons. took a while for our server to take our order and asked us twice what we wanted to drink (amnesia maybe ?..no she was just busy, trying to tend to everyone), so after about 10 minutes, my husband flipped the sign with the un-happy egg, to show we needed attention. the sweet lady at the register quickly came to us and asked what we needed. our server quickly came to us and apologized for the wait and also brought each of us the best <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> ever !!! \n\ni had the blackend <mark>Blackened Prime Rib Benny</mark>, a grilled croissant with  prime rib, sauteed spinach and roasted red bell peppers, two poached eggs, then covered with hollandaise sauce. also came with home fries and 2 slices of fruit. this dish was amazing ! all the flavors tied together so well and that <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> will make me a return customer ! the hubby had crepes filled w/ mushrooms, that i take was also <mark>Deli</mark>, since  i didn't get to taste it ! \n\nthe coupon for a \"buy one meal get the other for half off\" made the whole experience even better.\n\n we'll be back in 2 mos..egg and i but this time we won't be alone.",

            "my first impression was, \"cute sad and happy egg people everywhere!\"\n\nthe decor of this breakfast house really caught my attention as i first walked in. eggs are featured on everything from their tableware, to their menu, and their walls. it's too adorable. the menu looks like a real newspaper which is also a nice little touch to the theme of this restaurant. bright yellow everywhere is a great way to brighten up and start your day in vegas!\n\nwe went to egg & i for brunch and i can say it loud and proud, this is the best american breakfast i have ever had. hearty, filling, innovative, more than just eggs and waffles. egg & i has taken breakfast foods to a whole different level. i ordered the eggs benedict florentine (featured on rachel ray) which had  spinach, canadian bacon, two poached eggs on a grilled english muffin, with hollandaise sauce. we also ordered an omelette, both served with ranch potatoes...by far the best breakfast potatoes on this planet. i forgot the name of <mark>The Works Omelette</mark>, but i know for sure i'd order the eggs benedict florentine and extra <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> on the side. the complimentary <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> are made fresh in house, and they are so good. the service was just as bubbly and friendly as this restaurant is. if you want to start your day right in vegas, this is definitely one of your options.\n\nthe lasting impression? \"love my breakfast, let's get it on country style at egg & i!\"", 
            "<mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> & their potato hash is the business!!!\n\nthis place only serves breakfast & i believe they close at 3pm. the menu looks like a morning's newspaper, they have tons of yummy items to choose from. the trick to getting your waiter's attention: first you'd have to look at the smiley egg that holds the condiments on your table and when you flip the egg to a frown, you'll be serviced in no time. unless they are super busy and most of the time they are so just wait patiently. \n\nthe food portion size is big, i would say that thee portion is adult men's size who is damn hungry in the morning because i never finish and always pack it home.\n\nevery time i order unlimited coffee, it always taste old (drink @ your own risk) :\\ so i never get coffee unless i absolutely need it. \n\noverall, i love this place! mainly i give them a 5 for <mark>Homemade Soup of the Day</mark> food...it's just too damn good.",

            "this place was a big letdown. i guess b/c i had such a great experience with egg works their sister place i had put this place on such a high pedestal and they fell off... and no all the kings horses and all the kings men couldnt put this bk together again. \n\nentree: my bf got the franciscan scramble. sounded really good and he's a professional order-er. its amazing to watch him work. everything he orders always comes out spectacular and the best tasting dish at the table. not me.  i had a the tostada last time and i had really wanted the <mark>Southwestern Cobb Salad</mark> but was torn. so this time <mark>Southwestern Cobb Salad</mark> was my only request. \ndisguisting. \n\ncobb: i love <mark>Southwestern Cobb Salad</mark>. this was just plain gross. they probably gave me 3-4 lbs of iceburg lettuce. really? iceburg? gross.  the croutons were the 99 cent croutons with the green specks on it. they gave me 1/4 of an egg... at a a place with the word egg in it.. i was very disappointed. you'd think theyere 'd be at least a full egg? maybe 2. no.\non top of my salad was a lil bit of shredded cheese, and some deli sliced sandwich meat turkey and ham (not even cubes) and the box of sprouts sittong on top of my salad. i ordered blue cheese dressing, they brought me ranch. anything that could go wrong did. 2nd worst meal i've had in las vegas since i've lived here. \n\nmaybe its my fault? my fault for ordering anything that wasnt scrambled so early in the morning. i take some responsibility in that i guess. my bf's omelet was <mark>Deli</mark>. the potatoes were good.. so was his <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>.. (while my bran muffin was gross) it was just the perfect yin/yang of good vs. evil... , er mavs vs the heat, the cowboys vs the 49ers, egg works vs egg & i... and yes good food vs. bad food. \n\nthe only reason i gave them 2stars was b/c of the bfs food was 4 stars cancelled out by my zero stars.. to equal 2. :) \nhere's hoping you gleam something from my review... please do not order a salad at egg & i.",

            "we were in vegas this past weekend for a very short trip. of course there are bazillion places to eat on the strip, but i wanted to check out some place off strip, to get away from the craziness of driving in bumper to bumper traffic, waiting for tons of people to cross the streets and then to wait to eat. \n\negg & i is located off strip, east of the 15 off of the sahara exit. its located in a strip mall with plenty of parking. there is indoor and outdoor seating. there were a few people waiting when we arrived but we were quickly seated. the place was full with a few tables empty. we were expecting to wait but it was already about 10am by the time we went. \n\ni ordered the strawberry <mark>Waffle with Fruit and Whipped Cream</mark> <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> which was thick slices of soft <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> with a strawberry <mark>Waffle with Fruit and Whipped Cream</mark> cheese and strawberry preserves on top. it was pretty good. i liked that it wasnt too sweet like most <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark>/waffles with fruit toppings at other restaurants.\n\nthe bf ordered the fiesta skillet with chorizo. it had green chili, onions and salsa. i thought it was gonna be sausage type of chorizo but it was the ground kind. if you've ever cooked or bought it at the market you know what im talking about. when you cook it, it pretty much just melts. so the skillet was as if it had chili on top. it was pretty heavy and greasy. i could probably do without the chorizo next time.\n\nthe bfs bro ordered the <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark> skillet. this had chopped chunks of <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark> with their homestyle potatoes and eggs with white gravy on top. it was pretty good. it tasted just like a regular <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark> plate but all chopped up for you, if you dont mind your food touching (i know some people who dont, like my 5 yr old nephew...).\n\nbfs bro's fiance ordered the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark>. this was two pieces of their thick sliced fluffy <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> with an omelet in between. the eggs had lots of bits of bacon in it which made it tasty but it was pretty firm. i felt like it was over cooked. maybe it was all the cheese. it tasted good though. it tasted good with either the syrup and/or ketchup. sweet or savory, whichever you prefer. \n\nwe had also had a side of the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>, which was pretty good. it was large on top. it wasnt too sweet which was nice. it came out moist and warm. yum!\n\nthe service was good. everyone was pretty friendly and the food came out fast. we had ordered coffee and they gave us a pitcher of coffee. they take credit card but you have to show your id and pay at the front.", 
            "this place served the best corned <mark>Homemade Corn Beef Hash</mark> i've ever had! shredded corned beef, mixed with potatoes and maybe some onions and peppers. i'm not exactly sure but yum it was <mark>Deli</mark>. definitely coming back for this dish next time i'm in vegas. \ntheir blueberry pancakes were packed with plump blueberries. saved the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> for the drive home immediately after breakfast.. very tasty, once you start you cant stop. the place was packed on the sunday we visited but the wait was not bad at all. glad we came here instead of a buffet on the blvd.",

            "thanks to yelp and the good ol community of yelpers out there i know a lot of places where 10 bucks can go a long way in providing some good eats.\n\nmy buddy recommended the egg & i after hearing some good things about it from other sources. i've driven by this place multiple times and it's caught my attention a few time while in the same plaza as b&c camera. \n\nthey have a diverse menu of egg related items. i was about to order one of the combo skillets because another table's home fries looked good but ended up getting a hawaiian themed plate which featured portuguese sasuage or spam (went for the sausage), rice, <mark>Two Eggs</mark> <mark>Choice of Egg Any Style</mark> (sunny side up), \"sticky\" rice (turned out to be calrose rice). also came with a choice of what ever bread or the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> everyone raves about. \n\ni choose the muffin and man oh man it did not disappoint. blueberry's always been my favorite muffin and to be honest i havent eaten enough muffins in my life time. if i were in a situation where the entire fate of humanity rested upon my recommendation for a muffin it would be the egg & i's banana nut hands own, sorry humanity you had your chance i'm throwing this one out and if it lands under the bus so be it. \n\noverall the <mark>Island Favorite</mark> plate was good, obviously the portuguese sausage made the dish but in all honesty it wasnt worth the price. even with the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> dreams are made of it still wasnt quite worth it. for the same price my buddy got one of the combo skillets and he ended up easily with three times more food then i did.\n\nso far i do like this place. outdoor seating was available immediately seeing as it was a cold morning but their heaters are very powerful and aside from a few gusts of wind there was very little outdoor discomfort. looking at other people's plate was very easy on the eyes as their selection of food is diverse yet seeing common dishes amongst different diners makes me want to come back and get what they're getting because they cant all be wrong.",

            "the one thing i love about this place is the fact that it's off the strip, and it serves up <mark>The Classic</mark> homey style feel, rather than the over-glamorized you would expect in vegas. yeah you come this city hoping to escape into another reality, but it's nice to come down from the clouds once in a while.\n\nthe one thing i have to admire is there amazing variety of amazing egg selections. i decided on going with their chile relleno omelette, which was on the money, but their <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> is the thing to get. \n\nlisten, if you feel like wondering off the strip for some good home eatin', why not here??", 
            "came back again hoping for 4 stars on a saturday morning but the service ..  how do i put this nicely - it sucked. our waitress wasn't very attentive. we were seated right away since our party of 5 decided we would sit outside to avoid the wait (tip!!!!) it was nice for a while until it started getting humid and nasty but we stuck it through.\n\nwe had the eggceptional omelette (3 stars), <mark>Bacon & <mark>Sliced Avocado</mark></mark> & egg (4 stars) - these flavors always mesh well together!, <mark>The Crazy Chicken</mark> <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark> skillet (5 stars) and the cinnamon raisin <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> (2 stars).\n\na tip: stay away from the cinnamon raisin <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark>. couldn't taste the cinnamon in it at all and it was kind of soggy. not the heavenly experience in your mouth you get when you think of <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> ... mmmm. but get <mark>The Crazy Chicken</mark> <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark> skillet!!! you will not regret it. scrambled eggs on top. so yummy.\n\nand of course, the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> is still my favorite of all time here!",

            "came back a month later and had an awesome time! place was packed but got sat right away, our server was erin, aka freakin awesome! for was awesome just like i remembered. <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark> was crispy, gravy was perfectly seasoned! the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> was great too. \n\nfor some reason, this places coffee hits the spot. and they give a bowl of french vanilla creamers! awesome! my partner in crime had the corned <mark>Homemade Corn Beef Hash</mark> and she said it was <mark>Deli</mark>! \n\nerin was always right there refilling waters and left a coffee thermos at our table. bonus points! \n\nbottom line is that if you're on vegas, you have to eat here for breakfast. it is awesome! and erin is the bomb!", 
            "this place was great! it is not located in a hotel so i didn't have to walk through a maze to get there.  a little bit off the strip but that's what i liked about it.  there was a ten minute wait but that's how i knew it was going to be good, and it was completely worth it.  i had a skilled and <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>.  my girlfriend had their eggs \"benny\".  all was exceptional.  wait staff was great.", 
            "an early arrival to vegas gives us an opportunity to go off the strip and enjoy a couple of breakfast eateries. the egg and i has a cute name and an old cowboy ranch feel to it. the menus are newspapers and the servers are friendly!\n\nfood (4 stars): i ordered the corned <mark>Homemade Corn Beef Hash</mark> with over medium eggs and the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>. i'm usually not a banana nut fan, but this muffin changed my mind. it was full of spice and flavor, you can definitely taste the banana. the corned <mark>Homemade Corn Beef Hash</mark> was pretty good with the shredded style corned beef. the seasoned potatos were <mark>Deli</mark> and i wish i could've had more.\n\nwe ordered the cinncinati 4 way plate with onions. it is pretty much spaghetti pasta with chili and onions on top. our group was intrgued by the ingredients so we ordered it. it was amazing!!! who knew that chili and spaghetti pasta can go together so well?? topped <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> and onions, this is my dish!\n\nwe couldn't finish all of our food due to the large portions, so definitely come with an appetite. the food is still good after being reheated.\n\nservice (4 stars): our cute server was friendly and humorous. she frequently checked up on us and refilled our cups, she even got us another table because ours was cramped.\n\nbottom line: hungover? hungry? feeling like stuffinf your face? egg ans i will satisfy it all.", 
            "had a great breakfast there yesterday morning. service was great; samantha did a great job. food order was taken promptly and food brought to our table in a timely manner.  my wife had the <mark>Original <mark>Cabo Breakfast Burrito</mark></mark>; which she loved and i had the portuguese sausage and eggs with the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> (a must). overall very please with the food, service and will return again.", 
            "this is the second time i've eaten at egg & i and this place is soo good for breakfast. i forgot what i got the first time i've been here. the last time i've been here i got a cold turkey sandwich with french fries. the sandwich was really simple with turkey, guacomole, tomatoe and etc. just the usually stuff but it was good. their french fries was a bit different, it is small and crispy...not like mcdonald's or burger king fries.  i love love love their <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>!! it is so freaking good! everyone gotta try their <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>!\n\ni would definitely come back here again.", 
            "this place is awesome! we had erin as our server, she was great! she was very sweet and attentive to our table.\n\nmy boyfriend and i got two dishes to share because we couldn't decide! we started off with <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> (this is a must, they are home made!) i got the texas toast <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> and my boyfriend got, '<mark>The Crazy Chicken</mark>' omelette both were very tasty and cooked to perfection! \n\ni would definitely go back here!", 
            "very good place for breakfast.  had the taco skillet and it was decent.  the pancakes and <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> looked amazing.  our waitress samantha was great.", 
            "came to vegas for a week and decided to eat off the strip and found this place through yelp.  i was excited to see they served spam, egg and rice.  came on monday, june 9th for breakfast and from the time we walked in to the time we walked out we had exceptional customer service by gia the manager and our waitress, carole ann.   they were both very personable.\n\nwe we're seated promptly in the back next to the kitchen by gia.  carole ann came by to acknowledge us but would be right back because she had to sing happy birthday at a table.  no biggie as we were on vacation and wasn't in a rush to go anywhere.  \n\ngia came by and apologized but no need to apologize for the delay.  she came out with two <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> for us while we waited and took our drink orders and came out with it.  those muffins were <mark>Deli</mark>.  carole ann came back and took our order.  i ordered the spam and egg over rice.  that came with a muffin or toast and since we already got the muffin i thought that was it.  but she offered me toast or another muffin to take home, but i declined.   my other half ordered a chorizo skillet.  \n\nthe food and service was great and i would have def gone back but my intentions while i was in vegas was to visit a different restaurant everyday.  \n\nthey don't take american express, not sure if it's just at this location. \n\nthank you carole ann for great customer service, keep it up and i hope you get to meet mickey mouse!!!", 
            "i came here not once, but three times during my week's vacation with my fiance. we couldn't get enough!\n\nbesides the amazing food, there's always great service! i love the little egg signs on the tables--flip the happy face to sad and the servers can all see that you need attention and someone comes along. none of that trying to wave someone down, hand signal, awkwardness going on here. we flipped ours only once and got our refill within like 20 seconds...it's absolutely amazing. (note that using this doesn't mean you're an unhappy guest, just that you need attention...)\n\nwe were served by three great servers during our breakfasts here this week: john (i think he's new), thaynara (sp?), and erin; all did a fantastic job bringing extra napkins, getting refills, answering questions about the menu, etc. they were quick and attentive and just all around fantastic. \n\nso, the food. amazing. i'm not a breakfast person. usually eggs kinda gross me out if they aren't cooked right, and i'm kind of picky, i know. so why did i go to a breakfast joint and get eggs every time? because they know how to cook them! between the omelet, scrambled, and over medium, all were cooked perfectly!! not that i doubted a place with \"egg\" in the name couldn't get it right, but every meal i had was executed to perfection. eggs weren't dry or overcooked, nor were they runny or watery. just right, every time.\n\nout of the six things we ordered over our three visits, i got the coffee every time. it was piping hot and <mark>Deli</mark>, and was a perfect compliment to the breakfast... they bring the caraffe to your table so you don't have to wait for refills on the coffee, either. you've got to ask for the fancy creamers, but they'll bring some out for you no problem! (they had caramel and french vanilla, and i thinkkkk the irish cream flavor too.) \n\nthey have some awesome works potatoes (i have always called these home fries) that are seasoned and chopped into cute little cubes (more surface area = more crispy potato!) that are super tasty. side note: if you don't want the potatoes, or just not a huge helping of them, you can ask to sub fresh fruit, or do 1/2 fruit, 1/2 potatoes, as my fiance and i did a couple of times. the fruit they have is fresh and sweet, from cantaloupe, honeydew, watermelon, grapefruit, and pineapple. \n\nthey also have these to-die-for <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>. these muffins are homemade and so soft and moist! utterly delectable--i definitely recommend them over the toast option offered with most breakfast plates.\n\nwe've tried the corned <mark>Homemade Corn Beef Hash</mark> (no canned meat products here!) and the <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark> as well as the biscuits and gravy; all were keepers. the biscuits are two whole ones, not one cut in half (big servings), and i like that they cut up the steak in the skillet, makes it so much easier to eat. we also tried the works omelet and <mark>Brad's Scramble</mark>. there is so much on this menu that is tasty! \n\ni did mark the price range as $$ because most of the plates are around $10-11, plus a drink, per person is kind of expensive. we were on vacation, which was why we splurged, but if you're a local this is still a lovely breakfast-brunch place to hit up for some great food. \n\nside note the second: the decor is really cute! it looks like hand-painted farmland all over the restaurant, and they have merch available to buy with their logo at the front (i.e. a baby onesie with \"just hatched\" on it or something) and they sell loaves of that <mark>Deli</mark> banana nut bread to go, too!\n\nrecap: everything is <mark>Deli</mark>, huge portions, perfect eggs, fantastic service, great experience. will definitely return and recommend. :d", 
            "what an amazing find! we wanted the breakfast buffet at our hotel on the strip, but found out that the price doubled on the weekend. so on our way out of town to the grand canyon, we did a quick yelp search and found this gem. being in vegas, we thought it was funny that there were 777 reviews for this place, averaging 4.5 stars. it lived up to the hype! \n\ndefinitely ask for the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>, they are amazing. as are the potatoes. as are <mark>The Works Omelette</mark>...heck, it was all great! i ordered the chile relleno omelette (yes you read that right) and it was dee-lish. \n\nour server, alyssa, was friendly and made sure everything was to our liking and topped off. the manager, gia, stopped by our table to check in on us and ended up giving us some great ideas of places to check out on our road trip.\n\nafter the crazy hustle and bustle and falseness of the strip, it was great to eat at a down-home style diner. i liked it so much i wanted to buy a t-shirt, but they were out of the tie-dye one that i wanted. which is probably the only non-five-star thing i can say about this place. we will definitely be back here again the next time we're in town!", 
            "this place is a must stop every time i go to vegas.  i go to vegas at least once a year, more if i can and anyone who goes with me know that we will go here.  it is still pretty busy in the late morning even if it is off the strip, but if you go early (cause you're still on e. coast time), or later, it isn't so bad.  \nat home we have a place with this name, but it is not the same place.  this place is epic good.  my favorites are the <mark>Chicken Enchilada</mark> omelet, the strawberry <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark>, the banana nut <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark>, and the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> here is out of this world.  \nafter a 2008 trip to hawaii i became obsessed with hawaiian breakfast and they have both your traditional breakfast of eggs, rice and spam or portuguese sausage, but they also have <mark>Loco Moco</mark>!  if you've never had <mark>Loco Moco</mark> it is crazy good.  rice, steak, and eggs with gravy dumped on top.  yummy!", 
            "this was a very impressive breakfast restaurant!\n\ni came here with 4 of my other friends while we were in vegas and all of us had a positive experience.  both the food and the service were \"egg-cellent.\"  \n\nanyhow, i try to be a little bit pun-ny at times and this is one of them.\n\nfirst off, the service was great.  we came in around noon time and the restaurant was mostly crowded but our group of 5 was seated as soon as we walked in the door.  we were greeted by the hostess with a big smile and much enthusiasm.  what's interesting is that their menu is in the form of a newspaper, which is very creative and something i've never seen before.  our waitress, amanda, was very energetic and did a wonderful job.  she was very helpful with her recommendations, very quick, and very genuinely friendly.  i love it when the people at a restaurant enjoy what they do.  \n\nas for the food, my friends and i ordered different dishes but everyone enjoyed their meal.  i ordered a hawaiian dish that came with rice, eggs, and spam.  you could also have your choice of sausage.  now, i know it sounds plain from the description but it was probably the best breakfast of those items i\"ve ever had.  everything was prepared perfectly and also presented well.  i had <mark>Two Eggs</mark> that were made over-well, hot and juicy sausage that was perfectly seasoned and two mounds of perfectly scooped rice.  also, before our dishes were served, we were given complimentary appetizers in the form of a <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>.  it was the best <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> i've ever tasted because it came out warm and seemed to be freshly made.\n\nmy other friends ordered the country fried <mark>Chicken Breast</mark> skillet as well as a turkey sandwich that they happily shared with me.  i got to try it and it was just as excellent tasting as my dish.  the portion sizes were generous and all of us were stuffed by the end of the meal.\n\nwhat i found interesting was that they had a little sign in the shape of an egg that had two sides.  it was used to signal our waitress if we were in need of some help.  one side of the sign had a smiling egg and another had an egg with a sad face.  apparently you are supposed to flip it to the sad facing egg side if you needed service.  anyhow, the last part might not make sense until you actually go there...but it beats any breakfast place on the strip that i've been too!\n\nlastly, the price is extremely affordable.  an entire meal for one person was about $9-$10 before tax and tip.  i sort of wish they had one in orange county but i'll definitely come back here with friends the next time i visit vegas.", 
            "great bfast after a nite of boozing. the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> was spectacular. they have half portions which is great if you are not super hungry or are watching your figure. service was top notch. ask to sit in thaynara's section. she was one of the best servers we have ever had!", 
            "i would easily say that we received the most amazing service from the most incredible server in the world.  i only wished  i lived in vegas to get the chance to have brunch here at least once/week.  the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> was very fresh. the <mark>Chocolate Chip</mark> pumpkin pancakes were perfectly fluffy and pumpkin was fresh, and teh <mark>Chocolate Chip</mark> were just right (not too much, not to few).  the <mark>Chicken Fried Steak Skillet</mark> was also amazing!. cooked just right, with a thick <mark>Waffle with Fruit and Whipped Cream</mark> gravy, with perfectly cooked potatoes, and an egg, just how i asked for it. even the oj carafe tasted fresh, and it probably wasn't though, but it had me fooled.\nagain the prices, service and quality of food were amazing. (only thing is that this particular egg&i restaurant was a bit far from our hotel on the strip, but definitely worth the cab ride). even the general manager came by our table  a few times to ask how everything was. (my receipt says the  server is mandy but i believe her real name was thiereny (shes getting married soon)).\nand they have an amazing giveaway trip to disney", 
            "whut! this place is simply a friendly local's breakfast dive that is incredibly <mark>Deli</mark>! and the service is superb! were were served by thayrana who is getting married soon and was <mark>Deli</mark>. she gave us great and honest recos along with some complimentary <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> with her apologies when our food took a little bit longer than expected. our most favorite dish was the pumpkin pancakes with <mark>Chocolate Chip</mark>! highly recommend this place to all and apparently they have several locales as well!", 
            "having read the reviews on yelp, i just had to see for myself what all the fuss was about. well, i'm a big breakfast guy, and this place more than lived up to its reputation. i went with the <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark>, which had the perfect combination of crispy and tender. i'm more of a hash brown fan, but their cubed breakfast potatoes were very tasty. and i have to pay tribute to the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>; i don't even like <mark>Banana</mark>, but this was fantastic. to top it all off, my server staci was friendly, knowledgeable and attentive. highly recommended.",

            "awesome place!!  we were undecided between the egg & i and another place we saw on yelp with great reviews.  we'd gotten rid of our rental car <mark>Homemade Soup of the Day</mark> before so we'd have to take a taxi to either.  at the spur of the moment, we picked the egg & i.  yay for us for picking an awesome joint.  we waited only about 10-15 minutes before being seated.  once seated, we flipped through the newspaper menu.  i'd read so much about the muffins, we ordered a couple to start our meal.  they were <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>.  we both ate the entire thing.  so good.  and with a great cup of coffee, we could've stopped right there.  but we didn't!  since breakfast is not my favorite meal, i love it when i find a place that has lunch style breakfast.  there were so many options i had to choose from.  i was stuck between the stuffed pepper and the <mark>Taco</mark> rancheros.  i chose the <mark>Taco</mark> rancheros.  it was a tortilla topped <mark>Flour or Corn Tortilla Layered with <mark>Refried Beans</mark></mark>, ground hamburger, <mark>Two Eggs</mark> (which i got fried) and topped <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> and <mark>2oz. Sour Cream</mark>.  i would've liked some salsa with it but it didn't need it.  my partner got the garlic mashed potato omelet.  it was enormous.  she could only eat half of it to which our server, karla suggested getting the half order next time!  shoot, we didn't know you could do a half order.  but, my partner said she wouldn't gotten a half anyway because the portions would be all wrong.  we both loved the old bay <mark><mark>Habla Diablo Cajun Seasoned Fries</mark></mark> potatoes.  as we waddled out, it was great that the front desk called a cab for us.  very nice.  oh, and there's a little egg face on the table that you can flip revealing a sad egg face if you happen to need anything.  that's a brilliant idea!  karla was awesome and if we lived in the area, it would be our go to place!", 
            "the egg & i has got to be the best breakfast dining experience i've had in vegas. the place is busy because the food is excellent for a really good price and the service is very good.\n\nfood:\n1) <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> was the best i've ever tried so far. you could tell they used a lot of butter because it was so soft and flavorful!\n2) benedict - the eggs were poached perfectly and the hollandaise sauce was amazing. perfect execution of this dish.\n3) ranch potatoes were fantastic. they were seasoned perfectly and not overly salty. they didn't have that heavy, thick potato texture. it was lightly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.\n\nservice: the hostesses knew how to handle the influx of people waiting and the servers were friendly, helpful, and very efficient. we even got water refills without even having to ask.",

            "first...amazing <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>.  simply <mark>Deli</mark>.  the food is great with a large number of options.  staci, our server, was an amazing server.  i watched her explain items to us, as well as others.  she was very attentive and personable.   the only issues i would have are these.  1) i wanted a pancake and they only have large portions and no option for a single normal pancake to add to the side of a large omlet.  2) the potatoes were very salty...tasty...but too salty.  i don't mind a bit odd salt or spuce...but these were over the top with salt.\n\ngreat place for a nice breakfast.\n\ngive staci the trip to disneyland!", 
            "our server staci was awesome, and made us feel cared for as guests.  i appreciated that she asked whether we wanted full amount of cheese on <mark>The Works Omelette</mark> or butter on the toast, as it's nice to be made aware of some healthier changes to the food when dining in vegas.  i took one star off for the potatoes that were too salty to eat, but otherwise everything else was great.  i had the veggie omelette with added avocado and <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>.", 
            "i've been here since monday and today is wednesday finnally some real good food! chicken <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark> cooked to perfection gravy was on point and the potatoes works were seasoned and cooked just right! my husband got the egg <mark>Turkey Sausage or Turkey Bacon</mark> and toast soo good!! oh and the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>!! yum!!! \n\ni definitely recommend this place for the perfect breakfast!", 
            "i know this place can do without another 5 star review, but i think i want to move to vegas just for egg & i. we came in a group of 10, but service blew our minds away. at 1 pm on a saturday, we barely waited 10 minutes. our server took our orders quickly, and gave everyone a <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> on the house!\n\na couple of my friends and i split the blackened prime rib benedict (a must must must!), the strawberry cream-<mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> (tasted like fair food), and an italian omelette. enormous portions priced right--felt so bad leaving so much of it uneaten, especially since it was so <mark>Deli</mark>. even the coffee was the absolute perfect diner coffee.\n\ni don't think i can ever do a vegas trip without the egg & i. it's so worth the drive off the strip! and believe the hype--just stick to the <mark>Blackened Prime Rib Benny</mark> and you won't be disappointed.", 
            "gets packed around 10. you can call ahead to get your name on the list, but they will only  honor it for 30 minutes in advance. the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> is <mark>Deli</mark> with coffee. the potatoes were also <mark>Deli</mark> because of the seasoning they used. service was friendly and fast. i recommend their <mark>Original <mark>Cabo Breakfast Burrito</mark></mark>.", 
            "amazing, amazing experience here. the food and service was top notch here. they were able to accommodate our party of 10. regardless of our party size, they provided amazing service. we gave them a big fat tip. their <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> were to die for and possibly the best one i've ever had. i got the <mark>Spinach Benny</mark> and it was <mark>Deli</mark>. the other foods looked good and none of us had any com<mark>Plain</mark> during our meal. i think i will need to visit this place every time i'm in vegas. it's <mark>Deli</mark> with amazing service. can't go wrong!",

            "yes, being in vegas you would think the best places to eat would be on the famous strip. however, i've found that the restaurants worth pilgrimaging to are actually on the outskirts of the strip! i can't help it, i like to eat like a local. being a breakfast/brunch fanatic i figured i'd look to yelp to find a breakfast spot with big portions that won't break the wallet! i found egg & i as one of the best places to go to for brunch so i thought i'd give it a shot. \n\nthe ambiance has a small-town diner feel to it which i loved! the menu had way too many amazing options which made it difficult to decide what to eat. i chose to get the eggs benedict while the boyfriend had the <mark>Country Benny</mark>, both which were amazing! the portions were huge, the gravy is perfectly made, the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> is to die for, and the staff is always friendly and pleasant. now this is our \"go to\" brunch place to eat on sundays before we make the long trek back to california. this place is a must!",

            "absolutely amazing! the place was busy but we were still seated right away. we didn't have to wait at all for our food. our <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> were so fresh they were still warm. we all got different things off of the menu and liked everything we had. lisa was our waitress- she was very friendly, and very efficient.  we will definitely stop here again when we visit vegas!",

            "not the best breakfast/brunch place i've eaten at.  the pancakes were average and a bit too sweet with the strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> (and i have a huge sweet tooth).  and their famed <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> was maybe too hyped up, so my expectations were not in line with what i actually tasted.  not to say that it wasn't good. you do get a lot of food for the money though, considering you're in vegas, so it's a steal. and the service was very friendly, like being in a diner where everyone knows your name. so if you're looking for a fix of good old fashioned, artery-clogging american breakfast, this would be a good option in vegas if you don't want to break the bank in a casino establishment.", 
            "the egg and i, and chicken <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark>!\n\nexperience:  i met some friends for early lunch or late breakfast.  it was pretty busy for 11:00 on a thursday.  \n\nfacility:  fairly good size place with a dinner atmosphere. there were murals on the walls,  and typical tables and chairs with some half booth seating too. \n\nservice:  not the best service i ever had, but not the worst. doesn't seem to be one set waitress per table...this can be a good or bad thing. it took a good 10 minutes before someone took my drink order, we had to flag someone a few times, and after the food came, no one did the check back to make sure we didn't need anything else....but when they did help us, they were friendly and quick. \n\nfood:  a girlfriend and i decided to split two meals, so we could try more.  we ordered the \"chili relleno eggs benedict\" special, and we got the \"chicken <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark> with over easy eggs and <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>.\"  \nthe muffin came out warm and it was pretty tasty.  would have been perfect if they served some butter with it. \nthe benedict was good. i love the chili taste that cut the richness of the benedict. \n<mark>The Crazy Chicken</mark> <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark> was good, but not the best i ever had. it was crispy outside and a nice southern white gravy on the side to dip it in. i really did enjoy the hash brown potatoes on the side.  when they first came out, i thought i wouldn't like them because they looked to have too much seasoning on them.  however, they actually had just the right amount, and it had a lawrys season salt flavor. \n\noverall:  i would definitely come back here again. they have so many good things in the menu i want to try.  see yah soon!!", 
            "ambiance: 4 - it was okay inside, kind of a cross between homey restaurant, diner and cafeteria. it was bright inside, lots of families, and it felt nice in there..like when you went out for breakfast in the 90s on a bright sunday morning.\n\nservice: 4 - i thought that the service was good. the servers are always smiling and genuinely kind. they are constantly concerned about your food and if everything is tasting good. \n\nfood: 3 - my disclaimer: i really only came here to eat eggs. i did not want any meat other than bacon. i strictly came here for really, really plain ol' breakfast food, and not anything else.\n\ni got a really boring item called \"<mark>The Classic</mark>\", but i really wanted just eggs and bacon, so that's what i went with. my over easy eggs were cooked perfectly. i mean, they were absolutely perfect. some cooks leave the yolk barely runny on the inside, but they are experts at eggs here..and i have no com<mark>Plain</mark>. \n\nthe <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> was soft and moist, but i just didn't like the taste of it. i think i'm just picky, but the banana in the muffin tasted a little ripe. the potatoes were good, but they weren't great. the bacon was a little overcooked and a little too hard for me. \n\ni totally forgot to check yelp before ordering, but next time, i'll order a healthy omelet and see how that goes!!",

Sour Cream</mark>. came with a heaping side of potatoes and choice of bread - i got wheat.\n\noverall i was kind of underwhelmed by the dish. usually i love chorizo, but for some reason this omelette just did not meld like it should. \n\nservice was slow. yes, it was busy on a saturday, but there came a point when my husband looked up and said, \"where's the food?\". never a good sign when you actually start questioning whether or not they put the order in.\n\nthey did have a very yummy <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>, which i highly suggest getting if you come here. and (as of this writing) if you check in on yelp, you get one for free!\n\nthis is definitely a go-to breakfast spot if you live in the area. but, if you live elsewhere in the valley i am sure you can find a place that is just as good, if not better. i still like black bear diner over egg & i for breakfast.",

            "dragged an unwilling family to try a new breakfast place while we were in vegas. i was able to convince them on the basis of the high yelp ratings/reviews.  unfortunately, the experience did not meet expectations.  \n\nthe wait was about 20 minutes on a weekday, at around 10:30am.  not too bad.  a testament to the efficient staff and their ability to keep things moving.  but:  pancakes were doughy/floury and heavy.  neither of my kids could eat more than 1/3-1/2 even with coaxing and bribery.  i ordered eggs benedict but it was nothing special. worst part is there was a distinct fake butter/margarine aftertaste (which is a pet peeve of mine).  it was a definite disappointment.  my husband had some sort of corned <mark>Homemade Corn Beef Hash</mark> but his lack of commentary tells me it wasn't great.  maybe we ordered the wrong menu items?  \n\nthe free <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> for checking in on yelp was nice and the staff were friendly and efficient. too bad the food didn't match.  we don't understand the hype...", 
            "amazing! the food was great and the service was awesome! <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>!!!! it seems they get really busy friday-sunday so make sure you give yourself enough time. i will for sure be going back!", 
            "i love it here! the food is always amazing and the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> are bomb! i also had such great service this time from chance, a waitress there.", 
            "at a little before 7am on a sunday morning, the place was almost deserted.  this was a little worrisome, but we soon realized that this said far more about the vegas population than it did about the quality of the breakfast.  here's the best recommendation i can give about the food: i came back for breakfast the next day!  and we would have come back the third morning except that we had to be on the road before they opened at 6am!\n\nwe got off to a good start.  when the waitress found out this was our first visit, she brought us a warm <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> to try.  it's a house special and well worth getting.\n\nwhen you open up the newspaper-like menu, the first thing you'll notice is the words habla diablo in blazing red appearing in the descriptions of at least half the dishes.  my wife wanted the <mark>Spinach Benny</mark>, but was concerned about the <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark> because the name sounded spicy and she's a self-proclaimed spice wimp.  the waitress ex<mark>Plain</mark> that it wasn't spicy at all, that habla diablo is the owner's side company and he had just redone the menu to emphasize his products.  my wife went ahead with her <mark>Spinach Benny</mark> and i got the <mark>Loco Moco</mark>, with an extra side of the <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark>.  (it turns out that the habla diablo seasoning is a lot like lawry's seasoned salt.)\n\nmy wife really liked her <mark>Spinach Benny</mark>, but didn't care for the potatoes.  (but she's not a big fan of breakfast potatoes to begin with.)  i liked the potatoes and finished most of hers in addition to mine.  plus the <mark>Loco Moco</mark> was the best i've had on the mainland!\n\nthe next day, i came back on my own, but with orders to bring back something good to my wife in the hotel.  this time i had the biscuits & gravy, which were great.  but, fair warning, they were pretty salty -- well within my tolerance, but if you are sensitive to salt, you might want to steer clear.   then i picked out the <mark>California Crepe</mark> for my wife, which the waitress was happy to pack up for me to take back.  i asked to substitute some fruit for the <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark>, and she packed up a huge container of fresh fruit.  my wife loved the <mark>California Crepe</mark>, except for one thing -- it was way too big for her to finish!", 
            "had <mark>The Classic</mark> burrito and <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>. muffin was <mark>Deli</mark>! burrito came with a side of potatoes that was yummy. didn't care much for the sauce that came with the burrito. the service was great!", 
            "this is an egg-cellent choice for breakfast off the strip. don't forget to check-in on yelp to get your free <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>! \n\nthere were 5 of us and despite it being busy they seated us in less then 5 minutes. i had the <mark>Mashed Potato Omelette</mark> which was <mark>Deli</mark>. little pieces of bacon in the potatoes made the dish complete. other people at my table were satisfied with their omelettes and <mark>Loco Moco</mark>.\n\nthey have a sad egg face you can display if you need service immediately, but we didn't have to use it since our waitress genesis was on the ball. \n\nfor 5 people to eat, grab juices and coffee it was under $80, a true bargain compared to our other meals in vegas. \n\neat here and make your belly happy  :-)",

me, so that i could park. as soon as she walked in, she called me. she said that the place was a mess and she was going to have to come out and wait the 15 minutes it was going to take to be seated. nevertheless, the hostess pointed out some empty benches, around the corner. so, i walked in to wait.\n\nupon entering, i was discouraged because a lot of people were standing around waiting. i just knew it was going to take 30+ minutes. surprisingly, it only took 15 minutes before we were called and seated.\n\nthe place is really small and packed to capacity, so i was thankful that we got to sit around the corner where there were only about 4-5 tables. we had plenty space.\n\nthe server came around fast to take our drink order. she was quick to bring our drinks back too. she asked us if we were ready to order and we said, \"no, we're looking at yelp pictures and we need some more time.\" i did ask about the stuff <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> dish that someone shared on yelp. she smiled and pointed it out and said that it's a popular dish. then she left and took orders for people that was around us.\n\nas soon as she walked away, we decided what we wanted, but it took her about 6 minutes to make eye contact again. when she did stop back by, she asked if we were still looking at pictures or if we were ready to order. we went ahead and ordered. it totally slipped my mind to check in and get a free muffin for myself. the waitress said, \"you were on yelp, did you check in to get the free muffin?\" i was happy she reminded me to do that.\n\nshe came back a couple minutes later and brought 2 muffins. i don't even like <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> but i took it anyways because it was free. i took a bite of it and fell in love. it was so warm and yummy lol. my friend got emotional lol. she said it reminded her of childhood, when her mother used to make them. they were just <mark>Deli</mark>.\n\nabout 12-15 minutes later, our food started to roll out. i order the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> with eggs, cheese and sausage on it. it also came with <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark>. it looked incredible. my friend ordered the 2 <mark>Seasoned Center Cut Pork Chops</mark> that came with 2 eggs, the muffin, that she had already ate, and the <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark>. her's looked <mark>Deli</mark> too.\n\ni love potatoes so i ate those first. i put ketchup all over them and had a ball. my friend didn't like hers, because they were kind of crunchy, so she gave them to me. i put ketchup on them and finished them off too lol.\n\nnext, i started in on my <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> sandwiches. i didn't like the sandwiches. the sausages, eggs <mark>Cheese <mark>Ham, Bacon or Sausage <mark>Mushroom and Cheese</mark></mark></mark> didn't have much flavor. i thought i made a big mistake. being that i'm so smart, i thought to scrape the sausages and eggs off the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> and season the filling myself. i did, and it was 90% better. i ate the filling separately, and ever so often, i would dip the <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark> in the warm syrup that came with my food.\n\nmy friend said that the <mark>Seasoned Center Cut Pork Chops</mark> were just okay. they were really thin, for sure. i don't know why, but we were expecting some big juicy chops vs the breakfast chops. i wanted to taste the chops for myself, so she took a bite of mine and i took a bite of hers. they tasted as if onions were the main and secondary seasoning. she was right. they were just okay. she did enjoy my mixture of filling and seasoning though.\n\nthe good thing is, we got really full and still had a bunch of food left. i'm sure it has something to do with a humongous portion of potatoes we got and the muffin we were served in the beginning.\n\nthe service was like a 3/5 because there was a little piece of hair in my water when the server dropped it off. i asked for another one and she just stared at my full cup for like 10 seconds. i guess she couldn't understand my reason behind needing another one. i didn't even mention it because it wasn't a big deal and i didn't want anyone to make a big deal over water.\n\nbut also, i took some points off service, because it took my sever a long time to refill my water, once i had actually finished it. it took her maybe 4 or 5 minutes to check on us, after we finished eating too. we just wanted a box to pack up leftovers. when she did stop back by, we asked for the box, she quickly picked one up, dropped it off and walked away. she came back around maybe 3 or 4 minutes later and told us to pay upfront. we were just sitting there, waiting for her to come back by so that we could pay and leave. i'm glad she did stop back by because we probably would have been sitting there for a while.\n\nalthough i'm in love with the potatoes and muffins, i probably won't go back because the rest of the food was just average.",

            "this is a great breakfast option off the strip. took my family here for breakfast recently and had enjoyable experience. \n\nit's about a 10 minute drive from main casinos, located in strip mall. popular dining spot for locals and gets packed on weekends. luckily, we arrived early before the breakfast rush and were seated immediately. good thing too, 20 minutes after a bus load of people arrived and place was full.\n\ncountry style atmosphere and d\\u00e9cor provide the perfect backdrop for their food. both indoor and outdoor patio seating is available. old-fashioned breakfasts are the specialty here, including huge omelet platters, pancakes, eggs benedict and a large selection of house specialties. prices are reasonable and large portions. i highly recommend trying their famous <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>. omg, so good! super moist and the flavor profile is off the charts. i got mine free with my yelp check-in. you can also substitute the toast that comes with your breakfast entr\\u00e9es for a muffin. \n\nwe ordered \"the works\" scramble, <mark><mark>Fresh Veggie</mark></mark> omelet and the hawaiian breakfast spam and eggs. everything was fantastic! served in large skillet, the scramble was yummy. it's loaded with sausage, ham, bacon, onions, tomatoes, green bell peppers and mushrooms, served with <mark>Hash Browns</mark> and topped with the fluffiest scramble eggs. enough for 2, i literally devoured everything and no regrets. i loved the taste and texture of the <mark>Hash Browns</mark>, lightly crisp and tender. i usually prefer shredded kind, but this was equally nice. of course, who doesn't love spam and eggs for breakfast? simple hawaiian-pinoy breakfast done well here, served with steam rice. just the way us locals love them.\n\nmost of the time we usually dine along the strip because it's convenient. egg and i was definitely worth the drive and waking up early for. service was excellent too. our server did a phenomenal job, friendly and refilled our coffee regularly. still thinking about those <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>. looking forward to coming back.",

Sour Cream</mark>.  it is served with <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark> and a choice <mark>Side of Toast</mark> or a house made <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>.    \n\nthe omelet was cooked to perfection.  it was served hot, light and fluffy. the cacophony of ingredients came together to form the perfect symphony of <mark>Deli</mark>.   my preference for breakfast potatoes is <mark>Hash Browns</mark>.  i love them!  the <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark> were a treat and a nice departure from the hash brown rut i'd been in.  the high point of the meal was however was the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>(s).   they serve one almost like an appetizer when sit down before you order.  you get a free one with a yelp check in.   it told our waitress, chance (awesome las vegas name) how much i liked them and she sent me home with a couple of extra.  bless her!  i'm not a huge fan of <mark>Banana</mark>.  in fact i hate everything about them but the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> here changed my mind.  it's worth a trip to egg & i just for muffins.\n\nto summarize, great food, fun local ambience, extremely friendly staff.  i'd repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat...",

            "1st visit, good choice yelpers! sausage & biscuits were good, short on sausage in the gravy so they brought out a complimentary plate of sausage to take care of that, very thoughtful & much appreciated. our waitress amanda was very sweet & intent on making sure we were enjoying our breakfast. fiesta skillet was perfect, great flavors, not too spicy w a lot of cheese, green chiles, & perfectly cooked eggs.\nall those raving about the banana wal<mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> were right, it is <mark>Deli</mark>, dark brown (molasses added?), moist and perfectly cooked. almost glad my wife is allergic to walnuts so i could eat it all! very large portions, we ate a little more than 1/2 of each of our meals & were more than full. \nway better than the casinos & a lot better value. enjoy!!",

            "solid breakfast joint!\n\nwe decided to go off the strip for breakfast this past weekend to save some money. i swear we always spend at least $50 on breakfast when we eat in the hotels. breakfast at egg & i was under $30 :)\n\nthey were busy when we arrived and we waited about 15 minutes to be seated. they put us on the patio, luckily it wasn't too hot yet and there was one table left with shade. it was tolerable.\n\nservice was decent but not over the top. they have a system where if you need something you flip over a plastic egg on the table and the waitress will come back. seems like they never check on you unless you flip the egg.\n\nbreakfast was good. i had the eggs benedict with bacon instead of canadian bacon. one of the bacon slices was too fatty and not cooked enough, but the other one was good. the hollandaise was tasty, although a little runny. the potatoes on the side had a nice flavor to them.\n\nbf had their daily special, which was <mark>Cinnamon Roll</mark> <mark>Stuffed <mark><mark>Strawberry <mark>Bagel with <mark>Cream Cheese</mark></mark> <mark>Banana Bread French Toast</mark></mark></mark></mark>. it was really good, had a custard batter. too sweet for me, but he enjoyed it a lot. that was also served with a little cup of yummy cinnamon apples. i liked those very much.\n\nyou pay at the register, which is kind of annoying because that area is already super cramped with people waiting and there isn't really anywhere to stand in line to pay without getting in somebody's way. overall though, a good breakfast place. if you're willing to drive a couple minutes off the strip to save some cash, i recommend this place!",

Sour Cream</mark>.  it is served with <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark> and a choice <mark>Side of Toast</mark> or a house made <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>.    \n\nthe omelet was cooked to perfection.  it was served hot, light and fluffy. the cacophony of ingredients came together to form the perfect symphony of <mark>Deli</mark>.   my preference for breakfast potatoes is <mark>Hash Browns</mark>.  i love them!  the <mark>Habla Diablo Seasoned Potatoes</mark> were a treat and a nice departure from the hash brown rut i'd been in.  the high point of the meal was however was the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark>(s).   they serve one almost like an appetizer when sit down before you order.  you get a free one with a yelp check in.   it told our waitress, chance (awesome las vegas name) how much i liked them and she sent me home with a couple of extra.  bless her!  i'm not a huge fan of <mark>Banana</mark>.  in fact i hate everything about them but the <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> here changed my mind.  it's worth a trip to egg & i just for muffins.\n\nto summarize, great food, fun local ambience, extremely friendly staff.  i'd repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat..."

            "our friday morning breakfast club seems to be expanding and we ventured out to the egg and i with a few new members. looking back, we should have chosen a different location to welcome new members. i was not impressed with the waitress, who seemed to cop an attitude when reminded she sh<mark>Hot or Herbal Tea</mark> us a water. of course i got <mark>The Crazy Chicken</mark> <mark>Country Fried Steak</mark>, but was met with resistance when trying to substitute a pancake for my choice of bread. i was told i could not substitute, even if paying an up charge, and would have to actually get an order of pancakes. this is the first time i have run into this problem. she also told us we could not get separate checks at the table and would have to take care of that at the register. this turned out to be a fustercluck and inconvenienced the customers behind us at the register. the cfs itself was good, as were the potatoes. the eggs were eggs. i was leaning towards two stars, but the quality of the food helped to compensate for the difficult waitress.", 
            "i went here based on the yelp reviews.  lots of locals mixed with tourists.  seated right away and even on a monday morning was jammed packed with people. i had the cheese, spinach & egg omelet. even though it is not on the menu, you can design your own omelette.  so i designed one just for me, i asked for fruit rather than potatoes no extra charge to change the sides the fruit was amazing -big pieces of  pineapple, orange, grapefruit, watermelon, canteloupe and honeydew.  everything was yummy including the home made <mark>Banana Nut Muffin</mark> and we took a few to go.  good place for breakfast, nice menu selection and carole ann was a great waitress.  the total cost including two breakfasts, 3 muffins to go, 2 <mark>Hot or Herbal Tea</mark>, = $31.00 with tax & tip.  very good breakfast & service.", 
            "this is our favorite brunch spot!  they have the best service and the freshest, <mark>Hot or Herbal Tea</mark>, most scrumptious food in town.  we often bring friends and family for a special occasion, or not. :-)  we're never disappointed.  be warned, they can be very busy, especially on a sunday. so plan ahead, but even with a reasonable wait, you won't be disappointed!"
