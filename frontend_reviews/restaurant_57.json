            "for $26, get the all-you-can-eat menu.  the sushi is only ok and not authentic japanese food.  the <mark>Fresh Oyster</mark>, ika with massago, uni, beef terriyaki, and salad are not bad.  the service and chefs are really friendly.", 
            "went here for the ayce sushi, and it was simply bomb.com. \nend of story. \n\nok, i'll tell you more. they have more than just sushi on the menu - great steak, delicious <mark>Fresh Oyster</mark>, and best of all great service!! they didn't rush us, the sushi came out in a timely manner, but not all at once so we didn't get overwhelmed.\n\ndid i mention the amazing service?? cause it really was! i swear with all of the ayce sushi places around vegas, the menu doesn't vary too much, so the service really will determine if i come back to a place or not. \n\nand i will be back!! thanks for a great experience, and obviously a full tummy :)", 
            "first time visit \nmade a reservation \ndid not wait at all \nfood \nsushi :  3 star too much rice\nroll: ok \nappetiser : 3 star  ( surf and turf, <mark>Fresh Oyster</mark> )\ntable was sticky \nstaff : ok \noverrall 3 star", 
            "random nights with good friends are always a blast!  i've always said it.  spontaneity really makes the activity better!  so when i was invited last minute for a sushi dinner, i knew it was going to be fun.  we settled on a place one of us raved about.  i've been to soyo restaurant many times but never oyshi.  time to yelp!\n\nthe only down side of this place is the location.  i live across town from here.  oyshi is in a really cool strip mall in my opinion.  first, you have one of my favorite korean joints.  now you have my favorite fried rice joint, rice trax.  this location, although far, will be frequented a lot.  although the wait was super long, the restaurant is pretty cool.  love the concrete floors, the wood accents in the front and the half table chairs, half booth options for seating.  our service was pretty good.  multiple servers came by our table at most times.  it was enjoyable. \n\nfor dinner at a sushi joint in vegas, the only way to go is to get the ayce special (all you can eat).  this place charges a $26 price tag.  the one thing that threw me for a loop were the rules involved.  i've never seen a place have all their rules listed on their menu.  with this dinner, you can literally order anything off the menu.  granted, there are a few items that limit one per person, but you have access to everything.  my recommendations to get the most out of your ayce is to stick to non-rice dishes.  i know, i know, it's a sushi joint, but trust me.  you can eat so much more if you stick to the protein.  for dinner, here's what i got, grouped in categories:\n\nthings i loved: <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> (with sesame seeds), <mark>Fresh Oyster</mark> (with ponzu sauce, green onions and hot sauce), <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark> (topped with yum yum sauce and ponzu), <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark> (always a hit), shrimp tempura (lightly breaded), chicken yakitori (2 skewers with dark meat chicken and yakitori sauce), \n\nthings i liked but kind of disappointed with: <mark>Ahi Poke</mark> - bowl filled with <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>, shredded cucumbers and onions on the top, was small chunks of tuna with a little sesame seeds.  kind of a disappointment.  i understand that tuna is expensive, but the dish was 75% salad and 25% tuna, which should have been the star of the show. \n\nthings that were questionable:  yellowtail or hamachi nigiri - if there's any rice dish i get, it's nigiri because of the small portions. the yellowtail is usually my favorite fish, however, this specific yellowtail was a little discolored and questionable to me.  i took a bite and ended up finishing the dish but it didn't taste like what i'm used to.  make sure it's fresh!\n\nall in all, this place is actually good.  i'm definitely coming back for another ayce session.  the place is still convenient and the staff is nice.  if you're looking for a good sushi joint on the sw side of vegas, for sure check them out!", 
            "i have always enjoyed oyshi, ever since it opened years ago, i've been a huge fan! it was the first ayce sushi place i had ever been to. and after all this time, they still serve up pretty yummy eats!\n\nambiance: 3 - the space is intimate, but at the same time, still pretty well lit. usually has a good amount of people inside, i recommend calling in advance, especially with a big party.\n\nservice: 4 - service is okay, especially when you call in a big party reservation; everything came out fast and hot for our bday party celebration! it's also pretty fast seated at the bar.\n\nwhen you're not at the \"party tables\", regular service is a bit slow! i really hope they get better, but it's been that way for a while. also, they charged full price for a kid under 10! say whaa?! \n\nfood: 4 - i have a like/love relationship with the food. so i'll just tell you my absolute favorite dishes to order: love affair, <mark>Fresh Oyster</mark>, <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark>, japanese lasagna roll, vegas roll, garlic tuna nigiri, oyshi roll, strawberry mochi, green tea <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>, and the <mark>Ahi Poke</mark> :) all delish and some of the best sushi around. though, not a huge fan of all of the nigiri that they serve.\n\noyshi is always a fun time for me, so i hope that everyone that has a big reservation or sits at the bar feels the same way as well!", 
            "oyshi sushi bar restaurant is definitely a must go! i've been here three times since it has been introduced to me on july 5th of 2014. it obviously hasn't been that long ago and it has already taken my interest and satisfies my cravings! i love their ayce pricing ($21 lunch/$26 dinner) and of course the all-you-can-eat selections! i highly suggest their yellowtail with pico de gallo, <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>, <mark>Fresh Oyster</mark>, and shrimp tempura as starters to prepare you for this sushi selection like kami kaze, dragon, rock n' roll, catepillar, treasure and etc. seriously though, this place is amazingly delicious. my only complaint as to why i gave this place a four star instead of a five because customer service can take you a long way and two out of the three times i've been here was a little below fair. it took them almost 20 mins in order to finally give us some attention and take our second order, they didn't refill our drinks unless asked and our wait for our entree was quite some time. asides that, the food is heavenly mouth-watering and the ayce pricing is good!"

            "their service kinda sucks, but the food is excellent.  i always do the ayce and usually got for the bonsai roll, <mark>Ahi Poke</mark>, gyoza, <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark>, <mark>Grilled Beef Asparagus</mark> and some sushi (garlic tuna, cajun albacore)  yum!!", 
            "excellent service as well as fresh high quality fish. i've read some reviews where people say the service was horrible and it took over 30 minutes to receive their food. here's an idea... enjoy the company and talk with the people around you instead of staring at your watch. i did not experience bad service. everyone asked if we needed anything often enough to keep our glasses filled and our stomachs full. \n\nnow on to the amazing food! we had the <mark>Ahi Poke</mark>. super fresh fish and delicious flavor. ordered some hand rolls, yum yum and dragon. once again the unagi and scallops were fresh and delicious. i have to say though that things only got better with the last two rolls. the double screaming roll and the hawaiian roll made the meal! i used to be a huge sushi mon and wasabi fan but i think i found my new favorite. i was so impressed by the quality of food and the flavor i can't wait to go back.", 
            "we went there on last saturday nite expecting full house, but the place was only 3/4 full.  we sat at the wide open bar for all-you-can-eat so it's easier to order sushi from the chef. our first impression was good atmosphere and hip music.\n\nwe found the service excellent, contrary to some reviews. maybe because it was not busy or from over staffing, we were asked \"how is everything?\" every 5 minutes, even thought we were sitting at the bar.\n\nthe food was just ok. we liked the <mark>Ahi Poke</mark>, spider hand roll, white tuna, and especially the green tiramisu. on the other hand, we were not excited about the <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark>, bland tasting sushi, water-down soy sauce, light wasabi, and $2.50 xtra for hot tea.\n\nover all, we thought $67 for two ayce including 15% tip is just a little higher than most places in town especially for average food.\n\nwe might or might not go back.", 
            "i would've given this place 5 stars, had i reviewed it the first time i ate there. i don't quite remember what i had the first time coming into this restaurant, but i do remember having their blue<mark>Vanilla- Berry Parfait</mark>, and that alone deserved 5 stars! my second visit to oyshi was for dinner, and i ordered the <mark>Ahi Poke</mark> salad, the love affair sushi roll, and a parfait of course! the salad and the sushi roll were excellent, the best part was probably the love affair sushi roll.. probably the best roll i had in a while, from what i remember, it had lobster and crab meat, it was awesome! so here it goes, if so excellent, why the 4 stars you ask.. \n\nwell.. the parfait. it was so much bigger and tastier the first time around.. from what i recall, it was served in a taller glass the last time, more <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> and more toppings.. this time, it was skimped down to a smaller glass, and yes, smaller glass means smaller parfait. it also lacked the toppings i once remembered it had. therefore, i conclude this review by saying oyshi is an awesome restaurant, but they need to overcome this economic slump by serving more not less! =)", 
            "i can't give this place a 4 or 5 because the last time my friends and i went here the service was horrible...especially coming from a certain female server. she was slow with our orders and kind of stand-offish. i understand if you are having a bad night but don't ruin it for the customer.\n\nother than that, the food is great and i have never had any problems with it. the all-you-can-eat price is worth it especially if you know you are going to eat more than one roll including appetizers.\n\nthe <mark>Ahi Poke</mark> can use a little bit more pieces of tuna instead of being drowned in daikon and seaweed but it is still good.", 
            "i decided that i wanted ayce sushi last night (saturday) so i headed over to oyshi.  i checked in with the host at about 8:30pm and was informed that it would be about 20 minutes for a table.  it was a nice night, so i just grabbed a chair on the sidewalk in front and waited for the other half of my party to arrive.  there were probably four or five other small groups of people milling about waiting for tables too.\n\nwe were seated at the bar just after 9:00pm.  the place seemed pretty busy...  some uncleared tables, a couple large parties (one with kids) occupied the \"vip\" rooms behind us.  it was on the noisy side, especially with the techno/house/electronica music pumping from the ceiling speakers above the four chef's stations.\n\nafter a few minutes we were greeted by a friendly server who confirmed our ayce preference, took our drinks and asked if we were ready to put in our first round of orders.  we were.  i started with <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark>, an assortment of nigiri style items, an \"<mark>Ahi Poke</mark>\" and an order of four oysters (limit 1).  note:  i thought it was interesting that even though we were seated at the bar, our sushi requests were made with the server.  i guess the server was attempting to queue the orders for the very busy chefs.\n\nthe nigiri items on first order arrived quickly and we were told be the chef in front of us that the oysters would be out in a \"little while\".  the nigiri items were nicely presented and of good quality.  the <mark>Ahi Poke</mark> was just a small clump of chopped tuna on top of a mix of <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> and sprinkled with sesame seed (not exactly what i think of when i think poke, but i'm not trying to get techincal up in here son).\n\nthe oysters came out a few minutes later.  they were covered in green onion, a bit of masago and a squirt of sriracha.  i can only assume that the toppings were meant to cover up the tasteless, been sitting in a fresh-water tank, half-dollar sized oysters.  engh, i figured i'd keep moving forward, after all this was ayce...\n\nround two:  more nigiri (including surf clam, tamago, masago, quail egg, tako, and scallop), something called \"oyshi scallop\", and a spider roll.  we also ordered the chicken, beef and shrimp yakitori, which were all paired with asparagus and came sitting in a sweet teriyaki sauce.  again the nigiri items were of nice quality.  i'm not sure we ever got the \"oyshi scallop\".  there were two items in the order that looked like a krab salad (the california roll stuff) that i was sure we didn't order.  the spider roll was basically a california roll with one meager soft-shell crab in it, and it had been covered in the same bbq sauce they put on the eel.\n\nsince i was disappointed with the spider roll and i love soft-shell crab, i put in an order for a monster roll, which was also supposed to have soft-shell crab in it.  what came out was something similar to the spider (covered in the same eel sauce) only with the addition of a few slivers of eel and a refrigerator cold tempura shrimp stuffed into it.  slow down on that eel sauce dawg.\n\nat this point, i was pretty full and done trying...  the sushi chef in front of us was closing down his station, giving it a quick wash down with a wet rag and mumbling something about this night being his \"early out\".  by this time the dining room was starting to clear out too, but the party with the kids were still in our audible vicinity.\n\ni finished up my second pot of hot tea (which was a nice quality loose leaf green) and enjoyed a green tea <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> mochi ball.  both of these items were good.\n\nafter tipping out the chefs, server and taking care of the bill, i had spent about $75 for the two of us.  i'm not sure i'll be back anytime soon, but i made the best of it while i was there.", 
            "this buffet is heaven!\n\neverytime i visit vegas i will have to visit oyshi. i live in chicago and basically oyshi's sushi buffet kicks all the other sushi buffet's butts in chicago. oyshi has a very contempory & modern decor to it, with a cool geisha painting on one of the huge walls. \n\nmy dinner at oyshi was so fast, i couldn't even comprehend the food i ate. for starters - the mussels are a must and so is the <mark>Ahi Poke</mark> which is very fresh tuna. \n\ntheir sushi selection on the menu is so vast you don't even know what to order. if i had to pick only one sushi roll from the menu it would have to be the volcano roll.\n\nthe price is definitely worth this buffet which is around $26.", 
            "for $21 (lunch) or $26 (dinner) you can indulge in all you can eat sushi and sides. the difference between lunch and dinner is that lunch excludes oysters and something else they list on the front of the menu. aside from that, you can indulge in any roll or hot item. sashimi's off limits. \n\nkeep in mind that the rolls, regular priced, run for about $13 each so you might as well pay the $26 the ayce option and sample as much as you feel like... unless you're one of those freaks that can eat one roll and be satisfied... \n\nthe catch to the rolls was as i suspected- tons of rice. one roll was so loaded that i felt my body refusing to chew any more of it. the sushi was another story- the amount of rice was fair. oh, and sidenote, you're charged regular price for anything you remove or fail to consume the rice from. \n\nit seems that the best way to fill up without tapping out too early is to focus on the hot items and sushi- fill up on surf and turf, calamari, and <mark>Ahi Poke</mark> salad and pick maybe one or two rolls that sound too good to deny yourself of them. or, you could be me and go roll crazy and have to fight yourself to chew. \n\nthere are very tempting dessert options, of which you're limited to one (sad!) bring friends and share all four. the mochi (mango or raspberry) was tiny, but i can imagine it was a refreshing treat. i had the <mark>Trio Of Creme Brulee</mark> and my friend had the green tiramisu. both were absolutely wonderful. the green tiramisu was a first for me and it was so exciting to eat. creamy, yet subtle, yet sweet. \n\nthe only qualm i have with my experience was that we were there on a day when the sushi kitchen was hopelessly backed up. all of our hot food came out quickly, but the sushi took what felt like forever to appear. it became an issue for friends who didn't order hot food and waited well over an hour to eat anything. \n\nluckily the two-hour ordering limit was not applied to us or else this would be a fishy deal!", 
            "damn, where do i start... this place has one of the best ayce sushi bar for a price under $30. i love japanese food, so i'm quite critical when it comes to quality. the quality here is equal to the quality in japan.\n\nfor starters, i'd begin with the <mark>Ahi Poke</mark>, shrimp & asparagus, dynamite and <mark>Rib Eye Steak Teriyaki</mark>. \n\nwhen you're ready for battle, i'd suggest the yellowtail trio, atomic bomb, red dragon, and bonzai rolls!\n\nto complete the food madness, grab some mochi green tea <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>!\n\nso who's down for a vegas run?", 
            "i just realized that i have not yet written a review for my favorite sushi spot on earth! here it goes!! although i have not been here in months because i moved on the opposite end of vegas, now turning into a 30 minute drive, compared to a 5 minute drive =(\n\nwhere: located on rainbow & robindale\n\nwhat:  everything about this local sushi joint is outstanding! from the uniqueness of the special rolls to the to the great customer service, this is the place to try!\n\nif you do get the chance to come here for your first, second, or millionth time, i suggest ayce all the way!! lunch is 24.95 and dinner is 27.95- so worth the time and money spent!\n\none of my favorite appetizers is the <mark>Ahi Poke</mark>! there's something about the mixture that makes you want to order 5 of them and make your own dish!\n\nrolls:\n-oyshi roll: the first thing you should try! it is their special roll, and the absolute best!!\n-vegas & sibuya rolls: if i can recall, these are the 2 rolls without rice! & are both full of flavor!\n-japanese lasagna roll: i always have to have my baked roll!!\n\nthere are other great rolls, but i can't remember what the names were! so, until next time! i will update soon!\n\n*note: you also get a free dessert with ayce!! there are the fruit&yogurt parfait, <mark>Trio Of Creme Brulee</mark>, <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>, or mochi!", 
            "consistently good food and consistently bad service.. what can i say i am torn.  they have a great menu of rolls, decent ayce prices, their <mark>Ahi Poke</mark> is on point, but on the other hand i have had too many bad service experiences from them to count.. for that i would say there is better in vegas and its worth looking for.", 
            "(4.5 stars)\n\nmy trip to vegas would not be complete without a visit to oyshi sushi. though it's off strip, i'm lucky my best friend lives close enough so we can make a trip every time i'm there. \n\nmy last visit was the first time i've done their all you can eat deal, and for $26, it was well worth it! the only things it doesn't include are the chef's special sashimi, so all your appetizers, salads, specialty rolls and desserts are included. my friends and i went all out and ordered several to share of every course. oysters were delicious and <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark> (while too much mayo sauce) was to die for. tempura dishes are nice and crispy and not too soggy or heavy. my favorite salad is their <mark>Ahi Poke</mark> on top of <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> - yum! we shared 6 specialty rolls that were all delicious in their own ways. again their specialty \"yum yum\" sauce is \"yum yum\", but in small amounts. the <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> is like the type you buy at the store, but again, it's all part of the deal so might as well indulge! we also got a bottle of lychee flavored cold sake that was decently priced and balanced the sweet:alcohol ratio perfectly.\n\nservice is good: unless its super busy, the wait staff always comes up to check on your group, make sure your water is filled, etc. as with any sushi place, baked rolls will take longer, so be patient! they did forget one of our orders at one point, but since we were eating so much, it gave us time to digest.\n\nif you can make the trip out with a group who enjoys sharing specialty rolls and can throw down in eating, oyshi is the place to go!", 
            "ever since i can remember, sushi-mon (the one on silverado ranch/maryland pkwy) has been my favorite go-to spot. words couldn't describe how good it is. but i decided to try something new. this place had 270 reviews with an average of four stars. so they must be doing something right.\n\nafter one minute of walking the wrong way..we finally got into the entrance..by following the arrows...\n\ndecor was really nice, bigger than the usual sushi bars. great location too. the vip room and lounge room was a nice touch. it was slow mind you, during lunch when i walked in with my \"friend\" karlee. we started off with, my favorite <mark>Ahi Poke</mark> and <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark>. karlee had the soup as well and gyoza. <mark>Ahi Poke</mark> was ok, but not better than sushi mon, the flavor wasn't just there. miso was good, not fantastic. karlee loved the gyoza, she said it was better than the other sushi place she goes that serves it. \n\ni had the j&b roll, baked, with salmon and cream cheese. it was good, juicy, hand a hint of soy sauce. hats off to the sushi chef because it was awesome. i had a cucumber roll, asian strip steak and this deep fried california roll, with hot mustard and albacore tuna. all was great but the j&b roll was the highlight. karlee had 2 orders of the shrimp tempura roll, apparently it was good, i couldn't have any because i am allergic to shrimp. she tried to force feed it to me, knowing i was allergic, i think she tried to kill me, because i tried to make fun of her sirarcha/hot mayo sauce that she custom made..oh and she had <mark>Chicken Teriyaki</mark> and i think another order of gyoza, apparently she loves that stuff.\n\n the service was a little slow, especially when they weren't busy. this was all you can eat, and what i was shocked about how they did not serve half rolls!! i was like wtf? how could i possibly try more than 3 types. other than that the waitress seemed puzzled and brought us the wrong dishes a couple of times. no big deal. the food was great, service was so-so, and it is a place i would come back to again. i also ate too much, because i regret not getting desert (no one really gets more than one desert, but why would they limit you to just one, its all you can eat!!!), being that it was one of the reasons i came here for, green tea tiramisu, i'm coming back for you!", 
            "hmmm...i was planning to lose my ayce sushi virginity to ms. goyemon but there was a two hour wait so instead i opted for the next girl available named ms. oyshi....i'd rather like to think we didn't go all the way and i'm still saving myself for the former.  \n\nfor 26 bucks, i think it's definitely in line with sushi goyemon, but i happened to be in the company of some friends who had been there as well, so i was able to get some perspective as i proceeded with my first time navigating this a la carte ordering feeding frenzy.  the first few speed bumps which caught my eye were some ground rules listed in the menu:\n\n1. no sashimi, only one order of oysters (4 pieces), uni, and sweet shrimp allowed...fair enough\n\n2. no excess rice shall be allowed to remain uneaten on the plate, otherwise that order will be counted as extra on the final bill....have people been discarding their rice into a large pile assembling a massive sculptured mountain of rice?  the rice that was used to prepare the sushi was highly variable in quality  (too soft, too firm, or mixed) throughout the various rounds of ordering so it only motivated us to concoct creative methods for disposing the rice (hiding it in the tea jar, breaking it into tiny grains and scattering it across the plate so as to create the illusion of a clean plate, and to borrow a technique from a friend who disliked rice during her early childhood, placing said rice into mouth and going to bathroom to dispose in toilet/trash).  of course none of this was done, but it was tempting nonetheless.\n\n3.  any orders which are unfinished in general will be counted as extra orders on the final bill...this was adhered yet strangely enough after receiving our final round of food (a modest 2-3 rolls) the server waited when we were rubbing our bellies and chimes in \"you have two more rolls coming!\" and none of us had any idea where these phantom rolls were coming from and she then replies with a snarky shrug  \"i'll take them off your order\" as if she was doing us a favor....pure shenanigans\n\n4. the jalapeno poppers on the appetizer menu were not allowed to be included amongst the ayce orders....what kind of crazy logic is this?  wouldn't it be good strategy to fill your customers with heartburn due to fatty spicy cream cheese richness to slow down their intake of much much more expensive items?  either these are the greatest jalapeno poppers in the history of appetizers or a missed business opportunity.   i don't even like jalapeno poppers but i almost was willing  to eat one just because this condition existed.\n\nthe meal\n\nthe appetizers  (<mark>Ahi Poke</mark>, spicy <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>, and <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark>)  the poke might as well have been unseasoned sashimi, whereas the <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> was overdressed nearly drowning in the chili vinaigrette, and the <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark> was surprisingly not overly salty as i anticipated but ended up being the surprise highlight of the meal.\n\nthe \"big three\" (uni, raw oysters, and sweet shrimp)...not exceedingly fresh but no risk of possible food poisoning either, although the oysters had a watered down quality to them....only tasted good since they were not specifically paid for.\n\nthe nigiri:  i sampled the surfer clam, spanish mackerel, japanese yellowtail, and a few other standards....there was definitely something i couldn't put my finger on but the level of freshness just seemed 1 level below what you would expect if you ordered these same items at a regular reputable sushi bar.  i'm thinking perhaps they were precut in mass production and by the time they arrived they were partially dried out from the external surface area of each piece of fish being exposed for a prolonged period of time.\n\nthe rolls:  perhaps i've had enough sushi experiences to have progressed beyond rolls since they are drenched in so much sauce (seriously, what is the obsession with orgasm sauce in this town?), crispy shavings of empty calories, or packed with so many types of fish that i couldn't really differentiate any of them out of a sushi roll lineup much like the seinfeld episode where george tries to catch the twix bar candy thief (\"it's a setup! they're all caterpillar rolls!!\")  i would try to limit your roll intake and focus on the other items to keep your palate from being overwhelmed(and to avoid the server from pulling that phantom roll maneuver as previously discussed)\n\nlast but not least, we figured we had successfully navigated through the labyrinth of extra charges until we received the final bill which charged us for the hot tea...are you serious???  so you're telling me i could have drank an entire gallon of <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark> instead of one measly cup of hot green tea which cost you pennies to brew?  perhaps these were some tea leaves taken from the emperor's garden, but i would appreciate a warning next time.  \n\n3 stars only because we definitely still got our money's worth, but i'm leaving a few more stars to be earned since my friends reassured me goyemon is better.", 
            "ryan has been there several times and it was my (kalila) second time there.\n\ntonight we had a birthday dinner reservation for 12 people and they \"forgot\" to put it down. we got there and a friend of ours threw a fit and we ended up getting a private room. crisis averted.\n\nwe all came for all you can eat and it was delicious. love affair and cajun albacore are two of my favorites. i also love their <mark>Trio Of Creme Brulee</mark>.\n\ni've had better <mark>Ahi Poke</mark> though.\n\nbeing that we had a large group ordering like crazy, a lot of our orders never came and we had to re-order certain things at least twice before they finally gave it to us. there were a couple orders that we just never got. we didn't make too big of a deal about it since we had a lot of food to go around anyways.\n\nthe saddest part? coming home smelling like a giant piece of shrimp tempura. my hair, skin & clothes currently all smell like food. i guess that's just the price you pay (aside from your actual bill) for enjoying great food.\n\ndespite a couple of the issues, we will be happy to go back again in the future.", 
            "wow this place was definitely the best ayce sushi i've ever had. first of all, the selection is amazing and overwhelming. it is a great deal for 21 dollars. trust me and order the following items and you will be one satisfied customer with your belly about to explode. \n\ni will start off with the non-rolls food: must get the surf and turf, <mark>Ahi Poke</mark>, <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>, <mark>Asian Style Skirt Steak</mark>, <mark>Grilled Beef Asparagus</mark> and beef. there were a few other items that i would like to try next time. there were simpy so freaking many.\nfor rolls, try the nuclear bomb roll, lobster fair, paradise roll, and oh what the heck, just try everything!\nfor desert, you definitely have to try the green tea tiramisu. \n\nthe service was also great and very attentive. they will make great recommendations based off of your tastes. so trust me, if you're in vegas, give this place a try.", 
            "my boyfriend absolutely loves this place. he's not really into ayce sushi places, but he loves this one. me? yup, i thought it was pretty good too. love that they give you small portions, so that you can try more things, and you don't get stuck trying to finish something you don't like. ~$26 per person for ayce dinner. this includes everything on the menu except sashimi. some of our favs were the hawaiian <mark>Ahi Poke</mark>, nigiri, tiger roll, and for dessert, green tea <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>. it's about a 10 minute drive off the strip. great for large parties, but make reservations. we went on a monday night, and though we were able to get seats right away at 5:45pm, the place was pretty busy by the time we left.  we'll definitely be back.", 
            "i think that oyshi is one of the best ayce sushi restaurants in las vegas.  it is a bit of a far drive from the strip and from where i live, but it's worth it.  the ayce prices are $21 for lunch and $26 for dinner.  the ayce not only includes various sushi rolls, but also includes various items such as steaks, mussels, sweet shrimp, some nagiri choices, and dessert.\n \nmy top picks for ayce:\n-<mark>Ahi Poke</mark>\n-kamikaze roll\n-tiger roll\n-rainbow roll\n-rib eye steak (comes out sizzling on a hot plate about 6-8 oz)\n-mussels (2 comes in every order)\n-vanilla <mark>Vanilla- Berry Parfait</mark>\n \noyshi also has a normal non-sushi menu such as teriyaki chicken, <mark>Egg Roll</mark>, and a beef bowl, if you ever have any non-sushi diners in your group.  the service there is decent, some servers are friendly some are not.  i've never had a problem with trying to get a table here.  my only qualms with oyshi is that they tend to play rave/techno music there that does not match the ambiance.  and they also automatically add gratuity or parties of 6 or more, when it is usually customary to add gratuity for parties of 8-9 or more.", 
            "i've been going to this sushi restaurant for a little over 4years. i remember this place because it was where i had my first date on valentines day. my opinions on this restaurant has been consistent within these several years. i love this place. i eat here few times a month because i can't get enough of the food! some reviewers may complain about the service, with a few exceptions, their service to us has been amazing. the thing i admire most about this restaurant is that the service isn't limited to just the servers, but the owner is running around serving people as well. i've been going here for so long, the owner recognizes us each time! \n\nfood: i am obsessed with their ian's special roll. it has multiple layers of flavor goodness! \n\nthings to try: snow mountain roll, salmon lover, tiger roll, surf and turf (appetizer), <mark>Ahi Poke</mark>, <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark>, <mark>Grilled Beef Asparagus</mark> and shrimp, and all the sushi fish you desire. their vanilla parfait for dessert is pretty amazing too. \n\ni usually look forward to the uni and the oysters, but the reason why it's 4 stars and not 5 is because there have been times where it is not available. and it really puts a damper on my entire meal. who doesn't want to get their money's worth! \n\noverall, great experience! when anyone comes into town, this is the first place i take them, and they all love it as much as i do! it's pretty amazing! i've tried so many sushi restaurants here and out of state, and none compares to the sushi place here in vegas!", 
            "say what?! ayce for $26?! yes sir it's worth your whole $26, or if you're going for lunch, it's only $21 but you don't get oysters and who doesn't love oysters?! they have a vast selection of sushi rolls, some of my favorites are the oyshi roll which is a baked roll with dynamite topping, spicy tuna crunch, and the atomic roll. but the one thing that is worth every penny is their super white tuna. have you had super white tuna?! no?! well, get your butt over here and try it! it melts in your mouth like butter, it's the champagne of fish.. yes, ahh thinking about it just makes my mouth drool, they top it off with ponzu sauce and it couldn't get any better than that.\n\ntheir appetizer list is ongoing and you have so many choices, that's what i like about their ayce, you have many options to choose from. the calamari is nice and crispy on the outside and a little chewy when you bite into it. the surf and turf is awesome and they just have new meats to pick from that come in a griddle plate (is that what it's called?) it comes steaming hot and on a bed of cabbage and onions yummmm! they have a good <mark>Ahi Poke</mark> bowl that comes with cucumber slices and <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> underneath, amazing. i could go on, but you really just have to get your butt over there and try it for yourself! oh yeah, did i mention the desserts? oh, i haven't.. well i love their vanilla parfait! they also have creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e, green tea tiramisu, and green tea and vanilla <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>. oh goodness, i'm hungry.", 
            "random nights with good friends are always a blast!  i've always said it.  spontaneity really makes the activity better!  so when i was invited last minute for a sushi dinner, i knew it was going to be fun.  we settled on a place one of us raved about.  i've been to soyo restaurant many times but never oyshi.  time to yelp!\n\nthe only down side of this place is the location.  i live across town from here.  oyshi is in a really cool strip mall in my opinion.  first, you have one of my favorite korean joints.  now you have my favorite fried rice joint, rice trax.  this location, although far, will be frequented a lot.  although the wait was super long, the restaurant is pretty cool.  love the concrete floors, the wood accents in the front and the half table chairs, half booth options for seating.  our service was pretty good.  multiple servers came by our table at most times.  it was enjoyable. \n\nfor dinner at a sushi joint in vegas, the only way to go is to get the ayce special (all you can eat).  this place charges a $26 price tag.  the one thing that threw me for a loop were the rules involved.  i've never seen a place have all their rules listed on their menu.  with this dinner, you can literally order anything off the menu.  granted, there are a few items that limit one per person, but you have access to everything.  my recommendations to get the most out of your ayce is to stick to non-rice dishes.  i know, i know, it's a sushi joint, but trust me.  you can eat so much more if you stick to the protein.  for dinner, here's what i got, grouped in categories:\n\nthings i loved: <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> (with sesame seeds), <mark>Fresh Oyster</mark> (with ponzu sauce, green onions and hot sauce), <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark> (topped with yum yum sauce and ponzu), <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark> (always a hit), shrimp tempura (lightly breaded), chicken yakitori (2 skewers with dark meat chicken and yakitori sauce), \n\nthings i liked but kind of disappointed with: <mark>Ahi Poke</mark> - bowl filled with <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>, shredded cucumbers and onions on the top, was small chunks of tuna with a little sesame seeds.  kind of a disappointment.  i understand that tuna is expensive, but the dish was 75% salad and 25% tuna, which should have been the star of the show. \n\nthings that were questionable:  yellowtail or hamachi nigiri - if there's any rice dish i get, it's nigiri because of the small portions. the yellowtail is usually my favorite fish, however, this specific yellowtail was a little discolored and questionable to me.  i took a bite and ended up finishing the dish but it didn't taste like what i'm used to.  make sure it's fresh!\n\nall in all, this place is actually good.  i'm definitely coming back for another ayce session.  the place is still convenient and the staff is nice.  if you're looking for a good sushi joint on the sw side of vegas, for sure check them out!", 
            "usually come here for a guaranteed good to amazing ayce sushi experience but my most recent visit here today proved itself to be less than good let alone ok. \nin short: the food and quality of it is amazing, not sub par by any means. i highly suggest their nigiri as well as their red dragon and crazy philly roll. their <mark>Ahi Poke</mark> is fresh and the bed of <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> it's placed in is on point. \nhowever, the service (today at least) was below average. it's understandable if a waiter is slammed with tables, if errands for sushi bar needs to run, miscommunication with orders happen ---shit happens and waitressing is a tough job. but when you don't even bother to check your tables on the way of running food or when you're plain mia for the duration of our longer than expected stay---it's simply no bueno. our waiter josh was sweet and was probably jam packed with errands but when it comes to an hr wait for the check let alone dessert orders...well hmm :/ \n\nstill love this place but maybe perhaps don't understaff?", 
            "variety versus service - this is my headliner for this place.\n\nthe menu is excellent, and by that i mean i have many choices, in fact too many that on my second visit here, i think i have only tried an eight of their items. quality and freshness of their seafood are outstanding, and i've had them on roll, sushi, and sashimi.\n\nthe stand-outs are: <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark>, <mark>Ahi Poke</mark>, shrimp tempura, calamari, surf and turf, eel and avocado, <mark>Trio Of Creme Brulee</mark>.... food is four stars hands down.\n\nnow, the service is not the most accommodating, i'm afraid to say. some cons on my last visit: our waiter forgot our three orders of calamari and had to be reminded, as we waited for a good twenty minutes, grave sin on customer service definitely. for the pros, we were greeted and seated very quickly and our drinks were refilled readily and i appreciated the fact that our waiter apologized for making us wait on our calamaris. in the end, i would give them three stars and believe that they could do better by following up with an order.", 
            "my husband and i eat out a lot and oyshi sushi is one of our favorite places, but our only favorite sushi place. best all you can eat. we get the <mark>Ahi Poke</mark>, <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark>, surf and turf, <mark>Chicken Teriyaki</mark>, and <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark> for appetizers. \nthe japanese lasagna, atomic bomb, and lobster fair are a must! \n\n\nalways busy here so plan ahead. i think it's worth the wait though! \nhappy eating!", 
            "i used to hate this place!  many visits a couple years ago...all with slow service, room temperature nigiri, etc.  this was actually one of the only places that i told people not to go to for sushi....and never understood why others liked it so much.\n\na very reluctant lunch stop proved to be a much better experience this time around!\n\na few highlights :\n\nsea scallops were awesome! super fresh, buttery texture...melt in your mouth! \n\nsake was very fresh today! beautiful cuts of salmon....the sake in yuzu was very good as well, and not overpowering like yuzu can be sometimes.\n\nthe ika with mint. i really enjoyed this combination...and it was noticeably less chewy than most. \n\nahi. fresh, but another odd cut...the darker area was a bit tougher...should have been removed by the chef.  pic : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oyshi-sushi-las-vegas?select=unvcwliuog_lmr-zkuakwq#unvcwliuog_lmr-zkuakwq\n\nunagi. nice crispy edges...good flavor! \n\n<mark>Ahi Poke</mark>. tuna was fresh, and the <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> was good too!\n\nsunomono. i liked their version here...thin cuts versus the larger circular cuts most use. the ginger sauce was good too.\n\ngreen tea <mark>Trio Of Creme Brulee</mark>. delicious! lots of tea flavor here \n\nservice was fairly quick, considering their tables were mostly full.\n\ni would come back again now if i was already on this side of town :p", 
            "i have always enjoyed oyshi, ever since it opened years ago, i've been a huge fan! it was the first ayce sushi place i had ever been to. and after all this time, they still serve up pretty yummy eats!\n\nambiance: 3 - the space is intimate, but at the same time, still pretty well lit. usually has a good amount of people inside, i recommend calling in advance, especially with a big party.\n\nservice: 4 - service is okay, especially when you call in a big party reservation; everything came out fast and hot for our bday party celebration! it's also pretty fast seated at the bar.\n\nwhen you're not at the \"party tables\", regular service is a bit slow! i really hope they get better, but it's been that way for a while. also, they charged full price for a kid under 10! say whaa?! \n\nfood: 4 - i have a like/love relationship with the food. so i'll just tell you my absolute favorite dishes to order: love affair, <mark>Fresh Oyster</mark>, <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark>, japanese lasagna roll, vegas roll, garlic tuna nigiri, oyshi roll, strawberry mochi, green tea <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>, and the <mark>Ahi Poke</mark> :) all delish and some of the best sushi around. though, not a huge fan of all of the nigiri that they serve.\n\noyshi is always a fun time for me, so i hope that everyone that has a big reservation or sits at the bar feels the same way as well!", 
            "i gave this place 5 stars, because i honestly believe this is the best buffet/ayce for the price in vegas. i have gone to this place for almost 3 years now. the best part about this place are the appetizers. i love the shrimp on skewers, rib eye, <mark>Asian Style Skirt Steak</mark>, <mark>Ahi Poke</mark>, gyoza, and many more....over the years their portions have gotten smaller, but i understand because it prevents from wasting food..btw you can always get more....their fresh sushi is amazing as well, big pieces of fish with small rice, and their baked rolls are very tasty. my favorites is the lobster fair and the paradise rolls. word of advice try to get there early around 5 for dinner, or you can expect a long wait. service is really good, and ambiance is great with a younger japanese themed feel....oyshi is the only reason my wife wants to go to vegas...", 
            "it seems the quality has dropped in service and sushi. one theory my friend has is that it just gets bad at peak times. lunch and dinner time on the weekends and holidays. \nunderstaffed maybe? \n\nour <mark>Ahi Poke</mark> seemed less than fresh. our shrimp tempura seemed rushed and not fully fried. sushi rolls took forrreevvver to come out. and it seems like the creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e serving gets smaller each time we visit.", 
            "sunday night here is pretty packed but people here are very accommodating and friendly. their ayce is the bomb!! so my mom and i ordered their monster, (a little sweet for me), lobster fair (omg this is one is freaking good!), japanese garlic lasagna, and many more! however, their salmon lover was a little bit so so for us cause the salmon wasn't fresh at all, they used frozen ones. for appetizers, their <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>, <mark>Ahi Poke</mark>, <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark> were pretty good. and of course, for dessert, i got some green tea <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> and their tiramisu too! so yummy! we're definitely looking forward to eat here again besides we just live near here!"

            "oyshi sushi is a pretty good ayce sushi restaurant located in the sw.  after hearing my coworker praising it, i finally hit up the place with a few meetup folks from las vegas and socal.  it is the sister restaurant to soyo barestaurant in the same plaza, so yes, this is another korean owned sushi restaurant with some items that has a more korean flare/flavor.\n\nthe restaurant itself is well-lit and trendily decorated, and attracts a diverse crowd of patrons looking for good ayce sushi at a reasonable price.\n\nthe ayce menu is practically the entire menu (mostly nigiri and rolls), except the sashimi and if i remembered correctly some salads.  they also have expanded their menu, and the new items are printed on the paper place mats, so don't forget to check those out too.  plus the numerous options available in the appetizer section is more than adequate to round out the sushi dining experience.  there are three special items (uni, ama ebi and raw oysters) that is limited to one order/pp with ayce, and the restaurant reserves the right to charge you for the food you don't finish to minimize unnecessary waste (standard rules of the ayce realm).\n\ni enjoyed:\nsibuya no rice roll\nnew moon roll\nvegas no rice roll\nyumyum scallop\nama ebi and the fried shrimp heads\nsurf n turf\n<mark>Popcorn Scallop</mark>\n\ni didn't care for:\njapanese lasagna (topped with way too much mayo that it overwhelmed and masked the flavor profile of the rolls underneath)\nasian style flank steak (basically a not so good version of the traditional korean bulgogi served on a sizzling plate)\ngreen tea tiramisu\n\nservice was good, especially considering that ted, was our only waiter, and he was looking after our party of 7 plus his other tables.\n\nwe were seated in one of the side rooms with really comfortable seats, so it was extra relaxing.\n\nambiance: 5/5  great vibes.\nservice: 4/5  for a busy night, our service was still great.\nfood: 4/5  overall, i think it is pretty good for ayce.\nprice: 4.5/5  very reasonable.\nparking: 5/5  never been a problem finding a parking space when i come to this plaza.\n\n4 stars!",

            "i cant believe its taken me this long to find this place! stumbled upon this sushi restaurant while out doing some errands today and what a hidden treasure! usually sushi bars have a very boring decor and bland music but this place was playing trance music.. that is awesome! with beautiful decor to the wall art and the exposed pipes it has a very stylish/modern feel to it. i almost felt like i was in san francisco. \ni ordered the <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>. it was a very generous portion but my only gripe was it was completely covered in sesame seeds which i am not a fan but know next time to request them to be left out. the seaweed itself was very fresh and the right amount of dressing was used.\nthen i ordered the hawaiian roll with soy paper. it had albacore, shrimp, and cucumber inside wrapped in a cajun albacore and avocado tossed with some ponzu sauce... heaven. seriously one of the best sushi rolls i have ever had and i consider myself a sushi connoisseur. \nthe <mark>Popcorn Scallop</mark> are amazing as well. they're little scallops deep fried and served with a wasabi ranch and honey mustard sauce. \ni had the all you can eat which was only $25 and that even included 2 oysters! amazing deal especially for the quality. ive already been 3 times in the past 3 days and ill probably end up here at least 3-4 times a week. love love love!\n\noh! and the sushi chefs are awesome. :)", 
            "this was my second visit to oyshi, my first to the main dining room.  it was fairly busy, but we had a reservation and were seated immediately.  our server was friendly and extremely prompt without being pushy at all!  she never let our drinks get completely empty and always made sure our plates were full!  my friend and i shared the spicy tuna crunch and i devoured the japanese lasagna and the lobster/crab roll alone as he isn't a big fan of any warm sushi.  we also shared some gyoza and the <mark>Popcorn Scallop</mark> (my favorite appetizer!) as always, everything was fresh and extremely tasty.  i can't wait for my next visit!!",

            "finally got the chance to sample this southwestern sushi spot.\n\nrestaurant design: very modern. comfortable seats everywhere, very nice lounge with its own tv, huge counters at the bar. one of the largest interiors i've seen. the only weird thing is how low the armchairs in the lounge are. luckily, we didn't have to deal with that since we didn't fill the table.\n\nservice: consistent pacing throughout the night. could be because we were the lounge table, but i'll take that versus sometimes being forgotten.\n\npicks:\n\nnigiri: everything was delicious through and through, even the tuna. the spicy tuna was a bit overwhelming for my sensitive palate. smoked salmon special here is superior to goyemon's special. uni is the best quality other than when i tried kaze's ayce sashimi lunch. there were some issues with seaweed wrappers from different pieces sticking to each other though.\noysters: no real off flavors and haven't gotten sick yet, so that's a win for me\n<mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark>: solid\nfried calamari: fine\nlasagna roll: didn't notice much difference with the inclusion of avocado, and good quality\nparfait: really, really good. fruits and crunchy granola made me really happy. glad i made this my limit-one-dessert-that-isn't-ice-cream-scoops choice.\n\npassable:\n\ndynamite: pretty good, but the sesame threw me off.\nsurf n turf sizzling plate: beef strips and shrimp on a bed of onions and cabbage. not bad, but not great.\nhot sake: average, i suppose. best part was that it was a mon/tues 2-for-1 special.\n\npans:\n\n<mark>Popcorn Scallop</mark>: pretty useless.\namaebi head: brain drained. i feel like they did this as a restaurant-wide strategy to appeal to a more mainstream palate (you can tell by how they let you order yum yum sauce on the side). would've liked all off the flavors to be there.\n<mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>: while the green tea was pretty good, the vanilla was not that impressive and the texture of both had noticeable ice crystals\n\noverall, i enjoyed the meal with a few notable exceptions. it's worth the drive if you want a change from your normal sushi spot. i'd probably come back to explore the rolls since we didn't really plumb the depths of that extensive part of the menu."

            "their service kinda sucks, but the food is excellent.  i always do the ayce and usually got for the bonsai roll, <mark>Ahi Poke</mark>, gyoza, <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark>, <mark>Grilled Beef Asparagus</mark> and some sushi (garlic tuna, cajun albacore)  yum!!", 
            "first time here &amp; loved it!!\nprobably one of the best all-you-can-eat sushi places i have ever ate!\nthe only down side is its a bit pricey!! 21 for lunch &amp; 26 for dinner.\nbut you get what you pay for! everything is made &amp; comes out fresh once you order it!\n\n-<mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark>\ndelicious! wasnt salty at all! :)\n\n-eel/avocado roll\nnot a big fish person...but i have to admit was good! the eel overpowered the avocado for sure.\n\n-salmon with rice \ni dont eat raw fish or anything..but i had half of one piece and it wasnt bad at all!! it looked and tasted fresh! im sure all you salmon lovers would enjoy this very much.\n\n-love affair\nshrimp tempura roll with yum-yum lobster with crunch flakes &amp; masago!! this was my favorite roll of the night! i finished the majority of the plate!! \n\n-crunch scallop\nyummy!! taste had a sweetness to it and this was my second fav of the night.\n\n-<mark>Grilled Beef Asparagus</mark>\ndelicious!! loved this and i would have eaten more if i wasnt so stuffed!! one of my favorites. simple but great!\n\n-<mark>Rib Eye Steak Teriyaki</mark>\nsteak was tender!\n\n-<mark>Asian Style Skirt Steak</mark>\nsteak was tender and could taste the ginger like crazy in this dish! in fact, you can taste all the ingredients they used to make this dish, but the ginger enhances a bit.\n\n-<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>\nlightly fried soft tofu in green onion soy sauce! really light and it was phenomenol. i dont think you can ever ruin this dish.\n\n-green tiramisu\nsucked!!! never order this.\n\nmy auntie & uncle said their <mark>Trio Of Creme Brulee</mark>, parfait is great! their rattlesnake roll is highly recommended!", 
            "so, after doing much research, hoping to find a great alternative to my usual spot for ayce sushi, i decided on oyshi, solely because of the great reviews i saw here on yelp. \n\ni looked up the website, called and asked about prices, and finally my boyfriend and i decided to make the trip out. \n\nwe arrived at about 8:30pm, and it was a friday night, so i expected it to be bustling. during our wait to be seated,  i scoped out the crowd, and noticed the usual. mostly those under the age of 30, large groups of them in fact, and figured this must be their spot before they hit the clubs, considering their attire. well, it was either that or the fact that the music in the restaurant sounded as if you were already in a night club. it must be set on pandora or something. anyway, it was only about a 15 minute wait, which wasn't bad at all. \n\nso, besides my observations of the restaurant ambiance and demographic, we finally were able to look at the menu. my boyfriend usually orders the nigiri, so we got the usual garlic tuna, albacore, cajun albacore, and decided to try the oyshi scallops. as for the rolls, i decided on the sibuya no rice, coco, and a bonsai. i also decided to get the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, <mark>Grilled Beef Asparagus</mark>, <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark> and <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>. this was only the first round after all.\n\nwe were excited to eat until the food arrived on our table. first the nigiri, the presentation was obviously not of any importance, but you can't judge a book by its cover, so we took a few bites anyway. \n\nverdict, \n\nthe garlic tuna was disgusting. it smelled and tasted like spoiled blood. i've had garlic tuna many times at many other restaurants, and this one had to be the worst. it even looked slimy, not because of the sauce, just itself.\n\nthe albacore was seared, and also tasted old. it had the same garlic sauce poured over it as the garlic tuna, and it was mushy.\n\nthe oyshi scallops i thought were going to be \"oishi\" but, definitely not. they mixed it with crab meat, and very light mayo, and it fell apart immediately as i tried to pick it up. \n\nthe cajun albacore had too much cajun seasoning! i usually love cajun albacore, and this was too much for my palate, on top of that it was dry.\n\nmy boyfriend got his usual spicy tuna hand rolls as well, and the spicy tuna looked a little spoiled. \n\non to the rolls,\n\nthe bonsai, had the cajun albacore on it as well, but i had to bear it to see if the spicy tuna in the center was at least average. the roll as a whole was not to my liking.\n\nthe coco, was probably the most decent roll on table, probably because each of the ingredients in it were fully cooked.\n\nthe sibuya no rice, again with the spicy tuna... eh.\n\nthe appetizers,\n\nthe <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> is usually my favorite appetizer!!! it came out looking as if it were just fried up, and i commend the presentation on this one, but the center was cold, the sauce was not tasty, and i hate that it is not \"bite-size\" as most japanese cuisine is known to be. \n\nthe <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> was not a bright green and although it was crispy, it had an ugly after taste, i've had better, let's just leave it at that.\n\nthe <mark>Grilled Beef Asparagus</mark> was drizzled in teriyaki sauce. the asparagus was perfect, but the beef wrapped around it was dry somehow.\n\nthe <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark> were not baked enough, and the yumyum sauce was pretty tasteless. \n\ni was disappointed already, but decided to take another round of appetizers, since i knew the sushi wasn't going to be very enjoyable. i settled for calamari, shrimp/veg tempura, edamame, <mark>Asian Style Skirt Steak</mark>, and some other things that were just not memorable enough.\n\ni knew it was bad when i was scarfing down edamame and tempura. the calamari looked good, but the dipping sauces  (ranch and a mayo/mustard mix) could have been more \"asian\" i guess? my boyfriend ate the <mark>Asian Style Skirt Steak</mark> (aka korean bulgogi, in my opinion). he even commented \"i'm eating beef, which is probably the last thing i would expect to eat at a sushi restaurant.\"\n\nwith that said, it smelled as if something was burning the entire night we were there! \n\nhm, it was overall a disappointing experience.  we have both gone to many sushi restaurants, with my list including restaurants in hawaii and san francisco, california, and i wanted to seriously give this place a chance. unfortunately, oyshi just did not live up to the hype!\n\non a side note though, my waitress was very helpful, and service was mediocre, but that's about it.", 
            "there's no other food out there that i can say that i could every single day.  with as much sushi choices as there are, who can ever get tired of eating it?! seriously. when i first discovered this place, i was so enamored by their flavor and service, that i told every single person looking for a good place to eat, local or tourist, that they have to go to oyshi sushi and get ayce!\n\ni'm a big fan of nigiri and i highly recommend their nigiri because the ratio of fish to rice is 80-20. the fish they use is very fresh and they use a huge slice! omg! my top list of nigiri: cajun albacore, salmon, and eel! have to have it every time.  also highly recommended: love affair, salmon lover, sunrise, and red dragon.  their appetizers are awesome as well, but the ones that stick out the most that some sushi bars don't have are: surf & turf, <mark>Potato Croquette</mark>, <mark>Grilled Beef Asparagus</mark>, and the unagi (eel) bowl! mmmmm!\n\nthey also do dinner reservations if you have a large party coming. they have vip rooms that can accommodate large parties if you call ahead.  i've sat in their vip rooms and their chairs are extra comfortable. the dining area near the entrance has a huge mural that gives this place it's feel and vibe. if you speak to the sushi chefs, they're pretty funny too! and if you're cool with waiting a little bit to be seated, get your oyshi on!", 
            "wow this place was definitely the best ayce sushi i've ever had. first of all, the selection is amazing and overwhelming. it is a great deal for 21 dollars. trust me and order the following items and you will be one satisfied customer with your belly about to explode. \n\ni will start off with the non-rolls food: must get the surf and turf, <mark>Ahi Poke</mark>, <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>, <mark>Asian Style Skirt Steak</mark>, <mark>Grilled Beef Asparagus</mark> and beef. there were a few other items that i would like to try next time. there were simpy so freaking many.\nfor rolls, try the nuclear bomb roll, lobster fair, paradise roll, and oh what the heck, just try everything!\nfor desert, you definitely have to try the green tea tiramisu. \n\nthe service was also great and very attentive. they will make great recommendations based off of your tastes. so trust me, if you're in vegas, give this place a try.", 
            "first time ever that i have had all you can eat sushi this style. why doesn't new orleans have this?? all you can eat on the menu for around $21! this deal more than filled my stomach. \n\nwe started off with the <mark>Grilled Beef Asparagus</mark> and <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark>. i love the beef that wraps around the asparagus which gives it a great taste to the asparagus. the sauce on the <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark> is also perfect. \n\noverall i had  a great experience. we ordered most of the special rolls on the menu. i will definitely come back whenever i am back in town!", 
            "i've been going to this sushi restaurant for a little over 4years. i remember this place because it was where i had my first date on valentines day. my opinions on this restaurant has been consistent within these several years. i love this place. i eat here few times a month because i can't get enough of the food! some reviewers may complain about the service, with a few exceptions, their service to us has been amazing. the thing i admire most about this restaurant is that the service isn't limited to just the servers, but the owner is running around serving people as well. i've been going here for so long, the owner recognizes us each time! \n\nfood: i am obsessed with their ian's special roll. it has multiple layers of flavor goodness! \n\nthings to try: snow mountain roll, salmon lover, tiger roll, surf and turf (appetizer), <mark>Ahi Poke</mark>, <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark>, <mark>Grilled Beef Asparagus</mark> and shrimp, and all the sushi fish you desire. their vanilla parfait for dessert is pretty amazing too. \n\ni usually look forward to the uni and the oysters, but the reason why it's 4 stars and not 5 is because there have been times where it is not available. and it really puts a damper on my entire meal. who doesn't want to get their money's worth! \n\noverall, great experience! when anyone comes into town, this is the first place i take them, and they all love it as much as i do! it's pretty amazing! i've tried so many sushi restaurants here and out of state, and none compares to the sushi place here in vegas!", 
            "my husband and i have a new favorite place in town. we live in summerlin and still drive to the southwest side of town for sushi.\n\nportions for ayce would fool you. sushi pieces are generous and balls of rice are not enormous. the appetizers are good, you have to try <mark>Grilled Beef Asparagus</mark>!\n\nstaff is friendly and do their best on busy nights. make sure you call for reservations on weekend nights. \n\nalso, you can order half rolls from the sushi bar, not tables. so if we go, just the 2 of us, we will sit at the bar.", 
            "oyshi has ayce appetizers you can't find at any other ayce sushi place. the <mark>Grilled Beef Asparagus</mark>, <mark>Asian Style Skirt Steak</mark>, rib eye, and a few other things are unique to oyshi. <mark>Grilled Beef Asparagus</mark> is especially tasty. the rolls are similar to what to get anywhere else. so is are the nigiri. i think the bonsai roll is very good. spicy tuna inside with cajun albacore outside. probably the best roll we had. the biggest thing is the green tea creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e. no other ayce sushi place has this. it is so good!!!! without it i'd probably give 3 stars. but the green tea creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e alone is worth 1 stat!!!", 
            "oyshi is my go to ayce, they are always consistent with quality, taste and service.  i always get monster roll, tiger roll, nyi roll, sibuya, love affair, surf&turf app, <mark>Grilled Beef Asparagus</mark> app, gyoza, uni, ikura, unagi, and usually try some specials, the green tea <mark>Trio Of Creme Brulee</mark> and tiramisu are very good, and i'm not usually a dessert person.  these guys are always on point! i love oyshi sushi!"

            "i just love it when ayce sushi places not only serve sushi but all the different tapas style appetizers! dinner is priced at $26.95.\n\nservice is usually very good. last time i went, had to wait 20 mins for a table (it was a little busy) and the waiter did not come around as much as i had hoped for. our water and teas were never refilled without asking. but the other times i have gone prior, service was fine.\n\nwhen it comes to sushi at oyshi, ah, i've had better. their spicy tuna for me was too mushy. i like spicy tuna when the tuna is cut into chucks then mixed with the spicy mayo. so, i was quite disappointed with that. the salmon nigiri was fresh and quite tasty though. i try to stay away from the rolls because they are huge, will become quite full from one roll. \n\nwhenever i find myself at oyshi, i tend to order a few nigiris then i ransack the appetizer menu! lol. i love the steak. it comes out sizziling on top cabbage and onions. they also have, shrimp/vegetable tempura, bacon wrapped asparagus, scallop poppers, oysters, <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, etc.\n\noyshi used to be a favorite of mine for ayce sushi, but after discovering island sushi... i don't know if i will be back to oyshi.",

            "4.30.11 i definitely enjoyed the atmosphere, it was cute for a huge restaurant. it was dim, but not to the point where you can't see anything. i really like their sushi bar it's really big. the tables in the restaurants are nicely spaced so you're not rubbing elbows with your neighbors. i'm not used to japanese restaurants that can accommodate several large parties. they had two private rooms and we were in another area that was semi-private. there were 9 of us and we sat comfortably. i really like the painting they had against the wall in our semi private area. it was actually the only painting i saw throughout the restaurant. \n\ni have never eaten at an ayce sushi in las vegas away from the strip so i was super excited. i ordered their <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> and it was so salty! stay away, ha ha. i was disappointed but quickly got over it when i tasted their poke salad. i remember ordering the kimono roll, yellow trio and dessert. i had more than that, but i was so amazed how refreshing everything tasted i was too excited to remember to write it down. when i ordered i stayed away from tempura or anything baked. i was not going to get full off that, i wanted fish. their sushi was fresh and i especially remember the salmon handroll, it was perfect. i really enjoyed their food, although the oyster was okay and their uni really looked like it needed a makeover. \n\ntheir service was super duper good, although for some reason i was the last one to receive my order. that made me the last one to eat the desserts everyone was done while i was still waiting. ha ha. do not pass up on ordering their <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>. doesn't matter if you're full and your fly is about to pop, still order their dessert.\n\nso overall, next time i will definitely come here for their ayce! their selection of rolls for their ayce is plenty, not like other places its mainly filled with baked and tempura stuff. this one had plenty of raw fish in their rolls. just the way i like it! \n\ndon't be a fool and miss out on this wonderful meal..", 
            "ayce sushi! service was great.  sushi was good for ayce standards.\n\nmy picks if you're doing ayce:\n\n<mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> - pretty standard, kind of small\ntempura - so good! \n<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> - good flavor, but wasn't the best that i've had.\n<mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> - you only get to choose one dessert, definitely choose this!!\nsunrise roll - nice spicy flavor\n\nwait staff was really good at handling our large party of 16.  kept track of most of the orders and checked on us often.", 
            "this place has changed a lot since i first went there. \nuni- i know not to expect too much from ayce uni, but the uni came out grey and slimy. \noysters- the oysters were nice and big. they tasted fresh, and not overpowered with sauce. probably the best dish. \nsurf & turf - bland and flavorless. the shrimp was super rubbery due to being over cooked.\n<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>- fried to a crisp, so when you cut into it.. the entire batter falls off. it should be light and easy to swallow.\nnigiri- fish quality was decent, but filled with a lot of rice. the amaebi tasted ok, but there is a part of the shrimp head that they don't clean off and discard. this makes it very difficult to enjoy, and sharp on the gums. \nasparagus beef- asparagus wasn't shaved down enough at roots, so you get the bad stringy part stuck in your teeth if it's possible to even bite off. \nbeef and asparagus, shrimp skewers - very dry, overcooked, flavorless. ( a waste of stomach space )\n\noverall, really nothing special anymore. they don't allow half rolls which is unusual at an ayce spot. they seem to have cut the ayce app menu down a bit too. the service was good, and attentive. however, i would rather stick to umiya for ayce. they have a larger selection with much better quality."

            "my boyfriend and i live right across the street from oyshi, and we go once a week or once every two weeks. it is soooo delicious and we crave it basically on a daily basis. lol. i have tried other sushi places, but oyshi is by far my favorite. i love their baked rolls and appetizers. my favorites are the hot tamale roll, the japanese lasagna, spicy tuna crunch, <mark>Potato Croquette</mark>, <mark>Egg Roll</mark>, yellowstone, and quite a few others. the sushi chefs behind the bar are very nice. i rave about this place to basically everyone i know. lol. it gets really busy during the normal dinner hours...which we typically try to avoid because it takes longer for each order to come out. the only reason i rated 4 stars instead of 5 is because the service is a hit or miss. sometimes we get a really great server who is very attentive to us, but other times we sit there forever before a server finally notices us. or they take forever to refill your drinks...or they take your first order and forget you're there. it is a little pricey, but so worth it! if you want to eat or try a lot of stuff, definitely go for the all you can eat!"

            "star # 1 - all you can eat sushi!  i mean that is a star in itself\n\nstar # 2 - $26.95 for all you can eat sushi dinner ;) good price because i can eat that much in sushi ...easy!\n\nstar # 3 - i have been to other all you can sushi places in vegas and this one has the most variety.  the side dish list is much longer than others and offers some good stuff\n\nstar # 4 - customer service here is great. they treat you with great courtesy and always come back to make sure you are ok.\n\nstar # 5 - restaurant setting.  i mean they play a little bit too much trance and should maybe mix in the some r&b, or commercial hip hop, but the ambiance is still cool.  they have modern decor, and tvs in visible areas to watch espn...perfect! haha!\n\ncome here hungry and beware how much you order.   here are some good things i like to order:\n\nside dishes:\n-surf n turf\n-<mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark>\n-shrimp tempura\n-edamame (warm and with some salt! lol)\n-green tea <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>\n-green tea mochi\n\nsushi rolls:\n-spicy tuna crunch\n-spider roll", 
            "so, after doing much research, hoping to find a great alternative to my usual spot for ayce sushi, i decided on oyshi, solely because of the great reviews i saw here on yelp. \n\ni looked up the website, called and asked about prices, and finally my boyfriend and i decided to make the trip out. \n\nwe arrived at about 8:30pm, and it was a friday night, so i expected it to be bustling. during our wait to be seated,  i scoped out the crowd, and noticed the usual. mostly those under the age of 30, large groups of them in fact, and figured this must be their spot before they hit the clubs, considering their attire. well, it was either that or the fact that the music in the restaurant sounded as if you were already in a night club. it must be set on pandora or something. anyway, it was only about a 15 minute wait, which wasn't bad at all. \n\nso, besides my observations of the restaurant ambiance and demographic, we finally were able to look at the menu. my boyfriend usually orders the nigiri, so we got the usual garlic tuna, albacore, cajun albacore, and decided to try the oyshi scallops. as for the rolls, i decided on the sibuya no rice, coco, and a bonsai. i also decided to get the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, <mark>Grilled Beef Asparagus</mark>, <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark> and <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>. this was only the first round after all.\n\nwe were excited to eat until the food arrived on our table. first the nigiri, the presentation was obviously not of any importance, but you can't judge a book by its cover, so we took a few bites anyway. \n\nverdict, \n\nthe garlic tuna was disgusting. it smelled and tasted like spoiled blood. i've had garlic tuna many times at many other restaurants, and this one had to be the worst. it even looked slimy, not because of the sauce, just itself.\n\nthe albacore was seared, and also tasted old. it had the same garlic sauce poured over it as the garlic tuna, and it was mushy.\n\nthe oyshi scallops i thought were going to be \"oishi\" but, definitely not. they mixed it with crab meat, and very light mayo, and it fell apart immediately as i tried to pick it up. \n\nthe cajun albacore had too much cajun seasoning! i usually love cajun albacore, and this was too much for my palate, on top of that it was dry.\n\nmy boyfriend got his usual spicy tuna hand rolls as well, and the spicy tuna looked a little spoiled. \n\non to the rolls,\n\nthe bonsai, had the cajun albacore on it as well, but i had to bear it to see if the spicy tuna in the center was at least average. the roll as a whole was not to my liking.\n\nthe coco, was probably the most decent roll on table, probably because each of the ingredients in it were fully cooked.\n\nthe sibuya no rice, again with the spicy tuna... eh.\n\nthe appetizers,\n\nthe <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> is usually my favorite appetizer!!! it came out looking as if it were just fried up, and i commend the presentation on this one, but the center was cold, the sauce was not tasty, and i hate that it is not \"bite-size\" as most japanese cuisine is known to be. \n\nthe <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> was not a bright green and although it was crispy, it had an ugly after taste, i've had better, let's just leave it at that.\n\nthe <mark>Grilled Beef Asparagus</mark> was drizzled in teriyaki sauce. the asparagus was perfect, but the beef wrapped around it was dry somehow.\n\nthe <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark> were not baked enough, and the yumyum sauce was pretty tasteless. \n\ni was disappointed already, but decided to take another round of appetizers, since i knew the sushi wasn't going to be very enjoyable. i settled for calamari, shrimp/veg tempura, edamame, <mark>Asian Style Skirt Steak</mark>, and some other things that were just not memorable enough.\n\ni knew it was bad when i was scarfing down edamame and tempura. the calamari looked good, but the dipping sauces  (ranch and a mayo/mustard mix) could have been more \"asian\" i guess? my boyfriend ate the <mark>Asian Style Skirt Steak</mark> (aka korean bulgogi, in my opinion). he even commented \"i'm eating beef, which is probably the last thing i would expect to eat at a sushi restaurant.\"\n\nwith that said, it smelled as if something was burning the entire night we were there! \n\nhm, it was overall a disappointing experience.  we have both gone to many sushi restaurants, with my list including restaurants in hawaii and san francisco, california, and i wanted to seriously give this place a chance. unfortunately, oyshi just did not live up to the hype!\n\non a side note though, my waitress was very helpful, and service was mediocre, but that's about it.", 
            "another ayce sushi joint in vegas.  i swear there are one in every two blocks.  bigger than most, this place is usually busy at night but very chill during earlier hours like  most places.  but when it's busy, it's really busy which leads to service sucking!  but overall the atmosphere inside is pretty good and seats up large group of people which is good for birthday dinners or just a bunch of friends coming from out of town.\n\nall you can eat i believe was $25 for dinner.  i'm just gonna point out what i like and usually order. <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark>, dynamite roll, volcano roll, nigiri is not as tasty here, oysters are the best i've had in vegas but unfortunately only 4 per person so get your friends to order it as well even if they don't eat it so you can have it, surf and turf (highly recommended), and for dessert the fruit parfait. \n\nthis is not a quiet place for dinner so bad idea for a date if you plan on having a meal with a quiet conversation.  people come here often with their kids and big groups of people, which shouldn't surprise you are very loud.  this place is a hit or miss but fortunately i'm patient when it comes to bad service when it's excusable because of how busy this place can be at times.", 
            "(4.5 stars)\n\nmy trip to vegas would not be complete without a visit to oyshi sushi. though it's off strip, i'm lucky my best friend lives close enough so we can make a trip every time i'm there. \n\nmy last visit was the first time i've done their all you can eat deal, and for $26, it was well worth it! the only things it doesn't include are the chef's special sashimi, so all your appetizers, salads, specialty rolls and desserts are included. my friends and i went all out and ordered several to share of every course. oysters were delicious and <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark> (while too much mayo sauce) was to die for. tempura dishes are nice and crispy and not too soggy or heavy. my favorite salad is their <mark>Ahi Poke</mark> on top of <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> - yum! we shared 6 specialty rolls that were all delicious in their own ways. again their specialty \"yum yum\" sauce is \"yum yum\", but in small amounts. the <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> is like the type you buy at the store, but again, it's all part of the deal so might as well indulge! we also got a bottle of lychee flavored cold sake that was decently priced and balanced the sweet:alcohol ratio perfectly.\n\nservice is good: unless its super busy, the wait staff always comes up to check on your group, make sure your water is filled, etc. as with any sushi place, baked rolls will take longer, so be patient! they did forget one of our orders at one point, but since we were eating so much, it gave us time to digest.\n\nif you can make the trip out with a group who enjoys sharing specialty rolls and can throw down in eating, oyshi is the place to go!", 
            "first time ever that i have had all you can eat sushi this style. why doesn't new orleans have this?? all you can eat on the menu for around $21! this deal more than filled my stomach. \n\nwe started off with the <mark>Grilled Beef Asparagus</mark> and <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark>. i love the beef that wraps around the asparagus which gives it a great taste to the asparagus. the sauce on the <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark> is also perfect. \n\noverall i had  a great experience. we ordered most of the special rolls on the menu. i will definitely come back whenever i am back in town!", 
            "1) ambiance: modern, busy, high energy with techno/dance music playing.\n\n2) price: comparable to most ayce sushi joints $21 lunch/ $26 dinner\n\n3) service: slow as far as food preparation. spent nearly 2 hours on ayce for 2 people. the servers & management were very nice though. drinks were always refilled and they came around to check up on us often.\n\n4) food: some of the things we ordered.\n\nappetizers-\n<mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark> were good. i could eat 100.\n<mark>Asian Style Skirt Steak</mark> - came out on a sizzilin' platter & smelled terrific but i wasn't diggin' the taste. nothing special.\n\nsushi-\nfish was eh... just ok. not as fresh.\n\nfavorite rolls-\namigo - jalapeno, combination of fish and cream cheese w/ flaming hot chili sauce. jalepeno-licious!\nlove affair - shrimp tempura roll with yum-yum lobster, crunch flakes. scrumptious!\n\n5) overall: satisfactory. there were a lot of things we wanted to try but were too full. i would give this place another shot.", 
            "on a wednesday evening, we had 2 ayce dinners for ~60. \n\n- accommodative. they changed the channel for the olympics for us :)\n- get the oysters. small but packed with flavor. beware! rocks with the oysters? too fresh :/. lol\n- calamari was a bit too oily. no flavor\n- get the <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark>. they even cut it in half for you :)\n- big pieces of yellow tail and salmon for the nigiri :)\n- the monster roll is deceiving. it's not all soft shell crab. sad that they only use the legs. ends are shrimp tempura.  \n- loved the salmon skin roll. more skin than salmon means more crunchy :)\n- the nyi roll barely has soft shell crab. even smaller legs!!! :(\n- nuclear roll had a bit too much cream cheese. :/\n- yellow tail trio was a bit too tangy. small pieces of yellow tail\n- you only get one dessert! fail...\n- mango mochi was average. they put a toothpick in it with the plastic on. lol\n- parfait was delicious. but needs more granola. i think the berries and strawberry pieces are frozen.\n- although it may sound picky, overall it was pretty delicious or oishi :)", 
            "i get why they have four stars, it's a hip place with electronica music playing in the background, and that seems to be a vegas standard now.  however, i can't say ill be making my way back.\n\nthey have a variety to choose from for ayce, with the whole inside menu strictly rolls.  when i do ayce, i only go for nigiri.  as i've posted before, i'm not really into rolls because its usually covered in sauce, with very little filling.  i guess it's what americans love though... sauce on everything.  i'm guilty as well, just not on my sushi.\n\nanyway, the fish was really poor quality.  after my initial order, i couldn't bring myself to order any more.  i love my fish to taste like fish (if that even makes sense).  the fish here had no taste whatsoever.  all i could taste was the vinegar from the rice.\n\ni thought it was cool they served oysters, but it was pretty blah.  there was no flavor at all.  it tasted like water.  it did not have that \"taste like the sea\" quality.  i don't know.  it just didn't taste like anything.  the <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark> were not very good. overcooked. no flavor.  too chewy.\n\ntofu was ok, but too much sauce, and it was overly sweet.  desserts were boring.  no green tea <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>. creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e was ok.  <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> parfait was ok.\n\nseriously, this place is lacking all types of flavors.\n\ni like the fact that they serve \"fresh\" scallops, other places usually have the baby scallops drenched in yum yum sauce.  \n\nserver was friendly.  \n\ni'd pass on this place and go for goymen, sushi komo, or even kaya.", 
            "i've been going to this sushi restaurant for a little over 4years. i remember this place because it was where i had my first date on valentines day. my opinions on this restaurant has been consistent within these several years. i love this place. i eat here few times a month because i can't get enough of the food! some reviewers may complain about the service, with a few exceptions, their service to us has been amazing. the thing i admire most about this restaurant is that the service isn't limited to just the servers, but the owner is running around serving people as well. i've been going here for so long, the owner recognizes us each time! \n\nfood: i am obsessed with their ian's special roll. it has multiple layers of flavor goodness! \n\nthings to try: snow mountain roll, salmon lover, tiger roll, surf and turf (appetizer), <mark>Ahi Poke</mark>, <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark>, <mark>Grilled Beef Asparagus</mark> and shrimp, and all the sushi fish you desire. their vanilla parfait for dessert is pretty amazing too. \n\ni usually look forward to the uni and the oysters, but the reason why it's 4 stars and not 5 is because there have been times where it is not available. and it really puts a damper on my entire meal. who doesn't want to get their money's worth! \n\noverall, great experience! when anyone comes into town, this is the first place i take them, and they all love it as much as i do! it's pretty amazing! i've tried so many sushi restaurants here and out of state, and none compares to the sushi place here in vegas!", 
            "after reading all the great reviews, i came here with high expectations. we got the \"all you can eat\" sushi. it took us about 30 minutes to receive each order. the waiter didn't bother to check on us unless he had food to deliver. and the sushi was warm. i've had way better sushi at other places then what we we're served at oyshi. and the oysters we're only 2 per customer. so don't expect all you can eat oysters. we stayed about an hour and 45 minutes at oyshi. half of the time we just sat there looking around for our waiter to come by and refill our drinks. the best thing on the menu we're the <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark>.", 
            "this place has easily become my favorite ayce sushi joint after luisa p. invited me to come for her brother's birthday dinner here. i had a bad experience here in 2011 so this was their second chance. boy have they been delivering! we had one of the vip rooms all to ourselves for his birthday because we were part of such a huge party. they did a great job of accommodating our big group and even brought in more tables as well as chairs so that we could all be included.\n\nbe prepared to wait! if you plan on bringing a large group, have someone.. or a few someones come early so that you can put your name on the list. just make sure the majority of your party is there to be seated. i want to say that all 3x i have came (during dinner time), the wait has been about 20 mins - 35 mins.\n\ni love doing ayce because as long as you eat about 3 rolls, you're getting your money's worth. plus, it is fun to share delicious food! make sure you're only sharing with those in your group that are getting ayce or else they will get charged the ayce price as well. they have an extensive rules/information outline on their menu.\n\ni think that the service here is really great for them being busy all of the time. they were always coming back to check up on us and asked if we wanted to put in more orders. our tables were never cluttered because different people would swing by and grab our empty plates, plus everyone was more than helpful when we needed anything.\n\nmy go-to rolls: monster roll: order it, just order it! pink lady roll. spider roll. dragon roll. japanese lasagna roll. i need to try even more of their specialty rolls, i am guilt of sticking to my favorites! for appetizers, order the <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark>, they're amazing here. only a few sushi joints can get it right, trust me.\n\nif you know me, then you know that i love white tuna nigiri/sushi. the first time i had it here, it was amazing. the second time was decent. haha, hopefully it just keeps getting better because i order a lot of those wherever i go for sushi. \n\nfor dessert, order the green tea tiramisu with vanilla <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> on the side. your mouth will thank me, lol.\n\ni will definitely be back!", 
            "oyshi is right around the corner from where i reside so of course i'm gonna try it! well this place rocks! great service and and an always friendly staff. we always ask for stacy if she is working and she has never let us down! i recommend the j&b roll as well as any of the tempura rolls...the <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark> are amazing too! i highly recommend ayce...worth every penny ;)", 
            "random nights with good friends are always a blast!  i've always said it.  spontaneity really makes the activity better!  so when i was invited last minute for a sushi dinner, i knew it was going to be fun.  we settled on a place one of us raved about.  i've been to soyo restaurant many times but never oyshi.  time to yelp!\n\nthe only down side of this place is the location.  i live across town from here.  oyshi is in a really cool strip mall in my opinion.  first, you have one of my favorite korean joints.  now you have my favorite fried rice joint, rice trax.  this location, although far, will be frequented a lot.  although the wait was super long, the restaurant is pretty cool.  love the concrete floors, the wood accents in the front and the half table chairs, half booth options for seating.  our service was pretty good.  multiple servers came by our table at most times.  it was enjoyable. \n\nfor dinner at a sushi joint in vegas, the only way to go is to get the ayce special (all you can eat).  this place charges a $26 price tag.  the one thing that threw me for a loop were the rules involved.  i've never seen a place have all their rules listed on their menu.  with this dinner, you can literally order anything off the menu.  granted, there are a few items that limit one per person, but you have access to everything.  my recommendations to get the most out of your ayce is to stick to non-rice dishes.  i know, i know, it's a sushi joint, but trust me.  you can eat so much more if you stick to the protein.  for dinner, here's what i got, grouped in categories:\n\nthings i loved: <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> (with sesame seeds), <mark>Fresh Oyster</mark> (with ponzu sauce, green onions and hot sauce), <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark> (topped with yum yum sauce and ponzu), <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark> (always a hit), shrimp tempura (lightly breaded), chicken yakitori (2 skewers with dark meat chicken and yakitori sauce), \n\nthings i liked but kind of disappointed with: <mark>Ahi Poke</mark> - bowl filled with <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>, shredded cucumbers and onions on the top, was small chunks of tuna with a little sesame seeds.  kind of a disappointment.  i understand that tuna is expensive, but the dish was 75% salad and 25% tuna, which should have been the star of the show. \n\nthings that were questionable:  yellowtail or hamachi nigiri - if there's any rice dish i get, it's nigiri because of the small portions. the yellowtail is usually my favorite fish, however, this specific yellowtail was a little discolored and questionable to me.  i took a bite and ended up finishing the dish but it didn't taste like what i'm used to.  make sure it's fresh!\n\nall in all, this place is actually good.  i'm definitely coming back for another ayce session.  the place is still convenient and the staff is nice.  if you're looking for a good sushi joint on the sw side of vegas, for sure check them out!", 
            "been here a few times and i must say, i like it here. we usually get the ayce. the menu has a good variety and includes dessert. the sushi is decent to good. there's a board with specials as well so don't forget to check that out. \n\noyshi offers the usual japanese fare from sushi to specialty rolls, appetizers and other small plates. some of the sushi have options of preparing. ie. you can have your albacore regular, seared, seared with garlic, etc. same goes for the salmon and yellowtail and a few other fish on the menu. \n\ni really like the yakitori, <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark>, sushi options and desserts. \n\nthis location is way off the strip. it's worth a try if you like ayce. they also accept reservations.", 
            "today was my second time visiting this sushi place. first time i was there, i wasn't too impressed. but i came back again today, and oh boy.. i completely changed my mind about this place.\n\nmy family and i had shrimp tempura, <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark>, heart attack roll, salmon roll, california roll, oyshi roll, lasagna roll, yellowtail nigiri, salmon nigiri, white tuna nigiri, and the vegas roll. everything that we ordered was completely delicious. i really appreciated that the sashimi slices for their nigiri were generously thick. the fish to rice ratio of the nigiri was perfect. not too much rice.\n\nonly reason why i gave it a 4 is because the service was kind of eh. and i really didn't like how my 3-year-old was $16 for ayce. my daughter doesn't even eat much sushi at all. i like sushi places that have children 5 & under free. so those two would be my only reasons as to why they don't receive 5 stars. \n\nminus the cons, i think this place is a very decent place to eat sushi. i would go back. not often, but if i'm ever in this side of town & craving some sushi.. i'll definitely stop by.", 
            "finally got the chance to sample this southwestern sushi spot.\n\nrestaurant design: very modern. comfortable seats everywhere, very nice lounge with its own tv, huge counters at the bar. one of the largest interiors i've seen. the only weird thing is how low the armchairs in the lounge are. luckily, we didn't have to deal with that since we didn't fill the table.\n\nservice: consistent pacing throughout the night. could be because we were the lounge table, but i'll take that versus sometimes being forgotten.\n\npicks:\n\nnigiri: everything was delicious through and through, even the tuna. the spicy tuna was a bit overwhelming for my sensitive palate. smoked salmon special here is superior to goyemon's special. uni is the best quality other than when i tried kaze's ayce sashimi lunch. there were some issues with seaweed wrappers from different pieces sticking to each other though.\noysters: no real off flavors and haven't gotten sick yet, so that's a win for me\n<mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark>: solid\nfried calamari: fine\nlasagna roll: didn't notice much difference with the inclusion of avocado, and good quality\nparfait: really, really good. fruits and crunchy granola made me really happy. glad i made this my limit-one-dessert-that-isn't-ice-cream-scoops choice.\n\npassable:\n\ndynamite: pretty good, but the sesame threw me off.\nsurf n turf sizzling plate: beef strips and shrimp on a bed of onions and cabbage. not bad, but not great.\nhot sake: average, i suppose. best part was that it was a mon/tues 2-for-1 special.\n\npans:\n\n<mark>Popcorn Scallop</mark>: pretty useless.\namaebi head: brain drained. i feel like they did this as a restaurant-wide strategy to appeal to a more mainstream palate (you can tell by how they let you order yum yum sauce on the side). would've liked all off the flavors to be there.\n<mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>: while the green tea was pretty good, the vanilla was not that impressive and the texture of both had noticeable ice crystals\n\noverall, i enjoyed the meal with a few notable exceptions. it's worth the drive if you want a change from your normal sushi spot. i'd probably come back to explore the rolls since we didn't really plumb the depths of that extensive part of the menu.", 
            "my husband and i eat out a lot and oyshi sushi is one of our favorite places, but our only favorite sushi place. best all you can eat. we get the <mark>Ahi Poke</mark>, <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark>, surf and turf, <mark>Chicken Teriyaki</mark>, and <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark> for appetizers. \nthe japanese lasagna, atomic bomb, and lobster fair are a must! \n\n\nalways busy here so plan ahead. i think it's worth the wait though! \nhappy eating!", 
            "my girlfriend and i have been to oyshi sushi a couple of times and have thought that the food was good. nothing spectacular. we have always gone if we are craving sushi and they have an ayce option. we've never had the problem of getting seated right away which other people have mentioned, but i don't blame them because their staff and customer service is plain out horrible.\n\nthe first time my girlfriend took my to oyshi she had an issue with the customer service that the waitress was giving her. she did not clarify the oysters which was a part of the ayce and after she was very rude. after taking our order we saw her twice and then thereafter other waitresses had to take our order and deliver our food.\n\nour second time going to oyshi it was fine. we were seated in a timely manner and received our orders of ayce sushi without any issues.\n\nthe third time we went to oyshi is why im writing this review and have joined yelp and is also why i'm not going back there. we were seated in a timely manner and our order was taken in a timely manner as well, but after the waitress (pinky) took our order of ayce we never saw her again. that's when everything fell apart. our food took at least 20 mins to come out and it wasn't even busy. not only that, we always order <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark> with our order  and that never came out to the point where we order a second round. we had to call over the host or the manager or whoever the guy that was dressed up with a tie was. when pinky never came back a young waiter started to follow up on us. this waiter was \"awesome!\" not!!! the guy would only look at my girlfriend and never acknowledged me at all. i had to flag the guy down to get a refill on my drink because he would just ask my gf and leave. after waiting and losing our appetites we didn't even ask for dessert which is a part of the ayce. we were so disgusted with the service that we just asked for the bill.\n\nlastly, this is why i gave them a one star...\n\nmy bill came out to be $61.62 and because of the wait and the horrible customer service i did not tip them. so tell me why after a couple of days my account was charged $72?!?!?!? \n\nthose ******** charged my card an extra $10.38 meaning they tipped themselves and fraudulently charged my card extra!!!!\n\nat what point do they think they deserve my $10.38?!?!\n\nnever go to oyshi sushi!!!! ever!!!", 
            "i have always enjoyed oyshi, ever since it opened years ago, i've been a huge fan! it was the first ayce sushi place i had ever been to. and after all this time, they still serve up pretty yummy eats!\n\nambiance: 3 - the space is intimate, but at the same time, still pretty well lit. usually has a good amount of people inside, i recommend calling in advance, especially with a big party.\n\nservice: 4 - service is okay, especially when you call in a big party reservation; everything came out fast and hot for our bday party celebration! it's also pretty fast seated at the bar.\n\nwhen you're not at the \"party tables\", regular service is a bit slow! i really hope they get better, but it's been that way for a while. also, they charged full price for a kid under 10! say whaa?! \n\nfood: 4 - i have a like/love relationship with the food. so i'll just tell you my absolute favorite dishes to order: love affair, <mark>Fresh Oyster</mark>, <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark>, japanese lasagna roll, vegas roll, garlic tuna nigiri, oyshi roll, strawberry mochi, green tea <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>, and the <mark>Ahi Poke</mark> :) all delish and some of the best sushi around. though, not a huge fan of all of the nigiri that they serve.\n\noyshi is always a fun time for me, so i hope that everyone that has a big reservation or sits at the bar feels the same way as well!",

            "sunday night here is pretty packed but people here are very accommodating and friendly. their ayce is the bomb!! so my mom and i ordered their monster, (a little sweet for me), lobster fair (omg this is one is freaking good!), japanese garlic lasagna, and many more! however, their salmon lover was a little bit so so for us cause the salmon wasn't fresh at all, they used frozen ones. for appetizers, their <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>, <mark>Ahi Poke</mark>, <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark> were pretty good. and of course, for dessert, i got some green tea <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> and their tiramisu too! so yummy! we're definitely looking forward to eat here again besides we just live near here!"

            "i think that oyshi is one of the best ayce sushi restaurants in las vegas.  it is a bit of a far drive from the strip and from where i live, but it's worth it.  the ayce prices are $21 for lunch and $26 for dinner.  the ayce not only includes various sushi rolls, but also includes various items such as steaks, mussels, sweet shrimp, some nagiri choices, and dessert.\n \nmy top picks for ayce:\n-<mark>Ahi Poke</mark>\n-kamikaze roll\n-tiger roll\n-rainbow roll\n-rib eye steak (comes out sizzling on a hot plate about 6-8 oz)\n-mussels (2 comes in every order)\n-vanilla <mark>Vanilla- Berry Parfait</mark>\n \noyshi also has a normal non-sushi menu such as teriyaki chicken, <mark>Egg Roll</mark>, and a beef bowl, if you ever have any non-sushi diners in your group.  the service there is decent, some servers are friendly some are not.  i've never had a problem with trying to get a table here.  my only qualms with oyshi is that they tend to play rave/techno music there that does not match the ambiance.  and they also automatically add gratuity or parties of 6 or more, when it is usually customary to add gratuity for parties of 8-9 or more.", 
            "i almost wrote this place off for the unusual amount of time i spent waiting to be seated but patience paid off.  i ordered the ayce (all you can eat) lunch & had an <mark>Egg Roll</mark>, a spicy tuna crunch roll & a rainbow roll.  i informed my server of my food sensitivities & she assured me that i can make omissions :-) (some sushi places are funny about that)  my <mark>Egg Roll</mark> was ok, nothing special, but i have to say that both my sushi rolls were very tasty & fresh.  although not totally family friendly, its a relaxed enough atmosphere that you could totally bring the kiddos.  the bathroom although small was neat & clean.  my one note is in regards to service.  the staff wasn't especially friendly nor were they cold.  a smile here or there definitely would earn another star.  that being said, a must for sushi lovers especially with the wide variety of choices on the ayce menu.  i would definitely eat here again.", 
            "my boyfriend and i live right across the street from oyshi, and we go once a week or once every two weeks. it is soooo delicious and we crave it basically on a daily basis. lol. i have tried other sushi places, but oyshi is by far my favorite. i love their baked rolls and appetizers. my favorites are the hot tamale roll, the japanese lasagna, spicy tuna crunch, <mark>Potato Croquette</mark>, <mark>Egg Roll</mark>, yellowstone, and quite a few others. the sushi chefs behind the bar are very nice. i rave about this place to basically everyone i know. lol. it gets really busy during the normal dinner hours...which we typically try to avoid because it takes longer for each order to come out. the only reason i rated 4 stars instead of 5 is because the service is a hit or miss. sometimes we get a really great server who is very attentive to us, but other times we sit there forever before a server finally notices us. or they take forever to refill your drinks...or they take your first order and forget you're there. it is a little pricey, but so worth it! if you want to eat or try a lot of stuff, definitely go for the all you can eat!", 
            "we went to oyshi tonight and had the all you can eat sushi.  if it wasn't for the server i would give it no stars. the food was terrible and when you ordered a roll the inside was the size of a nickel and the roll because of all the rice was the size of a silver dollar.  the meat had no taste on a meat dish and the and the <mark>Egg Roll</mark> was overcooked and tasted terrible. my wife almost got sick on the mackerel sushi. i couldn't honestly recommend this restaurant to anyone."

            "their service kinda sucks, but the food is excellent.  i always do the ayce and usually got for the bonsai roll, <mark>Ahi Poke</mark>, gyoza, <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark>, <mark>Grilled Beef Asparagus</mark> and some sushi (garlic tuna, cajun albacore)  yum!!", 
            "we went there on last saturday nite expecting full house, but the place was only 3/4 full.  we sat at the wide open bar for all-you-can-eat so it's easier to order sushi from the chef. our first impression was good atmosphere and hip music.\n\nwe found the service excellent, contrary to some reviews. maybe because it was not busy or from over staffing, we were asked \"how is everything?\" every 5 minutes, even thought we were sitting at the bar.\n\nthe food was just ok. we liked the <mark>Ahi Poke</mark>, spider hand roll, white tuna, and especially the green tiramisu. on the other hand, we were not excited about the <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark>, bland tasting sushi, water-down soy sauce, light wasabi, and $2.50 xtra for hot tea.\n\nover all, we thought $67 for two ayce including 15% tip is just a little higher than most places in town especially for average food.\n\nwe might or might not go back.", 
            "driving down rainbow with my dad and sister after some very exhausting furniture shopping, we decided to pick up sushi for dinner. there are several sushi restaurants along the way, so we pulled over to the first one we saw: oyshi sushi. \n\nthe restaurant is very cute, decked out in the typical japanese style (fountains, folding screens) with a modern feel. it could serve well as a date spot or a family dinner outing, based on the groups of people i spotted. while we waited for our take-out order, the host offered us beverages, which was a very nice touch.\n\ni tend to judge restaurants based on how vegetarian- and vegan-friendly they are, and this place definitely passed. there are at least 10 or 12 vegetarian rolls to choose from. i ordered the asparagus and avocado roll, vegetable tempura and <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark>. all of them were very good. the sushi in particular was well-made and tasty, which was surprising considering that this restaurant advertises its all you can eat special. \n\nthe prices are good, the food is better. we'll be back!", 
            "first time here &amp; loved it!!\nprobably one of the best all-you-can-eat sushi places i have ever ate!\nthe only down side is its a bit pricey!! 21 for lunch &amp; 26 for dinner.\nbut you get what you pay for! everything is made &amp; comes out fresh once you order it!\n\n-<mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark>\ndelicious! wasnt salty at all! :)\n\n-eel/avocado roll\nnot a big fish person...but i have to admit was good! the eel overpowered the avocado for sure.\n\n-salmon with rice \ni dont eat raw fish or anything..but i had half of one piece and it wasnt bad at all!! it looked and tasted fresh! im sure all you salmon lovers would enjoy this very much.\n\n-love affair\nshrimp tempura roll with yum-yum lobster with crunch flakes &amp; masago!! this was my favorite roll of the night! i finished the majority of the plate!! \n\n-crunch scallop\nyummy!! taste had a sweetness to it and this was my second fav of the night.\n\n-<mark>Grilled Beef Asparagus</mark>\ndelicious!! loved this and i would have eaten more if i wasnt so stuffed!! one of my favorites. simple but great!\n\n-<mark>Rib Eye Steak Teriyaki</mark>\nsteak was tender!\n\n-<mark>Asian Style Skirt Steak</mark>\nsteak was tender and could taste the ginger like crazy in this dish! in fact, you can taste all the ingredients they used to make this dish, but the ginger enhances a bit.\n\n-<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>\nlightly fried soft tofu in green onion soy sauce! really light and it was phenomenol. i dont think you can ever ruin this dish.\n\n-green tiramisu\nsucked!!! never order this.\n\nmy auntie & uncle said their <mark>Trio Of Creme Brulee</mark>, parfait is great! their rattlesnake roll is highly recommended!", 
            "we moved into the neighborhood a few months ago and have been to oyshi several times. the <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark> and the tempura veggies are delicious. overall this is some of the best sushi we've had. the only reason i didn't give a 5 star review is because the shrimp aren't fried to order for the rolls. the tiger roll is usually one of my favs but not when the shrimp are soggy.", 
            "if you are a sushi snob, hit back on your browser and get a plane ticket to la at least if not tokyo. las vegas as far as i have seen as two sushi options... buffet and the type of place you are subsidizing comped high rollers. \n\noyshi is the buffet type. $21 for lunch. $26 for dinner. i did not notice anything different between the two menus. the $5 vig is likely pure the night vig. \n\nyour options include sushi, rolls and hot dishes. each is worth a paragraph. \n\nsushi. most ayce places save $$$ by not offering albacore, ikura, scallops, uni and other such high end items. this is not the case for oyshi, which makes me wonder where they cut corners. that being said, i believe the sushi is the highlight of the menu. though the rice is not prepared to sushi standards, the rice portion is fairly small compared to the fish, so this does not take away too much from the bite. the actual fish itself is pretty good considering it is ayce. note that each order is a fairly small two pieces, so don't be shy about ordering a lot. do eat the rice as well, though, as you will be penalized for going no-carbs. \n\nrolls. of the spider, bonsai, ebi ebi and volcano, i only liked the last two. i think the issue here is the sauces are pretty hit and miss. i think that ayce places try to make their rolls filling, salty and sweet to induce satiation or in the case of bonsai nausea. that roll actually made me heave a little. don't order too many rolls. it is sort of like how most of the menu is rolls like casinos mostly place slot machines on the casino floor. it's the most profitable. \n\nlast and definitely least is the appetizer menu. all the meat items suck. the beefs are stringy and sweet sauced up to disguise their cheapness and the chicken is dry. don't waste gut space. if you wanted a nice surf and turf combo, you should be at a fine steakhouse. i was disappointed, but having a good appetizer menu at an ayce sushi place would just be a bonus. i think some of the non-meat stuff is fairly safe, such as the <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark> (though don't expect the world). \n\ndrinks. didn't sample the alcohol, but you have your usual assortment of sake and beer. since i was there for lunch and was still tired from the previous night's drive, i passed. tea is $2.50 in case you wanted to know and is pretty good to share since it is a flat fee for one pot with free hot water refills. \n\nthough oyshi is in a strip mall on a nondescript corner of the vegas suburbs, it wants you to think that you are in caesar's palace. not necessarily a bad thing. \n\nthere are two back rooms to accommodate large groups. lunch is fairly quiet. i would expect dinner to be loud with the drinking and the karaoke. \n\nservices is good during lunch. attentive and even proactive about making sure you order a lot. nice. \n\noverall, it is a good value at $21. this continually justifies my urge to stay away from the strip for dining. just don't expect tsukiji quality or anything and enjoy the relatively cheap eats.", 
            "generally, i wouldn't recommend a place if i wanted to keep it a secret. i would say something like, the place sucks and not to go there. i thought about it, but then then it might backfire and the place closes down. therefore...\n\nyes, i am a big fan. i'm not the biggest sushi lover as some people are, but when it's good, it's good. i do believe i've had a wide enough sample of restaurants to know the difference. this place is definitely a place i would recommend. \n\nthe place is cool, kind of a drive from the strip, middle of nowhere strip mall with tumble weed crossings, inside is not too fancy, and not too much the other kind. but really you don't need to care much, as long as it's clean.\n\nthe place is all you can eat, not all you can pay for. more like... you can eat all, for one set price (within two hours). three of the four pages of the menu are all included for that price. and let me tell you, they had every roll i've ever seen or heard of along with many many more that i haven't. but there are also all the wonderful appetizers like the rib eye and shrimp called \"surf and turf\" tucked all the way on the last page at the very end. ya we ordered about 8 of those. that alone, would probably be worth the price. \n\nbetween the seven of us we ordered more sushi than i could ever imagine. but it wasn't so much about the quantity but the quality was just as impressive. of the different rolls i did try. i had, not one complaint. they were as good as i've had at any other sushi restaurant. i'd go into the names and ingredients of the rolls but if you love sushi, and even if you don't just imagine the ones you like and it's probably on the menu.\n\nservice was pretty good considering how many people were eating all you can eat sushi in the restaurant. i really did expect the sushi to come out one every half hour. but i didn't even notice any wait between drinks, appetizers, sushi, more sushi, more appetizers and finally dessert. in fact, upon ordering an extra <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark>, it seemed like it got to the table before i finished ordering it. they were that fast.\n\neating good food releases endorphins in your brain. a good sign that you just had a good meal with good friends is how much everyone is laughing at the end. and there was plenty of that to be had for everyone. the only reason its not 5 stars, is because i've had some really good sushi, but i can't order it here because it's usually a chef special at the other places.\n\nby the way, this place sucks.", 
            "i decided that i wanted ayce sushi last night (saturday) so i headed over to oyshi.  i checked in with the host at about 8:30pm and was informed that it would be about 20 minutes for a table.  it was a nice night, so i just grabbed a chair on the sidewalk in front and waited for the other half of my party to arrive.  there were probably four or five other small groups of people milling about waiting for tables too.\n\nwe were seated at the bar just after 9:00pm.  the place seemed pretty busy...  some uncleared tables, a couple large parties (one with kids) occupied the \"vip\" rooms behind us.  it was on the noisy side, especially with the techno/house/electronica music pumping from the ceiling speakers above the four chef's stations.\n\nafter a few minutes we were greeted by a friendly server who confirmed our ayce preference, took our drinks and asked if we were ready to put in our first round of orders.  we were.  i started with <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark>, an assortment of nigiri style items, an \"<mark>Ahi Poke</mark>\" and an order of four oysters (limit 1).  note:  i thought it was interesting that even though we were seated at the bar, our sushi requests were made with the server.  i guess the server was attempting to queue the orders for the very busy chefs.\n\nthe nigiri items on first order arrived quickly and we were told be the chef in front of us that the oysters would be out in a \"little while\".  the nigiri items were nicely presented and of good quality.  the <mark>Ahi Poke</mark> was just a small clump of chopped tuna on top of a mix of <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> and sprinkled with sesame seed (not exactly what i think of when i think poke, but i'm not trying to get techincal up in here son).\n\nthe oysters came out a few minutes later.  they were covered in green onion, a bit of masago and a squirt of sriracha.  i can only assume that the toppings were meant to cover up the tasteless, been sitting in a fresh-water tank, half-dollar sized oysters.  engh, i figured i'd keep moving forward, after all this was ayce...\n\nround two:  more nigiri (including surf clam, tamago, masago, quail egg, tako, and scallop), something called \"oyshi scallop\", and a spider roll.  we also ordered the chicken, beef and shrimp yakitori, which were all paired with asparagus and came sitting in a sweet teriyaki sauce.  again the nigiri items were of nice quality.  i'm not sure we ever got the \"oyshi scallop\".  there were two items in the order that looked like a krab salad (the california roll stuff) that i was sure we didn't order.  the spider roll was basically a california roll with one meager soft-shell crab in it, and it had been covered in the same bbq sauce they put on the eel.\n\nsince i was disappointed with the spider roll and i love soft-shell crab, i put in an order for a monster roll, which was also supposed to have soft-shell crab in it.  what came out was something similar to the spider (covered in the same eel sauce) only with the addition of a few slivers of eel and a refrigerator cold tempura shrimp stuffed into it.  slow down on that eel sauce dawg.\n\nat this point, i was pretty full and done trying...  the sushi chef in front of us was closing down his station, giving it a quick wash down with a wet rag and mumbling something about this night being his \"early out\".  by this time the dining room was starting to clear out too, but the party with the kids were still in our audible vicinity.\n\ni finished up my second pot of hot tea (which was a nice quality loose leaf green) and enjoyed a green tea <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> mochi ball.  both of these items were good.\n\nafter tipping out the chefs, server and taking care of the bill, i had spent about $75 for the two of us.  i'm not sure i'll be back anytime soon, but i made the best of it while i was there.", 
            "the food was good and the price was right.\n\nwe ordered my nephew the ninja meal which came with a <mark>House Salad</mark>, <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark>, half california roll, teriyaki chicken.\nfor my niece we ordered the cheesy katsu meal and that came with a <mark>House Salad</mark>, <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark>, and 3 sauces on the side of katsu sauce, honey mustard, and nacho cheese and a good size of katsu. the kids meals didn't come with rice so we ordered each a bowl on the side.\nit was alot of food for just the kids, my boyfriend and i ended up eating the left overs and we were stuffed.. it was definetly worth $6 each for the kids meal excluding the bowls of rice.\n\nmy boyfriend had the <mark>Unagi Bowl</mark> which was perfect as we both shared 1 big bowl of rice unagi and grilled onions which was delish, an order of a rainbow roll which was ok, as it didn't have avocado :(  but it still took care of my craving for sushi and a salmon handroll which was ok as i've gone to other resturaunts that pack it with salmon and the slices are big.  \n\ni like oyshi.", 
            "thanks neal v-g for recommending this place!! great place to eat before a bachelor party.\n\n5 star rating for sure, here's why:\ncame here after a 3 hour trip from los angeles. arrived around 4pm, with a group of 12. was seated promptly in the back private room. drinks were served quickly, left us with a large jug of ice water= awesome. waiter was very polite and patient with our large group of guys. we all ordered different rolls and shared them. each roll was delicious. presentation, taste and size of content to each roll was perfect. i remember getting the rattle snake, heart attack, lobster fare,  shrimp tempura, <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark>, fried scallops, warm saki and calamari. absolutely no complaints of any item ordered.  best, made to eat, all you can eat eat (ayce) sushi joint ever. \n\ncaution: do not over order!! take your time and enjoy each item is my advice. after your first roll you will want to go berzerk and order everything on the menu, trust me just enjoy and order what you can finish. you may feel pressured by the two hour time limit, but don't worry you will have plenty of time and the food is served pretty quickly.", 
            "sigh. we were *really* looking forward to this after all the stellar reviews. i've been to vegas many times and always thought the best sushi would be at some swank place on the strip, but yelp claimed otherwise.\n\nthe good: the food was, overall, fine. we didn't do all you can eat because my wife wanted two orders of sashimi (salmon and hamachi). both were excellent. nice large meaty pieces, well trimmed, nicely presented. we had two rolls each, which were fine but nothing special. i also had two orders of nigiri.\n\nthe bad: we arrived around 2pm on a sunday afternoon. the restaurant was maybe half full. it more than half hour before our first piece of food came out. it was 40 minutes before i saw any of my order. the (nice) server came by at 30 minutes and offered us free <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark> to help pass the time. meanwhile we watched every other table in the place get multiple orders of sushi delivered. completely unimpressed, and cost them several stars.\n\nother issues: i asked if they had aji bones they could deep fry, and the server went off to find out but never came back to tell me yes or no. my aji nigiri had the tiniest pieces of aji i've ever eaten on top. it tasted fine, but they amounted to table scraps, not at all like the beautiful pieces of sashimi my wife got.", 
            "i love this sushi restaurant. in fact, i'm going back for more today. i happen to work in the area so i haven't had a chance to try the $26 all-you-can-eat sushi. in fact, i rarely get the all-you-can-eat from any sushi shop.\n\nwhat i enjoy the most at oyshi's is their $10 sizzling plate lunch special. you get a calfornia roll, <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark> salad and your choice of teri beef, teri chicken or teri salmon.\n\nmy friend and i add the lobster fair for another $12 and split it. i've tried all 3 and have to say that the teri beef is my favorite by far. it has the most flavor of the 3 proteins.\n\ni've heard great things about the all you can eat as well and recommend you try both!! \n\ni'm going back for dinner so i can try it with some sake!!\n\nkanpai!", 
            "finally went to oyshi yesterday (as it was recommended by my friend).  the atmosphere was pretty awesome.  they had a spacious seating arrangement, colorful decor, xgames and the laker's game on tv, and techno music playing in the background (not really what i had expected in a sushi joint).  we came for the ayce @ about $22.00 for dinner.  it's decently priced for ayce.  the price does not include a drink.  the selection of food on the menu was pretty good.  they had a good assortment of appetizers, specialty rolls, and traditional nigiri (not to mention hand cut maki rolls).  i am a big fan of sashimi, but like 99% of the time, the sashimi is not included in the ayce.  i did however stock up on the sake (raw salmon) nigiri.  being my favorite nigiri, i found their sake nigiri to be very very fresh.  it was super bright orange and tasted incredible!  for dessert, they have a few different flavors of mochi, but you can only get one.  if i remember correctly, the flavors are as follows: green tea, mango, and red bean.  i opted for the mango and wish i could have had a second since they were pretty small in size.  anyhow, the sake nigiri alone would have gotten oyshi 4 stars, but unfortunately the service was extremely slow.  on top of that, the only soup available was the <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark>.  how do you not have udon on the ayce menu?  seriously?? they also did not have low-sodium soy sauce (i know it still has like 800mg per tbsp , but that's better than 1000mg).  overall, i'd come here again... i just hope my server can keep my water cup filled.", 
            "i went to return movies at blockbuster with my younger son and had the urge for some sushi. since oyshi was just across the street from blockbuster, we stopped in for a quick sushi fix. i've been to oyshi many times in the past, but this visit will be my last. service at oyshi in the past sucked, but tonight's service was just plain unacceptable. \nbeing a server myself, i strive to be polite, easy, patient, understanding, and tip well. when my son and i walked in, we waited a good 5 mins as the manager and servers walked passed us and no one even cared to seat us. i finally flagged down a server to seat us. if the establishment was busy, that's a different story, but this was at 10pm on a thursday with only three other tables.\nthe girl that sat us gave us menus and asked if we were doing ayce and i responded, \"no\"(i didn't want to stuff myself this late at night). i ordered water and told her i was ready to order, but she said she's not my server. 5 mins passed and our server came to take our drink order, and i told her i was ready to order. i ordered two waters, a <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark>, and 2 simple rolls. the waters and soup came in a timely manner, but i had to flag down a server for a spoon, straws, settings, and soy sauce. \nwe waited, waited, and waited(@ least 30 mins), saw other customers get their food-while thinking...did they forget our rolls??? i lost patience and called the server over & told her if they haven't yet made our rolls, i wanted to cancel. she glared at me then went over to tell the sushi chef, and he miraculously & immediately passed her a plate with our rolls! what the heck?? while we were waiting forever for our rolls, the sushi chef had them.\nwe never even got an apology for the delay. not once were we asked if we were ok or needed anything or even got a refill. as soon as we got our rolls, we gulped them down, asked for the check, paid, and bounced!! the rolls were mediocre. being a good tipper, i left absolutely nothing for such horrible service(from the beginning to the end) :-/.", 
            "ever since i can remember, sushi-mon (the one on silverado ranch/maryland pkwy) has been my favorite go-to spot. words couldn't describe how good it is. but i decided to try something new. this place had 270 reviews with an average of four stars. so they must be doing something right.\n\nafter one minute of walking the wrong way..we finally got into the entrance..by following the arrows...\n\ndecor was really nice, bigger than the usual sushi bars. great location too. the vip room and lounge room was a nice touch. it was slow mind you, during lunch when i walked in with my \"friend\" karlee. we started off with, my favorite <mark>Ahi Poke</mark> and <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark>. karlee had the soup as well and gyoza. <mark>Ahi Poke</mark> was ok, but not better than sushi mon, the flavor wasn't just there. miso was good, not fantastic. karlee loved the gyoza, she said it was better than the other sushi place she goes that serves it. \n\ni had the j&b roll, baked, with salmon and cream cheese. it was good, juicy, hand a hint of soy sauce. hats off to the sushi chef because it was awesome. i had a cucumber roll, asian strip steak and this deep fried california roll, with hot mustard and albacore tuna. all was great but the j&b roll was the highlight. karlee had 2 orders of the shrimp tempura roll, apparently it was good, i couldn't have any because i am allergic to shrimp. she tried to force feed it to me, knowing i was allergic, i think she tried to kill me, because i tried to make fun of her sirarcha/hot mayo sauce that she custom made..oh and she had <mark>Chicken Teriyaki</mark> and i think another order of gyoza, apparently she loves that stuff.\n\n the service was a little slow, especially when they weren't busy. this was all you can eat, and what i was shocked about how they did not serve half rolls!! i was like wtf? how could i possibly try more than 3 types. other than that the waitress seemed puzzled and brought us the wrong dishes a couple of times. no big deal. the food was great, service was so-so, and it is a place i would come back to again. i also ate too much, because i regret not getting desert (no one really gets more than one desert, but why would they limit you to just one, its all you can eat!!!), being that it was one of the reasons i came here for, green tea tiramisu, i'm coming back for you!", 
            "hmmm...i was planning to lose my ayce sushi virginity to ms. goyemon but there was a two hour wait so instead i opted for the next girl available named ms. oyshi....i'd rather like to think we didn't go all the way and i'm still saving myself for the former.  \n\nfor 26 bucks, i think it's definitely in line with sushi goyemon, but i happened to be in the company of some friends who had been there as well, so i was able to get some perspective as i proceeded with my first time navigating this a la carte ordering feeding frenzy.  the first few speed bumps which caught my eye were some ground rules listed in the menu:\n\n1. no sashimi, only one order of oysters (4 pieces), uni, and sweet shrimp allowed...fair enough\n\n2. no excess rice shall be allowed to remain uneaten on the plate, otherwise that order will be counted as extra on the final bill....have people been discarding their rice into a large pile assembling a massive sculptured mountain of rice?  the rice that was used to prepare the sushi was highly variable in quality  (too soft, too firm, or mixed) throughout the various rounds of ordering so it only motivated us to concoct creative methods for disposing the rice (hiding it in the tea jar, breaking it into tiny grains and scattering it across the plate so as to create the illusion of a clean plate, and to borrow a technique from a friend who disliked rice during her early childhood, placing said rice into mouth and going to bathroom to dispose in toilet/trash).  of course none of this was done, but it was tempting nonetheless.\n\n3.  any orders which are unfinished in general will be counted as extra orders on the final bill...this was adhered yet strangely enough after receiving our final round of food (a modest 2-3 rolls) the server waited when we were rubbing our bellies and chimes in \"you have two more rolls coming!\" and none of us had any idea where these phantom rolls were coming from and she then replies with a snarky shrug  \"i'll take them off your order\" as if she was doing us a favor....pure shenanigans\n\n4. the jalapeno poppers on the appetizer menu were not allowed to be included amongst the ayce orders....what kind of crazy logic is this?  wouldn't it be good strategy to fill your customers with heartburn due to fatty spicy cream cheese richness to slow down their intake of much much more expensive items?  either these are the greatest jalapeno poppers in the history of appetizers or a missed business opportunity.   i don't even like jalapeno poppers but i almost was willing  to eat one just because this condition existed.\n\nthe meal\n\nthe appetizers  (<mark>Ahi Poke</mark>, spicy <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>, and <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark>)  the poke might as well have been unseasoned sashimi, whereas the <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> was overdressed nearly drowning in the chili vinaigrette, and the <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark> was surprisingly not overly salty as i anticipated but ended up being the surprise highlight of the meal.\n\nthe \"big three\" (uni, raw oysters, and sweet shrimp)...not exceedingly fresh but no risk of possible food poisoning either, although the oysters had a watered down quality to them....only tasted good since they were not specifically paid for.\n\nthe nigiri:  i sampled the surfer clam, spanish mackerel, japanese yellowtail, and a few other standards....there was definitely something i couldn't put my finger on but the level of freshness just seemed 1 level below what you would expect if you ordered these same items at a regular reputable sushi bar.  i'm thinking perhaps they were precut in mass production and by the time they arrived they were partially dried out from the external surface area of each piece of fish being exposed for a prolonged period of time.\n\nthe rolls:  perhaps i've had enough sushi experiences to have progressed beyond rolls since they are drenched in so much sauce (seriously, what is the obsession with orgasm sauce in this town?), crispy shavings of empty calories, or packed with so many types of fish that i couldn't really differentiate any of them out of a sushi roll lineup much like the seinfeld episode where george tries to catch the twix bar candy thief (\"it's a setup! they're all caterpillar rolls!!\")  i would try to limit your roll intake and focus on the other items to keep your palate from being overwhelmed(and to avoid the server from pulling that phantom roll maneuver as previously discussed)\n\nlast but not least, we figured we had successfully navigated through the labyrinth of extra charges until we received the final bill which charged us for the hot tea...are you serious???  so you're telling me i could have drank an entire gallon of <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark> instead of one measly cup of hot green tea which cost you pennies to brew?  perhaps these were some tea leaves taken from the emperor's garden, but i would appreciate a warning next time.  \n\n3 stars only because we definitely still got our money's worth, but i'm leaving a few more stars to be earned since my friends reassured me goyemon is better.", 
            "very fresh sushi- came here with a girlfriend, and on a diet!\nshe ordered ayce for $21...her food looked amazing.\ni opted for a lot of low-calorie things, so i got fresh albacore (6 pc), <mark>House Salad</mark> w/ dressing on the side, and <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark>.my food was amazing and i tried one of her lobster roll,that was also amazing!\nthey had served us edamame as an appetizer beforehand i guess...awesome i love those little perks places like this offer. sometimes its cucumber salad. love.\nshe ended up getting a pink ball of <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> after,but i didn't try it.\nwe will definitely be back, as they have a ladies night and ayce for $21 quite often!", 
            "late night sushi at its best (at least, from what i've tried so far)\n\ni usually don't get off until 11:15 at night, and by that time, most sushi bars in vegas have already packed it in and called it a night, or are shortly about to. not oyshi!\nthankfully, this place stays open until 2am (last call at 1:30 am) and is perfect for folks working in the entertainment industry in vegas.\n\nthe all-you-can-eat option is $27 at this place, and it is worth it! though not as great as other ayce places i have dined in, it still boasts a wide selection of rolls and hot food. \n\ni think my favorite roll was the yellowstone roll, which was an interesting spicy tune and whitefish concoction that was topped with yum-yum sauce, jalapeno and cheddar cheese. i haven't ever been to a place with cheddar cheese as a sushi topping.\n\ni do wish that the dessert was all you can eat as well, because i would have like two mochi balls instead of 1, but that's a small gripe.\n\nthe alcohol did seem relatively expensive. my buddy had a sapporo and it was $7 or $8. that almost seems obscene.\n\non a positive note, dad is not a huge sushi fan, so he opted for the teriyaki chicken dinner. for $11, hhe had a <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark>, a salad, a bowl of white rice and a huge steaming hot plate full of <mark>Chicken Teriyaki</mark> with hardly any vegetables. it was a fantastic deal!", 
            "random nights with good friends are always a blast!  i've always said it.  spontaneity really makes the activity better!  so when i was invited last minute for a sushi dinner, i knew it was going to be fun.  we settled on a place one of us raved about.  i've been to soyo restaurant many times but never oyshi.  time to yelp!\n\nthe only down side of this place is the location.  i live across town from here.  oyshi is in a really cool strip mall in my opinion.  first, you have one of my favorite korean joints.  now you have my favorite fried rice joint, rice trax.  this location, although far, will be frequented a lot.  although the wait was super long, the restaurant is pretty cool.  love the concrete floors, the wood accents in the front and the half table chairs, half booth options for seating.  our service was pretty good.  multiple servers came by our table at most times.  it was enjoyable. \n\nfor dinner at a sushi joint in vegas, the only way to go is to get the ayce special (all you can eat).  this place charges a $26 price tag.  the one thing that threw me for a loop were the rules involved.  i've never seen a place have all their rules listed on their menu.  with this dinner, you can literally order anything off the menu.  granted, there are a few items that limit one per person, but you have access to everything.  my recommendations to get the most out of your ayce is to stick to non-rice dishes.  i know, i know, it's a sushi joint, but trust me.  you can eat so much more if you stick to the protein.  for dinner, here's what i got, grouped in categories:\n\nthings i loved: <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> (with sesame seeds), <mark>Fresh Oyster</mark> (with ponzu sauce, green onions and hot sauce), <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark> (topped with yum yum sauce and ponzu), <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark> (always a hit), shrimp tempura (lightly breaded), chicken yakitori (2 skewers with dark meat chicken and yakitori sauce), \n\nthings i liked but kind of disappointed with: <mark>Ahi Poke</mark> - bowl filled with <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>, shredded cucumbers and onions on the top, was small chunks of tuna with a little sesame seeds.  kind of a disappointment.  i understand that tuna is expensive, but the dish was 75% salad and 25% tuna, which should have been the star of the show. \n\nthings that were questionable:  yellowtail or hamachi nigiri - if there's any rice dish i get, it's nigiri because of the small portions. the yellowtail is usually my favorite fish, however, this specific yellowtail was a little discolored and questionable to me.  i took a bite and ended up finishing the dish but it didn't taste like what i'm used to.  make sure it's fresh!\n\nall in all, this place is actually good.  i'm definitely coming back for another ayce session.  the place is still convenient and the staff is nice.  if you're looking for a good sushi joint on the sw side of vegas, for sure check them out!", 
            "i often used to come to oyshi because it's close to my house and it was very delicious. fish was always fresh and service was always good, but ever since they got popular, everything has down-graded. \n\ni tried to give them second chances because i used to love this place so much! but lately, their customer service has been way too slow. i get that they're busy, which imo they need to hire more staffs. my last visit, it took them at least 10 mins to realize that we were standing there waiting to be seated. then, it took 30 mins for the server to bring us water and <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark>. the owner walks by and doesn't acknowledge us at all. you've got to be fast and efficient, especially a busy place like this, you've got to have more staffs. i will never come back again, even if it's a block away from my house. \n\ndespite my horrible experience, i still love their love affair roll, it's the only roll that doesn't fail to satisfy me.", 
            "variety versus service - this is my headliner for this place.\n\nthe menu is excellent, and by that i mean i have many choices, in fact too many that on my second visit here, i think i have only tried an eight of their items. quality and freshness of their seafood are outstanding, and i've had them on roll, sushi, and sashimi.\n\nthe stand-outs are: <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark>, <mark>Ahi Poke</mark>, shrimp tempura, calamari, surf and turf, eel and avocado, <mark>Trio Of Creme Brulee</mark>.... food is four stars hands down.\n\nnow, the service is not the most accommodating, i'm afraid to say. some cons on my last visit: our waiter forgot our three orders of calamari and had to be reminded, as we waited for a good twenty minutes, grave sin on customer service definitely. for the pros, we were greeted and seated very quickly and our drinks were refilled readily and i appreciated the fact that our waiter apologized for making us wait on our calamaris. in the end, i would give them three stars and believe that they could do better by following up with an order.", 
            "my husband and i eat out a lot and oyshi sushi is one of our favorite places, but our only favorite sushi place. best all you can eat. we get the <mark>Ahi Poke</mark>, <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark>, surf and turf, <mark>Chicken Teriyaki</mark>, and <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark> for appetizers. \nthe japanese lasagna, atomic bomb, and lobster fair are a must! \n\n\nalways busy here so plan ahead. i think it's worth the wait though! \nhappy eating!", 
            "if you want to receive any of your rolls in under 20 minutes don't go here. went on a tuesday night and it took forever to get even some soup (13 minutes). i didn't know one of the rolls had mushrooms in it which i'm allergic to, and instead of being more considerate the waitress argued with me and said i should have read a different part of the menu where it have the description. i didn't know the roll was in the menu in two different places so i was a little upset. she ended up charging us for two all you can eats even though i only got <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark> because when i got the roll and took a bite i got sick. so i really paid 27$ for <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark>. she could have had the courtesy to charge him for his all you can eat and me for just my soup. \n\nwon't be coming here again. rude server and roll took 20 minutes to get to me anyways.", 
            "more like three and a half, but i'll be nice.\ngot here on a friday night, no reservation. it was super busy, we waited about 25 minutes. we didn't mind the wait, we were pretty excited to try somewhere new. our waiter immediately took our drink orders, and then asked if we'd like to order. all three of us got all you can eat, so we could try a bunch of stuff together. we got edemame, chicken yakitori, muscles, raw oysters, gyoza, yellowtail nigiri, <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark>, and a few rolls. the raw oysters were outstanding. soooo fresh and good! the chicken was tasty, the muscles were fresh and not too much sauce,  the edemame was steamed perfectly. the nigiri was a little different, but tasted okay. the tiger roll and the screaming roll were only okay. an overload of rice, it was almost astonishing. like holy shit, that's a lot of rice, bro. the hawiaan and whatever rolls my friend got were pretty tasty. overall, it's worth it just for the appetizers. i'll come back to try different rolls\n\nby the way, when my friend got a refill on her sprite, he came back and she said that the syrup was all out, it just tasted like soda water. he was confused. did she want another one? uhm. yeah. so he went into the kitchen, literally stood there for a few seconds, and came back and gave her the same glass. oh boy. \nother than that weird mishap, service was pretty good.", 
            "one hour wait. okay this place has to be somewhat of a decent ayce sushi. no. just honestly go next door to soyo and save your $27 bucks. \n\nwe finally sat down and didn't see the waitress again for another 15 minutes. we ordered a couple random rolls, a bunch of sushi, and appetizers. \n\nso the rolls we're just rolls. i'm not really a fan for rolls. the food runner finally gave us sushi and didn't even know what was what. \n\nfood runner: heres your octopus...\nme: thats not octopus. \nfood runner: oh sorry, red snapper. \nme: that's not red snapper. \nfood runner: ohh.... *walks away... \n\nit was actually surf clam. learn your sea creatures if your going to work at a sushi place! \n\nthe sushi was not fresh. all of them were small and slightly fishy. the uni was literally orange brown and tasted so weird i couldn't eat it. \n\ni think then only thing i enjoyed was the <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark>. \n\nservice needs to be a lot better too. i know now the only reason why we waited a hour was because they took forever to clean the tables around us!", 
            "i ordered a la carte, and when i first looked at the menu, i thought to myself, \"the pricing is on the in-expensive side\". then the food arrived. \n\nthe cuts of fish were smaller than i am used to. so taking portion size into account, the a la carte pricing is fair. which leads to this point: i think that part of the draw of this place is that they have an \"ayce\" (all-you-can-eat) menu. the ayce price is equivalent to what i paid for my a la carte meal (as described below).\n\nas for my experience, i ordered: <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark> with clams; a california roll; tuna sushi, salmon sushi, cajun tuna sushi, and halibut sushi. these are standard items, and i felt it would provide me with good gauge of the quality of their fish. the quality of the fish was very good.\n\nwould i go again? sure. but i would go for the ayce.\n\nbtw... the kitchen closes at 1:30am most nights (check the site for operating hours). not bad for the suburbs.", 
            "would have given a 5 star but the service was a bit lacking. however, the food made up for it. went to lunch there with our staff and the menu was wonderful. i ordered the lunch special sizzling plate with <mark>Chicken Teriyaki</mark> and it came with <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark>, salad, tempura shrimp and vegetables, and california roll with the entr\\u00e9e. it was a boat load of food for $10. i had to take a portion home. btw: the green tea <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> is also a screaming deal for two scoops $2.50. great food but i should caution you to go early for lunch because you will wait for a good fair amount of time. i will definitely be back to give the service another chance."

            "so, after doing much research, hoping to find a great alternative to my usual spot for ayce sushi, i decided on oyshi, solely because of the great reviews i saw here on yelp. \n\ni looked up the website, called and asked about prices, and finally my boyfriend and i decided to make the trip out. \n\nwe arrived at about 8:30pm, and it was a friday night, so i expected it to be bustling. during our wait to be seated,  i scoped out the crowd, and noticed the usual. mostly those under the age of 30, large groups of them in fact, and figured this must be their spot before they hit the clubs, considering their attire. well, it was either that or the fact that the music in the restaurant sounded as if you were already in a night club. it must be set on pandora or something. anyway, it was only about a 15 minute wait, which wasn't bad at all. \n\nso, besides my observations of the restaurant ambiance and demographic, we finally were able to look at the menu. my boyfriend usually orders the nigiri, so we got the usual garlic tuna, albacore, cajun albacore, and decided to try the oyshi scallops. as for the rolls, i decided on the sibuya no rice, coco, and a bonsai. i also decided to get the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, <mark>Grilled Beef Asparagus</mark>, <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark> and <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>. this was only the first round after all.\n\nwe were excited to eat until the food arrived on our table. first the nigiri, the presentation was obviously not of any importance, but you can't judge a book by its cover, so we took a few bites anyway. \n\nverdict, \n\nthe garlic tuna was disgusting. it smelled and tasted like spoiled blood. i've had garlic tuna many times at many other restaurants, and this one had to be the worst. it even looked slimy, not because of the sauce, just itself.\n\nthe albacore was seared, and also tasted old. it had the same garlic sauce poured over it as the garlic tuna, and it was mushy.\n\nthe oyshi scallops i thought were going to be \"oishi\" but, definitely not. they mixed it with crab meat, and very light mayo, and it fell apart immediately as i tried to pick it up. \n\nthe cajun albacore had too much cajun seasoning! i usually love cajun albacore, and this was too much for my palate, on top of that it was dry.\n\nmy boyfriend got his usual spicy tuna hand rolls as well, and the spicy tuna looked a little spoiled. \n\non to the rolls,\n\nthe bonsai, had the cajun albacore on it as well, but i had to bear it to see if the spicy tuna in the center was at least average. the roll as a whole was not to my liking.\n\nthe coco, was probably the most decent roll on table, probably because each of the ingredients in it were fully cooked.\n\nthe sibuya no rice, again with the spicy tuna... eh.\n\nthe appetizers,\n\nthe <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> is usually my favorite appetizer!!! it came out looking as if it were just fried up, and i commend the presentation on this one, but the center was cold, the sauce was not tasty, and i hate that it is not \"bite-size\" as most japanese cuisine is known to be. \n\nthe <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> was not a bright green and although it was crispy, it had an ugly after taste, i've had better, let's just leave it at that.\n\nthe <mark>Grilled Beef Asparagus</mark> was drizzled in teriyaki sauce. the asparagus was perfect, but the beef wrapped around it was dry somehow.\n\nthe <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark> were not baked enough, and the yumyum sauce was pretty tasteless. \n\ni was disappointed already, but decided to take another round of appetizers, since i knew the sushi wasn't going to be very enjoyable. i settled for calamari, shrimp/veg tempura, edamame, <mark>Asian Style Skirt Steak</mark>, and some other things that were just not memorable enough.\n\ni knew it was bad when i was scarfing down edamame and tempura. the calamari looked good, but the dipping sauces  (ranch and a mayo/mustard mix) could have been more \"asian\" i guess? my boyfriend ate the <mark>Asian Style Skirt Steak</mark> (aka korean bulgogi, in my opinion). he even commented \"i'm eating beef, which is probably the last thing i would expect to eat at a sushi restaurant.\"\n\nwith that said, it smelled as if something was burning the entire night we were there! \n\nhm, it was overall a disappointing experience.  we have both gone to many sushi restaurants, with my list including restaurants in hawaii and san francisco, california, and i wanted to seriously give this place a chance. unfortunately, oyshi just did not live up to the hype!\n\non a side note though, my waitress was very helpful, and service was mediocre, but that's about it.", 
            "i was coming through vegas on my move across country, and great friend said he wanted to take me out for sushi.  this was a special occasion for several occasions:  we were meeting after knowing each other online for ten years, it was a few days before my birthday and most importantly, i'd never eaten sushi before. i told him to pick somewhere really special and where i could try several different things because i wasn't sure what i'd like.  he said that oyshi was all you can eat, which meant i could sample just about anything i wanted.\n\nwe ordered everything. this little guy put away about 18 pieces of yellowtail.  i tried it and it was ok, though the rolls were definitely the star.  the fried calimari was amazing.  we ordered fantasy roll, sexy roll, love affair, and dragon roll.  it was all amazing! if i had to pick my favorite, it was the love affair.  we also got <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>, sweet shrimp, and fried scallops. the only thing i didn't care for was octopus, but it was a personal preference.  it was amazingly good, all of it, and they were so nice! service was excellent and since 2 people in our party were almost an hour and a half late, they even let us stay longer than the two hours allowed.  it was the best first experience having sushi that i could've had!", 
            "been here several times. 1st time was for my 24th birthday. they dont take reservations, which was hard to plan out with 18+ people, but they were able to accommodate all of us, and the people who trickled in late. for the amount of people we had, the service was great! they even gave me a small bottle of hot sake on the house for waiting :]\n\nthe foods always been consistent every time i've come back. im not too big on the rolls (although there are a few i like). i get my fill on the hot items and appetizer items. they've added salad bowls and rice bowls as well.\n\nfavorites: poke, <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>, oysters (dinner only), ribeye (its not a complete meal if i dont order at least 5 orders for myself), hamachi, salmon, and a few others. \n\ni only rated a 4 because service is never consistent. we sat at the bar one night, and had excellent service from our server (again, the name escapes me. i should really write these down!). another time, a group of maybe 9 or 10 of us went in for lunch, and if i remember right they were short handed at the sushi bar. hot food items came out before rolls did, and half of our groups didnt come out until the end of the meal (after asking servers several times about our food. the disappointing part was the table next to us got their food way before we did, and they sat well into half of our meal). \n\nthis place is definitely a must try, if you've never been. but a regular spot? probably not. as a college student, its hard to pay $30 (including tip) for one meal as often as i'd like to. but when i do have some extra money, i will definitely be back!", 
            "tell all your friends: best and freshest sushi place in town!  if you can splurge for all you can eat it is definitely the way to go!  super selection-the yellowtail and garlic tuna are amazing!  fresh everytime  and melts in your mouth.  top 5  favorite rolls - i think what makes these so good is the eel sauce (slightly sweet):\n\n1) atomic bomb (kind of a sad name for a japanese roll but i digress) - spicy jalapeno on top and siracha\n2) monster roll - huge but has all the goodies \n3) simply shrimp- light and sweet\n4) red dragon- spicy tuna roll sweet and spicy yum!\n5) tiger roll - similar to red dragon buy with shrimp tempura added\n\njust tried their hand roll last night - they have a killer shrimp and avocado one. not on the menu but they'll make it for you. \n\nappetizers:\n<mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>\nexcellent tempura-always fresh and hot never oily\nsurf and turf-steak and shrimp appetizer. one order enough for two people to share\n\ndesserts (all you can eat is one dessert per person)\nmochi of course!!\nyogurt parfait is big, especially after a large meal, but very tasty\n\nsome negatives:\n\noyshi can get really busy.  they do take reservations and have two private rooms available.  also, not a big fan of the \"baked sushi\" although the california crunchy roll is pretty good if you like baked.\n\nall in all, this is my favorite sushi place in town and really hard to beat.  this place is a \"must\" for any yelper!", 
            "by far the best all-you-can-eat sushi places i have ever been to.\nmy cousin, who lives in the area, claimed that this place has really good sushi and an even better all-you-can-eat deal. as i'm from san francisco, i was a bit cautious and not too optimistic about the quality and freshness of the fish, however i was quickly impressed with the large variety of rolls, fish as well as other main entr\\u00e9es and appetizers on the menu.\ni started with the simple <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> and edamame, both which were well seasoned and served at the perfect temperature.\ntypically i am a fancy, combo roll fan but i will have to say that the quality of fish made the simple rolls one of my favorites of the night. the spicy yellowtail roll was very good as was the salmon avocado.\nto finish off, the all-you-can-eat menu there is a choice of dessert. i'm always a fan of the green tea <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> and in this instant the <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> was superb. \nwill def go back the next time i am in vegas.",

            "great deal for all you can eat!!! 21 bucks for adults and 15 for kids. i treated myself and my cousins to a lunch before taking the red eye back to nyc.\n\ni wasn't sure if we were going to be able to eat a lot but we sure ate more than we paid for! everything in the menu was included except for sashimi (easy fix: order it sushi style and don't eat the rice), uni and ebi.\n\nwe had gyoza, edamame, <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>,  seven rolls (from regular spicy tuna and alaska rolls to specialty ones including a spider, baked rolls, and a deep fried philly), two hand rolls, two orders of tako nigiri, two orders of hamachi nigiri, an order of tamago, and green tea <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> for dessert.\n\ni'd say we did a but of damage at this joint! what i also liked was that our waitress was recommending specialties to get and told us that appetizers and dessert were included. she was also helpful when my cousin wanted green tea <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> and parfait by combining the two together. it was pretty much the green tea <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> instead of vanilla yogurt with fruit and whipped cream on top. what a way to end a great meal!", 
            "so the beautiful girl i've been dating told me about this place being one of her favorites so of course i had to take her there.  we made sure to sit at the bar because you get excellent service when you do.  the food was amazing and the staff was super friendly and upbeat.  \n\ntun was the chef making most of our rolls and he even introduced us to the supervisor nye who offered us some complimentary sake which we turned down because we were already on our second bottle.  they have a happy hour from 11pm-2am with buy one get one sake or beer.  they also had just launched ladies night which knocked down the price for the lovely lady on the all-you-can-eat to $21.\n\nwe started with the <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> before we moved on to the fabulous rolls.  we had the monster, japanese garlic lasagna, dragon, vegas, and oyshi rolls.  we wish we could have tried more but we were stuffed.  we sat around chatting with the friendly staff and drinking sake until we had a little more room in our tummies for dessert.\n\ni highly recommend this place for the great food, fun atmosphere, and they play house music.", 
            "(4.5 stars)\n\nmy trip to vegas would not be complete without a visit to oyshi sushi. though it's off strip, i'm lucky my best friend lives close enough so we can make a trip every time i'm there. \n\nmy last visit was the first time i've done their all you can eat deal, and for $26, it was well worth it! the only things it doesn't include are the chef's special sashimi, so all your appetizers, salads, specialty rolls and desserts are included. my friends and i went all out and ordered several to share of every course. oysters were delicious and <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark> (while too much mayo sauce) was to die for. tempura dishes are nice and crispy and not too soggy or heavy. my favorite salad is their <mark>Ahi Poke</mark> on top of <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> - yum! we shared 6 specialty rolls that were all delicious in their own ways. again their specialty \"yum yum\" sauce is \"yum yum\", but in small amounts. the <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> is like the type you buy at the store, but again, it's all part of the deal so might as well indulge! we also got a bottle of lychee flavored cold sake that was decently priced and balanced the sweet:alcohol ratio perfectly.\n\nservice is good: unless its super busy, the wait staff always comes up to check on your group, make sure your water is filled, etc. as with any sushi place, baked rolls will take longer, so be patient! they did forget one of our orders at one point, but since we were eating so much, it gave us time to digest.\n\nif you can make the trip out with a group who enjoys sharing specialty rolls and can throw down in eating, oyshi is the place to go!", 
            "compared to the sushi buffets in la, ive gotta give oyshi 3 stars. the 2 things that trumps la's sushi buffet is they serve <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> and you get dessert at the end! main reason why it doesnt beat la's sushi buffet: fish isnt as fresh and no sashimi!\n\nwhat i recommend: <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>, tempura, tofu appetizer, mango <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>, green tea tiramisu, eel & avocado hand roll\n\nthe raw fish itself is alright, it's not that fresh...i would rate it 7/10",

            "random nights with good friends are always a blast!  i've always said it.  spontaneity really makes the activity better!  so when i was invited last minute for a sushi dinner, i knew it was going to be fun.  we settled on a place one of us raved about.  i've been to soyo restaurant many times but never oyshi.  time to yelp!\n\nthe only down side of this place is the location.  i live across town from here.  oyshi is in a really cool strip mall in my opinion.  first, you have one of my favorite korean joints.  now you have my favorite fried rice joint, rice trax.  this location, although far, will be frequented a lot.  although the wait was super long, the restaurant is pretty cool.  love the concrete floors, the wood accents in the front and the half table chairs, half booth options for seating.  our service was pretty good.  multiple servers came by our table at most times.  it was enjoyable. \n\nfor dinner at a sushi joint in vegas, the only way to go is to get the ayce special (all you can eat).  this place charges a $26 price tag.  the one thing that threw me for a loop were the rules involved.  i've never seen a place have all their rules listed on their menu.  with this dinner, you can literally order anything off the menu.  granted, there are a few items that limit one per person, but you have access to everything.  my recommendations to get the most out of your ayce is to stick to non-rice dishes.  i know, i know, it's a sushi joint, but trust me.  you can eat so much more if you stick to the protein.  for dinner, here's what i got, grouped in categories:\n\nthings i loved: <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> (with sesame seeds), <mark>Fresh Oyster</mark> (with ponzu sauce, green onions and hot sauce), <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark> (topped with yum yum sauce and ponzu), <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark> (always a hit), shrimp tempura (lightly breaded), chicken yakitori (2 skewers with dark meat chicken and yakitori sauce), \n\nthings i liked but kind of disappointed with: <mark>Ahi Poke</mark> - bowl filled with <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>, shredded cucumbers and onions on the top, was small chunks of tuna with a little sesame seeds.  kind of a disappointment.  i understand that tuna is expensive, but the dish was 75% salad and 25% tuna, which should have been the star of the show. \n\nthings that were questionable:  yellowtail or hamachi nigiri - if there's any rice dish i get, it's nigiri because of the small portions. the yellowtail is usually my favorite fish, however, this specific yellowtail was a little discolored and questionable to me.  i took a bite and ended up finishing the dish but it didn't taste like what i'm used to.  make sure it's fresh!\n\nall in all, this place is actually good.  i'm definitely coming back for another ayce session.  the place is still convenient and the staff is nice.  if you're looking for a good sushi joint on the sw side of vegas, for sure check them out!", 
            "i come here for sushi when i'm craving a solid ayce menu with a lot of raw fish options. i find if you sit at the sushi bar and just ask the chefs for your order the menu is not very stringent and they are happy to really make you anything you ask for. i found the service of our waitress to be pretty bad. my drink was only refilled once and she was very inattentive. quality of fish is always good and have never had a problem besides how full i leave. the other options are also very good, i always order the <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> and seared ribeye steak which comes on a sizzling hot pan with cabbage and onions and is a great option on the ayce menu for those that love a surf and turf. i say the food is great for the price, and the place is only getting 4 for the value i got which is something i look for. but the service was lacking. still worth a trip!", 
            "usually come here for a guaranteed good to amazing ayce sushi experience but my most recent visit here today proved itself to be less than good let alone ok. \nin short: the food and quality of it is amazing, not sub par by any means. i highly suggest their nigiri as well as their red dragon and crazy philly roll. their <mark>Ahi Poke</mark> is fresh and the bed of <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> it's placed in is on point. \nhowever, the service (today at least) was below average. it's understandable if a waiter is slammed with tables, if errands for sushi bar needs to run, miscommunication with orders happen ---shit happens and waitressing is a tough job. but when you don't even bother to check your tables on the way of running food or when you're plain mia for the duration of our longer than expected stay---it's simply no bueno. our waiter josh was sweet and was probably jam packed with errands but when it comes to an hr wait for the check let alone dessert orders...well hmm :/ \n\nstill love this place but maybe perhaps don't understaff?", 
            "i used to hate this place!  many visits a couple years ago...all with slow service, room temperature nigiri, etc.  this was actually one of the only places that i told people not to go to for sushi....and never understood why others liked it so much.\n\na very reluctant lunch stop proved to be a much better experience this time around!\n\na few highlights :\n\nsea scallops were awesome! super fresh, buttery texture...melt in your mouth! \n\nsake was very fresh today! beautiful cuts of salmon....the sake in yuzu was very good as well, and not overpowering like yuzu can be sometimes.\n\nthe ika with mint. i really enjoyed this combination...and it was noticeably less chewy than most. \n\nahi. fresh, but another odd cut...the darker area was a bit tougher...should have been removed by the chef.  pic : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oyshi-sushi-las-vegas?select=unvcwliuog_lmr-zkuakwq#unvcwliuog_lmr-zkuakwq\n\nunagi. nice crispy edges...good flavor! \n\n<mark>Ahi Poke</mark>. tuna was fresh, and the <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> was good too!\n\nsunomono. i liked their version here...thin cuts versus the larger circular cuts most use. the ginger sauce was good too.\n\ngreen tea <mark>Trio Of Creme Brulee</mark>. delicious! lots of tea flavor here \n\nservice was fairly quick, considering their tables were mostly full.\n\ni would come back again now if i was already on this side of town :p", 
            "we were in vegas a few months ago when a stranger told us about this place.  i remembered the name and we had time to try it out a few days ago.  we got there at about 8pm and on a weekday so it wasn't packed.  we had the best waiters though.  service was excellent from the get go.  the people that work there are friendly and nice.  we ordered a few rolls and some appetizers to begin with.  we just took our time eating.  we weren't in a rush.  at times, we would take breaks and the waiter/waitress would check to see if we wanted to order anything.  all the rolls were fresh and tasty.  it's ayce but they ask that you eat everything that you order.  everything that we ordered was delicious.  we also ordered the <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> and that was very nice.  the music is loud but it is also a place with a lot of energy.  i thought it was perfect.  we had a great experience and we will be back the next time we're in vegas.", 
            "oyshi sushi bar restaurant is definitely a must go! i've been here three times since it has been introduced to me on july 5th of 2014. it obviously hasn't been that long ago and it has already taken my interest and satisfies my cravings! i love their ayce pricing ($21 lunch/$26 dinner) and of course the all-you-can-eat selections! i highly suggest their yellowtail with pico de gallo, <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>, <mark>Fresh Oyster</mark>, and shrimp tempura as starters to prepare you for this sushi selection like kami kaze, dragon, rock n' roll, catepillar, treasure and etc. seriously though, this place is amazingly delicious. my only complaint as to why i gave this place a four star instead of a five because customer service can take you a long way and two out of the three times i've been here was a little below fair. it took them almost 20 mins in order to finally give us some attention and take our second order, they didn't refill our drinks unless asked and our wait for our entree was quite some time. asides that, the food is heavenly mouth-watering and the ayce pricing is good!", 
            "sunday night here is pretty packed but people here are very accommodating and friendly. their ayce is the bomb!! so my mom and i ordered their monster, (a little sweet for me), lobster fair (omg this is one is freaking good!), japanese garlic lasagna, and many more! however, their salmon lover was a little bit so so for us cause the salmon wasn't fresh at all, they used frozen ones. for appetizers, their <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>, <mark>Ahi Poke</mark>, <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark> were pretty good. and of course, for dessert, i got some green tea <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> and their tiramisu too! so yummy! we're definitely looking forward to eat here again besides we just live near here!", 
            "this is one of the best ayce sushi joints out there. their fish is fresh and the portions are right. the sushi is big enough for you to actually taste it, but at a size where you don't get full quickly. my staples at any ayce sushi joints are eel and avocado handrolls and nigiri. i'm not a big fan of rolls and this place does it for me. they also have additional appetizers that you won't find at typical sushi restaurants. i really like their <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>, which is quite the generous portion. <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> is expensive and this place does not skimp out. the albacore is especially good at this restaurant. they have these sizzling plates which comes out on fajita wooden plates. i have tried the surf and turf which is really delicious. i would recommend getting one to share with a few friends. the appetizer portions are small, but they do fill you up. try sharing the appetizers so you can save room for the real stuff. with this said, the best part truly is the dessert. this place by far has the best tasting <mark>Trio Of Creme Brulee</mark> i have ever had. the only bad thing is that dessert is not all you can eat, it's only one per person. make sure you leave room for dessert because you do not want to miss out. i have been here twice and will definitely come back the next time i'm in town. the service has been great during both of my visits. the food is usually out at the right time and you never have to wait too long for your orders. the waiters are also really sweet. i highly recommend this place!!"

            "oyshi is the closest ayce sushi to my house, so i've been here quite a lot. not my favorite place, but it's a solid option. the decor is very modern and trendy. they also play edm music and have sports showing on the flat screens near the bar. all postitives in my eyes. i always sit at the bar, so the service is good. normally i can just order directly from the sushi chef without waiting for a waiter. that really speeds up the ordering process. i can't speak to the service when seated anywhere else in the restaurant.\n\none disappointing thing about oyshi is that it doesn't offer <mark>Seafood Salad</mark> on the ayce menu. that automatically prevents it from a five star review in my eyes. on the bright side, the amount of fish on the nigiri sushi is ample. very high fish to rice ratio. i also like the variety of desserts offered. you're not limited to the usual mochi or <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>. oyshi also offers <mark>Trio Of Creme Brulee</mark> and a <mark>Vanilla- Berry Parfait</mark>. the <mark>Vanilla- Berry Parfait</mark> is my usual and it's a must have."

            "hmmm...i was planning to lose my ayce sushi virginity to ms. goyemon but there was a two hour wait so instead i opted for the next girl available named ms. oyshi....i'd rather like to think we didn't go all the way and i'm still saving myself for the former.  \n\nfor 26 bucks, i think it's definitely in line with sushi goyemon, but i happened to be in the company of some friends who had been there as well, so i was able to get some perspective as i proceeded with my first time navigating this a la carte ordering feeding frenzy.  the first few speed bumps which caught my eye were some ground rules listed in the menu:\n\n1. no sashimi, only one order of oysters (4 pieces), uni, and sweet shrimp allowed...fair enough\n\n2. no excess rice shall be allowed to remain uneaten on the plate, otherwise that order will be counted as extra on the final bill....have people been discarding their rice into a large pile assembling a massive sculptured mountain of rice?  the rice that was used to prepare the sushi was highly variable in quality  (too soft, too firm, or mixed) throughout the various rounds of ordering so it only motivated us to concoct creative methods for disposing the rice (hiding it in the tea jar, breaking it into tiny grains and scattering it across the plate so as to create the illusion of a clean plate, and to borrow a technique from a friend who disliked rice during her early childhood, placing said rice into mouth and going to bathroom to dispose in toilet/trash).  of course none of this was done, but it was tempting nonetheless.\n\n3.  any orders which are unfinished in general will be counted as extra orders on the final bill...this was adhered yet strangely enough after receiving our final round of food (a modest 2-3 rolls) the server waited when we were rubbing our bellies and chimes in \"you have two more rolls coming!\" and none of us had any idea where these phantom rolls were coming from and she then replies with a snarky shrug  \"i'll take them off your order\" as if she was doing us a favor....pure shenanigans\n\n4. the jalapeno poppers on the appetizer menu were not allowed to be included amongst the ayce orders....what kind of crazy logic is this?  wouldn't it be good strategy to fill your customers with heartburn due to fatty spicy cream cheese richness to slow down their intake of much much more expensive items?  either these are the greatest jalapeno poppers in the history of appetizers or a missed business opportunity.   i don't even like jalapeno poppers but i almost was willing  to eat one just because this condition existed.\n\nthe meal\n\nthe appetizers  (<mark>Ahi Poke</mark>, spicy <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>, and <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark>)  the poke might as well have been unseasoned sashimi, whereas the <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark> was overdressed nearly drowning in the chili vinaigrette, and the <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark> was surprisingly not overly salty as i anticipated but ended up being the surprise highlight of the meal.\n\nthe \"big three\" (uni, raw oysters, and sweet shrimp)...not exceedingly fresh but no risk of possible food poisoning either, although the oysters had a watered down quality to them....only tasted good since they were not specifically paid for.\n\nthe nigiri:  i sampled the surfer clam, spanish mackerel, japanese yellowtail, and a few other standards....there was definitely something i couldn't put my finger on but the level of freshness just seemed 1 level below what you would expect if you ordered these same items at a regular reputable sushi bar.  i'm thinking perhaps they were precut in mass production and by the time they arrived they were partially dried out from the external surface area of each piece of fish being exposed for a prolonged period of time.\n\nthe rolls:  perhaps i've had enough sushi experiences to have progressed beyond rolls since they are drenched in so much sauce (seriously, what is the obsession with orgasm sauce in this town?), crispy shavings of empty calories, or packed with so many types of fish that i couldn't really differentiate any of them out of a sushi roll lineup much like the seinfeld episode where george tries to catch the twix bar candy thief (\"it's a setup! they're all caterpillar rolls!!\")  i would try to limit your roll intake and focus on the other items to keep your palate from being overwhelmed(and to avoid the server from pulling that phantom roll maneuver as previously discussed)\n\nlast but not least, we figured we had successfully navigated through the labyrinth of extra charges until we received the final bill which charged us for the hot tea...are you serious???  so you're telling me i could have drank an entire gallon of <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark> instead of one measly cup of hot green tea which cost you pennies to brew?  perhaps these were some tea leaves taken from the emperor's garden, but i would appreciate a warning next time.  \n\n3 stars only because we definitely still got our money's worth, but i'm leaving a few more stars to be earned since my friends reassured me goyemon is better.", 
            "wow this place was definitely the best ayce sushi i've ever had. first of all, the selection is amazing and overwhelming. it is a great deal for 21 dollars. trust me and order the following items and you will be one satisfied customer with your belly about to explode. \n\ni will start off with the non-rolls food: must get the surf and turf, <mark>Ahi Poke</mark>, <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>, <mark>Asian Style Skirt Steak</mark>, <mark>Grilled Beef Asparagus</mark> and beef. there were a few other items that i would like to try next time. there were simpy so freaking many.\nfor rolls, try the nuclear bomb roll, lobster fair, paradise roll, and oh what the heck, just try everything!\nfor desert, you definitely have to try the green tea tiramisu. \n\nthe service was also great and very attentive. they will make great recommendations based off of your tastes. so trust me, if you're in vegas, give this place a try.", 
            "i went there tonight for a take out and it took them an hour to finish my order, plus it took another 15 minutes to be bagged.  i saw my order on the counter ready for bagging, but nobody was minding it.  if i did not asked about my order, it will be just sitting there.  they also forgot to put dressing on my <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>.   hence, the 2 stars."

            "ever since i can remember, sushi-mon (the one on silverado ranch/maryland pkwy) has been my favorite go-to spot. words couldn't describe how good it is. but i decided to try something new. this place had 270 reviews with an average of four stars. so they must be doing something right.\n\nafter one minute of walking the wrong way..we finally got into the entrance..by following the arrows...\n\ndecor was really nice, bigger than the usual sushi bars. great location too. the vip room and lounge room was a nice touch. it was slow mind you, during lunch when i walked in with my \"friend\" karlee. we started off with, my favorite <mark>Ahi Poke</mark> and <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark>. karlee had the soup as well and gyoza. <mark>Ahi Poke</mark> was ok, but not better than sushi mon, the flavor wasn't just there. miso was good, not fantastic. karlee loved the gyoza, she said it was better than the other sushi place she goes that serves it. \n\ni had the j&b roll, baked, with salmon and cream cheese. it was good, juicy, hand a hint of soy sauce. hats off to the sushi chef because it was awesome. i had a cucumber roll, asian strip steak and this deep fried california roll, with hot mustard and albacore tuna. all was great but the j&b roll was the highlight. karlee had 2 orders of the shrimp tempura roll, apparently it was good, i couldn't have any because i am allergic to shrimp. she tried to force feed it to me, knowing i was allergic, i think she tried to kill me, because i tried to make fun of her sirarcha/hot mayo sauce that she custom made..oh and she had <mark>Chicken Teriyaki</mark> and i think another order of gyoza, apparently she loves that stuff.\n\n the service was a little slow, especially when they weren't busy. this was all you can eat, and what i was shocked about how they did not serve half rolls!! i was like wtf? how could i possibly try more than 3 types. other than that the waitress seemed puzzled and brought us the wrong dishes a couple of times. no big deal. the food was great, service was so-so, and it is a place i would come back to again. i also ate too much, because i regret not getting desert (no one really gets more than one desert, but why would they limit you to just one, its all you can eat!!!), being that it was one of the reasons i came here for, green tea tiramisu, i'm coming back for you!", 
            "late night sushi at its best (at least, from what i've tried so far)\n\ni usually don't get off until 11:15 at night, and by that time, most sushi bars in vegas have already packed it in and called it a night, or are shortly about to. not oyshi!\nthankfully, this place stays open until 2am (last call at 1:30 am) and is perfect for folks working in the entertainment industry in vegas.\n\nthe all-you-can-eat option is $27 at this place, and it is worth it! though not as great as other ayce places i have dined in, it still boasts a wide selection of rolls and hot food. \n\ni think my favorite roll was the yellowstone roll, which was an interesting spicy tune and whitefish concoction that was topped with yum-yum sauce, jalapeno and cheddar cheese. i haven't ever been to a place with cheddar cheese as a sushi topping.\n\ni do wish that the dessert was all you can eat as well, because i would have like two mochi balls instead of 1, but that's a small gripe.\n\nthe alcohol did seem relatively expensive. my buddy had a sapporo and it was $7 or $8. that almost seems obscene.\n\non a positive note, dad is not a huge sushi fan, so he opted for the teriyaki chicken dinner. for $11, hhe had a <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark>, a salad, a bowl of white rice and a huge steaming hot plate full of <mark>Chicken Teriyaki</mark> with hardly any vegetables. it was a fantastic deal!",

            "so, after doing much research, hoping to find a great alternative to my usual spot for ayce sushi, i decided on oyshi, solely because of the great reviews i saw here on yelp. \n\ni looked up the website, called and asked about prices, and finally my boyfriend and i decided to make the trip out. \n\nwe arrived at about 8:30pm, and it was a friday night, so i expected it to be bustling. during our wait to be seated,  i scoped out the crowd, and noticed the usual. mostly those under the age of 30, large groups of them in fact, and figured this must be their spot before they hit the clubs, considering their attire. well, it was either that or the fact that the music in the restaurant sounded as if you were already in a night club. it must be set on pandora or something. anyway, it was only about a 15 minute wait, which wasn't bad at all. \n\nso, besides my observations of the restaurant ambiance and demographic, we finally were able to look at the menu. my boyfriend usually orders the nigiri, so we got the usual garlic tuna, albacore, cajun albacore, and decided to try the oyshi scallops. as for the rolls, i decided on the sibuya no rice, coco, and a bonsai. i also decided to get the <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark>, <mark>Grilled Beef Asparagus</mark>, <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark> and <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>. this was only the first round after all.\n\nwe were excited to eat until the food arrived on our table. first the nigiri, the presentation was obviously not of any importance, but you can't judge a book by its cover, so we took a few bites anyway. \n\nverdict, \n\nthe garlic tuna was disgusting. it smelled and tasted like spoiled blood. i've had garlic tuna many times at many other restaurants, and this one had to be the worst. it even looked slimy, not because of the sauce, just itself.\n\nthe albacore was seared, and also tasted old. it had the same garlic sauce poured over it as the garlic tuna, and it was mushy.\n\nthe oyshi scallops i thought were going to be \"oishi\" but, definitely not. they mixed it with crab meat, and very light mayo, and it fell apart immediately as i tried to pick it up. \n\nthe cajun albacore had too much cajun seasoning! i usually love cajun albacore, and this was too much for my palate, on top of that it was dry.\n\nmy boyfriend got his usual spicy tuna hand rolls as well, and the spicy tuna looked a little spoiled. \n\non to the rolls,\n\nthe bonsai, had the cajun albacore on it as well, but i had to bear it to see if the spicy tuna in the center was at least average. the roll as a whole was not to my liking.\n\nthe coco, was probably the most decent roll on table, probably because each of the ingredients in it were fully cooked.\n\nthe sibuya no rice, again with the spicy tuna... eh.\n\nthe appetizers,\n\nthe <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> is usually my favorite appetizer!!! it came out looking as if it were just fried up, and i commend the presentation on this one, but the center was cold, the sauce was not tasty, and i hate that it is not \"bite-size\" as most japanese cuisine is known to be. \n\nthe <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> was not a bright green and although it was crispy, it had an ugly after taste, i've had better, let's just leave it at that.\n\nthe <mark>Grilled Beef Asparagus</mark> was drizzled in teriyaki sauce. the asparagus was perfect, but the beef wrapped around it was dry somehow.\n\nthe <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark> were not baked enough, and the yumyum sauce was pretty tasteless. \n\ni was disappointed already, but decided to take another round of appetizers, since i knew the sushi wasn't going to be very enjoyable. i settled for calamari, shrimp/veg tempura, edamame, <mark>Asian Style Skirt Steak</mark>, and some other things that were just not memorable enough.\n\ni knew it was bad when i was scarfing down edamame and tempura. the calamari looked good, but the dipping sauces  (ranch and a mayo/mustard mix) could have been more \"asian\" i guess? my boyfriend ate the <mark>Asian Style Skirt Steak</mark> (aka korean bulgogi, in my opinion). he even commented \"i'm eating beef, which is probably the last thing i would expect to eat at a sushi restaurant.\"\n\nwith that said, it smelled as if something was burning the entire night we were there! \n\nhm, it was overall a disappointing experience.  we have both gone to many sushi restaurants, with my list including restaurants in hawaii and san francisco, california, and i wanted to seriously give this place a chance. unfortunately, oyshi just did not live up to the hype!\n\non a side note though, my waitress was very helpful, and service was mediocre, but that's about it.", 
            "this is my favorite sushi place in town. we eat here (and order to go) very frequently. they have really fresh fish and some interesting combinations. my favorite roll is the screaming roll, with shrimp tempura, cajun albacore, avocado and ponzu sauce. yum! their dinners are great, like the sukiyaki, rib-<mark>Rib Eye Steak Teriyaki</mark> and <mark>Asian Style Skirt Steak</mark>. also love their appetizers, like <mark>Popcorn Scallop</mark> and calamari tempura.", 
            "this was my second visit. after reading those frightening november reviews of food poisoning i was very leery about returning. i think alice w was more angry about the service and used the f.p. card. i've never heard of a whole family getting food poisoning so take that review with a grain of salt. \n\n my first time was good, i just did not write about it. today i went for lunch and had a great experience. they have a few new rolls and i tried 3 of them. they were all beautifully executed and tasted great. \n\ni'm usually not a fan of ponzu sauce but the iris roll**** off the new menu was so good i had 2 of them. it had  spicy albacore with cucumber, wrapped with avocado, and seared tuna. my eating partner in crime loved it. \n\nscreaming roll****shrimp tempura roll wrapped with yum-yum cajun albacore and avocado with garlic ponzu sauce. flavor of cajun albacore was awesome. \n\nlove affair roll ***shrimp tempura roll with yum-yum lobster, crunch flakes and masago on top. this was good, but came in last of all the other rolls. \n\n<mark>Asian Style Skirt Steak</mark>*** is served teriaki style on a sizzling mini skillet. it was a nice addition to sushi.\n\nservice was better than average. i always sit at the sushi bar. here you order from a waiter instead of directly from sushi chefs. my waiter was attentive, i had enough h2o to drink and never had to wait on food or ordering more of it. \n\nthe ayce is $21.00 per person and well worth it. i wish they offered fried rice but there are lots of items offered on their menu.\n\ni will return to oyshi as it is the best sushi that is close to my house.", 
            "wow this place was definitely the best ayce sushi i've ever had. first of all, the selection is amazing and overwhelming. it is a great deal for 21 dollars. trust me and order the following items and you will be one satisfied customer with your belly about to explode. \n\ni will start off with the non-rolls food: must get the surf and turf, <mark>Ahi Poke</mark>, <mark>Sashimi Salad</mark>, <mark>Asian Style Skirt Steak</mark>, <mark>Grilled Beef Asparagus</mark> and beef. there were a few other items that i would like to try next time. there were simpy so freaking many.\nfor rolls, try the nuclear bomb roll, lobster fair, paradise roll, and oh what the heck, just try everything!\nfor desert, you definitely have to try the green tea tiramisu. \n\nthe service was also great and very attentive. they will make great recommendations based off of your tastes. so trust me, if you're in vegas, give this place a try.", 
            "average sushi at best but considering that for $27 you can get all you can eat lunch, i'm a fan.\n\npros:\n1. decent selection of rolls, sashimi, appetizers for the buffet option\n2. friendly service\n\ncons:\n1. no sweet shrimp or uni (sea urchin) for lunch buffet (dinner only)\n2. dynamite roll had wayyyy too much mayo which was gross\n3. no all you can eat dessert!? wanted some more of that strawberry mochi!\n\nrecommendations: i'd choose the <mark>Asian Style Skirt Steak</mark> over the other steaks. yellow halibut is awesome (don't get the baby halibut as it is bland). any of their rolls is decent but nothing really stood out to me in particular.\n\ndefinitely worth coming back for the lunch special",

            "i go to oyshi on a consistent basis, as i live just down the street. the food is always delicious and fresh, although i feel the ayce is a tad overpriced for dinner as there are some odd restrictions (only one dessert per customer except for <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>, etc.). the service is hit or miss; it's either excellent and quick, or exhaustingly slow. \n\ni usually do ayce, but order mostly appetizers. the gyoza are fresh, crispy and delicious. the <mark>Asian Style Skirt Steak</mark> is wonderful. the chicken yakitori is also on my favorites list. as far as sushi rolls are concerned, i've always ordered the crunch shrimp tempura roll. no complaints about the food, except for the cut pieces are sometimes too big to eat one piece at once.",

            "for years i patronized an ayce sushi place called pumi at sahara/ft apache, they closed.  \n\nthen the search was on...i used yelp to find a place called hikari and patronized them for years. well, after several changes with management/ownership/service as well as the changes in fish quality/preparation/selection, i thought too many changes and i think consistency is important when indulging in raw fish, so what did i do?  i once again looked at yelp reviews to offer me additional ayce sushi selections and i found...oyshi.\n\noyshi is my new go to place for ayce sushi. the pricing is about the same as many of the others, around $28 per person. \n\nat 6'3 and 250 lb i like my elbow space, especially on airplanes and sushi bars. oyshi offers a wide and long sushi bar, that i could have a sumo wrestler feasting on each side of me and still eat comfortably. \n\nthere is a beautiful wall mural that i enjoy looking at when i dine from across the restaurant. it is of a geisha girl with bonzai trees and just a pretty colorful picture that adds a nice japanese type theme stretching across an entire wall. the music is american hip hop/top 40ish. they do accept reservations, however i'm not sure if it helps as there is always a long wait, like 45 minutes to 1.5 hours on a fri/sat night. they will take your phone number and call you if you are getting close to your table and do not want to stick around the entire wait. we left and went up to best buy and  daydreamed of the new $9,000 dollar uhd 78 inch television and came back in time for our dinner.\n\nthe server will come around and take your order for the sushi bar, despite being sat at the sushi bar. i find this odd considering the chef is right in front of us, but that's the way it is. perhaps because the chefs are always busy and rarely a moment to relax, joke around and drink sake with patrons, as common in other sushi bars.\n\nthere is a very talented and friendly sushi chef named ivan who wears a chicago white sox baseball cap. he has a sushi entree of his own called ivan's creation.  try it, you'll like it!\n\nour favorite server so far is vincent, not vinny, originally vincenzo. he knows the menu well and offers excellent recommendations based on his solid listening skills and good questions of what we like, dislike, etc.\n\nthe bathrooms are clean. they have many tables to dine at, in addition to the sushi bar and they also have a vip room that conceals a loud obnoxious 15+ patrons.\n\nthe ayce menu is three pages and filled with plenty to choose from whether raw or cooked. they are often out of oysters and do not offer sashimi as part of ayce, however they do offer plenty that other ayce places do not.  \n\ndozens of creative rolls to choose from that are delicious. many hot dishes to choose from including meat on skewers called yakitori. also cooked meats on a platter of cabbage or onions included choices of surf n turf, rib eye steak, <mark>Asian Style Skirt Steak</mark> and a cooked pork dish. an entire page on tempura dishes. dessert is included, she chose the <mark>Trio Of Creme Brulee</mark> and said it was delicious. my dessert included eel, quail eggs and octopus.\n\nif you've tried other nearby ayce sushi places such as hikari or goyemon, you will most likely enjoy oyshi and after dining here, you will say what we say...\"it was excellent, we will be back!\""

            "if it wasn't for a stubborn friend, we would have gotten here earlier and avoided a \"long\" wait.  this friend said take the 95, take the 95, blah blah blah.  even after the waiter said take the 215, my friend insisted on taking the 95.  the waiter probably said: \"whatever, dude, get lost and then wait longer and have your friends kick your ass before you eat our delicious buffet\".  after another friend looked oyshi sushi himself, we found out that we should take the 215 and did so after i got all frustrated driving in the 15 fwy traffic.\n\nin any case, after waiting and getting seated at our table, we went straight to ordering our all-you-can-eat, which includes 2 uni (sea urchin) pieces, 2 amaebi (raw, sweet shrimp) pieces & 4 raw oysters.  yep, there's a limit on those but you must understand that there aren't that many other places that would even give you these premium sushi pieces.  just a note on the uni - slightly less fresh than i've had before.  in any case, you get these in addition to their fresh & delicious sushi.  their salmon, yellowtail, albacore, halibut sushis are great, plus they don't give you as much rice in their sushi as other places.  their rib-<mark>Rib Eye Steak Teriyaki</mark> is also an excellent dish to have.  their tempura is also very good.  as for the dessert, we all had the strawberry <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>, which was very good.  all for $25 per person.  not bad at all.\n\ni only have to mention a couple of cons: there is a 1 dessert limit for each person.  however, you can have all the <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> you want since this is not considered one of the dessert items.  plus, i find it just strange that the place is so huge and yet they waste so much space & put tiny little tables in the center when you can get bigger tables there to accommodate more people.  last con... service.  a bit slow.  it was a really busy night, but i'm still surprised that they took more than 15 mins to take out raw food.  there was a 2-hr limit, but i don't think they pushed this limit all too much.", 
            "we get into vegas friday evening, checked in, and began our weekend off with a night of debauchery.\n\nfood porn at oyshi. yessiree, four hungry men and a ayce japanese food? this is gonna get ugly fast, real fast. we get there and it's packed. a nice waiter greeted us and told us it might be a while. 20 minutes. shit, thats it? his reaction made it seem like an hour or 2. dude! we'll wait. \n\nthe restaurant is nicely designed with modern furnishings. its set to look very relaxing like a lounge. like gerald s pointed out, it's not set up well if there's large groups. the good side is that it doesn't feel overcrowded. \n\nthe ayce is probably the best and only way to go here. there are so many items to choose from and the quality was not as bad as i thought it would be. they do limit the expensive stuff like uni, amaebi, and raw oysters, but it was well worth it. the sushi was very well made and fresh. their sushi cuts are very generous. they hardly give any rice, so it was perfect. everything was awesome, from the salmon, tempura, ribeye, and unlimited green tea or vanilla <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>!!! \n\nlike hawks, we swooped down and attacked everything. nothing was safe. we washed it all down with hot house sake ($7). for $25, i would do it over, and over, and over, and over, *deep breath*, and over again. the food came out slow, it was expected because they  had a full house. the service was simply awesome. if it's a friday or saturday, give them a call to make reservations. we left hurting and sat in our car like beached whales. \n\nyou may have defeated us oyshi, but we'll be back. back with bigger and hungrier guys. *waives fist*", 
            "so v. and i headed to this spot on our way out of las vegas to l.a. and i am adding this place to my favorites whenever in vegas...\n\nservice is decent,the food is great and they have plasmas where i got to see the lakers take on the rockets! so that was awesome,sushi and watching the game...how cooler can you get...jk\n\nso this was what v and i had/tried:\n\nphilly roll\nrainbow roll\ntiger roll\ndynamite roll\nginza roll\nspyder roll\n2 orders of yellowtail\n2 orders of albacore\n5 orders of tuna\n5 orders of salmon\nvanilla <mark>Trio Of Creme Brulee</mark>\nstrawberry <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>\n\neverything was really good and fresh(on a sunday!) \n\nyea,i have experienced some places on sunday,and the fish never tasted this fresh.\n\nso the deal is this,only 2 hours to eat and no sashimi,that works for me,regardless!\n\nthanks for reading,hit this one spot when in vegas!",

            "i would've given this place 5 stars, had i reviewed it the first time i ate there. i don't quite remember what i had the first time coming into this restaurant, but i do remember having their blue<mark>Vanilla- Berry Parfait</mark>, and that alone deserved 5 stars! my second visit to oyshi was for dinner, and i ordered the <mark>Ahi Poke</mark> salad, the love affair sushi roll, and a parfait of course! the salad and the sushi roll were excellent, the best part was probably the love affair sushi roll.. probably the best roll i had in a while, from what i remember, it had lobster and crab meat, it was awesome! so here it goes, if so excellent, why the 4 stars you ask.. \n\nwell.. the parfait. it was so much bigger and tastier the first time around.. from what i recall, it was served in a taller glass the last time, more <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> and more toppings.. this time, it was skimped down to a smaller glass, and yes, smaller glass means smaller parfait. it also lacked the toppings i once remembered it had. therefore, i conclude this review by saying oyshi is an awesome restaurant, but they need to overcome this economic slump by serving more not less! =)", 
            "yeah, the husband and i are sushi snobs - at least we're upfront about it.  but when you're living in vegas, the only way to go is to do ayce, right?  after getting tons of recommendations for this place, we finally got around to seeing what the hype is all about.\n\nall-you-can-eat dinner is $26/pp.  it was pretty busy on a sunday night with a steady stream of customers (and large groups) coming in all night long.\n\nlike ned m. mentioned, the sushi rice is only okay...it could be better.  perhaps that's what put us off already...we had to eat the rice and we weren't digging it.\n\nwe ordered lots of nigiri and found the fish to be okay too, some of it was mushy though.  as one friend mentioned, she wished the fish was a bit 'colder'.  maybe we came on a bad night - but everyone is raving about the fish.  i'm also not too fond of 'sauce' added to my nigiri, and they added 'sauce' to a lot of my nigiri choices.  \n\nthey do offer a wider selection of side items like <mark>Asian Style Skirt Steak</mark>, <mark>Rib Eye Steak Teriyaki</mark>, etc.  and for this reason, one friend prefers coming here over other ayce places.  i do like their version of agadashi tofu though.\n\nlimitations on their menu include:\n* one order of uni and amaebi per person\n* limit one order of oysters on the half shell (4 pieces) per person\n* limit one order on desserts <mark>Trio Of Creme Brulee</mark>, <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>, <mark>Vanilla- Berry Parfait</mark> or green tea tiramisu (regular <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> is ayce though - plum, green tea, vanilla, and coffee)\n\nsitting at the sushi bar, service was pretty good.  the manager seemed like he was our main waiter and he was quite attentive.  we thought we were supposed to order our sushi from the sushi chef, but he asked the manager to take our sushi order instead.  he continued to take our orders throughout the night and refilled our beverages too.  there was a gap at one point where our tempura order was forgotten, had to be reordered again, and then had to be followed up on again before we got it.\n\ni can see why this place is popular - there's definitely a mixed crowd and separate rooms for private parties.  the staff are busy and attentive and they definitely recognize the regulars.  they have a lot of rolls to choose from, something that we usually avoid.  overall, we found oyshi sushi to be an average place for ayce sushi.", 
            "i'm not from vegas but today marks my 3rd time coming here and i look forward to making it a tradition each time i'm in town. this place is awesome. it's a bit of a drive off the strip, about 10 minutes but well worth it.\nit has a nice ambiance perfect for a date or a night out with the girls. there were quite a bit of families there also. 26 dollars ! all you can eat. i've been to many ayce sushi places and they always give you fewer choices and just the basic appetizers and maybe a green tea <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> for dessert. not this place. they have a huge selection of rolls. they are so delicious. ummm. they have so many appetizers to choose from. if your a meat eater you will appreciate it because they offer a lot of meat dishes. last but not least if you have room the dessert is heavenly. they have <mark>Trio Of Creme Brulee</mark>, green tea tiramisu, <mark>Vanilla- Berry Parfait</mark> and one other that i cannot recall. \nall this for 26 bucks. it's unbelievable that you can get all this and still have great quality. the only negative thing i can say about this place is that on friday and saturday nights it gets busy so you may have to wait a while for them to come back and get your 2nd orders. this still doesn't deter me from giving them 5 stars because the servers are really helpful and cordial when they do come back.", 
            "i decided that i wanted ayce sushi last night (saturday) so i headed over to oyshi.  i checked in with the host at about 8:30pm and was informed that it would be about 20 minutes for a table.  it was a nice night, so i just grabbed a chair on the sidewalk in front and waited for the other half of my party to arrive.  there were probably four or five other small groups of people milling about waiting for tables too.\n\nwe were seated at the bar just after 9:00pm.  the place seemed pretty busy...  some uncleared tables, a couple large parties (one with kids) occupied the \"vip\" rooms behind us.  it was on the noisy side, especially with the techno/house/electronica music pumping from the ceiling speakers above the four chef's stations.\n\nafter a few minutes we were greeted by a friendly server who confirmed our ayce preference, took our drinks and asked if we were ready to put in our first round of orders.  we were.  i started with <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark>, an assortment of nigiri style items, an \"<mark>Ahi Poke</mark>\" and an order of four oysters (limit 1).  note:  i thought it was interesting that even though we were seated at the bar, our sushi requests were made with the server.  i guess the server was attempting to queue the orders for the very busy chefs.\n\nthe nigiri items on first order arrived quickly and we were told be the chef in front of us that the oysters would be out in a \"little while\".  the nigiri items were nicely presented and of good quality.  the <mark>Ahi Poke</mark> was just a small clump of chopped tuna on top of a mix of <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> and sprinkled with sesame seed (not exactly what i think of when i think poke, but i'm not trying to get techincal up in here son).\n\nthe oysters came out a few minutes later.  they were covered in green onion, a bit of masago and a squirt of sriracha.  i can only assume that the toppings were meant to cover up the tasteless, been sitting in a fresh-water tank, half-dollar sized oysters.  engh, i figured i'd keep moving forward, after all this was ayce...\n\nround two:  more nigiri (including surf clam, tamago, masago, quail egg, tako, and scallop), something called \"oyshi scallop\", and a spider roll.  we also ordered the chicken, beef and shrimp yakitori, which were all paired with asparagus and came sitting in a sweet teriyaki sauce.  again the nigiri items were of nice quality.  i'm not sure we ever got the \"oyshi scallop\".  there were two items in the order that looked like a krab salad (the california roll stuff) that i was sure we didn't order.  the spider roll was basically a california roll with one meager soft-shell crab in it, and it had been covered in the same bbq sauce they put on the eel.\n\nsince i was disappointed with the spider roll and i love soft-shell crab, i put in an order for a monster roll, which was also supposed to have soft-shell crab in it.  what came out was something similar to the spider (covered in the same eel sauce) only with the addition of a few slivers of eel and a refrigerator cold tempura shrimp stuffed into it.  slow down on that eel sauce dawg.\n\nat this point, i was pretty full and done trying...  the sushi chef in front of us was closing down his station, giving it a quick wash down with a wet rag and mumbling something about this night being his \"early out\".  by this time the dining room was starting to clear out too, but the party with the kids were still in our audible vicinity.\n\ni finished up my second pot of hot tea (which was a nice quality loose leaf green) and enjoyed a green tea <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> mochi ball.  both of these items were good.\n\nafter tipping out the chefs, server and taking care of the bill, i had spent about $75 for the two of us.  i'm not sure i'll be back anytime soon, but i made the best of it while i was there.", 
            "star # 1 - all you can eat sushi!  i mean that is a star in itself\n\nstar # 2 - $26.95 for all you can eat sushi dinner ;) good price because i can eat that much in sushi ...easy!\n\nstar # 3 - i have been to other all you can sushi places in vegas and this one has the most variety.  the side dish list is much longer than others and offers some good stuff\n\nstar # 4 - customer service here is great. they treat you with great courtesy and always come back to make sure you are ok.\n\nstar # 5 - restaurant setting.  i mean they play a little bit too much trance and should maybe mix in the some r&b, or commercial hip hop, but the ambiance is still cool.  they have modern decor, and tvs in visible areas to watch espn...perfect! haha!\n\ncome here hungry and beware how much you order.   here are some good things i like to order:\n\nside dishes:\n-surf n turf\n-<mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark>\n-shrimp tempura\n-edamame (warm and with some salt! lol)\n-green tea <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>\n-green tea mochi\n\nsushi rolls:\n-spicy tuna crunch\n-spider roll",

            "4.30.11 i definitely enjoyed the atmosphere, it was cute for a huge restaurant. it was dim, but not to the point where you can't see anything. i really like their sushi bar it's really big. the tables in the restaurants are nicely spaced so you're not rubbing elbows with your neighbors. i'm not used to japanese restaurants that can accommodate several large parties. they had two private rooms and we were in another area that was semi-private. there were 9 of us and we sat comfortably. i really like the painting they had against the wall in our semi private area. it was actually the only painting i saw throughout the restaurant. \n\ni have never eaten at an ayce sushi in las vegas away from the strip so i was super excited. i ordered their <mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> and it was so salty! stay away, ha ha. i was disappointed but quickly got over it when i tasted their poke salad. i remember ordering the kimono roll, yellow trio and dessert. i had more than that, but i was so amazed how refreshing everything tasted i was too excited to remember to write it down. when i ordered i stayed away from tempura or anything baked. i was not going to get full off that, i wanted fish. their sushi was fresh and i especially remember the salmon handroll, it was perfect. i really enjoyed their food, although the oyster was okay and their uni really looked like it needed a makeover. \n\ntheir service was super duper good, although for some reason i was the last one to receive my order. that made me the last one to eat the desserts everyone was done while i was still waiting. ha ha. do not pass up on ordering their <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>. doesn't matter if you're full and your fly is about to pop, still order their dessert.\n\nso overall, next time i will definitely come here for their ayce! their selection of rolls for their ayce is plenty, not like other places its mainly filled with baked and tempura stuff. this one had plenty of raw fish in their rolls. just the way i like it! \n\ndon't be a fool and miss out on this wonderful meal..", 
            "by far the best all-you-can-eat sushi places i have ever been to.\nmy cousin, who lives in the area, claimed that this place has really good sushi and an even better all-you-can-eat deal. as i'm from san francisco, i was a bit cautious and not too optimistic about the quality and freshness of the fish, however i was quickly impressed with the large variety of rolls, fish as well as other main entr\\u00e9es and appetizers on the menu.\ni started with the simple <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> and edamame, both which were well seasoned and served at the perfect temperature.\ntypically i am a fancy, combo roll fan but i will have to say that the quality of fish made the simple rolls one of my favorites of the night. the spicy yellowtail roll was very good as was the salmon avocado.\nto finish off, the all-you-can-eat menu there is a choice of dessert. i'm always a fan of the green tea <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> and in this instant the <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> was superb. \nwill def go back the next time i am in vegas.", 
            "great deal for all you can eat!!! 21 bucks for adults and 15 for kids. i treated myself and my cousins to a lunch before taking the red eye back to nyc.\n\ni wasn't sure if we were going to be able to eat a lot but we sure ate more than we paid for! everything in the menu was included except for sashimi (easy fix: order it sushi style and don't eat the rice), uni and ebi.\n\nwe had gyoza, edamame, <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>,  seven rolls (from regular spicy tuna and alaska rolls to specialty ones including a spider, baked rolls, and a deep fried philly), two hand rolls, two orders of tako nigiri, two orders of hamachi nigiri, an order of tamago, and green tea <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> for dessert.\n\ni'd say we did a but of damage at this joint! what i also liked was that our waitress was recommending specialties to get and told us that appetizers and dessert were included. she was also helpful when my cousin wanted green tea <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> and parfait by combining the two together. it was pretty much the green tea <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> instead of vanilla yogurt with fruit and whipped cream on top. what a way to end a great meal!", 
            "(4.5 stars)\n\nmy trip to vegas would not be complete without a visit to oyshi sushi. though it's off strip, i'm lucky my best friend lives close enough so we can make a trip every time i'm there. \n\nmy last visit was the first time i've done their all you can eat deal, and for $26, it was well worth it! the only things it doesn't include are the chef's special sashimi, so all your appetizers, salads, specialty rolls and desserts are included. my friends and i went all out and ordered several to share of every course. oysters were delicious and <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark> (while too much mayo sauce) was to die for. tempura dishes are nice and crispy and not too soggy or heavy. my favorite salad is their <mark>Ahi Poke</mark> on top of <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> - yum! we shared 6 specialty rolls that were all delicious in their own ways. again their specialty \"yum yum\" sauce is \"yum yum\", but in small amounts. the <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> is like the type you buy at the store, but again, it's all part of the deal so might as well indulge! we also got a bottle of lychee flavored cold sake that was decently priced and balanced the sweet:alcohol ratio perfectly.\n\nservice is good: unless its super busy, the wait staff always comes up to check on your group, make sure your water is filled, etc. as with any sushi place, baked rolls will take longer, so be patient! they did forget one of our orders at one point, but since we were eating so much, it gave us time to digest.\n\nif you can make the trip out with a group who enjoys sharing specialty rolls and can throw down in eating, oyshi is the place to go!", 
            "very fresh sushi- came here with a girlfriend, and on a diet!\nshe ordered ayce for $21...her food looked amazing.\ni opted for a lot of low-calorie things, so i got fresh albacore (6 pc), <mark>House Salad</mark> w/ dressing on the side, and <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark>.my food was amazing and i tried one of her lobster roll,that was also amazing!\nthey had served us edamame as an appetizer beforehand i guess...awesome i love those little perks places like this offer. sometimes its cucumber salad. love.\nshe ended up getting a pink ball of <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> after,but i didn't try it.\nwe will definitely be back, as they have a ladies night and ayce for $21 quite often!", 
            "compared to the sushi buffets in la, ive gotta give oyshi 3 stars. the 2 things that trumps la's sushi buffet is they serve <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> and you get dessert at the end! main reason why it doesnt beat la's sushi buffet: fish isnt as fresh and no sashimi!\n\nwhat i recommend: <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>, tempura, tofu appetizer, mango <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>, green tea tiramisu, eel & avocado hand roll\n\nthe raw fish itself is alright, it's not that fresh...i would rate it 7/10", 
            "ayce sushi! service was great.  sushi was good for ayce standards.\n\nmy picks if you're doing ayce:\n\n<mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> - pretty standard, kind of small\ntempura - so good! \n<mark>Agedashi Tofu</mark> - good flavor, but wasn't the best that i've had.\n<mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> - you only get to choose one dessert, definitely choose this!!\nsunrise roll - nice spicy flavor\n\nwait staff was really good at handling our large party of 16.  kept track of most of the orders and checked on us often.", 
            "this is one of my favorite all you can eat sushi places in vegas! i always have oyshi cravings every time i crave sushi... i love there oyster shooters in the all you can eat. most sushi places don't offer that.  the ambiance is pretty bumpin... they play good house music that keeps you going. the rolls are phenomenal and satisfies my cravings till i'm about till i'm about to fall over. dessert is great i always order the green tea <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> parfait *drools* price is $26 for dinner and lunch is about $21 before 3:30pm...", 
            "went here on a suggestion and wow is all i can say. the sushi was fresh and delicious and the variety is awesome. the fact that it is so close to where i live helps a lot also. the green tea <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> is a perfect way to cap off a great dinner. will definitely be back", 
            "my boyfriend absolutely loves this place. he's not really into ayce sushi places, but he loves this one. me? yup, i thought it was pretty good too. love that they give you small portions, so that you can try more things, and you don't get stuck trying to finish something you don't like. ~$26 per person for ayce dinner. this includes everything on the menu except sashimi. some of our favs were the hawaiian <mark>Ahi Poke</mark>, nigiri, tiger roll, and for dessert, green tea <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>. it's about a 10 minute drive off the strip. great for large parties, but make reservations. we went on a monday night, and though we were able to get seats right away at 5:45pm, the place was pretty busy by the time we left.  we'll definitely be back.", 
            "i get why they have four stars, it's a hip place with electronica music playing in the background, and that seems to be a vegas standard now.  however, i can't say ill be making my way back.\n\nthey have a variety to choose from for ayce, with the whole inside menu strictly rolls.  when i do ayce, i only go for nigiri.  as i've posted before, i'm not really into rolls because its usually covered in sauce, with very little filling.  i guess it's what americans love though... sauce on everything.  i'm guilty as well, just not on my sushi.\n\nanyway, the fish was really poor quality.  after my initial order, i couldn't bring myself to order any more.  i love my fish to taste like fish (if that even makes sense).  the fish here had no taste whatsoever.  all i could taste was the vinegar from the rice.\n\ni thought it was cool they served oysters, but it was pretty blah.  there was no flavor at all.  it tasted like water.  it did not have that \"taste like the sea\" quality.  i don't know.  it just didn't taste like anything.  the <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark> were not very good. overcooked. no flavor.  too chewy.\n\ntofu was ok, but too much sauce, and it was overly sweet.  desserts were boring.  no green tea <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>. creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e was ok.  <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> parfait was ok.\n\nseriously, this place is lacking all types of flavors.\n\ni like the fact that they serve \"fresh\" scallops, other places usually have the baby scallops drenched in yum yum sauce.  \n\nserver was friendly.  \n\ni'd pass on this place and go for goymen, sushi komo, or even kaya.", 
            "for a sushi restaurant in the middle of the desert, they've got some pretty damn fresh fish and a huge all-you-can-eat (ayce) menu.\n\nthough there are appetizers and salads, i always go for the nigiri and the rolls to fill that insatiable need for fish and rice. some of the maki come in hand rolls, while others are baked, deep-fried, full of veggies, spicy, or wrapped in soy paper. you definitely should be able to find at least one item you'll enjoy or you're just flat out doing it wrong.\n\nonce the chopsticks are down and i'm ready to do the slump of defeat, the dessert conveniently reminds you that you can get only one of the green tea tiramisu, <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>, or some of the other selections. except the <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> scoops. you can get as many scoops as your dessert stomach can handle!\n\nservice was pretty good, but could be a bit erratic.  they always came to refill our drinks, to check up on us, or to take additional orders.\n\nit saddens me that the journey to oyshi is so far, but i'm willing to travel the distance for the value and quality that they offer.", 
            "this is one of our go to sushi places because it's close to our house, but also because their ayce sushi is excellent.  the fish is very fresh and flavorful, except the oysters, which i thought were a little bland.  lately we've had to wait about 20 minutes to get seated, so this place is definitely gaining in popularity.  the menu has changed somewhat in the past year and now they have more appetizers and dessert, which is definitely a plus!  however you can only order one of the special desserts but you can have all the <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> you want.  the rolls are solid and the uni has been fresh every time we've visited.", 
            "i found this place perusing yelp sometime back in 2010. ayce lunch $21, dinner $26 which is comparable to similar places. ive come here about 2-3 times a month for the past 2yrs plus. always do ayce. the main thing that got me as a repeat customer is their service(at least in my experiences) is considerably better than most sushi places ive visited. i counted and cant even believe ive tried 12 different ayce sushi spots in vegas to date. im not a big fan of the traditional sushi, more into the creative and many rolls that these places sell. i like to say im more into the 'americanized' type of sushi and have been able to convince friends who dont even eat raw fish to try it with me and most liked it. so you can take what you want from my review based on that. this place does get very busy at dinner with sometimes long waits to be seated so i try to frequent at lunch. service can take longer at times. i typically like to sit at the bar when i sushi. i have experienced faster service that way usually, so now i lean towards sitting at the bar. the ambiance, decor and music targets the more younger demographic.\nsome items i favor are the seared salmon nigiri, cajun albacore nigiri, tiger roll, double screaming orgasm, heart attack, ian special, chung hua, kamikaze & surf n turf roll. at every ayce i go for green tea <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> and hamachi kama(not on ayce here) if its available. they do also have brulees, <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> and parfaits for dessert. all desserts are limited to 1 per cept for <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>. dinner ayce limits are 1 uni, 1 ama ebi and 2 raw oysters which is similar to most ayces. theres a list of appetizers which i will order from ocassionally but i concentrate more on the sushi and green tea <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>. :)\nis it the freshest and highest quality seafood? no. its decent. it does say theres a time limit of, 90min i believe? dont remember exactly atm since its never come into play. ive never been rushed even tho i know i have passed the time limit before, or things like being reminded repeatedly on leftover charges. i realize this may not be everybodys cup of tea but for food and service ive gotten here, i think you definitely get your moneys worth.", 
            "it's true...i have fallen hard for yet another sushi place. ayce, super unique rolls and here's the kicker...a very cool vibe! if you've ever been eating sushi and thought to yourself, this would be so much better with some tiesto playing, this is your spot!\n\nfirst off, don't be discouraged by the wait. they're busy and you should be happy for them. it's usually no more than 15 minutes and you can occupy yourself by practicing new dance moves. we always sit at the sushi bar and the service is friendly and fast. i once saw no less than 6 sushi chefs hustling in that narrow space so you'll be well taken care of. \n\non to the tasty stuff. what i like most about this joint is if you like deep fried, baked, raw, hot, mild, funky they've got you covered. i hate places that are all cooked or all raw, you've gotta people please!  from the freshness of the fish, to the sauces they're paired with it's all a win. their all you can eat knows almost no bounds so if you're not busting at the end you've done something wrong. to top it all off the strawberry <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> they serve is surprisingly top notch, little strawberry swirl through it and everything. \n\nthey also have 2 private rooms for large parties and i know this because i spied on them when i was there like a creeper. try this place out next time you're in the southwest. we were happy to find it on our side of town and not have to venture to sushi blvd aka eastern.", 
            "it's not my absolute favorite sushi or ayce sushi restaurant, but it's good and the location is wonderful. if there's an ayce option at a sushi restaurant, i always order it because the price equals 2-3 specialty rolls. it just doesn't make sense any other way. besides specialty rolls, i like hand rolls (tuna, salmon, yellowtail) and certain appetizers depending on my mood. i wasn't impressed with their hand rolls and although their specialty rolls are good, they're not amazing either (i've had better counterparts at other ayce restaurants). i really like their double screaming roll (without cream cheese) because the special sauce makes it unique. their desserts are really good too. i like that they offer a parfait that features <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>, fresh assorted berries, and granola. very good. on my most recent trip, i found out i could get green tea <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> rather than vanilla and it was even more amazing. the service is good and the food is usually quick. the only thing i really hate is the restaurant's lack of appropriate venting, so you end up leaving the place smelling like the inside of a fryer.", 
            "oyshi is the closest ayce sushi to my house, so i've been here quite a lot. not my favorite place, but it's a solid option. the decor is very modern and trendy. they also play edm music and have sports showing on the flat screens near the bar. all postitives in my eyes. i always sit at the bar, so the service is good. normally i can just order directly from the sushi chef without waiting for a waiter. that really speeds up the ordering process. i can't speak to the service when seated anywhere else in the restaurant.\n\none disappointing thing about oyshi is that it doesn't offer <mark>Seafood Salad</mark> on the ayce menu. that automatically prevents it from a five star review in my eyes. on the bright side, the amount of fish on the nigiri sushi is ample. very high fish to rice ratio. i also like the variety of desserts offered. you're not limited to the usual mochi or <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>. oyshi also offers <mark>Trio Of Creme Brulee</mark> and a <mark>Vanilla- Berry Parfait</mark>. the <mark>Vanilla- Berry Parfait</mark> is my usual and it's a must have.", 
            "we had a table of around 20 people, so the table was split between two waiters. we all got the ayce dinner. our waitress really sucked. it took an hour or so for our rolls and sashimi to come out. we've complained numerous times to her and she kept saying, \"it's coming. the sushi chefs are working on it.\" the other half of the table with the other waiter had all of their rolls and sashimi out already.... we all ordered the same stuff! they were already on round 3 and we were still on round 1!!! wth. \n\nthe uni was not good... looked old and dark. fresh uni is supposed to be light yellow/orange color but this was dark orange/brown. it tasted as if it had been refrigerated for a long time. overall bad service and the food was not good. the only good thing was the <mark>Trio Of Creme Brulee</mark> and <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>.", 
            "this place has easily become my favorite ayce sushi joint after luisa p. invited me to come for her brother's birthday dinner here. i had a bad experience here in 2011 so this was their second chance. boy have they been delivering! we had one of the vip rooms all to ourselves for his birthday because we were part of such a huge party. they did a great job of accommodating our big group and even brought in more tables as well as chairs so that we could all be included.\n\nbe prepared to wait! if you plan on bringing a large group, have someone.. or a few someones come early so that you can put your name on the list. just make sure the majority of your party is there to be seated. i want to say that all 3x i have came (during dinner time), the wait has been about 20 mins - 35 mins.\n\ni love doing ayce because as long as you eat about 3 rolls, you're getting your money's worth. plus, it is fun to share delicious food! make sure you're only sharing with those in your group that are getting ayce or else they will get charged the ayce price as well. they have an extensive rules/information outline on their menu.\n\ni think that the service here is really great for them being busy all of the time. they were always coming back to check up on us and asked if we wanted to put in more orders. our tables were never cluttered because different people would swing by and grab our empty plates, plus everyone was more than helpful when we needed anything.\n\nmy go-to rolls: monster roll: order it, just order it! pink lady roll. spider roll. dragon roll. japanese lasagna roll. i need to try even more of their specialty rolls, i am guilt of sticking to my favorites! for appetizers, order the <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark>, they're amazing here. only a few sushi joints can get it right, trust me.\n\nif you know me, then you know that i love white tuna nigiri/sushi. the first time i had it here, it was amazing. the second time was decent. haha, hopefully it just keeps getting better because i order a lot of those wherever i go for sushi. \n\nfor dessert, order the green tea tiramisu with vanilla <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> on the side. your mouth will thank me, lol.\n\ni will definitely be back!", 
            "say what?! ayce for $26?! yes sir it's worth your whole $26, or if you're going for lunch, it's only $21 but you don't get oysters and who doesn't love oysters?! they have a vast selection of sushi rolls, some of my favorites are the oyshi roll which is a baked roll with dynamite topping, spicy tuna crunch, and the atomic roll. but the one thing that is worth every penny is their super white tuna. have you had super white tuna?! no?! well, get your butt over here and try it! it melts in your mouth like butter, it's the champagne of fish.. yes, ahh thinking about it just makes my mouth drool, they top it off with ponzu sauce and it couldn't get any better than that.\n\ntheir appetizer list is ongoing and you have so many choices, that's what i like about their ayce, you have many options to choose from. the calamari is nice and crispy on the outside and a little chewy when you bite into it. the surf and turf is awesome and they just have new meats to pick from that come in a griddle plate (is that what it's called?) it comes steaming hot and on a bed of cabbage and onions yummmm! they have a good <mark>Ahi Poke</mark> bowl that comes with cucumber slices and <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> underneath, amazing. i could go on, but you really just have to get your butt over there and try it for yourself! oh yeah, did i mention the desserts? oh, i haven't.. well i love their vanilla parfait! they also have creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e, green tea tiramisu, and green tea and vanilla <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>. oh goodness, i'm hungry.", 
            "finally got the chance to sample this southwestern sushi spot.\n\nrestaurant design: very modern. comfortable seats everywhere, very nice lounge with its own tv, huge counters at the bar. one of the largest interiors i've seen. the only weird thing is how low the armchairs in the lounge are. luckily, we didn't have to deal with that since we didn't fill the table.\n\nservice: consistent pacing throughout the night. could be because we were the lounge table, but i'll take that versus sometimes being forgotten.\n\npicks:\n\nnigiri: everything was delicious through and through, even the tuna. the spicy tuna was a bit overwhelming for my sensitive palate. smoked salmon special here is superior to goyemon's special. uni is the best quality other than when i tried kaze's ayce sashimi lunch. there were some issues with seaweed wrappers from different pieces sticking to each other though.\noysters: no real off flavors and haven't gotten sick yet, so that's a win for me\n<mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark>: solid\nfried calamari: fine\nlasagna roll: didn't notice much difference with the inclusion of avocado, and good quality\nparfait: really, really good. fruits and crunchy granola made me really happy. glad i made this my limit-one-dessert-that-isn't-ice-cream-scoops choice.\n\npassable:\n\ndynamite: pretty good, but the sesame threw me off.\nsurf n turf sizzling plate: beef strips and shrimp on a bed of onions and cabbage. not bad, but not great.\nhot sake: average, i suppose. best part was that it was a mon/tues 2-for-1 special.\n\npans:\n\n<mark>Popcorn Scallop</mark>: pretty useless.\namaebi head: brain drained. i feel like they did this as a restaurant-wide strategy to appeal to a more mainstream palate (you can tell by how they let you order yum yum sauce on the side). would've liked all off the flavors to be there.\n<mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>: while the green tea was pretty good, the vanilla was not that impressive and the texture of both had noticeable ice crystals\n\noverall, i enjoyed the meal with a few notable exceptions. it's worth the drive if you want a change from your normal sushi spot. i'd probably come back to explore the rolls since we didn't really plumb the depths of that extensive part of the menu.",

            "love this place! been here over a dozen times. staff is wonderful & attentive. sushi is fresh. great ayce !!!! great atmosphere with private rooms for party's. expect to wait for a table during peak times. i'm not the only person who will go out of my way to eat here. the <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> & the nuclear bomb roll are my favs... num num.", 
            "was craving sushi. unfortunately service last saturday night was just so so. usually we would get very good service; server making suggestions, upbeat, or checking on us. usually we love the service there. unfortunately, our server hardly checked on us. i even had a leaking water glass. it was leaking all over my mat and pants when i drank. we couldn't flag our waiter. he was walking by bar & front. not attending to anything really. not checking on us. saw i think the manager looking at us, but he didn't do anything. i was able to flag another waitress about my glass. she was real nice & apologetic. she replaced my glass & mat. \n\nanyway, we ordered our favorite lobster afair roll & tiger roll. although we thought our lobster tasted more like the love afair roll which had crab instead of lobster. it was okay though. we just ate it. we asked our waiter for a recommendation after finishing our rolls, and wanted a spicier roll and he suggested nuclear bomb roll, which was good. \n\nwe ordered dessert. green tiramisu to go & i wanted green tea <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>. the waiter then suggested the green tea parfait. to me it was just okay. our waiter asked me how it was (when i had a spoonful of <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> in my mouth) & i nodded. anyway, when we left, he or nor anyone said goodbye or thank you. just odd. service was kind of cold that night. a bunch of them were standing around. might start trying different sushi places from now on. i heard goyemon sushi is much better (excellent sushi). just they usually have a 30-60 minute wait time. anyway will try there next time.", 
            "great service and great food. first time at oyshi's tonight! all you can eat <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>! hell yeah", 
            "it's pretty decent, not that i had high expectations for it. it's my first time just now because i had heard bad things about it a long time ago (quality of fish mostly). \n\nthere's nothing special, in my opinion, but my friend wanted to come to try one of their desserts (ikr?). \n\nthey only allow you to pick one dessert item (not including unlimited <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>, though). another friend stated when they came before they didn't have this restriction. well, looks like it was just <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> for me then, which comes only in strawberry, by the way. \n\nthey have some daily specials so check out that list on the way to your table. fish wasn't as shabby as anticipated so that was a plus. i love salmon nigiri but theirs wasn't too good, actually. so i definitely ate less than usual in that department. \n\nin terms of hot tea, they charge you $2.50 for the pot at the table so i'm thankful it wasn't $2.50 per person :). \n\noverall, it's pretty much a just as expected / average place for me. in this area, it's not my to-go place for ayce sushi but hey, this visit just means i won't say no if another friend wants to eat here. :0)", 
            "i go to oyshi on a consistent basis, as i live just down the street. the food is always delicious and fresh, although i feel the ayce is a tad overpriced for dinner as there are some odd restrictions (only one dessert per customer except for <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>, etc.). the service is hit or miss; it's either excellent and quick, or exhaustingly slow. \n\ni usually do ayce, but order mostly appetizers. the gyoza are fresh, crispy and delicious. the <mark>Asian Style Skirt Steak</mark> is wonderful. the chicken yakitori is also on my favorites list. as far as sushi rolls are concerned, i've always ordered the crunch shrimp tempura roll. no complaints about the food, except for the cut pieces are sometimes too big to eat one piece at once.", 
            "the hostess is rude and the service over all is extremely poor. it took over 1 1/2 to eat lunch. they did not have the lunch specials available nor did they have <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>. the customers next to us order gyozas and so did i. they sat down after us but still received their food before us. also, we order their <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> parfait and it took at least 15+ minutes to receive it. i would not recommend eating here!", 
            "we went here for dinner last night. 4 adults and 2 kids, the service was good. \n\nfor the value of what you pay, i think it was really good. we all got to try many things on the all you can eat. everything was good. we ordered salmon and tuna sashimi off the regular menu also and it tasted fresh and really delicious. \n\nwe got dessert too, our two friends ordered the green tea tiramisu and green tea creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e, they both liked it, i got the <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> which was also good. \n\nwe would recommend it and would go again, i'm not sure why the bad reviews from others.", 
            "my experience at oyshi was pleasant. i thought the staff was courteous and got all of our orders right. \n\nwe had all you can eat and i enjoyed pretty much everything i ate. we ate ayce so we had to pace ourselves or else you will get charged for wasted food.  i would start with the salad and calamari (2 dipping sauces) some things that i really enjoyed were the surf and turf (good steak and grilled shrimp) dynamite roll and monster roll. for dessert i always enjoy a classic creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e. the <mark>Vanilla- Berry Parfait</mark> was a berry <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> sundae and that was nice too. only thing i was ehhh about for dessert was the green tea tiramisu cause it tasted like a heavier creamed cake with a very buttery taste. \n\noverall i thought it was a nice location with nice atmosphere. service was fine and good was good. would i say that is the best sushi place in town? not quite but i am not disappointed and i would come back again.", 
            "would have given a 5 star but the service was a bit lacking. however, the food made up for it. went to lunch there with our staff and the menu was wonderful. i ordered the lunch special sizzling plate with <mark>Chicken Teriyaki</mark> and it came with <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark>, salad, tempura shrimp and vegetables, and california roll with the entr\\u00e9e. it was a boat load of food for $10. i had to take a portion home. btw: the green tea <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> is also a screaming deal for two scoops $2.50. great food but i should caution you to go early for lunch because you will wait for a good fair amount of time. i will definitely be back to give the service another chance.", 
            "after years of going to crowded sushi bars with minimal arm room between me and others, i found a location with comfort as well as a great selection of sushi creations. the restaurant is an upscale environment with room for large parties. \n\n - the restaurant offers a huge menu of both sushi and hot kitchen items (e.g., sushi, koma, hamachi, sizzling hot plates of steak and seafood, tempura, oysters, soups/salads, and desserts). \n\n-  there is usually a wait to be seated. the wait is sometimes as long as an hour during peek dinner times. you can drop in to be put on the list, and they will text you when they are ready to seat you. they take reservations. \n\n- they offer an all you can eat sushi menu for about $25 that includes one desert (e.g., green tea <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>, creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e, moche <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>).\n\n- my favorites are the yellowtail koma, double salmon roll, surf and turf sizzling hot plate, spicy tuna hand roll, fresh sashimi red snapper and halibut, red rock sushi roll, and the vanilla creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e with green tea ice-cream. \n\ni've been to this location over a dozen times in just the last four months - my most frequent visit being last week for lunch. i generally ask for my favorite sushi chef and server, and i am willing to wait for them. vincent is the best server!  this restaurant generally wants the server to tell the sushi chef your order even as you sit at the bar. at first i wasn't fond of this process, but it works well and there isn't a lag in service. the sushi chef still hands you your order -it just prevents you from yelling out at a busy chef. vincent offers exceptional service that includes getting your beverages, kitchen items, and sushi bar order. he is exceptional. \n\nthe sushi chefs are all awesome, but my favorite is ivan. when the restaurant isn't too busy, he will inquiry if you want anything. if you request, he will also make creations for you based on what he notices you like. he is efficient, creative, and humorous.", 
            "sunday night here is pretty packed but people here are very accommodating and friendly. their ayce is the bomb!! so my mom and i ordered their monster, (a little sweet for me), lobster fair (omg this is one is freaking good!), japanese garlic lasagna, and many more! however, their salmon lover was a little bit so so for us cause the salmon wasn't fresh at all, they used frozen ones. for appetizers, their <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>, <mark>Ahi Poke</mark>, <mark>Baked Green Mussel</mark> were pretty good. and of course, for dessert, i got some green tea <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> and their tiramisu too! so yummy! we're definitely looking forward to eat here again besides we just live near here!", 
            "well i have raved about this place before but today i was sooooo disappointed  the food as always was great so keep it up chefs but as for the waitress we had well that's heads a totally different direction...\n\nthe place is always made by the environment around and today we definitely did not feel welcomed \n\nthe hostess is greeted us and showed us to the table with a smile but that is where the courtesy ended...\n\nwe waited 15min to get asked for drinks, another 15 to order then even thought we were doing ayce we waited 35 min to be able to add to our order at this point we felt ignored considering there were only 6 other tables occupied around us. we decided to cut it short and just go straight to dessert, we figured some <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> could make us feel better, but upon ordering our desserts my hubby was given a creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e when he told our waitress he wanted the <mark>Vanilla- Berry Parfait</mark>, it would have been fine had she just apologized when we brought it up to her but she says i pointed to the br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e, ??? well being that he ordered his own dessert we just looked away...at this point upset and confused we just paid our bill and left.... sorry but no matter how great your food taste a staff with bad attitudes definitely brings your score down...\n\nsorry to say we won't be visiting this location anymore... our best advice, perhaps order to go if you wanna try them out!"

            "i'm not from vegas but today marks my 3rd time coming here and i look forward to making it a tradition each time i'm in town. this place is awesome. it's a bit of a drive off the strip, about 10 minutes but well worth it.\nit has a nice ambiance perfect for a date or a night out with the girls. there were quite a bit of families there also. 26 dollars ! all you can eat. i've been to many ayce sushi places and they always give you fewer choices and just the basic appetizers and maybe a green tea <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> for dessert. not this place. they have a huge selection of rolls. they are so delicious. ummm. they have so many appetizers to choose from. if your a meat eater you will appreciate it because they offer a lot of meat dishes. last but not least if you have room the dessert is heavenly. they have <mark>Trio Of Creme Brulee</mark>, green tea tiramisu, <mark>Vanilla- Berry Parfait</mark> and one other that i cannot recall. \nall this for 26 bucks. it's unbelievable that you can get all this and still have great quality. the only negative thing i can say about this place is that on friday and saturday nights it gets busy so you may have to wait a while for them to come back and get your 2nd orders. this still doesn't deter me from giving them 5 stars because the servers are really helpful and cordial when they do come back.",

            "for $21 (lunch) or $26 (dinner) you can indulge in all you can eat sushi and sides. the difference between lunch and dinner is that lunch excludes oysters and something else they list on the front of the menu. aside from that, you can indulge in any roll or hot item. sashimi's off limits. \n\nkeep in mind that the rolls, regular priced, run for about $13 each so you might as well pay the $26 the ayce option and sample as much as you feel like... unless you're one of those freaks that can eat one roll and be satisfied... \n\nthe catch to the rolls was as i suspected- tons of rice. one roll was so loaded that i felt my body refusing to chew any more of it. the sushi was another story- the amount of rice was fair. oh, and sidenote, you're charged regular price for anything you remove or fail to consume the rice from. \n\nit seems that the best way to fill up without tapping out too early is to focus on the hot items and sushi- fill up on surf and turf, calamari, and <mark>Ahi Poke</mark> salad and pick maybe one or two rolls that sound too good to deny yourself of them. or, you could be me and go roll crazy and have to fight yourself to chew. \n\nthere are very tempting dessert options, of which you're limited to one (sad!) bring friends and share all four. the mochi (mango or raspberry) was tiny, but i can imagine it was a refreshing treat. i had the <mark>Trio Of Creme Brulee</mark> and my friend had the green tiramisu. both were absolutely wonderful. the green tiramisu was a first for me and it was so exciting to eat. creamy, yet subtle, yet sweet. \n\nthe only qualm i have with my experience was that we were there on a day when the sushi kitchen was hopelessly backed up. all of our hot food came out quickly, but the sushi took what felt like forever to appear. it became an issue for friends who didn't order hot food and waited well over an hour to eat anything. \n\nluckily the two-hour ordering limit was not applied to us or else this would be a fishy deal!",

            "oyshi is the closest ayce sushi to my house, so i've been here quite a lot. not my favorite place, but it's a solid option. the decor is very modern and trendy. they also play edm music and have sports showing on the flat screens near the bar. all postitives in my eyes. i always sit at the bar, so the service is good. normally i can just order directly from the sushi chef without waiting for a waiter. that really speeds up the ordering process. i can't speak to the service when seated anywhere else in the restaurant.\n\none disappointing thing about oyshi is that it doesn't offer <mark>Seafood Salad</mark> on the ayce menu. that automatically prevents it from a five star review in my eyes. on the bright side, the amount of fish on the nigiri sushi is ample. very high fish to rice ratio. i also like the variety of desserts offered. you're not limited to the usual mochi or <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>. oyshi also offers <mark>Trio Of Creme Brulee</mark> and a <mark>Vanilla- Berry Parfait</mark>. the <mark>Vanilla- Berry Parfait</mark> is my usual and it's a must have.", 
            "we had a table of around 20 people, so the table was split between two waiters. we all got the ayce dinner. our waitress really sucked. it took an hour or so for our rolls and sashimi to come out. we've complained numerous times to her and she kept saying, \"it's coming. the sushi chefs are working on it.\" the other half of the table with the other waiter had all of their rolls and sashimi out already.... we all ordered the same stuff! they were already on round 3 and we were still on round 1!!! wth. \n\nthe uni was not good... looked old and dark. fresh uni is supposed to be light yellow/orange color but this was dark orange/brown. it tasted as if it had been refrigerated for a long time. overall bad service and the food was not good. the only good thing was the <mark>Trio Of Creme Brulee</mark> and <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>.", 
            "$21 all you can eat sushi for lunch/$26 for dinner. \n\ni love how their specialty rolls are included...and the rolls are made fresh (compared to most sushi buffets).  my favorite rolls were the love affair roll and the monster roll.\ndon't forget to get a dessert too! their <mark>Trio Of Creme Brulee</mark> is delicious! :)", 
            "come here for their green tea <mark>Trio Of Creme Brulee</mark>. that is all. no i'm only joking.\n\nin a city where ayce sushi is plenty of oyshi does ok. it's in my rotation for when i'm craving ayce sushi but not in my top favorites i do prefer others a lot more. it's all you can eat sushi and you can really eat all you can eat that's at least until they cut you off. it's your typical ayce sushi, they all are sushi grade and they make your typical sushi dishes everyone is doing. not many items wowing me but still many items satisfying.\n\nthe bad about oyshi is their spicy tuna, imitation crab usage, and kind of little nigiri and sushi rolls which is fine if you did ayce cause you can just order more but not cool if you weren't. they have a lot of items you want to order but aren't available with ayce. they seem to have a lot of rules.\n\nthe good about oyshi is just about everything else. it's a place to go people watch late nights. did i already mention their green tea cr\\u00e8me brulee. i've been there just for it without ordering anything else and when i do ayce, i'll make sure there's always room for it at the end. they serve some of their entrees on a sizzling hotplate, i do like the steaks and chicken. \n\nthey have a lunch special which includes a soup, salad, and your item of choice from various plates, there's a sushi plate, tempera plate, sashimi plate, and sizzle plate. it's not bad if your not wanting ayce during lunch.\n\nthey offer all my favorites that i must have. they have oysters and uni but they're limited. they have shrimp tempera. they have poke, which like everyone else stretched out with other items. they have a good variety of specialty, tempera, baked, and fried rolls.\n\ndon't mine the clubbing music that's usually playing, even during lunch.", 
            "variety versus service - this is my headliner for this place.\n\nthe menu is excellent, and by that i mean i have many choices, in fact too many that on my second visit here, i think i have only tried an eight of their items. quality and freshness of their seafood are outstanding, and i've had them on roll, sushi, and sashimi.\n\nthe stand-outs are: <mark>Japanese <mark>Clam Miso Soup</mark></mark>, <mark>Ahi Poke</mark>, shrimp tempura, calamari, surf and turf, eel and avocado, <mark>Trio Of Creme Brulee</mark>.... food is four stars hands down.\n\nnow, the service is not the most accommodating, i'm afraid to say. some cons on my last visit: our waiter forgot our three orders of calamari and had to be reminded, as we waited for a good twenty minutes, grave sin on customer service definitely. for the pros, we were greeted and seated very quickly and our drinks were refilled readily and i appreciated the fact that our waiter apologized for making us wait on our calamaris. in the end, i would give them three stars and believe that they could do better by following up with an order.", 
            "i used to hate this place!  many visits a couple years ago...all with slow service, room temperature nigiri, etc.  this was actually one of the only places that i told people not to go to for sushi....and never understood why others liked it so much.\n\na very reluctant lunch stop proved to be a much better experience this time around!\n\na few highlights :\n\nsea scallops were awesome! super fresh, buttery texture...melt in your mouth! \n\nsake was very fresh today! beautiful cuts of salmon....the sake in yuzu was very good as well, and not overpowering like yuzu can be sometimes.\n\nthe ika with mint. i really enjoyed this combination...and it was noticeably less chewy than most. \n\nahi. fresh, but another odd cut...the darker area was a bit tougher...should have been removed by the chef.  pic : http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/oyshi-sushi-las-vegas?select=unvcwliuog_lmr-zkuakwq#unvcwliuog_lmr-zkuakwq\n\nunagi. nice crispy edges...good flavor! \n\n<mark>Ahi Poke</mark>. tuna was fresh, and the <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> was good too!\n\nsunomono. i liked their version here...thin cuts versus the larger circular cuts most use. the ginger sauce was good too.\n\ngreen tea <mark>Trio Of Creme Brulee</mark>. delicious! lots of tea flavor here \n\nservice was fairly quick, considering their tables were mostly full.\n\ni would come back again now if i was already on this side of town :p", 
            "oyshi is my go to ayce, they are always consistent with quality, taste and service.  i always get monster roll, tiger roll, nyi roll, sibuya, love affair, surf&turf app, <mark>Grilled Beef Asparagus</mark> app, gyoza, uni, ikura, unagi, and usually try some specials, the green tea <mark>Trio Of Creme Brulee</mark> and tiramisu are very good, and i'm not usually a dessert person.  these guys are always on point! i love oyshi sushi!", 
            "for years i patronized an ayce sushi place called pumi at sahara/ft apache, they closed.  \n\nthen the search was on...i used yelp to find a place called hikari and patronized them for years. well, after several changes with management/ownership/service as well as the changes in fish quality/preparation/selection, i thought too many changes and i think consistency is important when indulging in raw fish, so what did i do?  i once again looked at yelp reviews to offer me additional ayce sushi selections and i found...oyshi.\n\noyshi is my new go to place for ayce sushi. the pricing is about the same as many of the others, around $28 per person. \n\nat 6'3 and 250 lb i like my elbow space, especially on airplanes and sushi bars. oyshi offers a wide and long sushi bar, that i could have a sumo wrestler feasting on each side of me and still eat comfortably. \n\nthere is a beautiful wall mural that i enjoy looking at when i dine from across the restaurant. it is of a geisha girl with bonzai trees and just a pretty colorful picture that adds a nice japanese type theme stretching across an entire wall. the music is american hip hop/top 40ish. they do accept reservations, however i'm not sure if it helps as there is always a long wait, like 45 minutes to 1.5 hours on a fri/sat night. they will take your phone number and call you if you are getting close to your table and do not want to stick around the entire wait. we left and went up to best buy and  daydreamed of the new $9,000 dollar uhd 78 inch television and came back in time for our dinner.\n\nthe server will come around and take your order for the sushi bar, despite being sat at the sushi bar. i find this odd considering the chef is right in front of us, but that's the way it is. perhaps because the chefs are always busy and rarely a moment to relax, joke around and drink sake with patrons, as common in other sushi bars.\n\nthere is a very talented and friendly sushi chef named ivan who wears a chicago white sox baseball cap. he has a sushi entree of his own called ivan's creation.  try it, you'll like it!\n\nour favorite server so far is vincent, not vinny, originally vincenzo. he knows the menu well and offers excellent recommendations based on his solid listening skills and good questions of what we like, dislike, etc.\n\nthe bathrooms are clean. they have many tables to dine at, in addition to the sushi bar and they also have a vip room that conceals a loud obnoxious 15+ patrons.\n\nthe ayce menu is three pages and filled with plenty to choose from whether raw or cooked. they are often out of oysters and do not offer sashimi as part of ayce, however they do offer plenty that other ayce places do not.  \n\ndozens of creative rolls to choose from that are delicious. many hot dishes to choose from including meat on skewers called yakitori. also cooked meats on a platter of cabbage or onions included choices of surf n turf, rib eye steak, <mark>Asian Style Skirt Steak</mark> and a cooked pork dish. an entire page on tempura dishes. dessert is included, she chose the <mark>Trio Of Creme Brulee</mark> and said it was delicious. my dessert included eel, quail eggs and octopus.\n\nif you've tried other nearby ayce sushi places such as hikari or goyemon, you will most likely enjoy oyshi and after dining here, you will say what we say...\"it was excellent, we will be back!\"", 
            "this is one of the best ayce sushi joints out there. their fish is fresh and the portions are right. the sushi is big enough for you to actually taste it, but at a size where you don't get full quickly. my staples at any ayce sushi joints are eel and avocado handrolls and nigiri. i'm not a big fan of rolls and this place does it for me. they also have additional appetizers that you won't find at typical sushi restaurants. i really like their <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark>, which is quite the generous portion. <mark>Seaweed Salad</mark> is expensive and this place does not skimp out. the albacore is especially good at this restaurant. they have these sizzling plates which comes out on fajita wooden plates. i have tried the surf and turf which is really delicious. i would recommend getting one to share with a few friends. the appetizer portions are small, but they do fill you up. try sharing the appetizers so you can save room for the real stuff. with this said, the best part truly is the dessert. this place by far has the best tasting <mark>Trio Of Creme Brulee</mark> i have ever had. the only bad thing is that dessert is not all you can eat, it's only one per person. make sure you leave room for dessert because you do not want to miss out. i have been here twice and will definitely come back the next time i'm in town. the service has been great during both of my visits. the food is usually out at the right time and you never have to wait too long for your orders. the waiters are also really sweet. i highly recommend this place!!", 
            "been here couple times when visiting vegas. $22 lunch special for all you can eat sushi?! worth it. market price on sushi can add up so this all you can eat deal is the best deal you can get so i would suggest not getting ala carte if you're a big eater on sushi. two rolls will already set you above the all you can eat price so you might as well get the ayce deal! i've tried several of their signature rolls such as oh my heart, pink lady roll, dynamite roll and rock & roll. all good! be sure you don't order with you eyes because there's a policy that you have to eat everything. always best when shared with others, don't all order the same thing. try a little bit of everything. i always make my money's worth it with orders of shrimp tempura. it's a must whenever i come here. you also get a free dessert with your meal as well. i love the <mark>Trio Of Creme Brulee</mark>, soooo delish! i always leave here with a feeling like a i gained 10 pounds."

            "i would've given this place 5 stars, had i reviewed it the first time i ate there. i don't quite remember what i had the first time coming into this restaurant, but i do remember having their blue<mark>Vanilla- Berry Parfait</mark>, and that alone deserved 5 stars! my second visit to oyshi was for dinner, and i ordered the <mark>Ahi Poke</mark> salad, the love affair sushi roll, and a parfait of course! the salad and the sushi roll were excellent, the best part was probably the love affair sushi roll.. probably the best roll i had in a while, from what i remember, it had lobster and crab meat, it was awesome! so here it goes, if so excellent, why the 4 stars you ask.. \n\nwell.. the parfait. it was so much bigger and tastier the first time around.. from what i recall, it was served in a taller glass the last time, more <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> and more toppings.. this time, it was skimped down to a smaller glass, and yes, smaller glass means smaller parfait. it also lacked the toppings i once remembered it had. therefore, i conclude this review by saying oyshi is an awesome restaurant, but they need to overcome this economic slump by serving more not less! =)", 
            "yeah, the husband and i are sushi snobs - at least we're upfront about it.  but when you're living in vegas, the only way to go is to do ayce, right?  after getting tons of recommendations for this place, we finally got around to seeing what the hype is all about.\n\nall-you-can-eat dinner is $26/pp.  it was pretty busy on a sunday night with a steady stream of customers (and large groups) coming in all night long.\n\nlike ned m. mentioned, the sushi rice is only okay...it could be better.  perhaps that's what put us off already...we had to eat the rice and we weren't digging it.\n\nwe ordered lots of nigiri and found the fish to be okay too, some of it was mushy though.  as one friend mentioned, she wished the fish was a bit 'colder'.  maybe we came on a bad night - but everyone is raving about the fish.  i'm also not too fond of 'sauce' added to my nigiri, and they added 'sauce' to a lot of my nigiri choices.  \n\nthey do offer a wider selection of side items like <mark>Asian Style Skirt Steak</mark>, <mark>Rib Eye Steak Teriyaki</mark>, etc.  and for this reason, one friend prefers coming here over other ayce places.  i do like their version of agadashi tofu though.\n\nlimitations on their menu include:\n* one order of uni and amaebi per person\n* limit one order of oysters on the half shell (4 pieces) per person\n* limit one order on desserts <mark>Trio Of Creme Brulee</mark>, <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark>, <mark>Vanilla- Berry Parfait</mark> or green tea tiramisu (regular <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> is ayce though - plum, green tea, vanilla, and coffee)\n\nsitting at the sushi bar, service was pretty good.  the manager seemed like he was our main waiter and he was quite attentive.  we thought we were supposed to order our sushi from the sushi chef, but he asked the manager to take our sushi order instead.  he continued to take our orders throughout the night and refilled our beverages too.  there was a gap at one point where our tempura order was forgotten, had to be reordered again, and then had to be followed up on again before we got it.\n\ni can see why this place is popular - there's definitely a mixed crowd and separate rooms for private parties.  the staff are busy and attentive and they definitely recognize the regulars.  they have a lot of rolls to choose from, something that we usually avoid.  overall, we found oyshi sushi to be an average place for ayce sushi.", 
            "i'm not from vegas but today marks my 3rd time coming here and i look forward to making it a tradition each time i'm in town. this place is awesome. it's a bit of a drive off the strip, about 10 minutes but well worth it.\nit has a nice ambiance perfect for a date or a night out with the girls. there were quite a bit of families there also. 26 dollars ! all you can eat. i've been to many ayce sushi places and they always give you fewer choices and just the basic appetizers and maybe a green tea <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> for dessert. not this place. they have a huge selection of rolls. they are so delicious. ummm. they have so many appetizers to choose from. if your a meat eater you will appreciate it because they offer a lot of meat dishes. last but not least if you have room the dessert is heavenly. they have <mark>Trio Of Creme Brulee</mark>, green tea tiramisu, <mark>Vanilla- Berry Parfait</mark> and one other that i cannot recall. \nall this for 26 bucks. it's unbelievable that you can get all this and still have great quality. the only negative thing i can say about this place is that on friday and saturday nights it gets busy so you may have to wait a while for them to come back and get your 2nd orders. this still doesn't deter me from giving them 5 stars because the servers are really helpful and cordial when they do come back.", 
            "dawn c. and i decided to try a new place today for our sushi lunch, and decided on oyshi based on the yelp reviews and the fact that it was close enough to my work for me to get there eat and get back in around an hour. \n\noh, am i ever glad we decided to try a new place today! oyshi is great, $21 ayce lunch with a huge selection to choose from. we sat at the bar and had almost impeccable service. we did to request plates (they did not bring them out with the wasabi) but everyone that helped us was so pleasant and upbeat, and our drinks were refilled without us ever having to flag someone down. our check was also brought out before we requested it, which i always appreciate when i am on my lunch break. \n\nwe started out with some edamame, which is serves warm with a sprinkling of salt. we also tried the beef wrapped asparagus because a reviewer recommended it. it was ok, but i was there to eat fish not beef... so it was on to the rolls. we tried the red rock, a new roll called the sexy something-or-other, baked philadelphia roll and the japanese lasagna. all were very tasty. some people may be turned off by the amount of sauce put on the rolls but i personally liked it. rolls that come with sauces on top say so on the menu so if that's not your style, just ask the sushi chef to leave it off! \n\nfor desert we had the green tea tiramisu and the <mark>Vanilla- Berry Parfait</mark>. the blueberries on the parfait were still crunchy from being frozen, and the tiramisu wasn't really as good as i had hoped. but i was so stuffed from the sushi it's probably better for my figure that the deserts weren't to die for! \n\ni will certainly be revisiting oyshi on another lunch break in the near future.",

            "i think that oyshi is one of the best ayce sushi restaurants in las vegas.  it is a bit of a far drive from the strip and from where i live, but it's worth it.  the ayce prices are $21 for lunch and $26 for dinner.  the ayce not only includes various sushi rolls, but also includes various items such as steaks, mussels, sweet shrimp, some nagiri choices, and dessert.\n \nmy top picks for ayce:\n-<mark>Ahi Poke</mark>\n-kamikaze roll\n-tiger roll\n-rainbow roll\n-rib eye steak (comes out sizzling on a hot plate about 6-8 oz)\n-mussels (2 comes in every order)\n-vanilla <mark>Vanilla- Berry Parfait</mark>\n \noyshi also has a normal non-sushi menu such as teriyaki chicken, <mark>Egg Roll</mark>, and a beef bowl, if you ever have any non-sushi diners in your group.  the service there is decent, some servers are friendly some are not.  i've never had a problem with trying to get a table here.  my only qualms with oyshi is that they tend to play rave/techno music there that does not match the ambiance.  and they also automatically add gratuity or parties of 6 or more, when it is usually customary to add gratuity for parties of 8-9 or more.",

            "well i have raved about this place before but today i was sooooo disappointed  the food as always was great so keep it up chefs but as for the waitress we had well that's heads a totally different direction...\n\nthe place is always made by the environment around and today we definitely did not feel welcomed \n\nthe hostess is greeted us and showed us to the table with a smile but that is where the courtesy ended...\n\nwe waited 15min to get asked for drinks, another 15 to order then even thought we were doing ayce we waited 35 min to be able to add to our order at this point we felt ignored considering there were only 6 other tables occupied around us. we decided to cut it short and just go straight to dessert, we figured some <mark>Mochi <mark>Ice Cream</mark></mark> could make us feel better, but upon ordering our desserts my hubby was given a creme br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e when he told our waitress he wanted the <mark>Vanilla- Berry Parfait</mark>, it would have been fine had she just apologized when we brought it up to her but she says i pointed to the br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e, ??? well being that he ordered his own dessert we just looked away...at this point upset and confused we just paid our bill and left.... sorry but no matter how great your food taste a staff with bad attitudes definitely brings your score down...\n\nsorry to say we won't be visiting this location anymore... our best advice, perhaps order to go if you wanna try them out!", 
            "this is my all time favorite all you can eat sushi place in las vegas. i've been coming here since right after i moved here when they were pretty new, in early 2008. i am pretty much obsessed with some of their rolls, my favorites are full moon, lava flow, nyi, red rock, and treasure, but i honestly haven't tried anything i don't like. the nigiri it's always delicious, and i also definitely recommend the vanilla <mark>Vanilla- Berry Parfait</mark> for dessert. i am disappointed that they stopped carrying \"white tuna\" aka escolar, but that seems to be city-wide. the private rooms are great for larger groups, i'd suggest making a reservation ahead of time for those. they have plenty of beer, wine, and sake, and the best part is that oyshi is open until 3am! best ayce sushi in vegas!"
