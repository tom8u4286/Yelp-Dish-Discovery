            "this modern upscale breakfast joint really knows how to tantalize my taste buds. started with a tangerine mimosa to drink, which was highly recommended on yelp. thumbs up! freshly sqeezed juice is always a plus for me. i enjoyed the tangy sweetness and i'll admit it one got me a little tipsy. \n\nthe bf and i wanted to split two plates, so our adventure began. i had to try the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> house hash, eggs, and sausage. they didn't have canadian bacon, what a bummer. \n\nthen the second order was <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark>. <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> included brown sugar banana flapjack, eggs, <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. the waitress ky told me it was the #1 seller. you get to choose your flapjack flavor out of: traditional buttermilk, blueberry pecan, blackberry granola, snickers, butterscotch almond, apple cinnamon, mango coconut, and strawberry frosted flake. \n\nthe food comes out quick, the place was busy for a monday afternoon. i really like the set up, service was amazing, and the food is killer even warmed up in the microwave later on. portions are huge! so you might wanna split an order or have breakfast the next day like i'll be having. that's when you know you have found a jem.", 
            "what a pleasant surprise!\n\ni didn't know what hash house was or anything like that, but i was so glad i got to go here! not only do they offer hashes, but there's a load of other stuff on the menu here too that i wish i would have been able to sample. but what i did end up tasting was the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>... that was pretty tasty, although i think the waffle would have been better if it was chopped up instead of just put in whole (of all the things i could think was weird, i thought that was weird). i had the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> house hash with rosemary, garlic, onions, and asparagus. this was all very good along with a fried green tea (i still don't know why it's \"fried\"), due to my previous night of drinking. \n\nwhich leads me to my next statement: if there's a hangover cure, it's at hash house.", 
            "i have mixed feelings about this place. on one side - nice interior, friendly staff.\non the other side... it was the first and the last time i went here by myself. i ordered breakfast <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> has and it was giant... enough for 2 (hungry) people. this place probably produces more food waste than a casino buffet :)", 
            "had the pistachio mocha to drink. it was great! i loved the hint of pistachio with the delicious coffee. the restaurant is pretty big, good for parties of around 5, but i'm sure they can accommodate larger parties.\n\ntheir portions are humongous! i had the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark>, garlic, onions, asparagus and rosemary hash. it was delicious although the chicken and biscuit was a bit dry. had to get some water to help it down. i can't believe i finished most of this entr\\u00e9e. boyfriend had <mark>Fresh Mushroom</mark>, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato and fresh spinach hash. this one was pretty good, but i'm not a big fan of artichokes. it was definitely flavorful! next time we will share a hash.\n\nthe service was okay. waters weren't filled as frequently as we would like. don't they understand we've been walking around in 110 degree weather!? it also took a while for us to get our waiter for the check and to give him the check after. hopefully this won't be a problem when we come back next time!", 
            "yup, like most people who reviewed this place, we also came here because of man vs. food.  we enjoyed this place so much, we came 2 mornings in a row last week.\n\nmorning 1 - got here a little before 8am. didnt have to wait, got seated right away.  our waitress was cindy, super pleasant and nice.  i ordered one of the house favorite scrambles with <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark>, corn, roasted peppers, and mozzarella cheese. it also came with a biscuit, fruit (which was melon and pineapple), and your choice of griddled <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> or crispy potatoes (i got the griddled <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>).  my wife ordered <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> with 2 eggs, bacon (extra crispy), and the vanilla waffle.  we both enjoyed our meals and really wanted to try other dishes which is why we came back for.....\n\n....morning 2 - got here a little later today. around 830.  and boy what a difference that made. it was a lot more crowded and we had to wait 10 minutes to get seated.  altho nothing compared to the hours that some other yelpers had to wait!  today i ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles.  this thing was huge.  my wife ordered 2 breakfasts today because she could not make up her mind and it was our last day in vegas so we were not gonna be back here for a while.  she got the farm scramble with <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, avocado, and onions (it came with swiss cheese but she ordered it without).  and she also ordered the granola waffle.  that did not stop her from eating part of my breakfast.  she was gonna order the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> but since she saw my breakfast came with it, she decided to do the granola waffle and just help herself to my <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>.  fed wife = happy wife.\n\neverything we had at hashouse was good. the portions were huge tho so you gotta come hungry.  we ended up taking home part of her granola waffle which she did eat later on in the day.  yes, according to her, it still tastes good hours later.", 
            "very delicious food...if you get a chance try the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> benedict.  its not always on the menu according to the staff.  good stuff.", 
            "came for breakfast and had to wait about 20 minutes for a table. it was definitely busy, with long lines of people waiting. i had the brown sugar banana pancakes, which were quite good. my companion had the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> hash- it was huge! but it was also very dry. the portions were gigantic, but the food could have been better.\n\nthe service was quick and efficient despite the crowds. the decor was a little lacking, and it was kind of loud inside. you could also smell some of the smoke that had drifted up from the casino.", 
            "the first stop that we made was a pretty well know spot away from the strip. hash house a go go was amazing. the eatery is well known for their over sized food, and breakfast hash. we decided to order the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> hash. like all of the other hashes it is tossed with crispy potatoes and topped with 2 eggs and is accompanied with 1 huge biscuit, but this hash has <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> breast meat, garlic, onions asparagus and rosemary. it tasted so fresh and the chicken was moist and full of flavor. the biscuit was no afterthought either. each table had what i think was a fresh strawberry rhubarb preserve to top your biscuit with.\n\nfinally, we also ordered the over sized brown sugar banana flap jacks. these cakes were crunchy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside. i wish i had a picture but we were so hungry, it was too late, all the more reason for you to go see it for yourself.", 
            "i went to vegas over memorial day weekend. one of my friends mentioned he saw hash house a go go on man vs. food and wanted to check it out. little did we know the entire city of vegas had the same idea. we went on sunday at noon. there was an hour wait for a table of five. i was fine with the wait since that probably meant the place was good. \n\nwe put our names on the list and went next door to vamp'd for a drink while we waited. i recommend doing this if the wait is more than an hour. vamp'd is a rocker bar. lots of rock memorabilia on the walls, guitars, chopper behind the bar, and a coffin telephone booth (kind of cool, but creepy when you get in it). very cool place to check out. and it made our wait go by fast. hash house tells you their pagers sometimes don't work next door, but we didn't have a problem. our table was ready, but they wouldn't seat us without our entire party. two of us stayed at vamp'd to pay our bill, which took 5 minutes. good thing it didn't take longer because they were ready to give up our table.  just be ready when your pager goes off!!! \n\nwe sat down and it took a few minutes for our waiter to come over. once he did, he was very helpful. i thought the ambiance was great. everything that passed our table looked delicious! it was a tough decision on what to get. i ordered the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark>, garlic, onions, asparagus and rosemary house hash. our food took about a half hour. when my food came out barely warm, slightly cold i was a little disappointed. the manager on duty came over and gladly had the cook make me a new dish. mine was good, the chicken was a little dry. could have used some sauce. there is a lot of food for one person to eat. i highly recommend sharing a meal if your not a big eater. or get a to-go box and give it to a bum. \n\ni would definitely go back. i think they have a lot of creative dishes. i will order something different next time. everyone else liked their meal.\n\npros: atmosphere, food selection, their mango margarita, friendly wait staff\n\ncons: the wait (even though it is worth it)", 
            "this is my second time coming to hash house a gogo for brunch, and let me tell you, it did not disappoint.  \n\nfirst off, the pricing:  while none of the food items would be considered cheap, the pricing is slightly less than what you would pay on the strip.  \n\nsecond of all, portions:  portions here are meant to probably meant to be served towards farm hands who have just had a full days work of lifting  100's of lbs of hay with no break for meals.  they are gigantic.  trust me, you will most likely not finish your meal here.\n\nquality:  everything we've had here is top notch.  i'm hesitant to say that about any restaurant, however the food is excellent.  the drinks are creative and tasty.  it's hard to go wrong with this place.  that being said, here's what i've tasted thus far:\n\nmango coconut pancake:  this is bigger than your head.  heck, it's bigger than the plate.  i think it was about the size of my wrist to my elbow... and with soft sweet mangos (must be quality canned mangos, since consistency and flavor were perfect) and shredded coconut throughout.  the thing about their pancakes is, it's made so well that you're pretty much eating cake for breakfast.  soft, moist, and tender pancake.  \n\n<mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> hash:  not sure how they made these potatoes, but they are perfectly crisp and flavorful.  the chicken is roasted well, with a few dry pieces (roasting a whole bird perfectly tender all the way through is near impossible, mind you), but a good dish overall.  this may be the one dish that doesn't stand out from the rest.  i was surprised, however, to see my wife downing the scrambled eggs since she hates eggs... and she loved the way these scrambled eggs were prepared.\n\n<mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> farm benedict:  here's the winner for me.  a gigantic piece of breaded and fried pork, on top of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, with a benedict sauce over the top.  spinach, scrambled eggs... i was happy to just finish 2/3 of this... and the last 1/3 could have been put between two pieces of bread for a significant size portion lunch.  get this.  if you like fried <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark>, you will love this.\n\nsmores espresso:  gigantic cup of coffee, drizzled chocolate all over, torched marshmallows covering the whole top, and a few graham crackers on the side for scooping purposes and eating.  pricey drink, but beautiful and executed phenomenally.  smores fan?  you'll be in love.\n\nhash house bloody mary:  i don't like bloody mary's.  but i order this one every time i'm here.  great condiments, excellent flavor, just enough kick to help jumpstart the day.  (i'm a lightweight drinker, mind you).  definitely spicy and flavorful, so it's not for those with bland tastes.\n\nverdict:  while off the strip, very worthwhile to make the trip.  great quailty, good pricing, huge portions, and friendly service... i've added this to my list of places to go to whenever i visit vegas.  followed by a nice 3 hour recovery nap to be scheduled every time.\n\nprotips - from the yelp reviews along with other friends who have been there, go for either breakfast or brunch... that's where they shine.  it sounds like dinner is good here, but not as good as the breakfast items.  also, while splitting is a great option since portions are huge, unfortunately you'll have to purchase side dishes so that they don't charge the fee for splitting entrees...", 
            "holy shiz! \n\nthe proportions here are enormous! but it's all so delicious and i love that they make the food look elegant and fun at the same time. i mean, to use a whole stalk of rosemary for platting style, i was quite impressed.\n\nmy friend ordered the basics, the flap jacks, sausage, bacon and two eggs. i ordered one of there egg scrambles with <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark>, asparagus,  that came with a biscuits and roasted potatoes. on top of that, we had hot chocolate which can be easily for two people. everything here is just bigger, yet better :)\n\ncan't wait to come back here and try more breakfast entrees and hopefully get to try lunch and dinner sometime :)", 
            "the following (and final) day started out with a big bang. seriously, that is the noise the ten pound plates made when plopped in front of us at hash house a go go. the portion size would put claim jumper to shame. (side note, i wonder if they bought all of claim jumpers plate inventory when they bk'd...?) so the low down on the mile high plates? we ordered from several section on the menu.\n\nfrom the hash section miles went with the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> hash\n\nand brein went with the meatloaf hash (shocker?) bill went for the indiana favorites section and got <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with eggs.\n\nkerie and i thought eggs benedict sounded good (and possibly a smaller choice...just by looking at the plates being delivered to other tables...we were very wrong). she got the crispy hammered pork benedict\n\nand i the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. starting from the bottom mine had 2 huge home made biscuits, about 2 cups of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> (crisped on the griddle), fresh spinach and tomato slices, 2 slices of crispy bacon, about 8 oz of melted mozzarella cheese, scrambled eggs (looked like 2 or 3), and then the largest <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breast i've ever seen with chipotle creme poured on top. oh yea, a slice of watermelon was in there somewhere too. \n\neveryone enjoyed their meal, brein and i enjoyed taking 80% of the food home with us and i even took my dad there a few days later. all in all this is a must however i will say that a friend got sick from the location at imperial palace and this review only vouches for the location on sahara.", 
            "i want to start out my restaurant reviews - with my #1 pick to eat at in the las vegas valley. the would be the hash house a go go. the hash house is located at four locations in the las vegas valley. the first is at 6800 west sahara blvd. just east of rainbow blvd. the second is in the imperial palace hotel & casino located at 3535 las vegas blvd s. the third location is in the m resort and casino located at 12300 las vegas blvd. s in henderson. and the newest is at the plaza hotel and casino at the end of fremont street in downtown las vegas. they have a great menu for breakfast, lunch & dinner. come dine for breakfast on a '<mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark>, garlic, onion, asparagus and rosemary' hash for only $12.95.\n\nor dine on one of their famous one pound burgers like the 'apple <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark> and mashed potato' burger also for only $12.95. no need for side dishes with this one, even though it comes with a ton of fries. (prices are subject to change) how about for dinner you try one of their '<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> linguine'. all of their food is great to eat and easy on the wallet.\n\nthey say that they serve \"twisted farm food\". i'm not sure if i would call it twisted, but it is some of the best i have had. not only is the food some of the best, i have to say that the servers are some of the best as well. my beverage was never empty and when they asked if i needed something more i never felt as if i were being pressured. they truly wanted to help me. even if they were just pretending, i could not see it. so, if you are looking for something unique and great tasting, get on down to one of the three locations of the hash house a go go.", 
            "i have been to hash house before but not at this location. my prior experience were not so good. but i decided to give it another chance. and i have to say that this location is far better than the other one in imperial palace. the food and service was just awesome.\n\nso, we got there early and were seated right away. the waitress was nice and attentive. \n\ni ordered the benedict andy <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>. ^_^ this was extremely good. just thinking about this dish is making my mouth water. additionally, my b ordered the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> which was another great dish. not to mention, the portion are huge. \n\nwith that say, i would totally come back to this restaurant.", 
            "came here for a birthday breakfast after a recommendation from a friend.  i'm glad we came here.  we ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs and the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> benedict.  the portions were huge!  we definitely could not finish in one sitting.  our meals were delicious.  the chicken was not too dry and seasoned well (not too salty, which is a common downfall).  i really liked the fact that they had tangerine juice!  yum!  because it was a birthday breakfast, i had to ask if they would give us a free dessert, which they didn't.  however, we were able to get a candle on the birthday girl's order.  that was nice.  the staff was friendly and the atmosphere was casual and perfect for families and larger parties.", 
            "took an extended weekend trip to vegas. yelped a few good places to eat at. came across hash house a go go. i ordered the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> with red peppers scramble with a side of potatoes. it was good not very seasoned but ehh cant complain. it was a good amount of food, i wasnt even able to eat it all. they had fresh homemade strawberry jam for the biscuits ( loved it ). the server was friendly and there was no wait. we wanted to sit outside on the patio however there was this thing shooting out a mist of water and we asked if that would be going on the whole time they said yes. i am not sure why any one would want to be sprayed with a mist of water while they are trying to enjoy their breakfast but whatever lol. i would recommend this place but dont sit outside!", 
            "this is the most overhyped place i've ever tried. i had their <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> hash and it was the most bland tasting thing i've ever had in my life. in fact, it was even served to me lukewarm. to top it off, the waitress and management did nothing to rectify the situation when i complained. bad food, bad customer service. save your money for one of the many better food options out here.", 
            "add me to chorus of positive reviews, you really can't go wrong with this place. \n\ni'm not a pig, but i get frustrated when you pay good money at a restaurant and you leave hungry. this will never happen to you here. the portions are huge, you always have a doggie bag, and they make your favorite menu item so well that you'll find it hard to try some of the other menu items (but you should, i have yet to try anything here that isn't first rate). the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> hash is my favorite (for the moment).\n\none thing i particularly enjoy about hhagg is the excellent micro-brew choices they have. it's not a massive list, but it's an excellent, rotating list, and it complements a lot of the meals really well. \n\n there is always a wait at this place, so plan accordingly. but you know when you see a big line in front of any restaurant, it's usually for the right reasons, and that is certainly true of hhagg.", 
            "it's so so good! \n\nhash house should hand out yoga pants at <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark>. a host should greet you and say, \"hi, welcome, our food is delicious and served in ridiculous portions so here are some stretchy pants to help you feel better about eating until you hate yourself!\" \n\nwe ordered the man vs. food benedict, the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> and red pepper skillet, the salmon sandwich and the artichoke, sun dried tomato hash. all of which were pure deliciousness! the benedict... unreal. it has <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, cheese, eggs, <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, a biscuit and it's smothered in a sauce you could bathe in. the strawberry jam that's served with the biscuits tastes so fresh and real. not smuckers jam, real grandma made it type jam. \n\nour service was pretty good but the it took almost 15 minutes to get our bill. the only negative thing i can say about the good is that the salmon sandwich needs a different bun, it's too much bread to sandwich ratio. \n\nwe will be back, with out stretchy pants on!", 
            "we had the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> and artichoke skillet and both were delicious. huge portions and everything was cooked to perfection. best biscuit in town. be prepared to experience a food coma."

            "omg . . . too much food.  there.  i've said it.  thought i'd never say it, but there you go.\n\ni recently went to hash house for breakfast.  i've always wanted to try the one in san diego, but could never find parking.  as i passed the vegas location, i saw it had its own parking lot and decided to give it a try.  the food was great  - - we had the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash and the basic breakfast.  to back my opening statement, whats known as the \"basic\" breakfast was huge!  i don't know how many eggs were used but suffice to say it was a lot, the ham steak was a very thick cut and of great quality, the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and roasted potatoes were plentiful.  all i can say is you won't be disappointed.\n\ni've said the mantra \"i don't mind paying for quality, just don't skimp on the food\" many times.  that said, you'll find the prices \"a bit up there\"  compared to average breakfast, but hash house is anything but average.  the quality and quantity is great.\n\nfinally, be warned . . . you'll either leave stuffed to brim, or have a hefty take home bag.  good eating at the hash house.",

            "chicken + waffles + the king of pop?!? \n\ni had no idea when i walked into hash house a go go for the first time that all the servers would be dressed as michael jackson! moonwalker michael was there, black or white michael, jackson 5 afro michael was there...you get the point. they played all of mj's hits during brunch and it was a totally fun atmosphere. \n\non to the food... \n\nwhen i see the words 'chicken' and 'waffles' on a menu i really don't need to look any further. what arrived was a jaw-dropping, head-turning architectural digest-worthy tower of juicy <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles. also stunning was the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash which they served on a massive cast iron skillet and the mouth-stretching double cheese burger. \n\nthe food was all very good although the standouts for me were the fries (dipped in the maple glaze!), <mark>Corned Beef</mark>, and their bloody marys.",

            "best meal in vegas!! the dishes are shockingly cheap considering one could feed 2-3 people. the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash had actual shredded <mark>Corned Beef</mark> in it.  the best were the chicken and waffles. the rosemary, the sauce, the everything. if i die without eating here again, i'll be very disappointed.",

            "this place has ridiculously huge portions!  my advice is if you cannot eat a huge plate, share, share, share or just bring it home so you can leftovers for days.  it is, gluttony at its best.  \n\nanna l. and i split <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with fresh spinach, tomatoes, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream, and scrambled eggs.  apparently, this dish is a fave of adam from man vs. food.  the dish was really good especially the chipotle cream.  it gave a nice spiciness to the dish.  the only downside...the chicken was lukewarm and not hot.  \n\nother dishes that we ordered were the chicken and waffles, banana <mark>French Toast</mark> (if i were craving sweets, that is probably what i would order), and <mark>Corned Beef</mark> and hash.  the drinks are delish esp. the watermelon lemonade cooler and mint mocha.  \n\ngood prices, clean restaurant, good food, and great service makes jen a happy chica!",

(you will see what i mean.) there was so much of it that i had to take it home. it was a complete meal though because it also included eggs and fruit. i did not like the lemonade they served. it tasted gross, but oddly, i think it was supposed to taste that way...\n\nmy most recent visit was for dinner. i had the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with the penne pasta. i did not like the pasta, but the chicken was pretty good. my boyfriend got the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles. he thought it was amazing and so did i! \n\nas far as food presentation goes, they do that very well. the food (during breakfast) is served on these large, heavy skillets. dinner is served on large (and i mean large) plates.\n\ni adore hash house. they not only make food good, they make it fun. i love this \"twisted\" farm food.",

            "gigantic portions are the name of the game at this spot way off the strip. we arrived early and were seated right away. as the morning wore on, i could see we really beat the rush. i had the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash over crispy potatoes, with 2 poached eggs. i had never had <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash like this before! rather than the ground and canned <mark>Corned Beef</mark> we're all used to, it was stringy pieces of actual <mark>Corned Beef</mark>! a shocking yet welcome sight after driving this far from the strip for breakfast. flabbergasted, i tried a complete bite with some egg, beef, and potato. all the textures and flavors came together like some sort of breakfast voltron in my mouth! no seasoning was necessary, and yes, mom, i cleaned my plate. a+ dish, without a doubt.\n\nmy only complaint are the prices. breakfast for 2 ran me almost $50 here with tip, a little more that i care to spend, but at least portions are big. i recommend sharing your dishes. who cares if you get charged $2.50, it'll save you about 10 bucks and you'll both be full.", 
            "i don't even know where to begin!!!  my friend had told me about this place because she went to the one in san diego.  i had never heard of it, so i decided to do some research and check out their website online prior to going.  my mouth was watering even before ever going there!\n\nwe got there right as soon as the place opened.  we opted to not go to the one on the strip because we figured it would be much busier.  there were people waiting outside, and soon after we were seated, the rush began and didn't stop when we left.\n\nour waitress was cute and dorky.  actually, most of the staff seemed to be right up that alley, but it all had a very smooth way of working out in the best interest of the business and created a nice atmosphere.\n\ni decided to try the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash (obviously i am a huge fan) and my fiance had the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>.  holy crap.  i knew the pictures online made the food look big, but i never imagined that the portions would be like this.  you can easily split a meal with someone if you wanted to and still be stuffed.  my hash came out with chunks of <mark>Corned Beef</mark>, not the crap from the can.  it seemed fresh like they just got it out of the crock pot and was piled with a mound of crispy potatoes and swiss cheese.  my fiance's food was amazing too!  i cannot even begin to describe the abundance of flavor in the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>!\n\ni highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone who likes good food and a lot of it.  i would have taken my leftovers with us, but we were in a hotel that didn't have a mini-fridge or microwave for reheating.  they need to bring this out to the desert heat in az because i am sure there would be quite the crowd and appetite for it.", 
            "omg! omg, omg, omg. did i say omg?!  \n\ni have to tell you that i am not a fan a breakfast. i do eat it though and it's ok. i have never been wowed by breakfast. let me just tell you that since visiting the hash house, i have eaten those words. i have never been to a breakfast place where everything (and i do mean everything) was delicious.\n\nfirst let start off with the decor. this is a very nice place. got a kinda old country/modern type feel. they have an outside patio in the front and also in the rear. the bathrooms are clean and quaint. \n\nenough of that, on to the grub. i ordered the pancake tractor breakfast with a rudy red mimosa. my hubby ordered the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hask skillet with coffee. i have pictures of the food but the mimosa was so damn good, i finished it before remembering to take pics. (sorry)\n\nmy breakfast came with 2 eggs, potatoes and a pancake. like i mentioned, i'm not a big breakfast eater, so i didn't want any meat. when my platter came (that's right, i said platter), i couldn't do anything but buck my eyes. how big is this pancake, i asked the waitress. and i quote\" 18 inches\". when i tasted the food all i could say was ummm. they eggs tasted like they plucked them from up under a chicken they had out back. (don't know if they have a chicken house out back, but they were just that fresh!) the potatoes were awesome and the pancake tasted like buttermilk.\n\nmy hubby food came but before that he couldn't stop talking about the coffee. now let me tell you, my husband drinks coffee, i don't. all he could talk about before his food came was how good the coffee was. i'm serious, he would not shut up about this coffee. he made me try the coffee. it was ok but like i said, i'm not a coffee drinker.\n\nto quote my hubby, \"this is some damn good hash. the best i ever had\". my plate had so  much food on it 3 people could have ate with me. even my husband had food left on his plate (and that's a surprise cause he usually don't leave anything!) \n\nthe bill came out to $40 but it was well worth it. you will not be sorry. i say go to hash house on sahara.", 
            "hmm, i think the reason they are so high in rating is cuz of the gigantic portion! chicken and waffles consisted of 4 waffles and 2 huge <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breast! <mark>Corned Beef</mark> is special cuz they hand pulled the beef and it's tender. the reason i said it was over rated is bec i was dissapointed with the taste. although presentation is 'wow', the taste is kinda bland. chicken was tasteless and waffles are not that great either, too much flour and not as fluffy as i like it to be. another hassle is that every person needs to order soething - even my 1 year old?? are you kidding me?! good thing we can order sides for additional person..... kiwi lemonade is just so so. the reason many people likes it was bec of the nice color it was presented - green/ yellow/ pink color! again, i would rather go to other place for breakfast next time.", 
            "holy cow! the portions here are ginormous! i ate like a pig, but felt like a cow. i guess that's keeping with the farm theme. \n\nthe first time i ate here i had the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash. freakin' bomb. i've recommended it to two other people and it was a hit for both of them! \n\nthis time around i had <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, which was pretty good too. i'm not going to go into it because other people have described it thoroughly. it really looks like a hot mess and i'm sure some top chef judge would probably be appalled by the busyness of the dish. i think all food groups were covered in this dish. thought i could tackle this thing, but only ate half. you'd probably have to share this meal with someone or you'll end up with leftovers (which isn't always a bad thing!) \n\nthe mango coconut pancake is something that i probably will have every time i eat here. when i told our server that i was ordering it for my three year-old, she said, \"it's pretty huge.\" i replied, \"yup, we're sharing it!\" even though it was a shared piece, we still went home with half of it. \n\ni failed to mention that perhaps the main reason why i couldn't eat all of my food was because i had a blood mary. it's definitely a meal in itself. it was sinfully good and perfectly balanced. wished i could've taken my leftover drink with me:d \n\nif you're going to eat here, make sure you come with an empty stomach and loose pants!!", 
            "more like a 3.7\n\ni had the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash with eggs ($12.95), orange juice, decaf.  so the decaf sucked like it usually does.  the rest of my meal was fantastic.  i feel i did pretty good only leaving about half the bag of potatoes and half the biscuit.  this is not an inexpensive place to eat but both the quality and the quantity justify the expense.  if you have wheels in vegas this is one of those places you have to try.  they also have a location inside the imperial palace.  i was seated immediately and the service had gaps in time but not bad for a 3/4 full restaurant.", 
            "this place gets pretty crowded.  it's like a denny's/ihop on crack.  their portions are ridiculously huge.  the vanilla pancakes were just ok. i also had the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash with eggs. i'm glad i shared my food.  the staff was pretty friendly.  it gets really noisy but the food was good.  i will come again and try something different.",

            "breakfast orgy!  those are the words i use to describe this place to my friends and family...at least the ones that are ok with the word orgy.  i made my first trip here 3 years ago after seeing the man vs food episode and now it is an absolute must on every vegas trip.  i was there for the week of the 4th and hit it up on the 4th...and the 6th.  <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> is my go to when i have to split with my wife.  when the shackles come off and i can order whatever i want, there's no telling what i'll get.  i'll list a few that i've had:\n\nchicken and waffles: share this.  it's two big pieces of chicken paired with waffles that have bacon baked into them.  i've never come close to finishing but wished i could.\n\nblackberry granola pancake: i was embracing my inner tree hugger and it was delicious.  the berries explode all over the pancake with patches of granola baked right in.  if you like those flavors, get this into your mouth asap.\n\n<mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash: order this if you like actual <mark>Corned Beef</mark> and not <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> food that comes in the hormel can.  it's served in strips, almost shredded, in a skillet with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and a buscuit.  coulda been something i'm missing, but it's all about the <mark>Corned Beef</mark>.  \n\nbanana pecan french toas: take a big ass banana, split it down the middle and cook that bad boy up.  now pair it with some of the best <mark>French Toast</mark> you've had with pecans also invited to the party in your mouth.  if you want some serious sweet for breffas, do this.\n\ndrinks- i've been wanting to order drinks for a while now.  i always fixate on the food and skip the exotic drink menu. not this last time though.\n\nsmores mocha: are you f'n kidding me?  first it comes in an oversized mug (surprise). it's a mocha which marshmallow fluff on top that's browned and then garnished with two pieces of graham cracker.  it's very sweet, so i'm not sure if it's an option, but an extra shot would probably be the only recommendation i could give to make this any better.\n\ncaramel mocha (?)- not sure of the name, but it comes in a tall glass that makes it look like a shake because it's topped with a bunch of whipped cream which is toped with drizzled caramel and chocolate.  like the above drink, very tasty, but very sweet.  i like my coffee strong, so i'd add an extra shot next time if possible.\n\ni believe there are at least 4 locations in vegas, the m, the plaza, the imperial palace and this one.  i like this one because it's a free standing building well off the strip, so i avoid a little of the vegas madness.  it gets packed pretty early.  if you think you're going to sleep till 9 and show up and get a table at 10 like every other lazy ass, you're mistaken.  you need to commit to breakfast, wake up early and show up as close to opening (i believe it's 7:30am) as possible.\n\nif you go to vegas and don't eat breakfast here, you're doing it wrong.", 
            "hung over and tired of all the buffets and expensive overrated eateries on the strip? well...hash house a go go might just be what you're looking for! it's located off the strip, but it's a great place for breakfast and brunch.\n\ni came here with a fairly large party and we were seated almost immediately. with a table full of foodies, we decided to order several dishes to share. this allowed us to try a little bit of everything, which was fantastic! some of the dishes that we ordered included the following: <mark>HH Famous Meatloaf</mark>, <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, <mark>Corned Beef</mark> house hash, griddled <mark>French Toast</mark>, roasted <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark>, and chicken and waffles. my favorite was the griddled <mark>French Toast</mark>; it was airy and fluffy, with a nice crisp at the edges. it included baked bananas drizzled with banana cinnamon cream and pecan maple syrup. <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> was absolutely orgasmic and i highly recommend it! another dish that stood out was the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. the benedict came with sort of scrambled eggs, versus the typical poached egg that i am used to. it was different, but delicious. the chicken was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside and the sauce was unique and flavorful.\n\nthe portions were humungous and very nicely presented. their drinks are also a hit too--especially their kiwi watermelon lemonade and various mimosas! our waitress was patient and courteous too, so don't forget to visit this place the next time you're in town!",

            "brenda's daughter took us here for breakfast one saturday morning instead of going to the local denny's or ihop. she insisted that it had some good food and the overall reviews said it was pretty good. when we got there, there were quite a few people ahead of us so hopefully that spoke to the quality of the food--unfortunately it didn't. after a long wait in line we finally were seated and greeted by a waitress who didn't seem like she really wanted to be there either (she probably already tasted the food).\n\nwe ordered our coffee and juice and stared at the menu. brenda and i both have an adventurous palate and are willing to try anything at least once. however, there is a difference between adventurous and just plain crazy. when you read the menu, nothing jumps out and says \"hey! pick me! i'm really tasty.\" quite the opposite--the food and flavor combinations of everything except the pancakes don't even begin to sound like they'll work together. however, to be polite, we placed our orders and waited for the food. i had the only thing that sounded somewhat normal to me; the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> has with red onions and swiss cheese. by the way, they have a no substitutions policy and they do enforce it.\n\nthe service here isn't any better than the food. wait staff is slow and you may or may not have everyone's meal served at the same time.as we waited for the food to arrive, we saw that the portions they brought out were huge--even bigger than what we get at black bear. unsurprisingly, with the amount of people here, the wait for the food was about 40 minutes, which is a bit long for breakfast. apparently because the food is all \"homemade\", it prevents the kitchen staff from having any type of timing system to ensure everyone at the table is served at the same time. when my food was placed in front of me, i just kind of stared at it. it certainly wasn't what i was expecting when i ordered <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash. instead of a neat presentation, i faced a huge pile of potatoes and the hash topped with a slice of cheese and two overcooked eggs. sticking out of the top of this monstrosity was a rosemary tree. normally, i would expect something like this to have the hash grilled and then have the cheese placed on top and remixed once it the cheese melted before putting it on the plate. i also expected the \"crispy\" potatoes to be on the side. since they were thrown in with the hash, they were soggy from all the grease.\n\nthe food itself lacked any real flavor and no amount of salt and pepper really did anything to improve it. sure, the portions were huge, but that just meant more wasted food at the end of the meal. quality is a bit more important that quantity.\n\ntheir motto is \"twisted farm food.\" i'm not sure what farms they're visiting, but it doesn't conjure up any memories of food i ate growing up in pennsylvania dutch country. head on over to ihop, denny's or black bear if you want a better meal at a cheaper price.",

            "as my friend pre-warned me, the best bang-for-your-buck food situation that i've experienced in a long time.\n\ni was warned that the portions were huge, and this was accurate. we sat in the bar area which had a tv and was separated from some larger groups in the main dining room.  as you can see if you check the menu, they have a wide variety of breakfast/brunch/lunch/dinner options. as it was just barely noon, i was expecting to go for a burger or something, but i was swayed by the lure of some legitimate <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash.  the \"hash\" options seem to be one of their signature items, as per their name. i went with the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> which had, obviously, some deliciously prepared <mark>Corned Beef</mark> (like, not chopped up pre-packaged frozen stuff - it was as if it had been slow-prepared that day), swiss cheese, red onions (but not too much). the kicker is that it was served over a large amount of delicious oven-fried potato chunks rather than standard hash browns, all in a large square skillet (see picture).  oh, and it also came with 2 eggs <mark>Two Egg Breakfast Any Style</mark>, a buttermilk biscuit, and a couple fruit garnishes.  that all was around $13 i think, which might seem like a lot but as i said, it was outrageously proportioned. i didn't even touch the biscuit or the fruit, and it was still very filling.  the taste was great, and i'd recommend it to anyone.", 
            "ok so when i come to hhagg it's always packed with a wait. that's a good sign right? one time we waited a good 45 minutes but it was mother's day after all. was the wait worth it...yes. \n\ni'm pretty much a traditional boring person when it comes to food. i like the simpler flavor versus the crazy unique flavors. whenever i am here i order the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash which is definitely one if my favorites. tender <mark>Corned Beef</mark> with skillet potatoes and swiss cheese on top. i'm a cheesy girl and that cheese as weird as it may sound actually pairs well with it. i actually have ordered something off the special menu as well.  the crab cake benedict on mother's day was pretty dang tasty. there was real crab and the crab vs. batter/filling ratio was about 2:1. it came with spinach and a spicy sauce (spicy to me) which was delicious. \n\ni've ordered drinks from hhagg before and although good it's just too much. their famous hot chocolate is huge! it's awesome but when i eat salty foods i like to drink the plain old h20. overall i do like this place for brunch/breakfast but service can be a bit on the slow side when they have a full house.",

            "this was my third time visiting hash house and the 3rd location i've seen. this particular location was off the strip and the outside looks similar to the one i went to near san diego. since there is one directly on the strip in a casino, this location appears to be frequented by more locals instead and less obnoxiously crowded. no need to wait over an hour or so for a table which means we were in and out of there before trekking back to phoenix in 40 minutes total!\n\nthe service was awesome and quick! we especially loved our waitress izzy! the waiters and waitresses were on top of \"question and answer\" sessions with newcomers. although there was only my hubs and i at our table, there was a group of 8 next to us with one cranky customer. despite the customer being unreasonable, their waiter handled the situation with such finesse and ease that it really wasn't such a problem anymore. whew! mini crisis averted!\n\nour food was predictably good. i ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with bacon stuffed waffles while bry ordered the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash skillet. from the pictures i uploaded, one could tell that these dishes were mighty and grand in stature and had the flavor to match! anyone who's \"hangry\" can appreciate how this food can quickly cure and almost overwhelm what you thought would be an insatiable hunger. bravo hash for you consistency is pleasing your customers on multiple levels! and bravo on the awesome bloody mary variations and even classic bloody mary!",

            "mmmmm food! this is a great breakfast eatery to visit when you are famished or waking up with the drunk munchies from tying one on the night before. the portions are ginormous and the presentation is pretty extraordinary too. i don't generally like for my food items to be all loved up to each other like they serve it up here but at hash house, it works. everything on the plate is served as though it is one item, if that makes any sense. all i know is, this is some delicious grub. \n\n<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> is so warm, juicy and sage-y. so good. but it's hard to make a decision because the <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> benedict is incredible as well. they offer quesadillas with a sriracha garnish that is a favorite of mine too. i have tried most of the menu items at one time or another and the only thing i would not order again is the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>. i didn't like the cracker crust. just a personal preference. hash house is not a one trick pony either. the lunch and dinner menus have some great dishes. i haven't sampled as many items as i have on the breakfast menu but i definitely recommend the crispy cornmeal salmon sandwich. the wheat bun and chili mayo really make this sandwich sing. love it. \n\nbesides the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>, i also don't like the split plate charge. imho it is inappropriate to charge more money for the exact same amount of food just because more people are going to be eating it. i rolled in with a group of four that selected three entrees to share, which would have been more than enough food to feed five people, only to be told that there was something like a $3.00 split plate charge. i'm not sure of the exact amount. and while three bucks isn't that big of deal it still seems unnecessary. \n\nthose few cons won't keep from going back though. the food is just too good.", 
            "the food is always freshly served and delicious. the <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark>, brie and eggs were really good. staff is really friendly and are good with recommendations when you're not quite sure what you want to order.   counter space available if only one two eating in a hurry.  sahara location is easier access then hotel on the strip.", 
            "if you're a huge eater, then this is probably a good choice for you but on my second visit here i decided that it's just complete overkill with the portion sizes. one breakfast entree is more than enough for two people, yet if you want to share they charge you an additional fee. i find this a little ridiculous, but whatever. \n\nthe food is generally okay (i love a good biscuit, and that they can offer) but on this past visit i was not happy with my entree which was a <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> benedict. it was basically a mountain of heavy and dry components which did not mesh together well at all but most importantly, the salmon tasted really fishy. i'm a pescetarian so i know fish pretty well and there was something just not quite right with this salmon. so i take about two bites and stop. i had my husband taste it too just to be sure it wasn't in my head and he agreed. we are not complainers, but we felt they needed to know about the funky fish. our server finally came by and noticed that i hadn't eaten much and asked if something was wrong, so we told her. she did ask if i wanted something else but i said i was okay. \n\na few minutes later a manager stopped by to find out what the issue was, so we explained it to her as well. so, here's where this establishment went all wrong...this manager proceeds to explain to us the entire process of how they \"smoke\" their salmon. she said their method is a little unique and \"not for everyone\" and that she didn't really care for it either. um, really? that's how you're going to handle this? she didn't offer anything to make it right. we weren't demanding a free meal, or even a refund. we didnt ask for anything different and just wanted to explain that there could have been a problem with old fish. the response was basically, our salmon is not for everyone, and sorry you didnt like it. arrogant, and not the way to keep loyal clientele. in short, poor management response has blacklisted this restaurant for me.", 
            "just kidding.\n\napparently i didn't appreciate <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> benedicts quite enough.\n\nif this restaurant were a person, the first thing it would say is: \"get your fatass back here and eat this damn food.\"\n\ndon't fight it.", 
            "let me start by saying i first went to hash house at imperial.  it was good, maybe what i ordered wasnt the best (<mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> hash).  alas, enter the location on sahara! oh my. i had the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and maple glaze. fantastic! portion was enormous, you definitely need to come with a hungry man here to finish your food.  i split the banana brown sugar pancake with my husband. heavenly. nothing compares.  the caramelization on the bananas and the surprising brown sugar bits in the batter were nothing short of spectacular.  might i say that the batter itself without the bananas and sugar was also delicious. eat here! you won't regret it.  i'm so sad i dont live here, but glad my brother does because this will be on our list of pit stops when we visit.", 
            "this review is for the restaurant as a whole and not specifically this location. my friends and i were in town for a birthday and on the way back to california, we decided to stop by at the hash house a gogo that was at the m resort. i've always wanted to try this place due to the fact that i'm an avid man vs. food watcher. \n\nthe food: the portions are fairly big so i would recommend sharing unless you've got a big appetite and know you are able to consume that much food. i sure wish i had shared my dish with some else. \nwhat we ordered (all very good dishes btw cause we tried each others dish): \n - farm benedict: <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> w/ fresh asparagus, sundried tomatoes, chili cream and two basted eggs\n - the basic: <mark>Two Egg Breakfast Any Style</mark>, potatoes, fruit and biscuit (add bacon, sausage or ham)\n - <mark>French Toast</mark>: griddled <mark>French Toast</mark> dipped in banana cinnamon cream w/ pecan maple syrup\n - <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> & biscuit \n - famous one pound stuffed burger: <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, avocado & cheddar\n\ni thought that the food was pretty rich in the sauces and quite heavy. i'm not much of a breakfast eater but i did enjoy my meal here. although i did have to take a good amount of it to go. \n\nprices: each dish is about 15 dollars ( unless you get the basic breakfast/brunch dishes, which are about 9 dollars) it isn't too bad as compared to the rest of the prices from restaurants on the strip in vegas.  \n\nservice: i have to rate the service at the m resort location to be a 2.5. our server/waiter was one of those who you could just tell hated his job and as a result it showed in his performance and the service that was provide to my party of 8 was not that great. he even dropped a fork on my friend as he was clearing the table and said \"shit man i'm sorry\" in my opinion, that is very unprofessional. from my work experience i know the importance of excellent customer service and i definitely did not feel it here. but the food was pretty good and i was in good company so i was willing to over look that slight annoyance \n\noverall. i recommend you all to try it at least once. :) check out the photos i posted too to see the dishes that my table ordered!", 
            "great big breakfast/brunch/hangover/binge restaurant. first off their drink selection is pretty amazing for mimosa type beverages and bloody mary's and alcoholic coffee drinks.  we orderd of course the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>..l amazing as expected.. great chipotle cream gravy and biscuits and juicy chicken. now i was actually not really happy with what i ordered... wish i would have ordered something else judging from everyone else's food around me. i got a scramble with <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> and cream cheese and it was just like a mushy blob and actually kinda small portion.... tasted like something i'd whip up with leftover salmon/lox at home.  \n\nwe sat at the \"bar\" on high top tables which was fine and way better than waiting.\n\ncan't wait to go back to try a different benedict nd have another great breakfast cocktail!", 
            "wow!  words can't describe the food here!  great food, great service, explained they don't have a microwave or heat lamps, so the food will come out as ready!  food fresh, hot, and wonderful!  try the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffle tower...ahmazing!!'  my husband had the <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> scramble...he said it was de-lish!  well worth the wait!", 
            "taking a break from traditional vegas buffets, i decided to give this place a try with friends. they're located about 5 miles west of the strip on sahara ave. although the place was fairly busy for a monday morning, we only waited about 10 minutes for our seat. \n\nthere rustic and casual take on traditional breakfast and comfort food is insanely good. we ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles, <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> scramble and blueberry pecan flapjacks. we were visually wowed when our food arrived.\n\nthe <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles was massively huge, piled high and beautifully presented. it must have been stacked 8-10 inches high and artistically decorated with huge sprigs of rosemary and sage leaves. i didn't know whether to eat it or pray to the food gods. it was truly amazing and the quality was downright excellent and delicious.the chicken was well seasoned, tender, light crisp on the outside and scrumptious. inside the waffles were infused with bits and pieces of bacon which caught me off guard and happily surprised. gratifyingly savory while still sweet, they're definitely better than any chicken and waffles i've tasted before. it makes rosco's chicken and waffles in la more like a kid's meal. \n\nfor you pancake lovers, their flapjacks are incredibly huge and almost the size of a pizza. most importantly, it was delicious. they don't skimp on toppings either. each flapjack was packed and full of blueberries and pecans. every bite had something in it. \n\non a more civilized level, the <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> scramble portions were smaller and regular size compared to the other dishes. both the brie and pesto provided scrumptious fusion of flavor and texture. accompanied with potato hash and toast, it was tasty and hearty breakfast.\n\nthe food here is crazy good and prices are very reasonable (entree $10-$15). our server was friendly, attentive and refilled our coffee and water promptly. while their over the top presentation and massive portions can be a bit overwhelming and mammoth, they make sure that taste and quality take center stage as well. enjoyed my first visit and hope to come back many more...", 
            "solid breakfast joint. loved the healthy options on the menu in addition to the classic american breakfast bombs. the smart start scramble with <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> and spinach was great! i would come here again and again if i lived nearby.", 
            "arrived shortly after opening and was pleasantly greeted and seated!  \nour server was quick to greet us and help us with drinks and answer any questions. \nthe menu is very unique and varied.  i loved all the different choices of pancakes and <mark>French Toast</mark>.  i opted for the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> (normally <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> is my go to). it was huge (as mentioned in nearly all other reviews)!  it was delicious. i was pleasantly surprised with the small chipotle kick on the side of the plate and in the sauce. \nmy husband ordered the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash and he would recommend that too!"

            "being a midwesterner, i am used to the idea of generous portions, but omg this place is ridiculous! it's not quantity of quality with this place, but both hand in hand!\n\nthis is what we had:\n\n<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> w/ fresh spinach, <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs. i took a picture of this sexy beast so look at it! this is shown as a man v food recommendation and adam richmond was spot on with this one! really good <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> just covered with egg, cheese, bacon, and chipotle cream. on the side of the plate they have like a chipotle puree as decoration and garnish. omg! really subtle, smoky chipotle cream just made the dish for me. it was really good. the chicken itself was a nice big piece of <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> that i really liked. there was a split biscuit underneath all of this and honestly, that by itself was really good. i ended up removing one of the halves of the biscuit and putting the house jelly on it.. such a good milky and fluffy biscuit.. a really hearty/delicious dish!\n\ncan't find it on the online menu , but also had a chorizo hash with fresh jalapenos, house potatos, and eggs. i think there was more to it than that, but i can't remember. really fresh chorizo with a nice kick to it. unlike other <mark>Chorizo</mark>, this wasn't too salty which was greatly appreciated! the potatoes were really good being nice and brown. no complaints about that dish either!\n\nof course had coffee and juice as well. fresh juice and always refilled coffee. can't beat it. \n\nas far as service goes, it was good. i could of used more water when i wasn't sipping my coffee, but other than that not bad at all.\n\npricing is fair for the amount you get!\n\noverall this is a 5 star place. really good food and good service at a fair price. it is more than what one usually pays for breakfast, but it is a special treat and we were in vegas so no biggie!"

            "five stars for a brunch place? hell yeah!  (i haven't had their dinner menu, but for a weekend brunch, it hits the spot!) \n\nafter driving by numerous times and being intrigued by the name of the restaurant alone, it was about time i got a chance to experience what the hash house was really all about.  \n\nafter about a 20 minute wait, we were starving.  it didn't help that we could see (stare) at what the diners were chowing on as they sat on the patio.  gigantic portions of anything and everything, that's for sure!\n\ni had their special mimosa with pom tangerine.  can i say yum?  if my boyfriend will make me a pitcher of that, i promise to get drunk real fast!  my other dining companions had their hh bloody mary with all the fixings.  those darn fixings were fabuloso!  they came with these vinegared blue lake string beans and stuffed green olives.  i heard two exclamations of \"i think this the best bloody mary i have ever had!\"  hot damn!  that was 2 for 2!\n\nfor food, i ordered their special farmer's daughter house hash that came with two eggs your way, biscuit, watermelon, and portabello mushrooms, cheddar cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, etc. on potatoes.  it was damn good!  my bf had the <mark>HH Famous Meatloaf</mark> hash house with spinach, meatloaf chunks, cheese and some other stuff on potatoes, along with two eggs his way, watermelon and a biscuit.  these house hashes arrived on a big ole' skillet and were hearty portions, which could easily be shared by two.  \n\nmy other dining companion had a omelet with salmon and brie.  the brie was such a nice and smooth taste to the omelet. yummy!  and our 4th diner chose two eggs with bacon and toast.  both orders arrived with a gigantic mound of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> that were tasty too.  \n\nthe best part...thank goodness the waitress told us about the homemade strawberry jam!  we were slathering that all over our biscuits and were just about to slather it all over ourselves. it was that good!  hot damn!\n\nlooking around at other diners, they had massive salads, gigantic pancakes and waffles that were falling over the edge of the plate, and huge sandwiches.  it all looked so good!  portions were plenty and you definitely feel like you get a big bang for your buck!  \n\ni was definitely curious to see if the dessert menu was so generous.  unfortunately, we were told the desserts were of average size.  they only had a strawberry cobbler, cheesecake, and some snickers thing.  but then again, with all this food...who makes it to dessert anyway?    \n\nservice was fabulous!  our waitress was super friendly, being patient with our delay in ordering and even bringing over more bloody mary fixings so we could devour.  \n\nwith a name like this, i am confident that you can have a feast after a little 'hash' of your own!  i'm even putting this restaurant into my \"top restaurants\" and \"nice date restaurants in vegas\" because if a boy brought me here 'the morning after', he would get a gold star in my book for sure!  that's right boys...if you're letting the girl stay over into brunch time and you bring her here, she'll be more than happy to go back to your place again (assuming you give her a chance to digest!).  and ladies, if you bring the guy here the morning after, he'll be sure to stick around for a few more mornings after for sure!  \n\nanyone who wants a hearty brunch in vegas away from the strip, hash house a go go is your place to go!  their numerous awards for breakfast and brunch are well deserved!\n\nupdate: 01/04/07 - i recently went back for their special blue lump crab cake with chili mayo <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> ($15.95).  the mayo had a nice zing for the crab cake and the deep fried angel hair pasta garnishment had a nice crunch.  it was a yummy dish and big enough to share.  it's a $2.50 split charge if you do share it.  their homemade jam was a mixed berry concoction this time.  i also tried their banana pancake with cinnamon.  the bf loved it, i'm more of a waffle kind of girl myself.\n\n(check out the photos above of my good eats!)", 
            "ive been hearing that this is the breakfast joint to hit up in vegas.  we went to this b/c i was so hungry after completing the first las vegas half marathon.  this place is away from the hustle and bustle of the strip on the west side of town.  it was a very good sign to see how busy this place was and how long the wait was.  just waiting outside and peaking into the heated outdoor eating area, you could see how enormous the plates were.  i should correct myself...they were enormous platters, not plates.  we were told that a party of 4 would be unable to sit in the bar area b/c the platters were huge.  \ni was impressed with the wide selection of breakfast items.  first off, going against the rules of post workout re hydration, i couldnt resist trying a libation from the mixed drink selection, why?  why not?  check this out...hash house bloody mary...premium vodka, bloody mary mix, fresh lemon juice, celery salt, worcestershire and hot sauce, spicy pickled green beans (with extras ordered), 2 jalapeno stuffed olives, and a mt olive kosher petite dill pickle, with fresh cracked pepper sprinkled on top...f@ckin hella savory ...that won me there at that point.\ni ended up choosing the <mark>HH Famous Meatloaf</mark> with roasted red peppers, fresh spinach, and smoked mozzarella all on big chunks of fried potatoes.  my favorite and lovely dining companion ordered the farmer's daughter house hash that came with two eggs your way, biscuit, watermelon, and portabello mushrooms, cheddar cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, etc. on also...big chunks of fried potatoes.  both came on a huge skillet (which they called their \"smaller\" dishes...lies...they were huge...i just finished the leftovers 2 days later)  my other dining companion had a decadent omelet filled with <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> and melted brie.  also, all our orders arrived with flaky biscuits, so you get to top it with some their own homemade strawberry jam (we ended up packaging some of the jam up for home...too bad it doesn't last long enough, not from me eating it all, but b/c it has no preservatives!!!\nthis ranks high in my favorite breakfast places to eat.  i will definitely return here with my lovely dining companion to enjoy the other things on the menu, such as the sundried tomato, basil & <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark> scrambled eggs, or the mushroom, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato and fresh spinach hash, or even the roasted <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark>, charred tomato, corn, baby green beans and mozzarella hash, and definitely for that damn bloody mary.",

            "biki tested and m.v.f. approved! this is not the normal breakfast fare! they have a spin to almost everything you eat! portioning omg is huge! after all, its serving size is a skillet! lol top choices are <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict and <mark>HH Famous Meatloaf</mark>! we need this in hawaii!!!!! i hope you heard that owners!", 
            "twisted farm food....that's pretty accurate\n\nmy only regret is i am not actually a cow, with the four compartment stomach and the ability to ingest 2.5% of my own body weight, which for me would be 4.2 pounds. if you do the math, you can figure out how much i weigh!\n\ni couldn't finish my brunch here.  i was defeated by a loaf of meat <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  i'm actually somewhat glad i didn't attempt the chicken and waffles, because my wife did, and she ate exactly half, so we decided the next time we come here, we would just split one, that way we can both feel accomplished in our eating endeavors.\n\ngargantuan proportions...just look at those pictures!  the food doesn't come on plates; here, they come on platters.  seriously consider whether you should donate a portion of your meal to charity.\n\n<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> tower.  it wasn't that architecturally sound, but at least it looked and tasted great.  bacon baked into the waffles, 2 pieces of crispy and not greasy chicken breasts on top of the waffles, with delicate fried leeks strewn about the plate, and a giant sprig of rosemary holding it all together.  usually comes drizzled with syrup, but we asked for it on the side and they were happy to do that. \n\n<mark>HH Famous Meatloaf</mark> with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  pretty much like normal meatloaf, but crispier and meatier(not meteor).  you know how meatloaf usually comes with either gravy or ketchup on top?  hash house does it with bbq sauce!  they are seriously changing the meatloaf game...the dish also came with the biggest biscuit i have ever seen in my life.  it was about 4 and a half fingerbreadths tall and about 7 inches around, and perfectly \"biscuit-y\".  you know what i mean?  a good balance of flakiness with fluffiness cut with a pinch of butteriness and saltiness, all in equal proportions.  i kind of love biscuits.\n\ni had a bloody mary to accompany my mini smorgasborg of a healthy brunch.  it was well made, as far as bloody marys go, and came with a garnish of a petite dill pickle and 2 jalapeno stuffed olives.\n\nprops - great food, tip-top service, good bloody mary\n\nnegative props - serious food coma.\n\nwe'd planned to partake in all manner of adventure after brunch, but hash house decided to ruin our plans by knocking us out with the force of a cast iron pan a la tom & jerry for about 4 hours.  we woke up and the sun was gone.  does that properly demonstrate the power of hash house a go go?", 
            "oh my gawd. this place blew my mind! if you have a car, this is definitely a must go in vegas off the strip. bring a huge appetite, because everything is massive portions. we ordered a ratio of 8 dishes to 12 people, and we were beyond stuffed. now, i'm able to write this review because we practically tried everything on their menu! :)\n\nmust tries:\n-banana maple pancakes (so fluffy, carmelized sugar, and baked in bananas...wow!)\n-corn beef hash (great presentation, liked it way better than the <mark>HH Famous Meatloaf</mark> one)\n-<mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> - this was amazing. the eggs on it were drenched in really interesting sauce. definitely not your typical eggs benedict.\n-kiwi watermelon lemonade. when you order this, and your friends see it, they're going to want one too. fair warning ;)\n\nwe also got the chicken and waffles (man vs food), and the porkloin benedict (which was kind of dry). they were all good. but i liked the top 3 i mentioned the best. \neverything was shocking and amazing. the portions were humongous. we all got drinks (mimosas, oj, and kiwi watermelon lemonade) and the bill only came out to about $15-16 a person. such a great value meal!",

            "my husband and i wanted to go here after we saw man vs food do their las vegas episode here. so we were planning a trip to the hoover dam and grand canyon and decide to stop here for a big breakfast. make sure you split with someone because the portions are unbelieveable huge. they charge a split plate fee. we got around that by ordering an extra biscuit. anyway we ordered the tracker <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark>. we got scrambled eggs, bacon, and the hh signature snicker flapjack. wow!!! pure heaven on a plate. i will add that service did suck here so if you are in hurry this place doesn't work for you!! we ended up eating at the bar area since it was a line for the resteraunt area.", 
            "hash house definitely didn't disappoint me with the amount of food they served on each plate. unfortunately, hh wowed me with quantity and not with quality. don't get me wrong, everything was edible, but i felt <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> of the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> w/ waffles could have been executed better.\n\ni think the maple flavored bacon inside the waffle was a great idea. trying to achieve that sweet and salty flavor some people crave, but this could have been accomplished with smaller bits of bacon within the waffle. instead you have large pieces of bacon stuck in between each waffle, i ended up avoiding the bacon all together.\n\nthe caramel for this dish actually ruined my <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>. i prefer my <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, untouched with any condiments, this is just a personal preference, but it may apply to those who are considering this dish.  the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> itself was crispy, tender, but lacked some unique flavors. i didn't taste any spice or herbs that may have been used in this dish.\n\nfyi: because their portions are fairly large, there is ~$2.50 surcharge for splitting a dish. the server recommended i order french fries on the side, instead of paying for the surcharge.", 
            "my boyfriend ordered some bbq ribs and everyone at the table were drooling over it. unfortunately he didnt share it with anyone else cuz he felt that if he did let someone try it then he'll have to let everyone else try it. there were about 4 ribs and some cole slaw. the ribs was literally falling off the bones when you eat it. it was pretty damn good! and we each ordered the pancake <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> i think. its literally a big ass pancake that covers the whole plate (btw the plate is really really really big) and it comes with maybe 2 eggs and your choice of sausage, bacon, or potatoes. i could barely finish the pancake. i only had maybe 1/6 of it. i should've just shared with my boyfriend. haha", 
            "if size mattered, hash house a go go would score stars off the charts.  if service mattered, it would get three stars.  if flavor mattered... well, there would be a slight dilemma. \n\nlet's start with first impressions.  forget \"line was out <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark>,\" it was more like mob surrounding the front patio.  once inside, you're greeted with such a busy atmosphere (on a weekend, at least) - all the tables were seated, families and friends getting together for a breakfast-version of thanksgiving.  if you haven't worked out those forearm muscles, not sure if this place would be for you.  their plates are ginormous (yes, this word has been officially quantified due to the portion sizes at hash house).  \n\ni would like to invest in whatever machinery they use to squeeze the orange juice.  \"fresh\" is an understatement.  that cup of orange juice is so amazing - it's as if someone took an orange, magically stirred up the juices inside an orange (without disturbing the peel), gave me a straw and offered me heavenly orange juice.  i was mesmerized by the juice, as i watched the pulp inside the glass, sway back and forth, taunting me with its citrusy-goodness, waiting for me to finish the entire cup, and ask for seconds or thirds.  i resisted - for i waited patiently for the food.  \n\nit's hard to not turn heads every time a server came by with a plate.  every plate looked like a mountain of food, with a twiggy-herb sticking up, followed by \"holy gamoly, that plate is huge!\"  pancakes looked like they were used as blankets to keep the plates from getting cold.  if it's true that you eat with your eyes first, you better close your eyes before the plates arrive at your table - you'd be full just by watching the plates make their way to the tables! \n\nwhen the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles showed up, i was amazed the table didn't tip over to one side.  the waffles piled against one another like mattresses, lending support the pieces of <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> that sat so gallantly on top.  once you cut into the waffles, bits of bacon are nestled inside the waffles, playing peek-a-boo, and tickles you with savory flavors to off-set the maple syrup, while making you yearn for the juicy <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>.  i'm telling you, it was all very well thought out.  four out of five stars is fair. \n\nsecond attempt - featured menu item: nappanee hash.  potatoes, tomatoes, strips of beef, eggs, (and other ingredients that i cannot remember) all glued together by smoked mozarella.  the potatoes were nicely crisped around the edges, eggs were made to order, and tomatoes danced around <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark>, teasing with freshness.  among the different flavor combinations came the strips of beef.  problem - they were just that: beef.  if we did role call, the character \"flavor\" would be followed by silence, because it was completely absent.  \"tenderness?\"  -- nice try.  that too, was absent.  two out of five.  \n\nas busy as i've seen this place, i would think that they would want more servers/waiters to make sure that the tables are flipped as quickly as possible.  service is a little bit on the slow side - and this is not just applied to the busy days.  on a day where there were no more than 6-tables, it took two or three attempts before we could get the waiter's attention to place an order.  three out of five.  \n\nif you don't have much patience for long lines (on the weekends) or slower service, steer clear.  if you've got a big group of (hung-over) people looking for some not-so-fancy foods at big quantities and little price, you're in good hands at the hash house.  if you're just tired of really watered down orange juices from the poker tables at the rio, just follow that holy-looking-glowing light to the hash house a go go.", 
            "as a las vegas local, i was very excited to finally go to breakfast here after hearing so much about it from various sources (man vs. food, other locals, etc.).  went with friends who are also locals and was their first experience eating here as well.\n\nwait time:  great...10 mins\n\ndecor/atmosphere:  hip/fun/great\n\nfood:  \"<mark>HH Original</mark> farm benedict was visually pleasing presentation-wise, portion size was large, but tasted very plain and average.  roasted red pepper cream sauce wasn't a plus to this dish.  unimpressive (according to my friend who ordered this dish).\n\n\"<mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark>\" (2 eggs w/ bacon and vanilla waffle version ordered) was nothing special/plain and over-priced for what you get ($12.95).  no garnish on the plate whatsoever with the exception of one strawberry on top of the waffle.  two of us ordered this dish (we each had our own) and felt exactly the same way about it.\n\nsmall orange juice ordered tasted like the kind that comes out of a machine and was way over-priced ($3.75).\n\nwe all ordered coffee. one person in our group took the first sip and immediately noticed a glob of old caked-on red lipstick on the rim of her cup.  disgusting!  she asked for a new cup of coffee.  server did not apologize nor seem to care...just brought a replacement cup. in my opinion, one cup of coffee should have been comped on our bill at the end of the meal, no questions asked, but that was not the case.\n\nservice:  very poor.  server was not friendly whatsoever.  this was so unexpected, especially given the \"notoriety\" of the restaurant.  t's not like you work at denny's!  i asked if it was possible to get fruit/strawberries to go with my waffle when i ordered, and the server's response was \"there's one strawberry that comes on top of the waffle\".  any other communication out of the server's mouth consisted of what seemed like \"grunts\" with an attitude of \"i really could care less whether any of you enjoy your breakfast\". took at least 20 mins before our food arrived at the table after having placed our order.\n\nall in all, the experience was a let down, and i so wish it had been otherwise.", 
            "my first visit to hash house a go go was for a cmye event, so i couldn't officially review it.  my second visit was a simple breakfast with the better half (tbh).\n\ni ordered the chorizo hash (chorizo, jalapeno, cheddar cheese, potatoes, eggs, biscuit, peppers & onions).  tbh ordered the salmon benedict.  to wash it down, i had the mango/peach iced tea.\n\nafter a short wait, the food came out.  since we have been here before, we knew what was in store for us....a massive plate of food.  adam richman from man vs food picked a great spot to host his show.....portions are large!  you have to bring your a-game to finish your plate.\n\nmy strategy was simple....i will save the biscuit for the end.  biscuits are stomach busters.  i added some tabasco and dove into the chorizo hash & eggs.  it was very good!  <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> of ingredients had a good flavor to it.  the saltiness of the chorizo combined with the gooey cheddar cheese and hot potatoes made for a huge plate of awesome!  i wish there were more jalapenos on it though....it didn't seem to have enough of them.....kind of light.  the eggs were prepared over easy just the way i like it....with the runny egg yolk covering the hash when i broke the seal.  as i said, the biscuit was last and i ate most of it with the final third of my dish....it was puffy & buttery....delicious and filling.\n\ntbh enjoyed her salmon benedict, but could only manage to finish 1/2 the plate.  i packed up the other half for later.\n\noverall, it was a great experience, just like the first time.\n\nwill i return?  soon....very soon!",

            "next time i visit hash house, i will make sure i will be in town that night, so that i may nap after eating and drinking my brunch. \nthis location is off the strip, with easy access parking and really good coffee! most diners have so-so coffee, but hash house a go go serves lavaza drip coffee and espresso drinks, with alcohol added, if you so desire. everything ordered was yummy. my friend ordered <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> with <mark>French Toast</mark>. i generally despise banana toppings, but enjoyed the sliced fried bananas on top, which i have named \"better than bananas.\"  the best parts of my <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> were the crispy fried <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, and the chipotle hollandaise sauce. mixed together, they were better than bacon!

            "oh my gosh, was this an experience....a great one for dinner! we had a variety...hamburgers, chicken, chops, etc.  absolute fabulous service and  very creative,gigantic servings.....unbelievable!   after hearing all the great reviews, i was dying to try it on my las vegas trip. definately, the place to go when you are famished.  we were so impressed, that we were taking pictures of the food. \n\nso go try it.   open 7 days a week, breakfast thru dinner.  and i can't wait until next trip to try breakfast.  they have a <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> if that tells you anything. i think it's two of everything.\n\njust so you know, hash house a go go, is casual, loud and super busy, but, a large restaurant.  it was no problem for us and were still seated right away.  great bar.  i ordered a martini, which i seemed to spill immediately.  one waiter brought another right away, as the poor bus boy cleaned my mess. what a way to start the evening!\n\nanother kudos to the manager.  she didn't like the way my entree looked, so she sent it back to be redone, and brought me a comp salad, big enough for two to share.  they were sure on top of things and i didn't mind the wait.\n\ntry it, you'll be happy you did..........", 
            "hung over and tired of all the buffets and expensive overrated eateries on the strip? well...hash house a go go might just be what you're looking for! it's located off the strip, but it's a great place for breakfast and brunch.\n\ni came here with a fairly large party and we were seated almost immediately. with a table full of foodies, we decided to order several dishes to share. this allowed us to try a little bit of everything, which was fantastic! some of the dishes that we ordered included the following: <mark>HH Famous Meatloaf</mark>, <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, <mark>Corned Beef</mark> house hash, griddled <mark>French Toast</mark>, roasted <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark>, and chicken and waffles. my favorite was the griddled <mark>French Toast</mark>; it was airy and fluffy, with a nice crisp at the edges. it included baked bananas drizzled with banana cinnamon cream and pecan maple syrup. <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> was absolutely orgasmic and i highly recommend it! another dish that stood out was the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. the benedict came with sort of scrambled eggs, versus the typical poached egg that i am used to. it was different, but delicious. the chicken was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside and the sauce was unique and flavorful.\n\nthe portions were humungous and very nicely presented. their drinks are also a hit too--especially their kiwi watermelon lemonade and various mimosas! our waitress was patient and courteous too, so don't forget to visit this place the next time you're in town!", 
            "i would definitely recommend this place.  great place to get your breakfast, especially if you're tired of eating on the stripe.  when i went on sunday for brunch (arrived around 10:30), the wait was 40 minutes. server was nice. \n\nrecommendation: chorizo hash, <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles, <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark>.", 
            "multiple times i have been to this hashhouse and each and every time these people are filled with awesomeness.  waiters/waitresses on point, friendly and attentive.  it seems as though everyone takes pride in customer service.  if i don't see my waitress/waiter i don't even have to ask for them.   a different waiter/waitress from a separate section may notice my coffee is low and offer me more.  great teamwork!!  today i had <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> with vanilla waffles.  a++  we also had chocolate chip pancakes, <mark>French Toast</mark>, and the chicken and waffles.  the survey from everyone was a+++", 
            "hangover food. yes. \n\nthe plates here are definitely shareable or for take-home for a second meal. i had the chicken biscuit benedict with a chipotle, and it was incredible. the flavors were so good in each bite and <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> of bacon, eggs, chicken, <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, chipotle gravy and garnish seems crazy weird, but it is full of win.\n\nwould like to come back for lunch and see what the burgers are all about, too. probably another surefire hangover cure. mental note...check!", 
            "love this place! always fresh, hot food and fast, friendly service. you can't go wrong with most items on their menu. my favorites are <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> and the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and bacon-infused waffle. yummy!",

            "yes adam richman, aka man vs food, has filmed here. yes, the potions are huge. yes, the dishes are unique and makes you wonder if it will all work together. it does! certainly a shareable kinda joint. we ordered two dishes to split amongst five of us! there was plenty to go around with no problem! it's not just huge portions though, it really is good food! you have to trust them on <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> that it will work though. you can get huge portions in various parts of vegas, but i'll say this is legitimate! nothing else, go once to say you did it. we did!"

            "after going to bed around 6am and getting up at noon, and before hitting the road for the long drive back to la sunday afternoon, we decided to come here for brunch since our friend that lives there raved about it.  we had to speed there from our friend's house since they stop serving on sundays at 2:30pm, but thankfully we made it in time.  they serve \"twisted farm food\" and plenty of it.  their menu is filled with plenty of heavy meat, eggs and potato dishes.  the kind of food you want to eat a lot of and then take a nap.  they have various brunch food including hash dishes, scrambles, flapjacks, <mark>French Toast</mark>, waffles, stuffed burgers, sandwiches, salads and benedicts, as well as a section titled \"indiana favorites\".  being from indiana, i knew i'd love this place once i saw that.\n\ni decided on the \"tractors <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark>\", which includes 2 eggs with bacon, sausage or potatoes and flapjacks, waffle or griddled <mark>French Toast</mark>.  since half the items on the menu feature bacon, i decided to get that as the side.  i had to get the griddled <mark>French Toast</mark> dipped in banana cinnamon cream with pecan maple syrup.  the eggs and bacon were good, but the star of the dish was definitely the <mark>French Toast</mark>.  2 pieces of fluffy <mark>French Toast</mark> with pecan maple syrup, whole pecans and a cooked banana sliced in half lengthwise.  amazing.  possibly the best <mark>French Toast</mark> i've had.  maybe not the best thing to eat before having to drive 5 hours since i just wanted to sleep afterwards, but worth it nonetheless.  \n\na couple of interesting dishes on the brunch menu are the \"<mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark>\", which is a 24 ounce budweiser with a side of bacon and the chicken and waffles, which unfortunately didn't look as good as chicken and waffles from roscoe's in la, but did include a full piece of bacon cooked into each waffle.\n\nthe atmosphere was very cool, kind of hip and kind of country, and the service was adequate.  the prices were reasonable, given that you get big plates of food.  i think our bill for 4 people came out to around $80 or so.  in addition to the great food, they were playing a very interesting mix of music.  from rem to notorious b.i.g. to sting to the beatles to gwen stefani to justin timberlake to elvis costello.  something for everyone i guess, but thankfully no country music.",

(comes with 2 olives stuffed w/jalepenos, a pickle and a green bean.)\n\nnot sure if it's because they just aired the man vs food episode of this place or not, but it was hella crowded.  an hour wait on a sunday at 11am (but not to worry....have a bloody mary at the bar while you wait).  then another 30-45mins wait for the food.  at least the waitress warned us after taking our order, so that's good.\n\nthe menu scared me, so i ordered a simple scramble.  typical eggs scrambled with ham, spinach and cheese.  nothing special.  the banana <mark>French Toast</mark> though.....fantastic!  about all the other food, check out the pics by the other yelpers.\n\nmassive portions at not-massive prices.  brunch for 6 was only $110 after tax+tip.",

            "it's ok for the prices you pay.  there's a ton of food, but some of it is hit or miss.  service is spotty, iced tea was very weak for the first round, better the second round.  <mark>French Toast</mark> was a bit soggy, <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> a little bland, eggs were eggs (can't really mess that up).  don't know if i'd go out of my way to go back and it's not like i'm 'in the area' of sahara and rainbow purposely to just 'swing by'.", 
            "we love our las vegas friends who were so kind to introduce us to hhagg.  we will eat here anytime we're in vegas and introduce others to this place as well.  fair warning though, bring your appetite!  the portions here are huge, feel free to share but you may not want to as this food rocks!  we love stopping in here for breakfast.  i highly recommend <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> with either the banana and brown sugar pancake or the <mark>French Toast</mark>.  simply to die for.  a friend of ours ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles and was in heaven saying it was better than roscoe's chicken and waffles.  her bf ordered <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> cheeseburger and loved every bite he could handle.  it's massive and fed 3 people.\n\nthis place does get packed so the earlier you eat the easier it is to get in.  a definite must if you're a foodie.",

            "5 stars automatically for great food, and staying open past the closing time! my group barely made it at their closing time, but the place was still hustling and bustling like it will be open for awhile. great!\n\nwe were promptly seated with menus. the restaurant was really interesting and the atmosphere was great. my boyfriend and i ordered their famous kiwi watermelon lemonade and our friend ordered the strawberry lemonade margarita.\n\nsince it says on the menu that the food might take a bit of time, we were anticipating the wait of our food. my boyfriend and i shared the chicken & waffles and biscuit & gravy side with our friend getting <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> with <mark>French Toast</mark>. servers kept coming back to inform us of the wait times without us asking, which was good.\n\nas our food arrived, we looked in awe at the presentation of the food. they were plated nicely for such humble food. as i took the first bite into the chicken, i knew that it was probably one of the best things i have eaten... in my life! yes a bold statement, but i believe this is true.\n\nso overall, we were incredibly satisfied and my boyfriend and i will be coming back again next time we're in vegas (probably every month or so). our friend who went with us lives in vegas and has already gone back!", 
            "not that this place needs any more glowing reviews, but what an experience!  i admit, the hype is why i came, but hash house did not disappoint.  \n\nparty of 4 on a saturday (late) morning.  we waited less than 30 minutes for a seat.  the patio area was refreshing and sunny.  our waitress was helpful with recommendations and any questions that we had.  \n\nour drinks came first.  i had the mint latte, which had a splash of mint.  it tasted really good with the actual mint leaf. \n\nwhen the actual food came out, our table went absolutely silent.  gigantic portions.  and so pretty (i'll post pictures).  i tried to put a fork or knife in the pictures for porportion, but the flatware is on the large-side, too!  i had the <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> benedict.  the dish was a little overwhelmingly salmon-y, but i liked <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> of the other ingredients.  my bf had the banana walnut <mark>French Toast</mark>.  the toast was a least an inch thick and surprisingly filling for how fluffy the texture was.  the other couple with us had the quesadilla and the bacon burger.  i had a bite of the burger and it was one of the tastiest burgers i've ever had.  the quesadilla was mild.\n\nthe prices are on the high side for a breakfast place, but i don't think you can even compare, since the servings are so big.  \n\ni did try to use a restaurant.com coupon, but i didn't read that the stupid thing said \"dinner only\".  waitress wouldn't take it, but it sounds like if it wasn't a weekend morning, she might have.  \n\neither way, i enjoyed myself and i will be back.", 
            "come for breakfast items, but stay away from potato dishes (bland). stick with the pancakes, waffles, <mark>French Toast</mark> or try the <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> benedict. the pork is also tasty at dinner.\n\nbring your appetite!",

            "this place has ridiculously huge portions!  my advice is if you cannot eat a huge plate, share, share, share or just bring it home so you can leftovers for days.  it is, gluttony at its best.  \n\nanna l. and i split <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with fresh spinach, tomatoes, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream, and scrambled eggs.  apparently, this dish is a fave of adam from man vs. food.  the dish was really good especially the chipotle cream.  it gave a nice spiciness to the dish.  the only downside...the chicken was lukewarm and not hot.  \n\nother dishes that we ordered were the chicken and waffles, banana <mark>French Toast</mark> (if i were craving sweets, that is probably what i would order), and <mark>Corned Beef</mark> and hash.  the drinks are delish esp. the watermelon lemonade cooler and mint mocha.  \n\ngood prices, clean restaurant, good food, and great service makes jen a happy chica!",

            "while we were disappointed we trekked all the way out here ($15 cab from strip) and it wasn't a strip joint meets amsterdam coffee house, the brunch was memorable.\n\nwe ordered a <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict and a banana cinnamon <mark>French Toast</mark>.  my friend had seen a man vs. food episode here so we were expecting the dishes to be on the large side.  we revised those portion estimates upward when we saw a flap jack the size of a small pizza go by our table.\n\nthe <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict was massive and interesting to say the least.  they've taken a lot of liberties in calling this an eggs benedict.  the eggs are scrambled instead of poached.  the hollandaise sauce is replaced with a delicious chipotle cream sauce.  the english muffin is replaced with a massive (and fairly tasteless) biscuit.  \n\nthe <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> (perhaps 2-3 pieces worth) under this heap of toppings was delicious.  also loved the garlic potatoes and apple-<mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark> that was in there.  the eggs were just so-so but at least they made it feel like brunch instead of some gluttonous hangover binge.\n\nthe <mark>French Toast</mark> was just so-so.  it's huge but size doesn't help when you order something that sweet.  i wouldn't recommend it.\n\nthe wait on a saturday morning was 45 minutes.  pretty impressive (and annoying) given that it's not on the strip.\n\nnot sure i'd make the trek out here again but it was worth a one-time visit.",

            "i absolutely loved this place!  i'm actually have withdrawals!  my husband got the andy <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> and i got the <mark>French Toast</mark> and they were both amazing!!  huge portions especially for kids.  my kids could've split a children's breakfast.  they also had freshly squeezed orange juice.  the prices were well priced for the amount they give you but if you're not interested in paying more than $15 for a plate or $5 for a tall glass of real oj than it's not for you!  :)", 
            "huge portions? how about delusions of grander; delusions that the food is unique and good for starters. this place is a con job from beginning to end. they serve the food in over sized plates and stack the meat on top of the <mark>French Toast</mark> and people seem to think they are getting something worthwhile. its beyond lame. my friend ordered a \"sirloin\" and when it arrived it was about 1/4 cup of meat and the rest cheese and undercooked potatoes. the pancakes were tough and the wait was insane. $46.00 for breakfast food, long waits and a broken bathroom. sticking a twig of rosemary on the food does not make it gourmet, just goofy. maybe if you have never had really good \"farm\" food, you will enjoy. otherwise, do not believe the hype. its bizzaro world in this place.", 
            "after seeing a review of hash house a go go, aka twisted farm food, on the travel channel, my husband and i knew that we had to pay this place a visit on our next trip to vegas.\nwe chose the sahara location as we wanted a more \"mom&pop\" experience as opposed to dining in a casino ( additional location in the imperial palace). we had a wait of about 45 minutes on a sunday afternoon and was treated very nicely by the host staff.\nonce seated, we were amazed at the platters that were coming out of the kitchen! everyone was taking pics of their food and people watching is the state of the atmosphere, so if you're bothered by people looking at you and your food, this may not be the place for you. sometimes, people will even take pics of another table's food, it's that amazing!!!\nother reviewers have stated that the portion sizes are embarrassing, but, hey! that's why we came here...for something different, memorable, a little bit crazy!!! if i want run of the mill, i'd go to denny's ... (boo)\n\ni had originally ordered a soda but quickly added a s'mores latte when my \"neighbor\" at the next table had their's delivered...yummy over-sized chocolate latte teeming with roasted marshmallow topping and chocolate drizzle...add some graham crackers to dip and it's practically breakfast in it's own right!!!\nmy husband ordered the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> while i ordered the <mark>French Toast</mark>. the <mark>French Toast</mark> is dipped in a banana creme batter and is served up with a griddled banana. the dish was tasty and filling, but i admit i was a bit envious of my hubby's platter which was overflowing with the most flavorful and juicy chicken dish i have ever had...i wish i would have talked him out of more than the few bites that i did...it was so good!\nwe have another location in socal and will plan a visit there soon with friends...the prices are a bit steep, but you get plenty for the price!!!", 
            "next time i visit hash house, i will make sure i will be in town that night, so that i may nap after eating and drinking my brunch. \nthis location is off the strip, with easy access parking and really good coffee! most diners have so-so coffee, but hash house a go go serves lavaza drip coffee and espresso drinks, with alcohol added, if you so desire. everything ordered was yummy. my friend ordered <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> with <mark>French Toast</mark>. i generally despise banana toppings, but enjoyed the sliced fried bananas on top, which i have named \"better than bananas.\"  the best parts of my <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> were the crispy fried <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, and the chipotle hollandaise sauce. mixed together, they were better than bacon! (and i reeeeally love bacon!) i am not a big fan of <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, so while i did appreciate the quality of hash house's chicken, i would recommend a different benedict dish for non chicken lovers. \na couple friends shared tales of long waits and mediocre service at the imperial palace location, however, we received excellent service with no wait at this location...around noon.  i shall return!", 
            "this place is just insane.  i should end my review here.  but then, i'd be a bad yelper.  let me explain.\n\nthere is this obsession with quantity in our culture, and hash house is the epitome of this obsession.  i was awe struck by the mountains of cooked flesh and grease that was being served all around me.  people were taking pictures of their food (no doubt to post on yelp).  as i waited for my <mark>French Toast</mark>, i wondered how much of this stuff people cram into their bodies every day.\n\ndon't get me wrong, i'm not a health nut.  i could care less really, but even i have my limits.  my <mark>French Toast</mark> with bananas on it tasted awesome for the first few bites.  however, after chewing on this thing for a while, i got bored.  that's right... as big and overblown as the food in this place is, i got bored of eating it.  and this, my friends, is the failing of hash house a go go. :-)", 
            "really good breakfast.  not sure why it has some bad reviews from people, because the 2 dishes my wife and i got were really good.  i had the banana <mark>French Toast</mark> (will order with extra syrup on the side next time) and the meatloaf hash with eggs.  both were good and huge.  we also got an orange crush champagne spritzer, which was good despite the fact that it sounds strange.  i would also try the bloody mary's next time since it looked like they made their own mix and everybody was ordering them.", 
            "too much hype for me. my sister has been in las vegas for over a year and we have talked about going her several times, on this last visit we made it.\n\nthe place was packed and we waited about 20 minutes for the table that was empty when we got there. (that always makes me crazy!)\n\nwaitress had room for improvment, but the bus boys more than made up for her.\n\ni had corn beef hash, of course and it was good. it defiantly had some twists, like cheese and the corn beef was definaly not chopped up much. my favorite was the busicut, so yummy and fresh.\n\nmy sister had the hamburger, it was huge. she said it was good but not as fabulous as everyone says it is. \n\nher boyfriend had <mark>French Toast</mark>, i had a bite it was good. crunchy on the outside and warm and soft inside. very good.\n\noverall it is an experience but might have had a 4 or 5 star experience at a less busy time.\n\noh and do not forget the bloody mary, it was great and chunky.", 
            "i agree with the reviews that think this place is totally overrated. having seen the san diego version on the food network and hearing rave reviews from friends, i decided to finally give hash house a-go-go on sahara a try to have breakfast with my sister and her two little boys. if you are looking for a brunch place on saturday where you can actually hear the person sitting next to you, not the place to go. \n\nfirst, being 10:30am on a saturday, there was a 30 minute wait for first available (inside or outside). there's minimal spots to sit inside so we had to wait out in the chill. when finally seated inside, a dj was blasting lady gaga so loud, i couldn't hear what my five year old nephew sitting right next to me wanted to order. this \"club-esque\" music lasted most of the breakfast and was a very irritating. maybe i missed the \"saturday brunch party\" memo.\n\ni split a decent $8.50 bloody mary with my sister that came with a green bean, stuffed olive, and sweet pickle. i ordered what i thought was the \"warsaw hash\" which was a brunch special they had for $10.95. after waiting 25 minutes for our food, the portion was pretty sizeable and i ended up taking half of it home. the quality, however, was a little bland. there were big chunks of ground turkey and pieces of bacon and melted cheese on potatoes. nothing amazing. i did try my nephew's cinnamon <mark>French Toast</mark> and that was pretty yummy.\n\noverall i found the place a mix of hipsters, hipster wannabes, and trendy yuppies looking for a place \"cool\" to eat at. the wait was long to sit, get our food, and get boxes and have the check paid. it took us an hour and fifty minutes to eat and get out. definitely not a place for a relaxing breakfast.", 
            "we heard about this place on man vs food.\n\nthe portions were, as promised, huge. i had <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark>, brown sugar pecans, banana <mark>French Toast</mark>. it was spectacular.\n\ni'm looking forward to going back to have the chicken fried steak and eggs which i have also heard is awesome.", 
            "huge portions, friendly staff, solid food and a decent bloody mary at a reasonable price.\n\nwe have been many times and tried many things.  if you are going for brunch, expect to wait.  as for food, we have tried pretty much everything and the best dish is likely the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>.  the hash plates are solid and (being i like sweet breakfast) the <mark>French Toast</mark> and pancakes are also good.\n\ngo to hash house a gogo for a large breakfast with a large bloody mary and expect to pay a very reasonable bill when you're done.  is it the best breakfast ever?  no.  but you would have a hard time finding a better all around breakfast deal and if you go in with the right expectations, i'd be surprised if you didn't enjoy the meal.",

            "this place is actually really good!\n\nwent here once with my girlfriend awhile back.  we both mistakenly ordered two of the scrambles that were on the specials menu.  we were not impressed at all..  i'm glad we gave it a second chance..\n\nwe ordered two items and split them.  \n\nthe first was the <mark>French Toast</mark>.  it was delicious!  there was nothing simple about this dish.  it is dipped in a banana cream batter.  and topped with fried bananas.  if you don't like bananas, avoid this.  they put the maple syrup on prior to serving, which is fine because it would just make the <mark>French Toast</mark> soggy.  the banana batter helps to keep the <mark>French Toast</mark> from being dry.  \n\nwe also ordered the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>.  this was great as well.  it's a little messy, but every ingredient was good.  i did not see anything spectacular about the fried part of the chicken.  not much seasoning in the batter.  but the chicken itself was moist and flavorful.  i would prefer other egg options than just scrambled in this dish.\n\noverall, the food we ordered was great!  and surprisingly, we ate most of these large portions.  the service was also good for us.  \n\nwe will definitely go back to try other dishes!",

            "2 words you must know: huge portions\n\nif you're on a diet, you better order a plate to share with 3 other people.  the plates here can definitely feed 2, if not 3 or 4 people.  \n\nmy favorite thing to order here is the griddled <mark>French Toast</mark>.  they are 4 huge slices on this dish and it comes with fried plantin bananas.  they already add the syrup for you and they actually put a good amount.  of course they offer extra syrup and butter for your taste.  my cousins ordered the chicken eggs benedict, and the bbblt (bacon bacon bacon lettuce tomato sandwhich).  again, portions huge!  \n\nwe were actually able to order all different things and share family style.  i think that's cool.  all the food was yummy! the benedict biscuit bread was a tad bit thick so it kind of took away flavor from all the other stacks on top of it.  i hate when i can't taste the egg!  this is definitely the place to take someone who loves to eat breakfast or brunch.  entertain them with the huge plates!\n\nyelp challenge! started 8/20/2011 (59/365).",

            "disappointing! with all the rave review we expected better, much better! yes their portions are big but so are the prices. you can get better quality food at other brunch spots for cheaper. here's a breakdown of our 1st visit:\natmosphere is always crowded & loud! very loud! they pump up the music so loud that the hostess had to yell at the top of her lungs for parties and if you're seated near her it's all you hear throughout your meal. it ridiculous! turn the music down a little and people will be able to hear the host and have a nice conversation without yelling over the music!\nfood, hubby ordered his usual <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash and let me tell u, don't order it if you're a <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash lover! with the name hash house you'd expect their hash to be awesome. but it was just pieces of shredded fresh <mark>Corned Beef</mark> on top of seasoned potatoes, topped w/ shredded cheese & green onions. it's not even \"hashed\" together! they serve it with a lame dry biscuit and a piece of watermelon & strawberry. i ordered their popular menu item, banana <mark>French Toast</mark>. now this dish was good and had 3 big thick slices topped with cooked banana. this is the only reason they get 1star. \nso for both dishes & 2 drinks bill was $40 w/tip. never coming here again, so not worth the $ or the crowd u have to deal with.", 
            "breakfast orgy!  those are the words i use to describe this place to my friends and family...at least the ones that are ok with the word orgy.  i made my first trip here 3 years ago after seeing the man vs food episode and now it is an absolute must on every vegas trip.  i was there for the week of the 4th and hit it up on the 4th...and the 6th.  <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> is my go to when i have to split with my wife.  when the shackles come off and i can order whatever i want, there's no telling what i'll get.  i'll list a few that i've had:\n\nchicken and waffles: share this.  it's two big pieces of chicken paired with waffles that have bacon baked into them.  i've never come close to finishing but wished i could.\n\nblackberry granola pancake: i was embracing my inner tree hugger and it was delicious.  the berries explode all over the pancake with patches of granola baked right in.  if you like those flavors, get this into your mouth asap.\n\n<mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash: order this if you like actual <mark>Corned Beef</mark> and not <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> food that comes in the hormel can.  it's served in strips, almost shredded, in a skillet with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and a buscuit.  coulda been something i'm missing, but it's all about the <mark>Corned Beef</mark>.  \n\nbanana pecan french toas: take a big ass banana, split it down the middle and cook that bad boy up.  now pair it with some of the best <mark>French Toast</mark> you've had with pecans also invited to the party in your mouth.  if you want some serious sweet for breffas, do this.\n\ndrinks- i've been wanting to order drinks for a while now.  i always fixate on the food and skip the exotic drink menu. not this last time though.\n\nsmores mocha: are you f'n kidding me?  first it comes in an oversized mug (surprise). it's a mocha which marshmallow fluff on top that's browned and then garnished with two pieces of graham cracker.  it's very sweet, so i'm not sure if it's an option, but an extra shot would probably be the only recommendation i could give to make this any better.\n\ncaramel mocha (?)- not sure of the name, but it comes in a tall glass that makes it look like a shake because it's topped with a bunch of whipped cream which is toped with drizzled caramel and chocolate.  like the above drink, very tasty, but very sweet.  i like my coffee strong, so i'd add an extra shot next time if possible.\n\ni believe there are at least 4 locations in vegas, the m, the plaza, the imperial palace and this one.  i like this one because it's a free standing building well off the strip, so i avoid a little of the vegas madness.  it gets packed pretty early.  if you think you're going to sleep till 9 and show up and get a table at 10 like every other lazy ass, you're mistaken.  you need to commit to breakfast, wake up early and show up as close to opening (i believe it's 7:30am) as possible.\n\nif you go to vegas and don't eat breakfast here, you're doing it wrong.",

            "this review is for the restaurant as a whole and not specifically this location. my friends and i were in town for a birthday and on the way back to california, we decided to stop by at the hash house a gogo that was at the m resort. i've always wanted to try this place due to the fact that i'm an avid man vs. food watcher. \n\nthe food: the portions are fairly big so i would recommend sharing unless you've got a big appetite and know you are able to consume that much food. i sure wish i had shared my dish with some else. \nwhat we ordered (all very good dishes btw cause we tried each others dish): \n - farm benedict: <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> w/ fresh asparagus, sundried tomatoes, chili cream and two basted eggs\n - the basic: <mark>Two Egg Breakfast Any Style</mark>, potatoes, fruit and biscuit (add bacon, sausage or ham)\n - <mark>French Toast</mark>: griddled <mark>French Toast</mark> dipped in banana cinnamon cream w/ pecan maple syrup\n - <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> & biscuit \n - famous one pound stuffed burger: <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, avocado & cheddar\n\ni thought that the food was pretty rich in the sauces and quite heavy. i'm not much of a breakfast eater but i did enjoy my meal here. although i did have to take a good amount of it to go. \n\nprices: each dish is about 15 dollars ( unless you get the basic breakfast/brunch dishes, which are about 9 dollars) it isn't too bad as compared to the rest of the prices from restaurants on the strip in vegas.  \n\nservice: i have to rate the service at the m resort location to be a 2.5. our server/waiter was one of those who you could just tell hated his job and as a result it showed in his performance and the service that was provide to my party of 8 was not that great. he even dropped a fork on my friend as he was clearing the table and said \"shit man i'm sorry\" in my opinion, that is very unprofessional. from my work experience i know the importance of excellent customer service and i definitely did not feel it here. but the food was pretty good and i was in good company so i was willing to over look that slight annoyance \n\noverall. i recommend you all to try it at least once. :) check out the photos i posted too to see the dishes that my table ordered!",

            "this review is primarily focused on the service. came to this location last sunday for brunch. it was very busy considering that it was around 1:30 pm. this is the only hash house that is located in a single standing building. the others are within hotels/casinos.  the wait took about 40 minutes for a table for 4. our waitress, erin, had a very flat affect straight from the start. she wasn't very friendly nor helpful.  i asked her if the couples could split the bill and she said it would be fine. we ordered our entrees, which consisted of the sun dried tomatoes, basil and <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark> farm scrambles, buttermilk flapjacks and the <mark>French Toast</mark>. all were very tasty and had good portions. one <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> to the food was the amount of syrup they gave with the <mark>French Toast</mark> and flapjacks. they gave a tiny shot glass worth of syrup for each dish. we had to ask for extra syrup about 3 times because these dishes needed the syrup. so when the bill comes, it had not been split, so i quickly reminded her to split the bill. i was going to mention which dishes on the credit cards but she replied \"i know what dishes you guys got\" in a very rude tone. yeeesh. she looked at my boyfriend and asked which card was his. he told her his name. the other couple's card had his picture on it. so when she returns with the split bills, she still managed to screw everything up and mix up the items with the cards. at this point, i was quite frustrated so i went back to look for her and just told her what had happened. she apologized but it honestly didn't seem like she cared.  we wanted to leave so we just signed the bills without changing them and left. \n\nthis experience left a sour taste in my mouth. the service at the other hash houses are pretty good. not sure if i want to go to this location again.", 
            "the name sure will grab your attention: hash house a go-go. doesn't that sound like it's a mess, a jumble, a hodgepodge, or chop-chops, or a dance of unlimited jiggering? nevertheless, it's beckoning that my mom and i frequented this place twice. it's got ample parking. a wait in line to be seated. not a large restaurant but it has a small bar and dining room with silver metal decor. relaxed atmosphere. service is attentive. a second visit was with mom again with friends and some other friends on an occasion during a happy hour for my birthday celebration followed by dinner. plenty of hors d'ouevres passed around. mom loved the shrimp in a stick because they were large shrimps, they were prawns! well of course, i couldn't be any happier but just munching on the many finger foods which to my delight had just the right amount of tastiness. afraid to fill myself up in so much of the appetizers i had to stop from sampling any more to make room for dinner since i have heard from friends was to make room in tummy-tum-tum for the main meals. i heeded, for when our dinner was set on the table, we couldn't help but admire the presentation and the generous portions. one meal can be shared by two or three people. not disappointing at all was the taste. breakfast favorites are: <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> with maple reduction served with 2 eggs, bacon, <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> & biscuit which the smell of sage gives it the extra invitation to deliciousness, and the griddled <mark>French Toast</mark> dipped in banana cinnamon cream with pecan maple syrup was just the right amount of moistness and sweetness. by the way, the bread is amish bread, oh goood. anything that's southern cooking to me is a favorite and those two are my breakfast favorites. wouldn't say no to chocolate chip flapjack with banana and pecans which the chef specially made. he specifically made it and personally served it to us. the chef was personable. the flapjack were thick, soft and goooey with melting chocolate just like ooheey-goooey cheese in a pizza. i like their lemonade and the sweetened iced tea beverages. dinner favorites: andy's stuffed burger is roasted mid-west beef patties topped with smoked mozzarella & charred tomato, stacked high in large buns served with criss-cross fries. the right amount of \"seaside\" taste in the manila clams drenched in white wine garlic broth mixed with caramelized onions and sprinkling of crushed red pepper. say, yummy clams. never to say no but say yes to <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> tower which was served with fried leeks drizzled with hot maple reduction. the waffles were just the right crispiness, and the chicken moist. the black skillet pork ribs served pipin' hot in a black skillet pipin' hot were in its rib-y juiciness to the bites. so they say it's \"twisted farm food\", twisted enough to twist my tasteful memory of it as country food super-sized! a feast to the eyes. get on it with your big big bites!", 
            "the food is tasty and the portions are ridiculously huge.  the griddled <mark>French Toast</mark> was very good, amish style bread dipped in banana cinnamon cream with pecan maple syrup.  the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was delicious, with maple reduction, eggs, bacon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, and a biscuit.  the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> with scrambled <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> was gigantic.  overall, food was very good.", 
            "the food is soooo good at hash house- whenever i have guests in town this is the first stop! plus, this is a pretty popular place so there may have a short wait but its so worth it !! the food is huge- quite literally, 1 plate could feed 2-3 people. so, what i would suggest is order a few things with your group and share! my favorite dish is the grilled <mark>French Toast</mark> and my hubby loves the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>!", 
            "multiple times i have been to this hashhouse and each and every time these people are filled with awesomeness.  waiters/waitresses on point, friendly and attentive.  it seems as though everyone takes pride in customer service.  if i don't see my waitress/waiter i don't even have to ask for them.   a different waiter/waitress from a separate section may notice my coffee is low and offer me more.  great teamwork!!  today i had <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> with vanilla waffles.  a++  we also had chocolate chip pancakes, <mark>French Toast</mark>, and the chicken and waffles.  the survey from everyone was a+++", 
            "okay, so i guess i should start by saying that we came for breakfast, first time trying their breakfast menu. they had tons of yummy sounding options, but i settled on a blueberry pecan pancake, over medium eggs, and bacon. my boyfriend got the <mark>French Toast</mark>.\n\nhis <mark>French Toast</mark> sounded soo good on the menu description, and when it was served, it looked fantastic, except for the griddled bananas (served in the peel, which was black and mushy, tasted good but very unappealing looking) his <mark>French Toast</mark> tasted like nothing, and was mushy and in general, just kind of blah.\n\nmy pancake was huge, and yummy, but my over medium eggs were basically raw, i mean the yolks were super runny (which is fine, i never, ever send food back) i was going to eat them until i noticed that the whites werent even cooked, i mean, runny whites on an over medium egg? yuck! i asked the waitress for new ones and she obliged saying, \"oh sure, you might want more of an over medium.\" um, yeah cause that's what i ordered. she brings the eggs back out and clearly the cook was annoyed that they got sent back, because he cooked the crap out of these eggs, i mean, they were beyond well done. whatever, i mean the pancake was so huge i didn't even need the eggs at that point.\n\nfast forward to them picking up the bill, i was paying by credit, they took the card, and then a different person came back and asked for id, which i accidentally left at home. (if its your policy to get id for credit cards, that's fine, but maybe ask for the identification before you run the card?) i explained i didn't have it and instead of offering another option he glared at me and asked if it was really my card. i mean, come on. i said that yes it is my card and he just mumbled something under his breath and walked off! we had cash, and would have paid in cash! to top it off we had to wait another few minutes for them to bring me a pen so i could sign the receipt.  really? i wanted to love this place, again the menu for breakfast is really enticing. but our general experience was way off.\n\nall in all, i've eaten here a few times (other times for dinner) and in general, they definitely wow you with portion sizes but they lack actual flavor. they describe their food as midwestern farm food with a twist. after eating here a handful of times i'm convinced the twist is the portion size and the giant sprig of rosemary they serve with everything.", 
            "best. <mark>French Toast</mark>. ever. it's big, it's thick, and it's topped with banana-cinnamon-pecan-maple-creamy goodness. it was so delicious paired with their crispy, <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>. i can't say enough about it. it was one of the best breakfasts i ever had.", 
            "best breakfast in vegas and the long lines prove it. pancakes are super huge and delicious.  banana <mark>French Toast</mark> is the bomb... definitely a must go if your close by.", 
            "everything from scratch and very fresh. you cannot go wrong here...\n\nthe <mark>French Toast</mark> and <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with waffles were awesome. we also had the best freshest oj ever. waitress was great with awesome personality and attentive. great job folks.", 
            "the comes out large, be ready eat, eat and eat. one great thing is, the good is amazingly delicious. had the biscuits and gravy. wow! that was good. this is a must eat. \n\none of other who company me ordered the grill <mark>French Toast</mark>. i took a small bite and there are no words to explain how good it tasted.", 
            "been wanting to go here since man vs. food episode on them   decided to test them with dish i could get elsewhere - <mark>French Toast</mark>.  dry, bland, and way overpriced.  ihop does it tastier and cheaper.  and ihop offers military discount which hhgg doesn't.", 
            "this place is the very definition of a gut-buster. \n\nportions are so huge, it's ridiculous. there's no way you'll be able to finish everything on your plate, unless you stick with a side of toast. even then, you'll probably end up with an entire loaf. i was drawn here because of man v. food, and ended up ordering the dish that adam made famous: it's advertised as a \"farm benedict,\" but what benedict have you ever seen that included a mound of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>? in addition to <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, fresh spinach, <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs? this thing isn't a benedict, it's a house! a very tasty house, as it turns out, but still. i have a pretty good appetite, but was finished only halfway through. my wife ordered the riddled <mark>French Toast</mark> dipped in banana cinnamon cream w/ pecan maple syrup, and lest you think her portion was any smaller, you'd be wrong. like i said, this place thrives on excess! the <mark>French Toast</mark> was chewy and delicious, with a hint of vanilla, and the warm bananas were a divine accompaniment. it all paired perfectly well with smoky bacon. again though, it was impossible to finish more than half. because we were on the road, this sadly meant wasting some of that delicious food, as there wasn't really an opportunity to eat the leftovers later. \n\nyou've gotta love a place that sells a hangover dish called <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark>: a 24 oz budweiser in a bag with a side of bacon.\n\nclassy? nope. but fun? absolutely. \n\nno matter how hungry you are, you will leave hash house a go go stuffed to the gills, vowing never to eat another bite of food again for the rest of your life. \n\nand the next morning, you'll be yearning for a return visit...", 
            "hash house a go go was better last time.  i guess they gotten more popular that it's not the same. super busy today... they even charge for extra sauce unlike before it was free. food was okay. some food was dry... like the chicken and <mark>French Toast</mark>. doesn't have good flavor. fruit was over ripe... didn't get our water refill... wouldn't recommend when there a lot of people waiting around...", 
            "so i've been here a few times but was never inclined to write a review until now. i must say i was absolutely amazed by the service. our server was a cute bubbly girl named merisa. she was really friendly and gave super speedy service. also my brother had a small complaint about his cocktail not being strong enough and she immediately grabbed it and had the bar tender make it a little bit stronger with no questions asked! it was great how easily she took care of it. thanks merisa! \nso on to the food, i got a hash with mushrooms, spinach, sun dried tomatoes, and artichokes. to be honest it was a bit bland until i poured the yolk from my eggs on it. then it was perfect! the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit. my brother got <mark>French Toast</mark> which came with caramelized bananas on top. he absolutely loved them! i couldn't believe he finished it all. the portion sizes were huge haha. i'll definitely be back and i'll probably ask for merisa next time.", 
            "short: sub-par food in large proportions dressed up for no reason with a loud atmosphere. \n\nvisited this place with a friend after we've been curious of it after a long time. disappointed, big time. food was decent, service was decent, place the decent, atmosphere was loud. \ni ordered some chorizo hash, and my friend had <mark>French Toast</mark>. the hash had deep-friend potatoes (probably from frozen), with some sauce and cheese on top. the chorizo was the soft type that just turned into liquid after it was cooked so there was only a few chunks left. it was alright, not mind blowing.\nmy friend's <mark>French Toast</mark> was worse. it was made of thick slabs of bread (good, right?) that had barely touched egg before they were fried--it was pretty much bread with a egg coating on the outside. if you didn't know: <mark>French Toast</mark> is bread soaked in egg, and fried. but this was barely touched, so it was like eating hot bread rather than eggy goodness. the toppings were a bit bland as well.\n\nbottom line: if you want to go to a place that puts more priority on decorating, than actually making your food taste good, go here. big proportions that don't need to be that big, dressed up for no reason, decent food.\n\nnext time, we're probably going to head to ihop or denny's. same food quality, better service, cheaper, and they don't play with our food.", 
            "we used to go to hash house for breakfast all of the time.  we loved their <mark>French Toast</mark> and gigantic waffle.  however, in the last two months, we have stopped going as the last 3 times we went, the meat and eggs were entirely too greasy for some reason and the waffle was doughy (not cooked enough) and my <mark>French Toast</mark> was burned.  it takes an incredibly long time to get food re-done and honestly, i have to evaluate if the value is there as the breakfasts are pricey.  i don't need a ton of food, just good quality of food as they used to have.  i gave them three stars as everyone should try them once, and my hope is they return to quality as then i will gladly return to the restaurant.  until then, so many other places to have breakfast in vegas for far less $. we also tried them for dinner to see if there was a difference with the kitchen perhaps but nope, over salted food and my now my bacon and <mark>French Toast</mark> were both burned....twenty minutes later, still chasing the server to check on our food.......dropping another star on this review soon.......", 
            "when i am not dieting or when we have out-of-town visitors, we always bring them to hash house a go go.  this place is the perfect place to go to for brunch or lunch.  its always busy but i never had to wait for more than 20 minutes.\n\nbasically, everything is good and there's  a lot of food!  my favorites are:\n\n- chicken and waffles (good white meat)\n- <mark>French Toast</mark>\n- sounds ridiculous, but the coffee is solid here.", 
            "at the suggestion of some local friends we went to breakfast at hash house a go go and it was as advertised.  very large portions of very good food.  the bacon was thick, eggs cooked perfectly to order and my <mark>French Toast</mark> was to die for.  i highly recommend this place.  the only rub is that it is busy so be prepared to wait.", 
            "all i have to say is wow!! hash house a go go went way beyond my expectations. the serving portions are huge. the food is excellent and the service was great. \n\nwe got there about noon and it was packed but still only waited 5 minutes for a table. we both ordered the caramel mocha latte which was to die for although i only drank half of it because it comes with 2 extra toast shots of espresso. i ordered the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & Waffles</mark> and my girlfriend ordered the banana cinnamon <mark>French Toast</mark>. they were both absolutely to die for. \n\nthis is a must for any local or tourist. they have a wide variety of things on the menu and they're not overly expensive. i would definitely give it an 8 out of 10.",

            "terrible service, the waiter forgot all of our side plates and all he said was \"i had a lot of shit going on\".  their <mark>French Toast</mark> were also soggy.  they did bring one side (bacon) which they just tossed at our table and the bacon fell off the dish.",

            "was really looking forward to eating here but left disappointed.   server, victor, was great but avoid any scrambled egg combinations.  sent back twice because they were cold.  on the positive side, biscuits were flaky and delicious and the shredded <mark>Corned Beef</mark>  tasty. i will try the famous <mark>French Toast</mark> next time.",

            "i was so bummed that i couldn't order the chicken and waffles i wanted....only because i wasn't feeling well. i didn't want to miss my chance at eating here so, i tagged along anyways. i had the <mark>Hot Sticky Granola</mark>. it was really good. if, that's your thing. it's not what i would normally order but it was delicious. my hubby got a combo breakfast and really liked his food. my sister susan has been here several times and always orders a <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>. she loves it. i thought it was just ok. my sister karen didn't really care for this place. she wanted to go down the street to our usual spot the egg and i. but, she ordered the chicken and waffles and said she really didn't like it. but, everyone else loved it. you have to be really prepared to wait or just get there right when they open."

            "as soon as we arrived in vegas we headed for the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>.  this is a very chill but popular place.  the servings are huge, and the pancake (yes you get 1) is bigger than your head.  its not the worlds best breakfast food, but its better than your local ihop.  the menu choices can sound a little \"out there\" so have an open mind once you get there.  to me, most of the choices were too eclectic, but the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> was good. if you are in vegas for breakfast or brunch, its worth taking a visit.  i know i would give it another go around.", 
            "all breakfasts should be this rock-n-roll!\n\njude and my eyes were definitely bigger than our stomachs, but do we care?  hells no.  bring on the carbs!\n\nwe shared their griddled <mark>French Toast</mark> *and* <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>.\n\nin addition, j had sausage gravy with biscuits.  i tackled their <mark>HH Famous Meatloaf</mark> hash - with roasted red peppers, fresh spinach, and smoked mozzarella.  it was a brekkie explosion in our booth.\n\nwhen all is said and done, we end up with massive leftovers.  the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> was good, but not great.  the <mark>French Toast</mark> won out.  this menu has to be one of the best i've seen in a very long time.\n\nnote:  i've been to the san diego outpost, and it was nice to have a decent waiting area and spacious dining room.  made the experience that much better.", 
            "i saw rachael ray go and visit this place on her best of vegas show and not the $40 a day show.  i was intrigued with how cool the place seemed overall but a bit apprehensive since she has steered me down the wrong path once.  at this place, they offered a bunch of typical breakfast fare with a sort of a modern fusion twist.  that is the best that i can describe it.  be prepared, the portions are huge!  i like to think that i have a hearty appetite, but this is enough to share for two--at least for breakfast.  dinner or lunch might be a bit different.\n\nservice\nwe showed up on a monday morning and the place was hopping at 10:30.  we didn't have to wait too long before our table became readily available.  overall, the service was great and friendly.  we were checked upon often and coffee cups were always refilled.\n\nfood\nthe food was really good and impressed with how fresh things tasted.  no krusteaz costco pancake mix here!  here is a breakdown of what we ordered.\n- banana brown sugar pancake: holy moly!  they serve up a whopping huge pancake that is almost served up on a serving platter.  i would say that the pancake is about 1.5 feet in diameter.  my husband could only tear through about half of it.  the brown sugar was a nice touch as it was added to the top of the pancake and then browned to almost caramel.  oh!  they also have different flavors of pancakes, different fruits, coconut mango, snickers and more!\n- <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>: if you are a fan of the salty sweet.  this is a must try.  when i ordered it, i thought that there would be sprinkles of bacon throughout the waffle.  instead, there were actual strips which crisscrossed throughout the waffle.  fancy.\n\ntip #1: come hungry.  do not order any sides since all portions are literally super sized.\n\ntip #2: if you can, come on a weekday vs. a weekend.  this place gets ridiculously crazy busy.", 
            "definitely a must go back type of joint. i found out about this place through watching man vs food on the travel channel. i left the las vegas strip in search for this place and it didn't disappoint. \n\nlooking over the menu i couldn't decide what to get, eveything looked and sounded good. i ended up with the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> which included <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>. as i waited for my meal, i saw other people's orders and was surprised at the huge portions and how the presentation was amazing. as my plate arrived, i knew i was in a little over my head. the two pieces of savory <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and the 4 pieces of <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> all looked tasty. as i started the meal, i knew i made the right choice. \n\nthe service was friendly and prompt also. i'll be back there when i visit lv again.\n\n\nnote: i went during a weekday so there was no wait. apparently, the wait on the weekends have been around an hour for seating. so plan ahead.", 
            "i have never heard of this place before and this was definitely an unexpected, but pleasant, surprise during our vegas trip.  one of my cousins had talked us into trying out hash house because she saw a feature of it on one of rachel ray's shows on food network.  never ones to pass up an opportunity to try something new, my husband and i went with our group of 9.  \n\nright off the bat, i knew we were going to experience something special when i saw the huge portions the servers were carrying out.  think of the silver trays at chipotle and imagine that it was turned into an oval shape and made of china instead of aluminum.  that's how big these were.  our lunch companions were smart and decided to share betweens the couples but wanting to try different things, my husband and i decided to order separately.  i had the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict which was the size of my entire head and my husband ordered their famous chicken and waffles.  \n\nalthough the portions were huge, my eggs were cooked perfectly so i was assured that quality was not overlooked for quantity.  my husband's <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> were amazing.  and when i say <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>, i mean bacon that is inside the waffles which has got to win some sort of award for just existing!\n\ni'm allergic to watermelon so i wasn't able to try the watermelon lemonades but everyone raved about theirs!  if i had remembered to bring along my epipen i would sipped some but i instead enjoyed a wonderful  pineapple champagne spritzer that was sweetly refreshing after our morning hiking around hoover dam in the desert heat.\n\nhash house is just the place to go when you're in the mood for a good and satisfying meal.  just be ready for the cravings to set in once you leave las vegas like i've been having!", 
            "it was nice to get away from the bustle of the vegas strip to come try hash house a go go for brunch. the wait took around an hour for the 5 of us since it was pretty darn busy on a saturday afternoon. we just sat around and admired all the autographed menus lining the entry way. their menu had an incredible selection too! i think i would have had trouble deciding if my friend marti l. hadn't already suggested a dish that sounded delish.\n\n<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> meal ($13.95 and $2.50 extra to split the dish) - omg!! the portions were humongous! no wonder hh was featured on man vs. food before. haha the prices are totally worth it if you share the dish with one or 2 other people. my faves were the bacon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and fresh baked biscuit. the chicken didn't taste of sage at all to me and a was a little dry...there wasn't enough maple reduction but was fried to perfection! (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/g8onv26ywjlzpezdbnowuq?select=rocmimasg_k3yc-aopggpa)\n\ni sampled the kiwi/watermelon lemonade (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/g8onv26ywjlzpezdbnowuq?select=avvdot4cdksnfccsuuy5vg) which looked pretty and was really tart just the way i like it. i also tried the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> which were to die for! (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/g8onv26ywjlzpezdbnowuq?select=avvdot4cdksnfccsuuy5vg) the batter was soft/chewy and the bacon complimented it very well. the food took around 20 min to come out but it was well worth the wait! our waitress was dressed like the chiquita banana lady too. lol\n\nfun meal and great, affordable food!", 
            "i love eating here, i just wish they were closer to the strip.\n\nbreakfast served late, and the breakfast here is good!  very large portions, so bring your appetite or someone to share with.  they have so many good things there, i don't really know what to recommend.  the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> are probably the best thing.  fresh pressed apple juice is great!", 
            "what a pleasant surprise!\n\ni didn't know what hash house was or anything like that, but i was so glad i got to go here! not only do they offer hashes, but there's a load of other stuff on the menu here too that i wish i would have been able to sample. but what i did end up tasting was the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>... that was pretty tasty, although i think the waffle would have been better if it was chopped up instead of just put in whole (of all the things i could think was weird, i thought that was weird). i had the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> house hash with rosemary, garlic, onions, and asparagus. this was all very good along with a fried green tea (i still don't know why it's \"fried\"), due to my previous night of drinking. \n\nwhich leads me to my next statement: if there's a hangover cure, it's at hash house.", 
            "this time i came back during real breakfast hours (as opposed to fake hours).  i knew what to expect with the food, but not with the wait.  it wasn't bad at all...considering how many people were waiting.  service was better than my last visit, which was excellent back then.  and cleanliness was obvious!    \n\nas usual lots of staring at unbelievable portions of food.  this time i had <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> with a brown sugar banana flapjack.  the \"large pizza\" looking flapjack tasted great, not too sweet.  although i did like the blueberry pecan flapjack better.  i also ordered a side of crispy potatoes, which was addicting.\nthe griddled <mark>French Toast</mark> dipped in banana cinnamon cream tasted better than it sounds.  and the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> didn't only look breathtaking, but was outstanding in taste.  there was actual bacon strips inside the waffle!  \n\ni'm working my way up to the one-pound stuffed burgers.  give me a month...", 
            "adam richman.... i blame you for the long wait i had to endure for my breakfeast! okay maybe i only had to wait 45 minutes but who the heck ever waits that long for breakfast? \n\n<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> with maple reduction... 2 stars. roscoe's serves waaaaay better chicken and waffles. the chicken was dry and the waffles were too doughy. where's the sage? the maple reduction was the best part about the plate but it stuck like hot glue so i couldn't get much from it. you absolutely need to ask for more syrup. the fried leeks were bitter.\n\n<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict... 4 stars. sooo heavy but sinfully good. very filling. the chipotle cream sauce really makes it. good thing for the tomato bc it really cuts through the heaviness a bit.\n\nmeatloaf hash... 5 stars! the meatloaf was sooo moist and tender. the biscuit is delicious with the homemade strawberry jam. even though this place is known for their <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>... i highly recommend the meatloaf hash.\n\nthe best thing about our meal? kiwi watermelon lemonade. it's beautiful and refreshing but too bad there are no refills. the nice waitress gave us refills of regular or strawberry lemonade so that was nice. you can take your lemonade to go!", 
            "i had big eyes here. and... if you have big eyes here, please only get one plate. one plate is enough to feed 4 people comfortably.\n\ni got the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. and the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>. (i shared the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> with 3 others). but we didn't even finish our dishes. everyone took something home. \n\n<mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. i was eyeing so many items on the menu, but this was my final decision since it said man v food favorite next to it. it was delicious, and i definitely took at least half of it home. the chicken was crispy and delicious. the sauce on top is really good. i don't know what it was. the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> are really good, and the biscuit is very fluffy. as soon as the waitress plopped it in front of me, i knew i couldn't possibly finish it. i had the leftovers later, and it was still good!\n\n<mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>. i actually really really really enjoyed this. maybe more than the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. only because it's simple: savory and sweet. btw, the bacon at this place is amazing. thick and crispy. i'll definitely want to get this again, but i'm going to have to give a chance to other items on the menu.\n\nwhen we arrived, it was a sunday around noon i'd say. they told us it was an hour and 15 minute wait. we decided to wait it out. we ended up getting seated 30-40 minutes in. so it wasn't bad. but we were extremely hungry, and that explains why we all got the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> as an \"appetizer\" to share. we definitely did not need it. \n\nthis location is off the strip.. quite the ways.. there's another one at imperial palace so i've heard.", 
            "i'll admit it... we only came here because adam richman from man vs. food recommended it, and apparently everyone and their mama saw that episode and was there too.  we came for saturday brunch and waited about 40 minutes for a table. they took our order, then forgot about us because the 2 tables that were seated next to us about 20 minutes later were served their food before us.  if it wasn't for that- this review would be 4 stars. \n\nat least the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> made up for the wait- it is amazingly delicious.  the flavor combination is perfect. i am a big fan of eggs benedict and this is now my new favorite.  my husband, who is not a fan of eggs benedict, has now changed his ways.  we shared this dish (and it serves 2, maybe even 4) and the plate was spotless when were done. \n\nwe also ordered the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> because everyone else on yelp raved about it, and i was sadly disappointed.  the waffles were blah, and the bacon wasn't anything special. \n\noverall, we are glad we went.  the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, alone, is worth the visit.", 
            "this place just makes me laugh - we had such a ridiculous time here.  the portions are so completely over-the-top, it's great fun and we definitely don't have anything like this up north.  \n\n<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>.. with <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>.. drenched with syrup.  i get the same look from everyone when i describe this to them.  it's a cross between absolute revulsion and incredulity - that i liked it?!  yeah, we don't have <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles up here - that's a new combo.  but damn, it was good. it's i'm-on-vacation-and-what-happens-in-vegas-stays-in-vegas good.\n\nthe green fried tomato is stacked up in a tower, layered with <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark>.  i have no idea what this is supposed to taste like, but it was just like very firm warm tomatoes, with <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark> & balsamic.  not bad, but nothing exciting beyond its portion size.\n\nthe crab cakes are more like crab patties.  they are burger sized, the biggest crab cakes i've ever seen.  taste-wise, nothing to write home about, but not bad in the traditional sense either.  there were decent amounts of real crab meat in there, not just filler.\n\nthe <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> comes served in a plate that is the size of the table-width.  no joke.  it made for a great late night snack.\n\ni really enjoyed the complimentary biscuits - big, buff and buttered with honey.  just the way i (now) like them.  i had to exercise considerable restrain in eating just one.  \n\narriving early enough on a friday night at 6:30, we were able to get  a table right away.  the place was pretty packed by the time we left at 8:30.", 
            "i made reservations, so i didn't need to wait for a table, even though the place was busy. the service was perfunctory. the waiter appeared just three times: to take my order, bring the food, and bring the check. \n\ni had  the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> tower. the chicken was moist with a crunchy coating. the waffles stuffed with bacon was a good idea, but weak on the execution - they were rather dry with no extra syrup on the side. i really liked the unusual  garnishes. fresh lemonade was perfect - not too sweet.\n\non a previous visit a year or so ago, i enjoyed the <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> sandwich. i remember the service being much better at that time.", 
            "saw this restaurant reviewed on the food network and decided to give this place a shot when i was in vegas.  \n\ni like how it is located away from the vegas strip and separated from all the madness.  i came here for lunch on a sunday.  there was a wait time of around 15-20 minutes, but well worth the wait.  i wanted to order everything off the menu because it all looked good on paper. \n\ni ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> served on top of <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>, fried leeks to dress the dish, and maple syrup drizzled on top of this giant tower of goodness.  the tower of food was held together with a large steak knife stuck right in the middle of the piled up food.  i felt like i was pulling out the excalibur sword from the stone when i took out that steak knife and was ready for action!  i demolished the dish with no mercy.  was a fair fight, but i think the dish won because i was knocked out when i got back to my hotel room.\n\nthe food was great.  chicken was tender.  perfect amount of seasoning.  crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> was good too.  didn't know putting bacon in waffles would go so well together.  also the watermelon lemonade is a refreshing drink.  the servers were very nice and friendly.  lively atmosphere environment. staff outfits were pretty cool too because they were dressed in team sports apparel. \n\nif you are in the vegas neighborhood, hash house a go go is an absolutely must visit destination for all food lovers.\n\nbon appetit!", 
            "rickilane's thread has reminded me that i have in fact been back for breakfast and i'd say it's just \"a-ok\". it's not worth the wait. it doesn't live up the hype (ok portion sizes do!). service blows, but overall the food is decent and if you're a quantity over quality type person this should be right up your alley (sadly i'm not!)\n\nlet's start with what they do right - the drinks! the coffee drinks. the mimosas, the bloody mary's, omg. divine. we had a sickenly sweet smores coffee drink with flipping marshmallows melted on the cup.. bonus points for creativity. i have yet to try a drink here that isn't scrumptious!!\n\nwe ordered one of the egg platters. it was decent. nothing memorable, but nothing wrong with it. \n\nthe chicken and waffles is where this place goes incredibly downhill. for those that say the chicken is flavorful, i think you don't have tastebuds. the chicken is so bland, dry, and awful. the waffle was somehow also bad. i love <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>, it's not like this place is the first place to have them (get them all the time at original pancake house), but the execution here was way off. the bacon wasn't small enough so you have major texture issues giong on. the waffle overall lacked that yummy sweetness you get from most waffles. it wasn't soft, it wasn't sweet, it basically tasted like dry white bread with huge pieces of extremely thick flavorless bacon in it. huge disappointment. we kept covering the plate with more and more syrup but there was no rescuing this pitiful excuse for chicken and waffles. \n\nmy hubbie is from georgia, i'm from tx. we eat chicken and waffles in the south all the time. we're familiar with how they should taste. roscoe's in la does an excellent freaking job. this my friends was the worst chicken and waffle execution i've ever encountered.. crappy chicken and a crappy waffle?? wtf hash house.", 
            "so it was my niece's b-day this last week and i invited her, my sis and my other local niece to caesar's for some swimming, then brunch followed by a visit to popcorn girl and rocket fizz. \n\nmy sis was worried about the high winds at the pool might make her girls sick - not sure how exactly ; but the bottom line, first on the list is immediately checked off. i know my niece, lizzie, loves a good pancake or a good waffle - so ok, back to hhagg ... please no wait...please good service ... please hot food ... well i'll be damned - 3 for 3 . \n\nsince we've seen a million reviews - i'll keep it short - the highlights: \n\n<mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> ( pic added ) - i kept staring at lizzie's plate - 4 large waffles ... please don't eat them all - 1st went down fast , 2nd one almost as quick ...oh-oh ...3rd ...she's starting to slow down ...she's gotta be full after that huge hot chocolate with all those marshmallow's ...whew ...she's done . \n\nbut wait, my sis had her eyes on them too ( she had a so-so stuffed burger, i had a so-so hash special - but the biscuit was awesome ! ) \n\nwe agree to share the last of the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> - fluffy, nice pieces of bacon in the mix, some whipped butter and syrup - exceptional !! \n\nhighlight #2 - hamms beer ( pic added ) - with my special i saw at the bottom of the description - add a hamm's beer for $1.25 - really ? hamm's, my beloved college beer of choice ?!? oh yeah - i'll take that ! \n\noverall, decent service, got seated quickly, and the food - above average - when they say twisted farm food, for me , this place gets me twisted - it's really getting to be a love-hate relationship, today, it was love.",

            "this place is alright.\n\nthere was something about it when i walked in, where it overwhelmingly smelled of heavily delicious breakfast foods. i'm usually a big fan of chicken and waffles back at home so i found it fitting to order the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>.\n\ni definitely hate to compare to roscoe's but hh takes a different approach. i was given 4 pieces of fluffy waffles and two chicken breast pieces for a really decent price too for what it was. i did enjoy my meal, but something about it made me really want the waffles to be thinner and just the use of heavy butter and grease for flavor. (oh yeah, and portions where huge!)\n\ni understand that it was a ny times favorite and that it was featured on man vs. food. it was probably a hit or miss deal ordering the chicken and waffles, but the rest of the items on the menu had looked really good as well. \n\nsomething really wants me to give this place a chance.\n\nchances of coming back? possibly.", 
            "i reserve my 5 star reviews for the most revered establishments, at which i have never had a care, worry or problem. that said, if i could, i would give hash house a solid 4.5. \n\nlike a lot of folks, i saw hash house on man v food. i had the place logged in the back of my head so when i was at a conference in vegas for a week and the boss says \"where we eatin'?\" i was ready with a home run.\n\nive eaten once at the original off strip location and once at the new location inside the ip. for the original, we were seated quickly on a weeknight and service was prompt, but that's not wat you want to hear about, is it?\n\nthe food is fucking massive. that night we had 2 appetizers, the fried green tomatoes and something else that escapes me. both were good but i was focused on getting what i had been waiting weeks to try; the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles.\n\nalright, so, 2 massive <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breasts stacked on top of 4 <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> roughly the dimensions of 2 hotel room gidions bibles cut in half and stacked, all held in place with a huge steak knife. the chicken was crisp and delicious with sage running throughout. the bacon in the waffles was amazing and was topped off with a maple reduction. by the time i was done forcing as much into my body as humanly possible, i still had a meal left over for the next day.\n\nyou would have thought we were in a photo studio with the ammout of flashes going off. everyone in here takes pictures of the food, don't be shy, show everyone back home what theyre missing. hhagg goes on your vegas bucket list.", 
            "this one kind of hurts, because in advance, i never thought this would only be three stars. bummer. first off, the place does not suck. after seeing this place on man v. food and bacon paradise, i think maybe i just got a little too hyped up for it. \n\ni know that part of the schtick is to be over the top...with the portions, with the bacon, everything over the top...i get it. but at a certain point, it's just kind of wasteful. i can't believe this is me saying that, but hash house took me there. \n\nthe <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was delicious. i wish it weren't just breasts, though...moist, juicy thighs are where its at. i know what you're thinking, and cut it out. the tower of <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>? delicious, but why a tower? who's gonna eat all these waffles? and don't get pissy when we need more syrup! \n\nthe grilled meatloaf hash was pretty good. lots of meatloaf, fried potatoes, and red and yellow peppers. huge amount of this hash next to a little mound of two scrambled eggs. i really like my eggs, and i felt bad that they were so outnumbered. three eggs and half as much hash would suit me fine. \n\nthe bacon bloody mary. for the love of all that does not suck....i wanted to love it. i had so been looking forward to it. i don't know what the frig is going on in this world, but it seems to be a recent trend that everyone feels the need to make their bloody mary spicy as all hell. hash house isn't just along for that ride, they bought the damned airline. imo, tabasco should *accent* the flavors in a bloody, waking the whole thing up, leaving behind a slight spicy flavor that pleasantly lingers....it should not be a dominant, overwhelming aftertaste without the drink being ordered that way. kind of like everything else here, it's just too over the top without needing to be so. \n\nservice was just fine, although i didn't quite dig the practice of going ahead and adding 18 percent gratuity under the line \"large party\". since it was just two of us, they were either insulting us by calling us large, or insulting us because we're cheapskates that used their gift certificate offer on restaurants dot com. either way, unappreciated. i'm in the industry, and you have to really suck to not get 20 percent and have that rounded up to the next dollar....even more if you don't suck. you were great, but you're saying 18 percent. so 18 percent it is, then. oh well.", 
            "on the advice of guy fieri, we decided to check out hash house.  he has his own show (and his advice has been pretty on-point in the past), so i considered anything he said golden. my bad...\ndon't get me wrong, hash house isn't bad, it just isn't anything different from your average breakfast place.  i love me a good breakfast, but hash house didn't exactly serve the best tasting breakfast. sure it was huge and it was filling, but as far as the tastebuds go, they weren't dancing...more like bobbing to the beat..no, not even that.  sorry!\ni ordered the veggie house hash (was that my mistake?) and dude ordered the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> and eggs.  it was okay, but, again, we've both had much better breakfasts.\nluckily, we didn't have to wait long since it was late morning on a tuesday.  service was good.  i guess my only complaint is that if it wasn't for ddd, there wouldn't be that much hash house hype.",

(if you're coming here, try not to eat for the day because the servings are monstrous!)\n\ni have been to both this location as well as the one in imperial palace and would definitely recommend this one by far. (imperial palace had equally good food, but much lower quality service). the decor is a bit different for both locations, with the sahara location being much bigger, livelier, and more attentive service. \n\nas soon as we got there, we ordered. my boyfriend got the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> and i got the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles....sorry, my mouth started watering just thinking about it.... the wait for our food was unbearable, mostly because waiters were walking by with pancake platters  with pancakes that took up the entire plate (about a foot in diameter)! i ordered a mimosa to ease my nerve. it was okay - too much champagne. \n\nfinally, our food came. two plates of enormous proportions - my chicken and waffles were the size of my head! it looked really good, though: four <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>, topped with perfectly <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> topped with a not-too-sweet maple glaze. (they had to drive a steak knife through it to make sure it didn't topple over). the chicken was tender, but fried in a bit of a spicy batter, which paired with the sweetness of the glaze, waffle, and bacon really well. \n\nlooking at his benedict, though, i had to take a sliver....which turned into half of his plate, haha. it was amazing! a perfect biscuit, topped with <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, two eggs, bacon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, and hollandaise sauce. (oh, and a slice of fruit to be healthy). the flavors came together so well! \n\nwe ate so much, our stomachs looked like two balloons ready to burst. it was worth it, though. it's been a week, and i'm having withdrawals. \n\nif you're looking for a good meal or want to be filled for days, or both, then go to hash house - you won't regret it.", 
            "ugh. came here for breakfast a few days ago. seriously so overrated and unimpressive. it wasn't busy so we got seated right away. i will say the hostess was friendly though. a lot better than our waitress. after looking over our menu and getting some water we decided on some eggs, biscuits, fruit, <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> along with a <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>. our waitress wasn't so helpful and was unsure of what a country scramble was. (how does a place that is suppose to be farmers food not know what a country scramble is?!) she also never came by to check back up on us or refill our waters which we downed pretty fast. about 20-25 minutes pass and we finally get our food complete with no refill on our waters. the food was basic and lacked a lot of flavor. the potatoes did not leave me or my boyfriend wanting more. the eggs had no taste to them. the best part of this plate was the biscuit and fruit, or should i say lack there of fruit. the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> was not that impressive either. i could have made better. in fact i think i have. i shouldn't complain about it though because it did have more flavor than the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. yes, the food here may be pretty to look at, but they need to work on flavors and making my taste buds yearn for more. i hardly ate any. our waitress was awful. never checked on us and when i asked for a box she brought me back a wet box and plastic bag along with the wrong check. sorry lady, but you are not getting more than you should.\ni had such better hopes for hash house after everything i have read on them, but i don't think i can come back to this bland food.", 
            "come hungry.\n\ni've been going to hash house since it first opened a few years back. the food is consistently great and the servers are super nice. the portion sizes are ridiculously huge. \n\ni love the alcohol choices here as well. pineapple mimosas= yum yum!\n\nmy hubby and i always split what we get. if you don't want the extra plate charge the servers have told us to order an extra biscuit which is huge and always served with homemade jam (flavors depend on the time of year).\n\ni highly recommend the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>. it's a normal belgian waffle but has bacon infused into the batter and each corner has a slice of bacon hanging off of it. life changing.",

            "this place is absolutely amazing! \"twisted farm food\" is how the describe their menu, and it is so true. from their handcrafted cocktails, fresh squeezed juices, and eclectic country cuisine, this place is by far one of the best breakfasts i've ever had! i highly recommend the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>, or the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict. delicious! get your grub on, y'all!", 
            "love this place!  i had visited years ago before the place blew up and decided to visit while in vegas with the family.  the staff here is fabulous!  they are all super friendly and will work to make sure you are taken care of.  \n\nmy eggs were delicious, the fruit fresh and sweet and the potatoes (non-hash) were just okay.  my daughter had the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> and ended up picking the bacon out of the sides.  she said the waffle itself was just a little too thick for her.  my mom had the normal breakfast plate (scram eggs, toast, potatoes & bacon), my aunt had the bacon scramble and i had the spinach/ham scramble.  i can see what other reviewers mean when they mention that the food is just okay.  the flavor doesnt knock you out of your seat but it is still a fun place to enjoy a meal. \n\nthe best part of the meal was our fabulous waitress, tiffany who should be delievering her son any day now.  too cute!", 
            "ok to be honest, everyone was raving about the chicken and waffles so i said why not let's give it a go.  when i bit into the meal i was a little disappointed because it wasn't what i expected it to be.  the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> was something different, i liked that part.  the chicken on the other hand i wasn't too much of a fan, the breading was a little off to me and the sauce that was on the plate did not go well with the meal, it tasted like soy sauce.  i'd rate it a 3 but i gave it a 4 because you definitely get what you pay for! roscoe's chicken and waffles in long beach, ca still holds the reigning champ title for chicken and waffles for me.\n\ngirlfriend had the tracker combo with the banana <mark>French Toast</mark>, and she loved it kept raving on about it so i'm sure that was a must :p",

            "the hash house a go go has an interesting menu and has been on a travel channel show, but in my opinion, it is more fluff than substance and your typical example of \"sounds better on paper.\"  you get large portions at a premium price for your typical diner (aka denny's style) food dressed up with a sprig of sage - it's not bad but you might feel a bit disappointed if you were expecting something awesome.  stay away from some of the gimmicky items, and you will have an experience similar to an ihop.\n\nas a person who usually orders waffles, i have to say this: order the pancakes.  the waffles have a slight baking soda taste, and when you get the bacon cooked in the waffle, it makes the flavor more pronounced.  most people are too hung-over or impressed by the serving size to care.  it took me 2 visits to come to the conclusion that decent pancakes trump weird waffles, and trust me, you don't want to order the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> unless you really like grease.  despite the yummy sounding menu, the best items to get are their \"regular\" dishes like an omelet or eggs and bacon.  their food tends to be bland, as if adding salt or ketchup is a requirement.  the chicken is ok for the first couple of bites, but it's actually a bit too dry and bland to enjoy without dipping it in something.  the omelets and pancakes were never bad during my visits.\n\nthe service is efficient and professional, though not particularly friendly.  if this place is on your \"vegas to do list\" then you should try to come during non-peak meal hours to avoid lines and a busy waitress.  \n\ni know the hash house a go go tries to create a nice breakfast/diner experience but the inconsistent flavors makes it difficult to really like.  if you're here to experience vegas, then stick with some basic breakfast or menu items and you should be fine.  it's not a bad place, but i think it is more hype than taste.  there are cheaper and tastier places to have breakfast, but then again, hash a go go does provide some very interesting menu options.  you should go just to see how big some of these dishes are.", 
            "i'm going to round this up to a 3 star rating because i've never really ate at a place quite like this.  they actually have really interesting stuff on the menu that sound really appetizing.  i wish i could've just ordered everything i wanted, but there was no way no how i'd be able to do that.  my bf and i decided to split a plate since it was our first meal of the day.  we had the rosemary <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> and leeks- $14.95.  it's definitely not chicken and roscoes!!!!  the chicken was extremely dry, hard and almost inedible.  waffle was too thick and not moist and fluffy; it was also dry.  the only saving grace on that plate were the leeks, and i would say it was there more for decorative purpose.  i'd pass on this dish.  we also had two eggs, sunny side up, for an additional $2.95.  this excluded the $2.50 fee they add on for those who split a plate.  the rest of my party enjoyed pancakes and the basics!.  everything is just ginormous!!!  the pictures posted give a rime example of the sizes/portions.  even the kids pancake is huge, and definitely not bad for 4.95?  it was cheap!  \n\nthe restaurant is pretty spacious and i appreciate the big booths they have.  i can't really say the decoration stood out to me though.  i can't pinpoint anything specific about it.\n\nservice was slow and rushed at the same time, if that even makes sense.  she took really long to greet us, but when she finally did she was eager to take our orders.  no \"good morning\", or \"welcome to hash house\".  it was my first time there so it would've been nice to have been greeted with a welcoming hello.  after she took our orders, it was a realllllllly long time before we saw her, or our food.  i flagged someone down inquiring about our food and then they finally came out, cold.  blah.\n\noverall, i think i want to give this place another shot, but it will probably be a while before i venture out again.  in the mean time i'll stick to the more \"normal\" breakfast spots out there....\n\noh yea, btw, happy thanksgiving to all my friends, all the people i've been blessed enough to cross paths with, all the people i have yet to meet, and most importantly my family! thankful to have everyone of you in my life!  enjoy", 
            "3 1/2 stars to be more precise.\n\ni'm sure hash house a go go got a nice surge after being featured on man vs. food and the gratuitous plug from adam richman (who has one of the coolest jobs in the world by the way).  but me?  i dunno, i'm not overly impressed.  it's kind of middle of the road for myself.\n\ni'm a good eater...and at hash house a go go they do serve big food!  portions are ginormous and meals often come out on platters the size of a small hubcap.  you will almost always leave with a little doggie bag of leftovers!  alas, for me the flavors of the food doesn't particularly sing to my palette.  it just seems like you're going to a chain restaurant with lots of chain restaurant food, and it all just kinda tastes the same.  not bad, but not standout great.  when you combine the muted flavors with the high prices i have no choice but to knock you down a star or two.\n\nbut perhaps this is my fault.  people rave that this place is a great deal for breakfast, when they showcase the best things to have at hash house.  i ended up going for dinner so maybe my review is somewhat off-kilter.  but i gotta go off of what we ate, and it pains me to say it but it was all average.\n\nwe shared <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> tower ($18).  i saw pics of this platter online and thought we gotta have that.  in all?  it was ok.  the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was hot and juicy, but i couldn't get into the batter they dip it in.  it was a tad on the thick side and got in the way of the chicken.  also, the flavor was just bland, bland, bland.  not spicy, savory, or sweet like a decent <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>.  it was very plain.  the waffles stuffed with whole strips of bacon?  impressive, but again off in it's flavors.  the <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark> was delicious on its own, but the waffle needed some seasoning that the hot maple reduction couldn't offer.  the waffle was nice and crisp and chewy on the inside though like a waffle should be.\n\nwe also shared one of andy's twisted stuffed burgers ($15).  the one we got had roasted beef, smoked mozzarella, and charred tomato in it.  it came out in a huge stack which of course made it near impossible to eat.  i had to cut it into tinier portions just to pick it up!  doing this made my stuffed burger very uneven in the tasting.  i had a hard time getting to meld a bite that included all the fixings in the burger.  and by the time i finally got to eat my burger the juices from the patty made my bottom bun extra soggy.  i hate that.  and again, the flavors just seemed subdued somehow.  no zip, no zing, no tang, no mas!  it really just struck me as an average burger.  i've honestly had a better one for less money.  will this be the first place i suggest use a dash of msg in their food?  however, the fries were crisp and delicious. \n\nspeaking of sharing...there will be none of it had unless you like being charged for it!  seriously, you get charged a $4-5 fee if you are sharing one plate.  it seems a bit highway robbery if you ask me...serve me a too large portion of so-so food then punish me if i want to share?  i can see why obesity rates are high in the us.  so your best bet here is to order two plates of food (or an entree and a large side) if you're a couple and avoid that dumb fee altogether.  you will just have more leftovers to take home.  \n\nspeaking of leftovers...we left hash house with 3 (yes 3) containers of food for the ride home!  i indeed ate all i could and left full, but not satisfied.  a few hours later i decided on some of the leftovers for a midnight snack but again was met with the mediocre.  my leftovers didn't hold up well at all!  <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was soggy (and still bland), and the burger had gone on the rubbery side.  i was too disappointed thinking about throwing away all this food so i ended up eating it anyway.  not one of my finer moments.\n\nthe main reason why i still give a 3 1/2 star here was because of the service.  our waitress was very attentive and pleasant, and kept our drinks filled without much fuss.  she had some mad strong forearms too, defined!  must be from all the heavy duty platter lifting going on there.\n\nhate to say it hash house a go go, but i think if i ever try this place again it will be for breakfast or brunch.  please work on seasoning your food!  thanks, k bye!",

            "twisted farm food....that's pretty accurate\n\nmy only regret is i am not actually a cow, with the four compartment stomach and the ability to ingest 2.5% of my own body weight, which for me would be 4.2 pounds. if you do the math, you can figure out how much i weigh!\n\ni couldn't finish my brunch here.  i was defeated by a loaf of meat <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  i'm actually somewhat glad i didn't attempt the chicken and waffles, because my wife did, and she ate exactly half, so we decided the next time we come here, we would just split one, that way we can both feel accomplished in our eating endeavors.\n\ngargantuan proportions...just look at those pictures!  the food doesn't come on plates; here, they come on platters.  seriously consider whether you should donate a portion of your meal to charity.\n\n<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> tower.  it wasn't that architecturally sound, but at least it looked and tasted great.  bacon baked into the waffles, 2 pieces of crispy and not greasy chicken breasts on top of the waffles, with delicate fried leeks strewn about the plate, and a giant sprig of rosemary holding it all together.  usually comes drizzled with syrup, but we asked for it on the side and they were happy to do that. \n\n<mark>HH Famous Meatloaf</mark> with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  pretty much like normal meatloaf, but crispier and meatier(not meteor).  you know how meatloaf usually comes with either gravy or ketchup on top?  hash house does it with bbq sauce!  they are seriously changing the meatloaf game...the dish also came with the biggest biscuit i have ever seen in my life.  it was about 4 and a half fingerbreadths tall and about 7 inches around, and perfectly \"biscuit-y\".  you know what i mean?  a good balance of flakiness with fluffiness cut with a pinch of butteriness and saltiness, all in equal proportions.  i kind of love biscuits.\n\ni had a bloody mary to accompany my mini smorgasborg of a healthy brunch.  it was well made, as far as bloody marys go, and came with a garnish of a petite dill pickle and 2 jalapeno stuffed olives.\n\nprops - great food, tip-top service, good bloody mary\n\nnegative props - serious food coma.\n\nwe'd planned to partake in all manner of adventure after brunch, but hash house decided to ruin our plans by knocking us out with the force of a cast iron pan a la tom & jerry for about 4 hours.  we woke up and the sun was gone.  does that properly demonstrate the power of hash house a go go?", 
            "yummy! if you are going for breakfast get there early like opening time early or else you will have to wait. but the portions are so big that waiting helps the hunger which helps you eat more of your dish. i've tried the brown sugar banana pancake and it was the biggest prettiest pancake i've ever seen. i love that they have tangerine juice. my mom tried <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and it was awesome! i have also tried their <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> and i'm a fan. there are so many good items on the menu, so if it looks good try it. i recommend the kiwi watermelon lemonade!", 
            "took my boyfriend here for his birthday breakfast and i was not disappointed.  although they were busy, we were seated within 10 minutes.  the waiter promptly came over and took our drink orders and i ordered the kiwi watermelon lemonade, i didn't want to drink it because it was so beautiful.  i have never felt that way about anything to drink!  when the food arrived the portions were huge.  my boyfriend had the pancake and i had the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>.  my <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> was delicioso!  i was able to eat on it for 3 days.  i can't wait to go back and try something different.", 
            "yummy!!\n\nportions are humongous and that's an understatement. \n\ni ordered the chicken and waffles. it could easily feed 2+ people - comes with 2 pieces of chicken and 4 <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>. i could only finish one waffle and chicken. \n\nthey have mimosas. that's always a plus.\n\nhot sauce isn't automatically a condiment that comes with the meal which is a boo but they had sriracha when i asked. so all good. \n\nhad to ask for extra maple syrup. i'm not a syrup whore but for the amount of food, i had to ask for more syrup. \n\nall the people who work there were super chill and nice.",

            "another awesome brunch today with \"twisted farm food.\"\n\ni love many things about this place. the decor, the huge menu, the portions. yes, the portions are big enough for you to share, take home, and have for maybe another meal. or two. but it's good yumy food.\n\ni've had many items off their menu. <mark>French Toast</mark>, waffles, <mark>Corned Beef</mark>, their amazing variety of flapjacks, scrambles... today's choice was <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>. <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> isn't traditional, but still good. belgian-style waffles with slices of bacon in-between. i don't really need to say much about that. isn't everything better with bacon?? just kidding...\n\nthe other highlight was the blueberry pecan flapjacks. nutty and fruity fluffy soft pancakes drizzled with warm maple syrup. nom nom nom... my son even gobbled it up.\n\ntheir service is great, the only thing that takes awhile is your food to arrive. it wasn't unreasonable, and you kind of forget about it once your ginormous plate of food arrives. the manager always comes around when plates are cleared to inquire how our meal were.\n\nthe prices are pretty hefty for breakfast, but you do get a lot for what you paid. i have two take-out boxes in my fridge right now...\n\ntill next time! :)", 
            "my friends and i stopped by here before making our long drive back to california. we got there around 12pm and people were waiting everywhere (good sign!!). we waited around 20 minutes before we got called. my friend and i shared the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles and ordered a side of crispy potatoes. when it came out, we sat there in shock...it was huge! we didn't know where to start. the description said tower of <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>, and sure enough, there were 4 waffles on top of one another and 2 <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breasts on top of that. the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was a little dry, but nothing a little dunk in ketchup or syrup can't fix. i could see the pieces of bacon in the waffles, which was a little overwhelming. the waffles were crunchy and pretty good; the crispy potatoes were nicely seasoned too. \n\none of my other friends ordered a breakfast combo and the other one ordered just the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>. both of them had <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> w/bacon, some of the heaviest <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> ever, but it was really creamy, buttery and good. the total wasn't bad either; i can't remember the exact number but i remember thinking it wasn't so bad. my friend and i who shared the chicken/waffles paid around $12 including tax and tip. we left overly stuffed and very happy.", 
            "was kinda disappointed, but will give it another try. the wife and i went late on a saturday for dinner. we walked in and the place was empty at 915pm. okay it was closing in 45 minutes, but was very surprised. we were seriously the only ones in there, maybe it's more of a breakfast place. we were greeted by the hostess who was very sweet and pleasant. she showed us to the table and made some recommendations since i had announced it was our first time there.\n i knew the portions were going to be huge so no appetizers for us. we looked at the menu briefly since we kinda knew from the website menu what we wanted. i ordered the chicken and <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> tower, the wife had the chik <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>. both were huge. the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> comes in what looks like a crust hat. the chikn waffles is built like a tower. the presentation was vey good, but the food in my opinion didn't live up to the hype. the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was somewhat dry, bland and greasy with a slight sage taste. the waffles on the other hnd were the best part... the bacon inside were crisp. i really didn't like the mound of fried leeks that everything was plated on. i think that's sort of what turned me off to the whole meal. i mean you have the sweet and savory combination of waffles, maple syrup and <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, and then get hit with a bit of onion taste... very off putting. \nthe <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> was different than usual which is fine. i can't really comment on the taste but it was made with real nice chicken pieces and huge chopped veggies <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. the wife liked it but stated not to expect the typical c.p.p. \nbad news... the dessert. we had a restaurant.com coupon to use so we needed to hit $50 on the tab. we ordered a snickers <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark>. it comes out with ice cream on top which didn't taste like ice cream, but more like ice milk. it was not velvety smooth and silky but weird. i asked the waitress if it was supposed to be ice cream she said yes... okay. then we get into the <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark>... it wasn't <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark> at all. it was chocolate cake dipped in some egg wash maybe and i don't know...cooked somehow... i think it was microwaved because i hit a nice frozen section on the bottom. i asked the waitress if it was frozen, she said yes. she then looked at me blankly... i looked at her blankly. my wife said its okay we can't finish it anyways.\n\ni will, call me crazy give it another shot for breakfast, maybe try the benedict. again just to be clear... i believe it is way overhyped so if u go, use a restaurant.com coupon, and don't expect great food. the waffles were decent and my wife liked the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>.", 
            "if you like texas sized portions (teehee) like i do... then this place is for you! \nmy girlfriend is from the vegas area and said she had been wanting to try this for quite some time. one of my initial positives was the fact that you can order breakfast, lunch, or dinner no matter what time of the day. as i am not a morning gal and was craving breakfast... this turned out to be a perfect option. \n\nas we approached the building, there is outdoor seating available including the misting machines to cool you down, which i find funny in contrast since i am from ca where outdoor patio seating has heaters, hehe. \n\nupon entering, we were greeted by the front desk girl who was very prompt in not only welcoming but finding us a seat. i am quite picky on customer service... so far, so good...\n\nmenus and water were brought out promptly. after a brief moment to look over food options, jackson introduced himself and was very welcoming. he offered awesome recommendations, his personal faves, and any dietary limitations. \n\nfor my order, i went with\nvanilla waffle\n\"over hard\" eggs\ncrispy potatoes\n\nall made delicious! the eggs were just made perfectly fluffy, and crisp enough just delicious. i don't usually like left overs but ate the waffle like a day or so later and it still tasted like perfection. and the potatoes were made deliciously crispy right down to the last bite. it was one of the last things we both nom nom'd on. for anyone wanting to be creative there's even a <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> available. \n\nyou also can't go wrong when both the guys from man vs. food & guy from diner, drive ins, and dives have both eaten here. \n\ncheck it out! there's something for everyone. plenty of seating also for children and large groups.", 
            "<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles!!!! \n\nafter seeing this impressive looking dish in many of my friend's vegas albums, i had to try it for myself. surprisingly the star of the plate is the fluffy waffles (5 of them to be exact) each of which has a few strips of bacon baked in! whoever thought of that is a culinary genius. \n\nthe chicken itself is good but the batter could actually use more seasoning or some form of louisiana/crystal hot sauce to complement it. the crispy leeks are amazing though and i would definitely ask for extra because they are so flavorful. \n\nportions are ridiculous, in a good way. could easily share a plate of chicken and waffles with someone else. though i did see a guy down the entire plate like a champ one table over. i however had extra <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> for the next two days.. no complaints there :)",

            "<mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> is not like it looked on the food network.  not much flavor or bacon. i had one little piece showing and it was hit and miss in the waffle. also the portion seemed much smaller but more than enough to fill me up. they use a lot of inexpensive ingredients as filler to make the portions seem bigger. my son had the blt and they used thick bread and almost a half head of lettuce to make it appear really large. overall, it's just okay. i live here and rarely eat at hash house because there are so many places in vegas with a lot better food and atmosphere.", 
            "if you go here for sunday brunch, expect the wait to be more than an hour. personally, i think the wait was worth it. most of the food here tastes great. the servings are huge! i think one plate of anything you order is a good amount that can be shared by three people. it's that crazy big! i love their crispy potatoes! the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>, a must try! everything here is a heart attack on a plate. but they are all so good. \n\nwe attended flavors of the heart last saturday and they were there sampling their crab cakes. i just want to commend their chef because it was good and it was one of my favorites! \n\nlove what you do for the aha!"

            "as i was waiting for friends, i decided to order their award-winning watermelon-kiwi-lemonade drink at the bar.  i can see why it's a reputable drink.  not too sweet and the fruity flavors go well with each other.  just wish i had a bigger glass.    \n\ni wasn't sure what to expect at this simple restaurant and bar.  \"twisted farm food\" is a good way to put it.  as if they have large creatures at this farm because portions here are gigantic.  \n\ni've had 12-14 inch pancakes before, but never were they filled and tasted just right.  i had their blueberry pecan famous flapjack as part of my <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark>.  this combo included 2 eggs with strips of bacon.  thick cuts of bacon and scrambled eggs already made me happy.  it was the flapjack draping over the large plate that scared me the most.  i don't even think 2 people can finish it.  this enormous pancake made everyone look at me.  they were probably wondering why i also ordered a side of hash browns.  \n\nlooks like to-go containers are popular here.  even with large appetites, people still leave home with a doggy bag.  the next time i visit i will have to try their one pound stuffed burgers.  a humongous burger that includes 2 patties, with apple-<mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark> <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> in between, and all the fix-ins and steak fries....sound like breakfast lunch and dinner combined.  who needs a buffet?  \n\nparking is easy and traffic around is not bad at all.  i would definitely take people visiting from out of town to this friendly establishment.  it sure beats the long lines and loud crowds on the strip.  besides, food here is way better...and bigger, which makes the prices reasonable.  thanks to tish and cynthia for introducing me to this place.  can't wait to go back!", 
            "we joined our out-of-town guests for breakfast this morning, and we figure hash house a go go would be the perfect place.  there was absolutely no wait on a thursday morning at 8:30 am, but two hours later, there is definitely a wait!\n\n* mushroom, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato & fresh spinach hash ($11.25) - the hashes \"are tossed with crispy potatoes and topped with 2 eggs, served with fresh fruit and biscuit.\" two sunny side up eggs sat in the corner of my skillet along with a large biscuit and a generous portion of potatoes and other good stuff.  i ate it all up, sadly enough, minus the biscuit.  and yes, i am still full from my breakfast.  it's a hearty portion alright! i even managed a couple of nibbles of the biscuit with the jam provided on the table.\n\n* <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> hash house farm benedict \"w/ fresh spinach, <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream & scrambled eggs\" ($14.95) - the husband was looking for the item that was featured on the travel channel's man v. food, and the waitress said it was this one.  all of their benedicts are \"served on a fresh split biscuit with griddled <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>.\"  it was a huge pile of something with creamy sauce dripping all over it.  i took a bite, and in retrospect, i don't think i tasted anything beyond the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and cream sauce!  i did see the generous scrambled egg resting on top of the chicken though!  the husband did box up the other half since it is such a generous order though.  \n\n* <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark> topped w/ ice cream and served w/ a cup of coffee ($7.95) - the waitress said the only <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark> they offered was the snickers one.  i don't recall a snickers <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark> on the menu, and this one didn't taste like there was any snickers in it.  no cup of coffee arrived with it either.  it was good though.\n\nservice was okay, water glasses were refilled in a timely manner. we thought she forgot about our dessert since it was taking longer than usual.  but i think that's when it was busy in the kitchen, so that could explain the lag time.  overall, hash house a go go is the place to be at for big breakfasts.

            "being a midwesterner, i am used to the idea of generous portions, but omg this place is ridiculous! it's not quantity of quality with this place, but both hand in hand!\n\nthis is what we had:\n\n<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> w/ fresh spinach, <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs. i took a picture of this sexy beast so look at it! this is shown as a man v food recommendation and adam richmond was spot on with this one! really good <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> just covered with egg, cheese, bacon, and chipotle cream. on the side of the plate they have like a chipotle puree as decoration and garnish. omg! really subtle, smoky chipotle cream just made the dish for me. it was really good. the chicken itself was a nice big piece of <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> that i really liked. there was a split biscuit underneath all of this and honestly, that by itself was really good. i ended up removing one of the halves of the biscuit and putting the house jelly on it.. such a good milky and fluffy biscuit.. a really hearty/delicious dish!\n\ncan't find it on the online menu , but also had a chorizo hash with fresh jalapenos, house potatos, and eggs. i think there was more to it than that, but i can't remember. really fresh chorizo with a nice kick to it. unlike other <mark>Chorizo</mark>, this wasn't too salty which was greatly appreciated! the potatoes were really good being nice and brown. no complaints about that dish either!\n\nof course had coffee and juice as well. fresh juice and always refilled coffee. can't beat it. \n\nas far as service goes, it was good. i could of used more water when i wasn't sipping my coffee, but other than that not bad at all.\n\npricing is fair for the amount you get!\n\noverall this is a 5 star place. really good food and good service at a fair price. it is more than what one usually pays for breakfast, but it is a special treat and we were in vegas so no biggie!",

            "i recently saw a cable show where a limousine company turned a ferrari into a limo.  it had never been done before. frankly, it was preposterous. one of the guys interviewed said their biggest challenge was finding a way to make the supercar a stretch limo while maintaining the driving characteristics of a ferrari. and somehow, they did it.  although a bit less of an engineering challenge, the folks at hash house a-go-go construct entrees that ride this fine line between quality and mega size.\n\nfeatured on the travel channel's man v. food, hash house specializes in their self-proclaimed \"twisted farm food,\" basically jumbo-sized offerings and off-beat interpretations of traditional american favorites.  while their \"twisted\" fare is available at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, they're probably best known for their breakfast.  we visited the day after thanksgiving around 10:30a and had a predictably long wait (45-50 mins). consistent with the rebel streak they're going for, walls at their sahara ave. location are adorned with diamond plate textured metal and large nuts and bolts. the industrial look suggests that guys into bikes and hot rods would feel right at home.\n\nwe ordered their signature <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> and tractor driver special with mango coconut pancakes (and for the record, it was my petite wife who chose to order the benedict). there's no denying the benedict was a monstrosity: a layer of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, scrambled eggs, <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, tomato, mozzarella, and spinach topped with <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and generous amounts of their chipotle cream (gravy). and because anything this big merits a tree-topper, they plant a long sprig of fresh sage right on top.  good grief.  i have to say my initial impression was genuine awe with undertones of mild disgust. this was clearly a dream for anyone who derives regular enjoyment from kfc's \"famous bowls.\" pushing past our bizarre feelings of hunger laced with nausea, dorothy and i started picking at the gravy-laden structure. and to our surprise, there were some nice flavor combinations depending on where you chose to bury your fork. the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> itself was done well--crispy with nice chunks of moist white meat. combined with a bite of potato and gravy, the chicken evoked a holiday meal more than it did breakfast. the chipotle cream had a nice hint of smokiness, but as it cooled down, the self-hatred to taste ratio definitely increased.  \n\nonly lacking tomato sauce and the fact it wasn't tossed into the air at any point during its life cycle, my pancake was basically a medium to large-sized pizza. once again, i was pleasantly surprised, particularly by the lack of any \"doughiness,\" or uncooked batter. the pancake itself wasn't the best i've had, but it was adequately fluffy and a solid effort, bolstered by generous chunks of fresh juicy mango and shredded coconut. not bland, but not too sweet, some pieces of cake could be eaten without syrup. my eggs were soft scrambled just right, and the sausage links plump and tasty (i've found that a decent test of a cook's competency with eggs is to order them soft scrambled; not having them overcooked or gushing of yolk requires just a bit of care and timing). the kiwi watermelon lemonade was a nice way to top things off--tasty and refreshing, but lacking any heavily-syruped sweetness.               \n\nit goes without saying that visits to these kinds of restaurants require a pre-meal regimen of a week-long fast, meditation, and a check-up with your doctor.  i think a regular visit would risk a gross-out burn-out.  although, glancing at the scrambles and other egg dishes of our fellow patrons, it seems that slightly more modest meals are possible.  i've noticed a number of folks complaining about the price, which is perplexing. while the benedict cost $15.95 and the pancacke combo $14.95 (both at the top of their breakfast price scale), i'd point out that you're actually getting about $15.95 and $14.95 worth of food when ordering these dishes.  each dish could easily feed two hungry human beings.  sure, maybe they could drop a buck or so off the price, but if you're ever in l.a., go somewhere other than denny's for breakfast. double-digit fru-fru breakfasts are everywhere here, some with decent quality, but typically with a quarter of hash house's portion size.  we have ample experience being ripped off at breakfast places, and hash house isn't one of them.    \n\na lunch at hash house is probably in store for our next visit to vegas.  i'll probably try the \"kokomo,\" the benign moniker for what looks to be another guilt-ridden meal in the form of a meatloaf sandwich. it's probably a good thing we don't get out to vegas too often these days. like the city itself, hash house is a spectacle incompatible with daily living.", 
            "we were starving after a long trip and a time change.... at 2:00 in the afternoon we stubbled into this place. split one of the amazing burgers! it was awesome. probably the best burger ive eaten next to the one up in keene nh (which was made from local beef and pannani pressed). we got the cheddar, <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark> and avacado burger. huge! split it and couldn't finish it! very friendly service, fun beer selections. cool decor. didn't try the hash but looks like everything is freshly made. stop by, i bet you'll be happy.", 
            "i didn't realize this restaurant had been featured on tv when i first visited; a friend from san diego suggested i try one of the lv locations of his favorite sd hangout when i said i'd be here for a trade show. i'm sure glad i followed through on that suggestion! i had a wonderful dining experience. excellent service, excellent food, excellent prices. i will definitely go back to any hh location, and recommend any of them without hesitation, just as my friend did.\n\nthe morning i visited, the restaurant was quite busy, but the amazing hostess quickly got us seated in a nice booth, and our coffee was brought out promptly. i instantly fell in love with the fun and funky ambiance and the quirky, tatted waitstaff. our waitress was as fantastic as her tattoos. she was fun, friendly, and so on top of it that we were the ones that had to ask her to wait - we needed some extra time to absorb the incredible menu. \n\ni had a very difficult time deciding, so since my friend had suggested the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> egg benedict ($15), that's what ended up ordering. i had been warned the portions were big, but until you see it with your own eyes, you cannot believe how gargantuan they truly are. a massive tower of <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with fresh spinach, <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, tomato, grilled mozzarella, chipotle cream and eggs was deposited in front of me, and i actually gasped out loud, to the amusement of my waitress. though i instantly realized there was no way i was going to be able to consume all of this feast and still have a functioning heartbeat, i happily gave it a try. \n\nit was an incredible breakfast. every delicious ingredient tasted farm fresh, hand-prepared, and it was all perfectly cooked and seasoned. and it all tasted ... original! and different! and good! you can tell they make everything from scratch, because it tastes like it. heck they even have house-made jam on the table... how awesome is that..??\n\nmy dining companion had the meatloaf hash, which was a huge portion of amazing hash adorned with roasted red peppers, fresh spinach, smoked mozzarella, and 2 perfectly cooked eggs. rounding out this monster breakfast was a side of crispy potatoes, fruit and biscuit ($13).  everything on this plate was also exceptionally flavorful and cooked very well.\n\ni've been to other restaurants famous for large portions, but their food always tastes like \"chain\" food, and you can never count on the service because of how busy the restaurant is. not so with hash house. these breakfasts are obviously individually prepared with great care and attention to detail, freshness and flavor, and they're served with pride and panache by a very well-trained staff. every aspect of my breakfast, from the first cup of coffee to the last bite of fruit, was wonderful. i cannot think of one single aspect i would change about this restaurant, the staff, or the food. it was absolutely perfect.\n\nwhile a person couldn't (and shouldn't) eat a big breakfast or lunch like this all the time, occasionally enjoying one this tasty is a nice treat, especially if you're from out of town. so just like my friend urged me, i urge you to visit any hash house location and give it a try. i'm sure you'll find, as i did, that you'll be very happy with the service, the prices, and most importantly, the wonderful food.\n\nnote:  apparently, if you have twitter and you tweet you're @hashhouselv,  you get a free drink!", 
            "hash house a go go's reviews were good. people loved it so we were interested. we learnt about its famous big portions so we ordered 2 dishes for 3 of us. we got <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> and 1 lb burger w/ apple wood <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, avocado, and cheddar. i really liked the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>. though it was chicken breast, it was very tender and juicy. however, i was not a fan of its burger. the patties were dry and overcooked. yes, it was huge, but no, it was not as tasty as it looked. it did not come with fries and to add a side of happy meal portion fries, we had to pay 2.99 more. plus, our waiter spilled 1/3 of the fries on the table by accident and he just walked away.

            "our vegas trip was coming to an end and we had one more stop before taking the long road home, hash house a go go!!\n\nthis place is freakin' awesome!!\n\nwe arrived at the right time (between 11:30a-12:00p on a monday) because we were seated almost immediately. shortly, a crowd of customers were gathering in the waiting area. we ordered our drinks then preceded to take a closer look at the menu.\n\ni was completely overwhelmed by the menu because everything looked so good! there were four of us total and i didn't want to order the same thing as someone else, so that we could all have a taste of something different, i ordered the <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> benedict with fresh asparagus, sundried tomatoes, chili cream and two basted eggs. the rest of the table ordered: <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with waffles, <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash with red onions and swiss cheese, and <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> with fresh spinach, <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs. \n\ni totally surprised myself in ordering the salmon benedict. i'm not much of a fish person and the idea of having it for breakfast sort of disturbs me. but i was glad that i ordered it, i really enjoyed the chili cream because it gave the dish a nice kick. we were kind of disappointed in <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> because it didn't have as much flavor as we had expected. it was  totally under seasoned! another dish that surprised me was the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash. i was sort of expecting a pile of hash that looked like something that came out of the can, but it was actual strips of <mark>Corned Beef</mark>. they were nicely seasoned and quite tasty! i would have eaten more, but it wasn't the dish that i ordered. \n\nthe price for a single dish ranges from $11-15 bucks, which is super reasonable for the amount of food you're served. a single order of food can easily feed two people. \n\ni will definitely visit hash house a go go on my next trip to vegas because you just don't find that kind of breakfast food anywhere else!!",

            "3 1/2 stars to be more precise.\n\ni'm sure hash house a go go got a nice surge after being featured on man vs. food and the gratuitous plug from adam richman (who has one of the coolest jobs in the world by the way).  but me?  i dunno, i'm not overly impressed.  it's kind of middle of the road for myself.\n\ni'm a good eater...and at hash house a go go they do serve big food!  portions are ginormous and meals often come out on platters the size of a small hubcap.  you will almost always leave with a little doggie bag of leftovers!  alas, for me the flavors of the food doesn't particularly sing to my palette.  it just seems like you're going to a chain restaurant with lots of chain restaurant food, and it all just kinda tastes the same.  not bad, but not standout great.  when you combine the muted flavors with the high prices i have no choice but to knock you down a star or two.\n\nbut perhaps this is my fault.  people rave that this place is a great deal for breakfast, when they showcase the best things to have at hash house.  i ended up going for dinner so maybe my review is somewhat off-kilter.  but i gotta go off of what we ate, and it pains me to say it but it was all average.\n\nwe shared <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> tower ($18).  i saw pics of this platter online and thought we gotta have that.  in all?  it was ok.  the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was hot and juicy, but i couldn't get into the batter they dip it in.  it was a tad on the thick side and got in the way of the chicken.  also, the flavor was just bland, bland, bland.  not spicy, savory, or sweet like a decent <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>.  it was very plain.  the waffles stuffed with whole strips of bacon?  impressive, but again off in it's flavors.  the <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark> was delicious on its own, but the waffle needed some seasoning that the hot maple reduction couldn't offer.  the waffle was nice and crisp and chewy on the inside though like a waffle should be.\n\nwe also shared one of andy's twisted stuffed burgers ($15).  the one we got had roasted beef, smoked mozzarella, and charred tomato in it.  it came out in a huge stack which of course made it near impossible to eat.  i had to cut it into tinier portions just to pick it up!  doing this made my stuffed burger very uneven in the tasting.  i had a hard time getting to meld a bite that included all the fixings in the burger.  and by the time i finally got to eat my burger the juices from the patty made my bottom bun extra soggy.  i hate that.  and again, the flavors just seemed subdued somehow.  no zip, no zing, no tang, no mas!  it really just struck me as an average burger.  i've honestly had a better one for less money.  will this be the first place i suggest use a dash of msg in their food?  however, the fries were crisp and delicious. \n\nspeaking of sharing...there will be none of it had unless you like being charged for it!  seriously, you get charged a $4-5 fee if you are sharing one plate.  it seems a bit highway robbery if you ask me...serve me a too large portion of so-so food then punish me if i want to share?  i can see why obesity rates are high in the us.  so your best bet here is to order two plates of food (or an entree and a large side) if you're a couple and avoid that dumb fee altogether.  you will just have more leftovers to take home.  \n\nspeaking of leftovers...we left hash house with 3 (yes 3) containers of food for the ride home!  i indeed ate all i could and left full, but not satisfied.  a few hours later i decided on some of the leftovers for a midnight snack but again was met with the mediocre.  my leftovers didn't hold up well at all!  <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was soggy (and still bland), and the burger had gone on the rubbery side.  i was too disappointed thinking about throwing away all this food so i ended up eating it anyway.  not one of my finer moments.\n\nthe main reason why i still give a 3 1/2 star here was because of the service.  our waitress was very attentive and pleasant, and kept our drinks filled without much fuss.  she had some mad strong forearms too, defined!  must be from all the heavy duty platter lifting going on there.\n\nhate to say it hash house a go go, but i think if i ever try this place again it will be for breakfast or brunch.  please work on seasoning your food!  thanks, k bye!",

            "at my house we have several names for this place:  hash house a no go, hash house a no no, and hash house a no mo'.\n\nthe main problem is that man vs. food hyped the place as being excellent with humongous portions. we wanted to experience it just for the novelty.  amongst the three of us we had the pancakes with hash browns, eggs over easy and chicken sausage; the apple <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark> & mashed potato burger with fries and watermelon lemonade, and the <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, avocado & cheddar burger with the same fries. we also tried the barbecued ribs appetizer.\n\nfirst, the lemonade, which was tasty, was $5.00, no refills. that's way overpriced for lemonade that isn't spectacular, but it was attractive looking. next, we specifically asked for the appetizer to be brought out before the meal (sort of the definition of the term \"appetizer,\" right? we shouldn't have had to say anything) but it came after the meal was brought out. how ridiculous is that? so two disappointments.\n\nwhen the pancake came out it was large, but it was underwhelming compared to the hype it got on tv.  yes it was really big- bigger than one outstretched medium sized female hand. it filled up maybe 2/3 of the oval plate it was served on, leaving room for maybe one cup of cubed potatoes (hashbrowns) and 2 eggs over easy. but check out this photo from man vs. food: http://yhoo.it/18o6avt - this was clearly nothing close to what we got, hence the disappointment.   the seasoned potatoes had no flavor, and the pancake tasted like flour.  no flavor at all.  we asked for chicken sausage and one link arrived, splayed open on a small dish. it was basically a hot dog, not sausage.\n\non to the apple <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark> & mashed potato burger. the teenager enjoyed it greatly, however, the teenager likes just about anything. the burger has one pound of meat divided into two pre-made, pre-seasoned patties that are cooked in a press of some kind so that both sides are cooked simultaneously. this means no way to request medium rare.  sigh...\n\nthe <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, avocado & cheddar burger was tasty, although the meat flavor seemed to come from the grill without additional seasoning. well, let's just say the seasoning was mild. i won't complain too much about the burger- it was satisfying.  the fries serving size was average. i think they were seasoned, and had a nice crunch. \n\nthe ribs came in what appeared to be an asian-inspired sauce, which i liked. one of the  four ribs was perfect, with tender meat falling off the bone. the others were chewy and tough. hate to speculate on the disparity- i'll leave that to you. they were artfully leaned against a pile of cold, nasty-tasting potatoes.  what a waste of potato. we got the impression that much of the food is pre-packaged, pre-seasoned, so not much creativity happens in the preparation.\n\nthe atmosphere was different from what i expected- the dark lighting made a nice ambience even though the food is denny's quality.  i liked the distressed wood everywhere and the (very) heavy metal chairs.\n\nso, we will chalk this up to experience and probably not come back as a family, although i'd bring the teen here if he wanted the burger again. for $13 it wasn't so awful in my opinion. \n\noh- the waitress was excellent- she got a full 20% tip.", 
            "food- 4 stars\nservice- 4 stars\nwait time for food (once seated)- 5 stars \n\nafter reading so many amazing reviews about this place i decided to add it to our itinerary on our trip to vegas. i'm glad we did. \n\nif you are looking for a unique/delicious/huge portions place for breakfast. you must come here!!!!!\n\ni ordered their <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, avocado, onion & swiss scamble. everything about it was perfect. probably the best tasting breakfast i've ever had. my wife ordered their snicker pancake, also amazing (and huge) \n\nhash house a go go, has single-handily made me a better person. after eating there, i donate more time and money to charity and try and visit retirement homes on a regular basis.   if you want to become a better person and probably a little more sexy, you must try this life changing restaurant at least once... or you'll never know your true life potential. good day", 
            "best. <mark>French Toast</mark>. ever. it's big, it's thick, and it's topped with banana-cinnamon-pecan-maple-creamy goodness. it was so delicious paired with their crispy, <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>. i can't say enough about it. it was one of the best breakfasts i ever had.", 
            "prepare to unzip your pants and possibly vomit (in a good way)!\n\nthank you vegas foodies for rating this spot so high and posting so many foodgasm shots of their popular <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles plate. you guys led us here. and surprisingly, this place was packed on a random weekday during the daytime. we sat at the bar since there was no wait for the seating there. \n\ni ordered myself a monstrous hot chocolate to start. i seriously probably took about 3 sips of that thing. i felt so bad wasting all that warm, chocolatey goodness in that huge mug.\n\nfor grub i ordered one of their farm benedicts, hoping it wouldn't come out as huge as the the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles plate. boy was i wrong! my benedict came with <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, fresh tomato, fresh spinach, this roasted red pepper cream and topped w/ two basted eggs. what makes these benedicts so special is that they serve it on a fresh split biscuit with griddled <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. talk about carb overload! since i don't have a binge-eating disorder anymore, i barely made a dent even into this plate. boo!\n\nthe bf ordered an actual plate that didn't come out monstrous. i believe it was just a simple breakfast plate with eggs, meat and some potatoes. if he ordered a flapjack (which are the size of a thanksgiving turkey serving tray) he would have been screwed for sure.\n\neven if you plan to swing into this restaurant hungover, i suggest sharing a plate with 1 or even 2 other people! portions are more than plentiful.", 
            "holy crap!! huge portions, outstanding quality, fantastic service! who thinks to put red skinned <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, homemade biscuit, <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, spinach, applewood <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, eggs, hollandaise and chili cream sauce together?? this place,....and thank goodness they did,.....original and amazing!!! soooo worth the 20 minute wait!!! highly recommended!!! come to the freestanding location, i hear it's better than the one in the casino. atmosphere here is fun, a little loud and very friendly :-)", 
            "this place is the very definition of a gut-buster. \n\nportions are so huge, it's ridiculous. there's no way you'll be able to finish everything on your plate, unless you stick with a side of toast. even then, you'll probably end up with an entire loaf. i was drawn here because of man v. food, and ended up ordering the dish that adam made famous: it's advertised as a \"farm benedict,\" but what benedict have you ever seen that included a mound of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>? in addition to <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, fresh spinach, <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs? this thing isn't a benedict, it's a house! a very tasty house, as it turns out, but still. i have a pretty good appetite, but was finished only halfway through. my wife ordered the riddled <mark>French Toast</mark> dipped in banana cinnamon cream w/ pecan maple syrup, and lest you think her portion was any smaller, you'd be wrong. like i said, this place thrives on excess! the <mark>French Toast</mark> was chewy and delicious, with a hint of vanilla, and the warm bananas were a divine accompaniment. it all paired perfectly well with smoky bacon. again though, it was impossible to finish more than half. because we were on the road, this sadly meant wasting some of that delicious food, as there wasn't really an opportunity to eat the leftovers later. \n\nyou've gotta love a place that sells a hangover dish called <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark>: a 24 oz budweiser in a bag with a side of bacon.\n\nclassy? nope. but fun? absolutely. \n\nno matter how hungry you are, you will leave hash house a go go stuffed to the gills, vowing never to eat another bite of food again for the rest of your life. \n\nand the next morning, you'll be yearning for a return visit...", 
            "after reading so many positive reviews, we decided stop here after the mall. i had read some reviews at the mall of so the hype was definitely set. when looking at the picture this place for me seem like \"comfort food\" with a twist. when we pulled up to a near empty parking lot we knew we did not have to to wait for a table. the hostess quickly seated us. the menu was massive and t took me a good 2 or 3 minutes to figure out where to start. our server according to our receipt was jay. he quickly took our drinking order and was prompt on service this evening this is a bonus. our waiter brought out the drinks and offered us complementary biscuits big portions. for hash house a go go \"big portions\" is a complete and total understatement. warning this place has monster size plates of food leaving the kitchen! this is not the restaurant to be eating with your eyes. \n\nnow, let's move onto the food quality. we had a total of four dishes the first  is the hash house meat loaf pasta. it had charred tomato, basil pesto and crispy parmesan cheese. this pasta was an a decent dish but my taste for pasta has changed since i went to italy. pasta in the united states is unable to compete with it. the slow grilled bbq pork ribs was amazing. i highly recommend this dish. the ribs are braised with a house soy bbq sauce and served with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. the ribs was tender and the meat just fell off the bone.the potatoes was the only disappoint on this dish since is was dry. the kokokmo, is meatloaf with tomato and griddled smooth mozzarella cheese on milk bread. reminded me a lot of a mozzarella grilled cheese sandwich with meatloft. it took an extra couple of minutes for the last dish to arrival comared to the other dishes for some reason. the last dish was the famous one pound stuffed burger. we had the <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, avocado & cheddar it comes with two patties with lettuce tomato and red onion. the prices were a little higher than i usually like to pay, but once we saw the plates of food coming out it didn't matter anymore. the presentation of all the dishes was well done (picture will be posted soon).\n\nhighly recommend the kokokmo and slow grilled bbq pork ribs. so if you are planning to eat here get hungry and make sure to wear some sweatpants!", 
            "i was really looking forward to trying this place after seeing it years ago on man v food. i hate to say it but i was disappointed. first off its super crowded every time you go there (been there twice) and they don't take reservations. one good thing is they do have a bloody mary bar so at least you can drink while you wait but being severely hungover and standing around for 15+ minutes is never ideal. the portions here are huge so make sure to share with a friend or two, even if you normally eat a lot. me and two others shared the man v food special benedict, <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> w/ fresh spinach, <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs. the presentation while huge was nice (and intimidating) but all in all the flavor just wasn't there. this is definitely a cool place to visit once in your life if just for the gigantic porportions and bloody mary bar but not top on my list taste wise.",

            "i've been to this location twice. both times exceeded my expectations. i've learned the quickest way to get a seat, is to go to the bar. i probably shouldn't tell you that secret, but it's not like i go there everyday so, i'm fine with that. \n\nanyway, i had a scramble the first time i was there. their breakfast potatoes (crispy) are great. the eggs are the usual and i had sausage and spinach in my scramble. while i was eating i noticed this monstrosity of goodness going by me twice. i decided the next time i go here, i will eat this. \n\nit turns out, it was the dish that was featured on the man vs. food show. it's the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> with fresh spinach, <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs this thing is monstrous. i, being a big dude, was able to finish it all because my friend challenged me to do so (prick). i was also hungover and wanted something to soak up all the booze from the night before. \n\nthis thing was tasty and took quite a bit to eat. the only thing i would change, and which i will ask of next time i get this, is to have it with the crispy potatoes. i love <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, but for breakfast i prefer the crunchy hash potato browns.\n\nthe service was great. the bartender was very attentive. she got everything out quick, made a damn good iced coffee, and i didn't have to worry about going empty. \n\nanother cool thing, i saw dee snider, lead singer of twisted sister, at the restaurant. nice guy. didn't bother him for a picture, but i did shake his hand. \n\noverall, very good restaurant. definitely a fan. the only reason i gave one star is because it could be pricey. breakfast shouldn't be that expensive, but then again, the portions are hugggggeeeee.", 
            "the <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark> mash potato burger i had was great, i feel like the mash wasn't enough lubricant for the whole burger though. found my mouth dry at times. crispy fries were excellent, and the mango iced tea was good. since the tea is so strong i think it'd be better if it had more of a mango taste. also i think it'd be better if it was sweeter."

            "ive been hearing that this is the breakfast joint to hit up in vegas.  we went to this b/c i was so hungry after completing the first las vegas half marathon.  this place is away from the hustle and bustle of the strip on the west side of town.  it was a very good sign to see how busy this place was and how long the wait was.  just waiting outside and peaking into the heated outdoor eating area, you could see how enormous the plates were.  i should correct myself...they were enormous platters, not plates.  we were told that a party of 4 would be unable to sit in the bar area b/c the platters were huge.  \ni was impressed with the wide selection of breakfast items.  first off, going against the rules of post workout re hydration, i couldnt resist trying a libation from the mixed drink selection, why?  why not?  check this out...hash house bloody mary...premium vodka, bloody mary mix, fresh lemon juice, celery salt, worcestershire and hot sauce, spicy pickled green beans (with extras ordered), 2 jalapeno stuffed olives, and a mt olive kosher petite dill pickle, with fresh cracked pepper sprinkled on top...f@ckin hella savory ...that won me there at that point.\ni ended up choosing the <mark>HH Famous Meatloaf</mark> with roasted red peppers, fresh spinach, and smoked mozzarella all on big chunks of fried potatoes.  my favorite and lovely dining companion ordered the farmer's daughter house hash that came with two eggs your way, biscuit, watermelon, and portabello mushrooms, cheddar cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, etc. on also...big chunks of fried potatoes.  both came on a huge skillet (which they called their \"smaller\" dishes...lies...they were huge...i just finished the leftovers 2 days later)  my other dining companion had a decadent omelet filled with <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> and melted brie.  also, all our orders arrived with flaky biscuits, so you get to top it with some their own homemade strawberry jam (we ended up packaging some of the jam up for home...too bad it doesn't last long enough, not from me eating it all, but b/c it has no preservatives!!!\nthis ranks high in my favorite breakfast places to eat.  i will definitely return here with my lovely dining companion to enjoy the other things on the menu, such as the sundried tomato, basil & <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark> scrambled eggs, or the mushroom, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato and fresh spinach hash, or even the roasted <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark>, charred tomato, corn, baby green beans and mozzarella hash, and definitely for that damn bloody mary.",

            "didn't live up to the hype of my foggy memories from my last visit.  it was late-night, but the restaurant wasn't busy and this time i was sober and unfortunately recommended it to my group.  our server was neither good at her job nor friendly.  i had to get up and get ketchup from another table myself just to enjoy my bland breakfast potatoes.  i got a scramble with sundried tomatoes, basil and <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark> and the eggs weren't tasty and there wasn't enough of the compliments to compensate.  they served me a huge biscuit with my meal, but there was no honey, jam or jelly to be found and i even overheard another customer asking for something to go with his biscuit and there was just nothing.  the server made no effort to serve the right food or drinks to the person who ordered, just handed it to us and walked off and then we sorted it out, of course the bills were also a mess.  i won't return on my next visit.",

            "every trip to las vegas, we make it a point to stop at least once for breakfast . . . not sure what happened in the last year and half . . . but the food quality and flavor, at least a this location seems to have wained.\n\norder from there specials menu . . . seshawanie hash with an extra biscuit . . . the venison sausage was bland, the aspragas and peppers were on the raw side, the <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark> tasted spoiled, but the biscuits were great.\n\nmaybe this location has just gotten old and complacent . . . either way . . . a visit to the hash-house-a-go-go is a right of passage for us . . . so next time we will have to try one of the other locations . . . but we are still fans . . .", 
            "this review is primarily focused on the service. came to this location last sunday for brunch. it was very busy considering that it was around 1:30 pm. this is the only hash house that is located in a single standing building. the others are within hotels/casinos.  the wait took about 40 minutes for a table for 4. our waitress, erin, had a very flat affect straight from the start. she wasn't very friendly nor helpful.  i asked her if the couples could split the bill and she said it would be fine. we ordered our entrees, which consisted of the sun dried tomatoes, basil and <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark> farm scrambles, buttermilk flapjacks and the <mark>French Toast</mark>. all were very tasty and had good portions. one <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> to the food was the amount of syrup they gave with the <mark>French Toast</mark> and flapjacks. they gave a tiny shot glass worth of syrup for each dish. we had to ask for extra syrup about 3 times because these dishes needed the syrup. so when the bill comes, it had not been split, so i quickly reminded her to split the bill. i was going to mention which dishes on the credit cards but she replied \"i know what dishes you guys got\" in a very rude tone. yeeesh. she looked at my boyfriend and asked which card was his. he told her his name. the other couple's card had his picture on it. so when she returns with the split bills, she still managed to screw everything up and mix up the items with the cards. at this point, i was quite frustrated so i went back to look for her and just told her what had happened. she apologized but it honestly didn't seem like she cared.  we wanted to leave so we just signed the bills without changing them and left. \n\nthis experience left a sour taste in my mouth. the service at the other hash houses are pretty good. not sure if i want to go to this location again.", 
            "this is one of my favorite places to take visiting family and friends. be aware that the portions are huge. as in, you need to split something with someone else, or be prepared to take half of your entree home. everyone raves about the chicken and waffles, and while it is an impressive spectacle, i found both the chicken and the waffles to be terribly bland. one dish i keep coming back to is the sun dried tomato , <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark> and basil omelette with crispy potatoes. this thing is full of flavor and tastes ridiculously fresh. the biscuits here are out of this world; you have to try it with the house-made strawberry jam and honey butter! i've also had the chicken biscuit benedict, and it's definitely my second favorite meal at this place. the husband always orders the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, and it is always delicious! flavorful, juicy, and you'll have a second portion to take home and enjoy the next day.\n\nfriends i have taken to this establishment always leave disappointed if they order a salad or a sandwich, so, be warned....", 
            "i finally made my way back after coming here in 2009. this was before all the other locations on the strip opened. on my return trip i wanted to come back to the original location in vegas. i've seriously dreamed about this place. i have raved to friends that hash house will ruin breakfast at all other places. the husband and i ordered enough for 4, but i really wanted him to try everything.\n\npumpkin latte - perfect balance of pumpkin flavor.\n\n<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles - still the absolute best chicken and waffles! chicken breast was perfectly fried and moist. waffles had bacon strips in them!\n\nsnickers pancakes - love that they are the size of a pizza pie! a little disappointed since i love the mango coconut pancake i had 4 years ago. the husband loves snickers and isn't a fan of coconut, so he picked this one. good, but a little drier. pancakes with fruit are the way to go.\n\nsausage hash - tasty with peppers, sausage and <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark>. potatoes were yummy too! \n\nwe finished most of the food as this was our pre-trip home lunch stop before heading to the airport for a 6 hour flight. staff was friendly. i look forward to coming back the next time we are in town. \n\n*chicken & waffles is a must!",

            "five stars for a brunch place? hell yeah!  (i haven't had their dinner menu, but for a weekend brunch, it hits the spot!) \n\nafter driving by numerous times and being intrigued by the name of the restaurant alone, it was about time i got a chance to experience what the hash house was really all about.  \n\nafter about a 20 minute wait, we were starving.  it didn't help that we could see (stare) at what the diners were chowing on as they sat on the patio.  gigantic portions of anything and everything, that's for sure!\n\ni had their special mimosa with pom tangerine.  can i say yum?  if my boyfriend will make me a pitcher of that, i promise to get drunk real fast!  my other dining companions had their hh bloody mary with all the fixings.  those darn fixings were fabuloso!  they came with these vinegared blue lake string beans and stuffed green olives.  i heard two exclamations of \"i think this the best bloody mary i have ever had!\"  hot damn!  that was 2 for 2!\n\nfor food, i ordered their special farmer's daughter house hash that came with two eggs your way, biscuit, watermelon, and portabello mushrooms, cheddar cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, etc. on potatoes.  it was damn good!  my bf had the <mark>HH Famous Meatloaf</mark> hash house with spinach, meatloaf chunks, cheese and some other stuff on potatoes, along with two eggs his way, watermelon and a biscuit.  these house hashes arrived on a big ole' skillet and were hearty portions, which could easily be shared by two.  \n\nmy other dining companion had a omelet with salmon and brie.  the brie was such a nice and smooth taste to the omelet. yummy!  and our 4th diner chose two eggs with bacon and toast.  both orders arrived with a gigantic mound of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> that were tasty too.  \n\nthe best part...thank goodness the waitress told us about the homemade strawberry jam!  we were slathering that all over our biscuits and were just about to slather it all over ourselves. it was that good!  hot damn!\n\nlooking around at other diners, they had massive salads, gigantic pancakes and waffles that were falling over the edge of the plate, and huge sandwiches.  it all looked so good!  portions were plenty and you definitely feel like you get a big bang for your buck!  \n\ni was definitely curious to see if the dessert menu was so generous.  unfortunately, we were told the desserts were of average size.  they only had a strawberry cobbler, cheesecake, and some snickers thing.  but then again, with all this food...who makes it to dessert anyway?    \n\nservice was fabulous!  our waitress was super friendly, being patient with our delay in ordering and even bringing over more bloody mary fixings so we could devour.  \n\nwith a name like this, i am confident that you can have a feast after a little 'hash' of your own!  i'm even putting this restaurant into my \"top restaurants\" and \"nice date restaurants in vegas\" because if a boy brought me here 'the morning after', he would get a gold star in my book for sure!  that's right boys...if you're letting the girl stay over into brunch time and you bring her here, she'll be more than happy to go back to your place again (assuming you give her a chance to digest!).  and ladies, if you bring the guy here the morning after, he'll be sure to stick around for a few more mornings after for sure!  \n\nanyone who wants a hearty brunch in vegas away from the strip, hash house a go go is your place to go!  their numerous awards for breakfast and brunch are well deserved!\n\nupdate: 01/04/07 - i recently went back for their special blue lump crab cake with chili mayo <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> ($15.95).  the mayo had a nice zing for the crab cake and the deep fried angel hair pasta garnishment had a nice crunch.  it was a yummy dish and big enough to share.  it's a $2.50 split charge if you do share it.  their homemade jam was a mixed berry concoction this time.  i also tried their banana pancake with cinnamon.  the bf loved it, i'm more of a waffle kind of girl myself.\n\n(check out the photos above of my good eats!)", 
            "ew.\n\ni mean, ew.\n\nit's adorable, in a prefab sort of way. and the servers are cute, sassy, and sharp. and the stuff on the menu sounds good. but damn, the ugly pile of slop they served me was nauseating. \n\ni mean, the individual parts tasted good enough, but it was so unappetizing and enormous, it really did put me off my food. (and trust me, i have no problem with over the top food... but this was just gross.) \n\nsupposedly a \"benedict\", my brunch included a giant pile of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, two enormous biscuits, 4 slices of bacon, at least 3 scrambled eggs, a melted-crisp slice of mozzerella, and chipotle hollandaise. oh, and a couple pieces of fruit, so you could eat healthy. when the waiter saw the look on my face, he said \"isn't it great?\" uh, no. no, actually. and, no.\n\nmy mom's brunch was a little less jumbo: meatloaf hash, fried eggs, and a biscuit, served in a full-size cast-iron skillet. it could have fed us both, amply, with leftovers. it was huge, but not disgustingly so.\n\ngreat concept, heartland food in a hip setting. but a truly nauseating execution.", 
            "when god appointed gluttony as a sin. he was eating at hash house. plan on not dieting when you eat here. the biscuits can feed an etheopian kid for a week. their farm food with a twist is more like farm food is twisted. ever go to a pancake house and order a stack or even a short stack. uncle buck would be impressed by their one pancake. mmmm i had the pineapple and coconut one. yum....i've had the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash there, the chicken and waffles. ok it's not roscoe's, but when waffles have bacon sticking out of them....fun.  i defnitely like the presentation. it's the size of a sushi boat.  i've also had the the chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>. technically i like chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> as a pie. not as an upside down pie crust hat with ladles of chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> innards and a mound of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. \ni definitely liked the flattened piece of fried pork goodness. hmmm i wish they had rice....you can't give a filipino pork without rice....\noverall the food is good. just insultingly large. it makes buffets look like 1 trip. \ncocktails inventive.....bloody mary with pickled green beans?  nice!\ncoffee drinks....just order the coffee with the smore's goodness on there.....\nbudgetwise - it's reasonable for the amount of food you get. ok does idaho have potato shortages from this place.\nyea too many little fried spaghetti thingies and those damn leeks. save the fried leeks!", 
            "this is my first 3 star review.  i feel all dirty inside.  so, let  me toss the pro and cons right at ya!!!\n\ni've dined at hash house many time's.  mostly because i have lot's of friends who come to town for short visits and don't wanna go to a casino. it does have a nice atmosphere. ( for being a converted chevy's....yes, it's a converted chevy's)  one of the most consistent things is the cocktail's. i love me the gin and tonic!!! whooo!!!  especially bombay sapphire and tonic.  every time i order one at the hash house, it's perfect. so, pro 1 is that they have a great bartender.\npro 2 it's got atmos.\n\nnow for the crap fest.....at first appearance their giant plate with a branch of rosemary ( i'm pretty sure it's rosemary ) sticking right out of the top is awesome, however, for the most part a plate of bl<mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  any restaurant that has a beautiful steak on the menu, then covers it in tasteless gravy and buries it in mushed potatoes....needs to go back to the drawing board.   i'm not sure where i read it, but a true test of an great restaurant is how they serve a steak.  sad part is the beef was fantastic, cooked just the way i wanted it....but, covered in crap and under seasoned.  booo!\n\nin closing....they got personality.  and most people say a great breakfast menu too.  (giant pancakes, cute)  i've had breakfast there.....packed with people, had a salmon scramble....dry and way fishy, ick!  it was accompanied by a swell mimosa.....so they got the liquor part in spades.  take a chance and feel their vibe, but when you choose what to eat, be really friggin picky!!!!", 
            "huge portions and long waits are the name of the game here.  it was about 30 minute wait for us - not too bad, i suppose.  \n\nthey don't use plates here - think platters, obesity and the answer to why europeans are more healthy than us!\n\ni ordered the delicious bacon avocado swiss and onion scramble with their crispy potatoes and a biscuit w/freshly made strawberry jam. i recommend forgoing those and trying the griddled <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  i found the crispy potatoes flavorless and boring.  the biscuit and strawberry jam were divine, however.\n\nthey have a full bar and feature some midwestern kitsch - such as milwaukees best in a brown bag as one of the menu items.  love the attitude on the menu.\n\nthe server almost messed up the order and gave my scramble to a couple who had just arrived.  it was corrected quickly. \n\ndefinitely worth the drive from the strip, but if you're looking for a good breakfast and looking to get away from the casinos, save your money and try blueberry hill.   i think that's a better value.", 
            "so you want breakfast do you? this contemporary southern cuisine is, hoe do you say, in-cred-ible.  it's mostly a breakfast spot but the lunch is worth it as well. whenever i have people in town this place is on the to-do list. be ready to share or for leftovers because the portions are gi-normous. it's comfort food at it's best. they serve my absolute fav dish in this town, <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. not your typical breakfast selection i know.  it's a piece of <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> on top of scrambled eggs and spinach on top of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and bacon on top of a huge biscuit cover with a chipotle cream sauce that is nothing short of heaven. the flapjack is the next on my list. yeah that's singular. that's because it's pretty much the size of a medium pizza. the coffee is very strong which i like but i know i'm in the minority on that one.  \n\nthe staff is very nice but you have to remember that great food takes time so if you are in a hurry you might want to try somewhere else. expect about a 10 - 30 minute wait here on the weekends but you golden on the weekdays. for the weekend warriors why not try the beer-in-a-bag special they have while you wait. it's a bud tall can in a brown paper bag. a nevada classic!",

            "omg . . . too much food.  there.  i've said it.  thought i'd never say it, but there you go.\n\ni recently went to hash house for breakfast.  i've always wanted to try the one in san diego, but could never find parking.  as i passed the vegas location, i saw it had its own parking lot and decided to give it a try.  the food was great  - - we had the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash and the basic breakfast.  to back my opening statement, whats known as the \"basic\" breakfast was huge!  i don't know how many eggs were used but suffice to say it was a lot, the ham steak was a very thick cut and of great quality, the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and roasted potatoes were plentiful.  all i can say is you won't be disappointed.\n\ni've said the mantra \"i don't mind paying for quality, just don't skimp on the food\" many times.  that said, you'll find the prices \"a bit up there\"  compared to average breakfast, but hash house is anything but average.  the quality and quantity is great.\n\nfinally, be warned . . . you'll either leave stuffed to brim, or have a hefty take home bag.  good eating at the hash house.",

            "this place is great after a night of drinking and gambling. my coffee with bailey's was perfectly matched with my breakfast, <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> - indiana favorite. the menu is full of yummy stuff. don't go if you expect a healthy meal - this is strictly meant for the meat <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> crowd.\n\nthey have unique menu items like ohare <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark>(a tall can beer served with an order of bacon) and a special called the boston melt(large crab cakes on top of a homemade biscuit covered in cheese served with french fries). portions are generous (i mean dishes are served on platters, you know the platters you see at thanksgiving dinner?). you definitely get your money's worth. the place is always packed and the service could be a little slow, depending on the crowd, but a definite must in vegas.",

            "i thought cheesecake factory is the only restaurant that serves oversize portions, boy was i wrong! hash house a go go serves gigantic portions with its unique menu items, from chicken and waffles to elegant prepared mahi mahi with blue crab cake.\n\nhubby and others ordered the special for the night, which was the chicken and waffles for $12.95 compared to $18 something on other nights. when it came out, it was taller than me (sitting down, of course). i was very surprised that the chicken were 2 thick pieces of huge breast meat. the chicken was crispy and a little sweet from the glaze. i thought the batter may need a little bit more seasoning but still decent.\n\ni ordered the mahi mahi with blue crab cake ($27). the presentation looked like i was at a fancy 5 stars restaurant; it was gorgeous. the taste was different but good enough for me to almost finished the entire entree. the dish started out with a bed of two mounds of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, then layered with with two pieces of mahi mahi and then the blue crab cake which was covered with the pesto sauce. it also came with a side of carrots.\n\nover all the experience was enjoyable because the entree were fun to look at and atmosphere was nice.\n\nthe service was great. we arrived here 30 minutes before closing, and still sat all seven us down with a friendly smile. they didn't rush or anything even though we felt bad.",

            "ah, the famous hash house a go go.  i was dying to try this place for months and was very pleased with the food.  between 3 of us, we ordered:\n\nmeatloaf hash - very good, moist, tasty and full of flavor...potatoes that it came with were a bit bland and nothing special, biscuit was good once you added some butter and jam, but dry by itself\n\nbrown sugar banana pancake - the best thing we ordered...brown sugar carmelizes the outside for a nice sweet and crispy texture\n\nblueberry pecan pancake - nothing special, just a giant blueberry pancake\n\nbanana <mark>French Toast</mark> - another excellent item...just like the pancakes, the brown sugar coating makes it nice and crisp...you dont even really need syrup for it...\n\nquesadilla - humungous!...probably about an inch and a half thick and full of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>...could have used some meat in it to make it better...this is something the table should share, rather than one person eating it for sure...\n\nand surprisingly, with 2 girls and me, we ate it all.  the waitress said, she \"had never seen anything like it before.\"  haha  my friends and i can eat and when you see us, you would never expect it. \n\noverall, this place is excellent and i would return.  next try, the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, which was gigantic and looked delicious.",

            "it was nice to get away from the bustle of the vegas strip to come try hash house a go go for brunch. the wait took around an hour for the 5 of us since it was pretty darn busy on a saturday afternoon. we just sat around and admired all the autographed menus lining the entry way. their menu had an incredible selection too! i think i would have had trouble deciding if my friend marti l. hadn't already suggested a dish that sounded delish.\n\n<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> meal ($13.95 and $2.50 extra to split the dish) - omg!! the portions were humongous! no wonder hh was featured on man vs. food before. haha the prices are totally worth it if you share the dish with one or 2 other people. my faves were the bacon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and fresh baked biscuit. the chicken didn't taste of sage at all to me and a was a little dry...there wasn't enough maple reduction but was fried to perfection!

(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/g8onv26ywjlzpezdbnowuq?select=avvdot4cdksnfccsuuy5vg) the batter was soft/chewy and the bacon complimented it very well. the food took around 20 min to come out but it was well worth the wait! our waitress was dressed like the chiquita banana lady too. lol\n\nfun meal and great, affordable food!", 
            "i am a fan of the hash house a go go in san diego thanks to my friend tomi who turned me on to it a few years back during the comicon... \n\nthis past weekend we were in vegas for a friend's wedding and were pleasantly surprised to find out the owners opened location in the city of sin. \n\nafter taking a zantac 75 pill, we headed over to the area to settle in and wait a good 45 minutes for a table for 2. patience is key here friends; this location apparently has been on man vs food (which i'm not familiar with) and some other food network shows. \n\ni had the watermelon kiwi cooler which was beautiful to behold and deliciously refreshing to drink! \ni have a sensitive stomach so i decided to go easy and order the blueberry pecan flapjacks with two bacon strips and eggs over easy. the pancake, as m put it, was bigger than his head! hehe... \n\ndamn was that pancake good although i only finished about 20% of it. m had the basic or original breakfast which consisted of eggs, bacon or ham <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. still gigantic for a mere $8.95 price tag. \n\nour server was great if not a bit harried due to the overwhelming crowds due to a biker convention in town! i took my dear flapjack to go and tore a few pieces off later to munch on before sending the remaining bits into the ye olde hotel room trashcan. \n\ni would recommend going at least once to check this place out. the decor is fun, the servers wearing great outfits and the food spot on. yes, it is crowded and a bit crazy inside but the experience is worth it to see giant food. \n\nthis place also reminds me of a now defunct restaurant in new york called royal canadian pancake house that i used to go to in the early early 90's... anyone remember or been there? \n\nanyways, go check it out!", 
            "first off--yes, i went because i saw it on man vs food. \n\nnow that is out of the way... \n\nthere were three of us. i ordered what i saw on tv, the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. friend #1 had the <mark>French Toast</mark>. friend #2 had the chicken salad sandwich. \n\n<mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>: it was big as my head, without exaggeration. this will server 3 people. i barely ate 1/3rd.. but i am not a huge portion eater anyways. i saw a biker kind of guy next to us eat 3/4 of it, which i though was super impressive. flavours? a little too much on the plate. you get a mixture of spicy, creamy, zesty, etc.. it's really hard to describe. if you don't know it by now, i'll call it out from bottom up; <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, biscuit, tomato slice, spinach, bacon, griddled cheese, <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breast.. and all drizzled with chipole cream sauce. it is definitely a brunch item, not breakfast. i have to say, i saw a someone else order it, but with the sauce on the side. smart! \n\n<mark>French Toast</mark>: more like, french loaf. again, massive insane portions. only half was eaten. but i sampled this, and it was quite delicious. probably one of the best <mark>French Toast</mark> that i had. \n\nchicken salad sandwich: by far the best chicken salad sandwich i have ever tried. nice dill flavour, and moist chicken meat. the multigrain bread was excellent too. fries were super hot and fresh. they had a bit of coating on them (very very lightly), and helped stay crispy until the end. \n\nyou must try the waltermelon-kiwi lemonade. very delicious, and thirst quenching. \n\nprice-wise, it can be considered as a good value, just because of the portions. i would say, share dish. do not attempt at it alone. \n\nservice was prompt and friendly, despite the hectic atmosphere.",

            "\"so, have you guys been to hash house a go go yet?\" asked the young woman at the front desk of the marriott grand chateau timeshare where we were staying in las vegas.  (good place, that marriott property, but that's a different review.) \n\nwe told her that we'd heard of \"hash house\" and the claim to fame for big portions which was not our thing - we'd rather have a little of something really good than a lot of something mediocre.  \"ah\", she said, \"the food there is really good.  but be sure you split an order..\"\n\nsince she, like my husband, was from brooklyn and even grew up in the same neighborhood, he was inclined to take her advice.  (\"a girl from the neighborhood can't be wrong\" he said.)  we're' so glad we did because she was right on all counts.   hash house a go go is a great place, the food is really good, and it's wise to split an order!\n\nwe stopped for breakfast at about 10:30 on a wednesday morning.  the place was jumping and  we  had to wait ten minutes for a table. (a good sign at mid week in down economy, we think.)  a few minutes of wait gave us time to look around and we noted how inviting and sparkling clean everything was.  also from \"meet and seat\" through \"order and eat\" the service was friendly and top notch.  \n\nthe breakfast menu had lots of options, both more familiar and highly unique.  we opted for more familiar and split a bacon, avocado, cheese and egg scramble that came with delectable pan fried <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, there's a novelty for breakfast, and a perfect buttermilk biscuit. honest to goodness homemade strawberry jam was on the table...none of that \"individual serving container\" corn syrup laden stuff here!. \n\nbreakfast was only about $12.00 and fed us both with more than we could eat.

            "i ate at the establishment inside the imperial palace. thank gawd they replaced that awful teahouse cafe with this restaurant. it rocks! now as you probably already know..the food portions are not for the weak or sorta hungry people...you better be friggin starving cause you have no business being in a place like this! if you share a meal they will charge you about $3 or $4 to split. a tip..if you're gonna order a side salad (btw anything \"side\" here is a full order of fatness) or a side of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> or even just the biscuits, then they won't charge you the split fee. when we had breakfast, the nice waitress recommended i get the biscuits which were only $2.95 so that i didn't get charged that dumb fee. by the way, the biscuits are yummy and the fresh made jam of the day (we had peach but i got to try strawberry at dinner) just complimented that goodness. ok on to breakfast...my boo ordered a spicy bloody maria to start..their version of a bloody mary but with an extra kick and i had a mojito...both were liquid delights and both gave us that nice buzz to prepare us for the behemoth of behemoths chicken and waffles!! it's a monster rraaaaahhhh!!...2 pieces of a breaded then <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> along side a stack of not 1, not 2, but 4 bacon stuffed (yep bacon stuffed) waffles. a steak knife is stabbed literally thru the middle of this mount fiji of wonder. the syrup is a sweet and yummy and the waffles are dee-lish. the chicken could be a tad less dry and they were a little bland but everything else on the plate was fatty already so i overlooked this. i guess we felt like we didn't get enough cholesterol running thru our arteries, so we headed back for dinner! yay!  this time we shared the <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. no need for sides so we just took the split charge fee. my daughter ordered the \"kids\" burger. ok...the plate that held this shamu of  a <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark>  was literally about 2 feet wide! no jokes..this plate probably weighed almost 10 pounds!  the <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> was pounded thin, breaded and fried to a crispy goodness and laid atop a mound of bacon cheese <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. there was some cool fried thin spaghetti pasta decorating on top of this that was actually edible......yeah go big or go home i say! my daughter's burger was definitely not kid size..no surprise here..and it was juicy and lovely. ahhhhhhhhhhh.....hash house...my food memories of you will always haunt my dreams..i don't know if i consider you a good dream or a great nightmare. my hats off to you imperial palace..you just found yourself a \"winner winner chicken dinner!\" kind of place :)", 
            "this is a review for breakfast.\n\nthe skinny: extreme portion sizes but hit-or-miss execution (3) service: not bad however we usually get there when it opens to beat the rush (3) value: pricing is a little pricy however you will for sure have leftovers unless you order 1 entree/2 people (3).\n\nwe come here for breakfast whenever we feel like a) we can get here early enough to beat the rush, b) we have to take the car in for service, c) we feel like pigging out in the morning.\n\nby far, the best dish here is <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benny. it sounds kinda gross - <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, bacon, <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, biscuit and gravy - but it's kind of a guilty pleasure. it's a total heart attack on a plate but very flavourful - sweet, crunchy, buttery goodness.\n\ntheir biscuits are great with their homemade strawberry jam. delish.\n\nnow for the bad news.\n\nthe pancakes here aren't bad either however their batter lacks the mild crispiness likely due to their size. blueberry pecan is better than blackberry granola in imho. \n\n<mark>French Toast</mark> is okay but a little too sweet.\n\ntheir chicken 'n waffles were not that good - the waffles were too saturated in syrup and were soggy. the chicken was fine though.\n\nyou need to bring a crew with you when you come here to eat because of the large portion sizes. i would suggest ordering maybe 1 entree per 2 people and then order the minimum amount for the second (such as a biscuit with butter). seriously - one entree will keep you nibbling for at least 2 days.\n\noverall, some good stuff, some not so good stuff. 3 star review.",

            "i recently saw a cable show where a limousine company turned a ferrari into a limo.  it had never been done before. frankly, it was preposterous. one of the guys interviewed said their biggest challenge was finding a way to make the supercar a stretch limo while maintaining the driving characteristics of a ferrari. and somehow, they did it.  although a bit less of an engineering challenge, the folks at hash house a-go-go construct entrees that ride this fine line between quality and mega size.\n\nfeatured on the travel channel's man v. food, hash house specializes in their self-proclaimed \"twisted farm food,\" basically jumbo-sized offerings and off-beat interpretations of traditional american favorites.  while their \"twisted\" fare is available at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, they're probably best known for their breakfast.  we visited the day after thanksgiving around 10:30a and had a predictably long wait (45-50 mins). consistent with the rebel streak they're going for, walls at their sahara ave. location are adorned with diamond plate textured metal and large nuts and bolts. the industrial look suggests that guys into bikes and hot rods would feel right at home.\n\nwe ordered their signature <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> and tractor driver special with mango coconut pancakes (and for the record, it was my petite wife who chose to order the benedict). there's no denying the benedict was a monstrosity: a layer of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, scrambled eggs, <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, tomato, mozzarella, and spinach topped with <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and generous amounts of their chipotle cream (gravy). and because anything this big merits a tree-topper, they plant a long sprig of fresh sage right on top.  good grief.  i have to say my initial impression was genuine awe with undertones of mild disgust. this was clearly a dream for anyone who derives regular enjoyment from kfc's \"famous bowls.\" pushing past our bizarre feelings of hunger laced with nausea, dorothy and i started picking at the gravy-laden structure. and to our surprise, there were some nice flavor combinations depending on where you chose to bury your fork. the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> itself was done well--crispy with nice chunks of moist white meat. combined with a bite of potato and gravy, the chicken evoked a holiday meal more than it did breakfast. the chipotle cream had a nice hint of smokiness, but as it cooled down, the self-hatred to taste ratio definitely increased.  \n\nonly lacking tomato sauce and the fact it wasn't tossed into the air at any point during its life cycle, my pancake was basically a medium to large-sized pizza. once again, i was pleasantly surprised, particularly by the lack of any \"doughiness,\" or uncooked batter. the pancake itself wasn't the best i've had, but it was adequately fluffy and a solid effort, bolstered by generous chunks of fresh juicy mango and shredded coconut. not bland, but not too sweet, some pieces of cake could be eaten without syrup. my eggs were soft scrambled just right, and the sausage links plump and tasty (i've found that a decent test of a cook's competency with eggs is to order them soft scrambled; not having them overcooked or gushing of yolk requires just a bit of care and timing). the kiwi watermelon lemonade was a nice way to top things off--tasty and refreshing, but lacking any heavily-syruped sweetness.               \n\nit goes without saying that visits to these kinds of restaurants require a pre-meal regimen of a week-long fast, meditation, and a check-up with your doctor.  i think a regular visit would risk a gross-out burn-out.  although, glancing at the scrambles and other egg dishes of our fellow patrons, it seems that slightly more modest meals are possible.  i've noticed a number of folks complaining about the price, which is perplexing. while the benedict cost $15.95 and the pancacke combo $14.95 (both at the top of their breakfast price scale), i'd point out that you're actually getting about $15.95 and $14.95 worth of food when ordering these dishes.  each dish could easily feed two hungry human beings.  sure, maybe they could drop a buck or so off the price, but if you're ever in l.a., go somewhere other than denny's for breakfast. double-digit fru-fru breakfasts are everywhere here, some with decent quality, but typically with a quarter of hash house's portion size.  we have ample experience being ripped off at breakfast places, and hash house isn't one of them.    \n\na lunch at hash house is probably in store for our next visit to vegas.  i'll probably try the \"kokomo,\" the benign moniker for what looks to be another guilt-ridden meal in the form of a meatloaf sandwich. it's probably a good thing we don't get out to vegas too often these days. like the city itself, hash house is a spectacle incompatible with daily living.", 
            "when people say that you get generous portions, they are not lying.  you get serving trays for your personal orders.  so, we definitely had too much food, since there were six of us eating there.  \n\ni ended up ordering the <mark>HH Original</mark> benedict.  and it was pretty darn good...though the sauce covered up most things in its taste.  i could barely taste the bacon, and forget even tasting the green fix-ins.  however, i could overshadow that with the fact that it was yummy sauce.  \n\nour server was awesome, and a real friendly guy.  he didn't even bat an eyelash when we all used twitter to get a free drink (mango iced tea, that day).  he also encouraged a friend in his man v. food challenge.\n\nfor the most part, it was darn good.  even though it did feel like you ingested an entire loaf of meat <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> afterward. \n\ni didn't see any of the long lines, but we went on a tuesday at 11am.  i just wish i had enough room to try out their <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark>!",

            "i was really looking forward to this... i was.  i got super excited when i saw the restaraunt.com coupons out there for them and even plotted a time that i figured they wouldn't be too busy so that i could sneak in with my family and get a nice dinner.  \nso we show up at 530p on saturday and the place was absolutely empty.  sat down and were promptly waited upon.  made my selection of the tenderloin at the top of the menu and my wife had the butternut squash (she's nutso for squash).  waiter arrives about 5 minutes later with huge biscuits with honey.  great!!  it went downhill from there.\nwhen the entrees arrived, all i can say is holy &%^$, those are huge portions.  but what they make up for in volume is the huge blandness and poor flavoring.  the tenderloin had an orangish/brown sauce that had zero redeeming value and it was rather thick and gloppy.  there was melted cheese in the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> that was like a nasty skin.  the tenderloin was a little overcooked.  my wife said her squash had no real interesting flavor, just seemed baked and the risotto inside was just very average.  however, we did have enough to take home to feed a small family.\nnice people, huge portions, but nothing really great.", 
            "next time i visit hash house, i will make sure i will be in town that night, so that i may nap after eating and drinking my brunch. \nthis location is off the strip, with easy access parking and really good coffee! most diners have so-so coffee, but hash house a go go serves lavaza drip coffee and espresso drinks, with alcohol added, if you so desire. everything ordered was yummy. my friend ordered <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> with <mark>French Toast</mark>. i generally despise banana toppings, but enjoyed the sliced fried bananas on top, which i have named \"better than bananas.\"  the best parts of my <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> were the crispy fried <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, and the chipotle hollandaise sauce. mixed together, they were better than bacon! (and i reeeeally love bacon!) i am not a big fan of <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, so while i did appreciate the quality of hash house's chicken, i would recommend a different benedict dish for non chicken lovers. \na couple friends shared tales of long waits and mediocre service at the imperial palace location, however, we received excellent service with no wait at this location...around noon.  i shall return!", 
            "after 600+ reviews, i'm still going to review it for myself. firstly, i was royally pissed when we came and was denied seating until our whole party was there. this i would understand if it was busy, or a weekend, or whatever - not a wednesday morning when more than half the place is empty. so after waiting for our friends we go back up and get seated. i was getting the shakes by then bc i needed food so bad and just ordered and waited. really couldn't care less about the place until i got my food. ordered an apple juice for my drink and it was really good. it tasted like it was freshly pressed. the order came and yes, it was huge, but stop looking at the size people and realize that they put almost 2in high of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> under everything. oh, and one thing i wasn't happy about, they don't list what is actually on/in the dish. they didn't mention that it had a type of salsa on top, or that it was on top of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. what if i had an allergy??? not good!\n\nso anyway, yes portions were huge, but frankly i've had better. maybe it was just what i ordered, but i won't exactly be rushing to this place anytime soon.", 
            "who wants the bubble guts?\n\ni guess i do, cause that's what we got after having breakfast here today. \n\ni came here today for breakfast with the yelp-izzles. thanks elnino f. for organizing this breakfast and for letting us take advantage of your gift certificate! the other major players at the table were jieun l., sun m., and oliver m. there was only one lucky player who walked away without the bubble guts. \n\ni ordered a farm benedicts with the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> cause i wanted to do it man v. food style. there was not enough chicken to go with the amount of eggs, biscuit, <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> on the plate. the biscuit was dry. the chicken and spinach was good. the slice of pineapple and orange was probably the best thing on the plate. i had a fresh lemonade mimosa to drink. it was ok.\n\ni guess i will have to come back to give them another try since i also bought a gift certificate from sunny dining deals. i wanted to give 2 stars cause the service was great, but 4 out of 5 got sick so i couldn't do it.",

(if you're coming here, try not to eat for the day because the servings are monstrous!)\n\ni have been to both this location as well as the one in imperial palace and would definitely recommend this one by far.

(they had to drive a steak knife through it to make sure it didn't topple over). the chicken was tender, but fried in a bit of a spicy batter, which paired with the sweetness of the glaze, waffle, and bacon really well. \n\nlooking at his benedict, though, i had to take a sliver....which turned into half of his plate, haha. it was amazing! a perfect biscuit, topped with <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, two eggs, bacon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, and hollandaise sauce. (oh, and a slice of fruit to be healthy). the flavors came together so well! \n\nwe ate so much, our stomachs looked like two balloons ready to burst. it was worth it, though. it's been a week, and i'm having withdrawals. \n\nif you're looking for a good meal or want to be filled for days, or both, then go to hash house - you won't regret it.", 
            "if you care about value, then this is the place to eat breakfast/brunch when you are in vegas, at the imperial palace.  after hearing about this place on man vs. food, my buddy and i came with the intention of eating our one meal of the day here.  we were met with a half-hour long wait, plenty of time to let our appetites work themselves into a tizzy as we decided on what to order.  as the 2 of us sat down, the group of 5 ladies next to us suggested that we split a single dish.  we scoffed at their suggestion and proceeded to order 3 entrees, intent on guaranteeing a heart attack before the age of 50.\n\nthe first dish to come out was the biscuits and gravy.  now, i love biscuits and gravy in a way that is completely unnatural and unhealthy, some might say unholy, and i'm normally left wanting from weakly seasoned gravy with piddling amounts of sausage.  not here!  there are meaty chunks of pork sausage in a nicely peppered gravy base over a couple hearty and moist biscuits, covered by scrambled eggs and sitting over a mound of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  hot damn, this was definitely one of the best breakfast items i've ever had and i will be back for this and only this when i come back to vegas.\n\nthe item that had been featured on man vs. food and found its way into my dreams was the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>.  overall, it was pretty satisfying but here's my beef with the dish. #1, you should call it a benedict if you don't poach the eggs, the yolks need to run all over the place and threaten you with delicious salmonella, scrambled eggs is simply weak sauce.  #2, the benedict was served on biscuits, which was awesome cuz they were delish, but everything was then surrounded by a wall of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> that turned the base into a gloppy mess.  #3, the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> sounded fantastic as described by adam richman, but overall the seasoning left me wanting.  #4, i know bacon makes just about everything better, but this was a bit much.  and what's this about tomato slices?  is this becoming a salad?!  the flavors together would've been better off in some god-forsaken breakfast sandwich but this was just too unwieldy.  overall, i felt like less would've been more.\n\nfinally, the 3rd item ordered was the kokomo, aka the meatloaf sandwich.  whoever their baker is, they deserve a prize, because the milk bread that they grill for this sandwich is simply fantastic, just as good as their biscuits.  the meatloaf was well-seasoned and extremely satisfying with good quality beef.  the only problems were the overload of roasted tomatoes, which gave me immediate heartburn with a single whiff, and the side of mac and cheese that, contrary to what our nice waitress said, was the most pedestrian mac and cheese i have ever eaten (you're better off eating kraft easy mac), unsalted and watery penne in a strange mish-mash of oddly flavored cheeses.  the best part of all of the meal (other than the biscuits and gravy) was that we housed 3 plates of food with people staring at us in awe/fear/shame, and i felt i channeled my inner adam richman to successfully defeat our challenge.\n\nfor the prices, i'm not sure if any place in vegas will give you as good a deal as the hash house.  if you're a sane person, you could probably split a dish or order one and take the remnants home.  if you are looking for a gourmet breakfast, however, you may need to move on.", 
            "ugh. came here for breakfast a few days ago. seriously so overrated and unimpressive. it wasn't busy so we got seated right away. i will say the hostess was friendly though. a lot better than our waitress. after looking over our menu and getting some water we decided on some eggs, biscuits, fruit, <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> along with a <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>. our waitress wasn't so helpful and was unsure of what a country scramble was. (how does a place that is suppose to be farmers food not know what a country scramble is?!) she also never came by to check back up on us or refill our waters which we downed pretty fast. about 20-25 minutes pass and we finally get our food complete with no refill on our waters. the food was basic and lacked a lot of flavor. the potatoes did not leave me or my boyfriend wanting more. the eggs had no taste to them. the best part of this plate was the biscuit and fruit, or should i say lack there of fruit. the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> was not that impressive either. i could have made better. in fact i think i have. i shouldn't complain about it though because it did have more flavor than the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. yes, the food here may be pretty to look at, but they need to work on flavors and making my taste buds yearn for more. i hardly ate any. our waitress was awful. never checked on us and when i asked for a box she brought me back a wet box and plastic bag along with the wrong check. sorry lady, but you are not getting more than you should.\ni had such better hopes for hash house after everything i have read on them, but i don't think i can come back to this bland food.",

            "this is my second time coming to hash house a gogo for brunch, and let me tell you, it did not disappoint.  \n\nfirst off, the pricing:  while none of the food items would be considered cheap, the pricing is slightly less than what you would pay on the strip.  \n\nsecond of all, portions:  portions here are meant to probably meant to be served towards farm hands who have just had a full days work of lifting  100's of lbs of hay with no break for meals.  they are gigantic.  trust me, you will most likely not finish your meal here.\n\nquality:  everything we've had here is top notch.  i'm hesitant to say that about any restaurant, however the food is excellent.  the drinks are creative and tasty.  it's hard to go wrong with this place.  that being said, here's what i've tasted thus far:\n\nmango coconut pancake:  this is bigger than your head.  heck, it's bigger than the plate.  i think it was about the size of my wrist to my elbow... and with soft sweet mangos (must be quality canned mangos, since consistency and flavor were perfect) and shredded coconut throughout.  the thing about their pancakes is, it's made so well that you're pretty much eating cake for breakfast.  soft, moist, and tender pancake.  \n\n<mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> hash:  not sure how they made these potatoes, but they are perfectly crisp and flavorful.  the chicken is roasted well, with a few dry pieces (roasting a whole bird perfectly tender all the way through is near impossible, mind you), but a good dish overall.  this may be the one dish that doesn't stand out from the rest.  i was surprised, however, to see my wife downing the scrambled eggs since she hates eggs... and she loved the way these scrambled eggs were prepared.\n\n<mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> farm benedict:  here's the winner for me.  a gigantic piece of breaded and fried pork, on top of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, with a benedict sauce over the top.  spinach, scrambled eggs... i was happy to just finish 2/3 of this... and the last 1/3 could have been put between two pieces of bread for a significant size portion lunch.  get this.  if you like fried <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark>, you will love this.\n\nsmores espresso:  gigantic cup of coffee, drizzled chocolate all over, torched marshmallows covering the whole top, and a few graham crackers on the side for scooping purposes and eating.  pricey drink, but beautiful and executed phenomenally.  smores fan?  you'll be in love.\n\nhash house bloody mary:  i don't like bloody mary's.  but i order this one every time i'm here.  great condiments, excellent flavor, just enough kick to help jumpstart the day.  (i'm a lightweight drinker, mind you).  definitely spicy and flavorful, so it's not for those with bland tastes.\n\nverdict:  while off the strip, very worthwhile to make the trip.  great quailty, good pricing, huge portions, and friendly service... i've added this to my list of places to go to whenever i visit vegas.  followed by a nice 3 hour recovery nap to be scheduled every time.\n\nprotips - from the yelp reviews along with other friends who have been there, go for either breakfast or brunch... that's where they shine.  it sounds like dinner is good here, but not as good as the breakfast items.  also, while splitting is a great option since portions are huge, unfortunately you'll have to purchase side dishes so that they don't charge the fee for splitting entrees...", 
            "sat morn breakfast at 11:30.  waited 15 mins and were seated outside which worried me because it was 100 already, but they have nice misters!  worked out great.  a large fresh squeezed juice was l-a-r-g-e - i like that.  four of us each had something different and we were each very pleased.  the two things that really shined were the <mark>French Toast</mark> (the best i've ever had anywhere) and that came with broiled bananas (mmm, i gonna make those at home! - thanks to my friend for giving me a bite!) and my husband's <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash.  oh the other thing was my griddled <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> - oh yum!  since we were traveling we couldn't take the rest of our food home, but we sure would have.  big portions, as you have already heard, so if you don't want to share then be prepared to take it home and that will give you another meal the next day!  service was fine and the entire experience was very positive.",

            "this place is sick.\n\nthat said, it's sick in the most delicious way possible.\n\nokay, y'all know me, constantly griping about how many new things i want to try but it's all too far, it's such a chore to get around this city without a car, yada yada, well this is something which i haven't tried yet which isn't all that far out of the way from where i live. i was having yelp withdrawls, instead of hitting up a usual suspect for the weekend like i have for the past several months, this time i needed to try\nsomething new so i had reason to post a new review. i am an aspiring writer you know. \n\ni've heard horror stories about the waits to get seated, but when we came in there was no wait at all. i'm guessing that must be during the breakfast rush, since we came in for dinner. \n\nthe ambiance is not what i was expecting based on what i've heard. outside, it does indeed look \"farm-like\", but the inside is a different story. the front half of the room was very ~hip~, the back half had a more intimate feel. i always thought the interior would match the exterior with the farm theme, but, like the tagline says, this is twisted farm food so that could be part of the point for all i know. \n\nand now, i will tell you all why this place is so \"sick.\"\n\nas we were reading over our menus, we were given these gargantuan biscuits smothered in honey. they looked delish, but they were a tad disappointing. they were crispy on the outside, and moist on the inside....until you get closer to the middle. at that point the biscuit gets quite dry, thank god for the whipped butter they give you on the side and all that honey residue on the plate. \n\nmy mom ordered the bacon garlic-mashed potato burger with bacon cheddar <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. although she couldn't finish it, the burger wasn't too insane. the bacon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> were amazing. they didn't give us any gravy though, but that was good enough by itself, i definitely know what i'm getting next time i go there. the burger was an unusual taste sensation, having <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> on it. it is quite tasty once you get used to it however. \n\ni ordered brinner: eggs, smothered in cheese with sausage and crispy potatoes, on top of the flapjack. now this was sick. so sick. the pancake was the size of a skillet, and the waitress even had to hold my plate with two hands. like i said earlier though, the pancake was sick in the most delicious way possible. i had about 3 bites of it before cutting it up into seven pieces to take it to go for the next day (which would be today. and i still haven't finished it). i was shocked about the potatoes. i figured they would be like hash browns, but they were hefty wedges sprinkled with onions and peppers. salt and pepper did the trick to make them less bland, but they didn't work all that well as i tried to mix them up with the eggs and sausage. it still made for a tasty meal, and i was almost full after finishing up that. \n\nwe were in and out of there in a little over an hour. talk about swift service. the portion sizes may scare me a little bit, but they are a steal at these prices, and it's always nice to be able to make another meal out of restaurant leftovers.\n\ndelicious food? great service? leftovers that are basically guaranteed? i'll be back alright.", 
            "i am very picky about breakfast and this place is phenomenal. saw on man vs. food and was in vegas on vacation so we wanted to experience for ourselves. i don't usually indulge in biscuits with sausage gravy, but this one served over s<mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> was worth every single calorie! my other friends got different versions of hash and couldn't stop raving about it! definitely worth the drive or cab ride off strip!",

            "we saw this  place on man vs. food and decided to seek it out on our next lv trip.  needless to say, we were not disappointed with hash house a go go.  i understand that there are some hotel versions of this closer to the strip, but we trekked out to the original on sahara blvd. and it was well worth the drive.  we were seated within 30 mins. on a saturday, we expected to wait longer, as this place is a magnet for locals and visitors alike - perhaps the casino versions of the restaurant keep it down to a decent wait if you drive out to the original hhagg.  service - probably the only thing that wasn't stellar here.  i won't take a star off for that, but it could have just been when we were there - the servers seemed a little green and the hostess had about as much class as what you might see in a local trailer park, but i digress.  \nnow, on to the reason to eat at hash house a go go - the food - omg - some of the biggest portions i've ever seen and not just big but good big food.  i had the indiana favorites - <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> w/maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon, <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> & biscuit.  and i ate every single thing on that plate - come hungry.  it was magnificent!  the chicken was tender and crunchy, drizzled with just enough maple reduction (i.e. syrup) to give it such a nice sweet taste to the the coating on the chicken.  more potatoes than you probably eat for a thanksgiving dinner including 2nds and 3rds but i kept that fork moving through everything, savoring each bite and not wanting this food to end.  the biscuit - oh man- the biscuit - you have to have a biscuit - take an order of those to go...they're that good.  and the whole thing was around $15.  this is now a must visit spot on any trip to vegas.  we may try the casino version to compare, but if you are in town and hungry - give the gaming tables and cicque shows a rest and grab a fork and napkin and dig in - you will  not be disappointed.  save your workout for the next day.",

            "i kept hearing about this establishment as a great breakfast spot, and didn't want to go to a watered down version of it with locations located throughout various casinos on the strip. so, we opted for the one about 6 miles off the strip. don't let the drive to it scare ya, as it's lined with a lot of vacant businesses. you will reach the location as it's across a carmax and it's next to some vampire themed club (no, i'm not joking).\n\nwe got here around 8:30am saturday and the place was pretty vacant. we took the tip from others stating to get here before 10am. loved the mellow ambiance of the place and the staff was super friendly and got seated with our menus asap. \n\ntheir menu was no joke and goes way beyond the standard breakfast options. some things made myself and the hubby go ooo and ahhh, but since we didn't want to try anything too crazy as we were heading to utah for an long day of being outdoors, we opted for something that would sustain us for a long day ahead. i opted for the original hh benedicts while the hubby got <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark>. we looked around the other tables with the huge portions, so we knew what to expect. \nhere's the breakdown:\n\noriginal hh benedict- <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> w/ market yellow tomato, spinach, bar b' que cream and topped w/ scrambled eggs, --oh, and this in top of a huge biscuit <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>!!!! holy moly, when they brought it out, it was like a diorama of the red rock canyon, with a sprig of rosemary as a miniature tree on top of the mountains! i swear, cutting into it was cutting through 5-6 layers of food! one bite and man oh man...so gooooooood!!!! the bbq cream gave it a different flavor because i'm a hollandaise type of gal, but it worked for this dish! seriously, 2 people could have split this entree, but i got through about 75% on my own (hey, needed the carbs for the hiking!). definite try if you're an eggs benedict person like me. \n\nas for <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark>, it was a borderline pothole sized pancake with eggs and bacon. the hubby can eat pancakes, but even he only ate about 1/2 of the pancake in order to eat the eggs and bacon as well. goodness! \n\nso yea...the portions here flat out represents why people think people in america are fatties. and if an episode of \"man vs. food\" had to prove how ginormous their portions are...yea, come here with an appetite.\n\ni won't lie...i secretly would like to return to try to chicken and waffles breakfast i saw others eating at the place, but again, will have to share that monstrocity with someone because i may get a heart attack if i ate it myself. \n\nprices justify the portions and the taste. yea, get here early! it's legit",

(and i enjoyed the leftovers.)\n\nwhat really speaks to the level of service at this place is the experience my mother in law had.  she has celiac, and cannot eat any gluten.  she made her allergy known to our waiter, who took the time to double-check with the chef about what dishes had flour.  she settled on a scramble that had asparagus, pot roast, cheese, tomato, and obviously, egg.  she remarked that the vegetables were very fresh and everything was cooked to perfection.\n\nother recommendation:  get a s'mores mocha.  wow.\n\noverall - it was worth the wait.  and given that i paid with my craps winnings, it was the right price.  stop by if you're in vegas, san diego, chicago, or anywhere else they open one of these.  it's worth the time.", 
            "my friends and i stopped by here before making our long drive back to california. we got there around 12pm and people were waiting everywhere (good sign!!). we waited around 20 minutes before we got called. my friend and i shared the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles and ordered a side of crispy potatoes. when it came out, we sat there in shock...it was huge! we didn't know where to start. the description said tower of <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>, and sure enough, there were 4 waffles on top of one another and 2 <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breasts on top of that. the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was a little dry, but nothing a little dunk in ketchup or syrup can't fix. i could see the pieces of bacon in the waffles, which was a little overwhelming. the waffles were crunchy and pretty good; the crispy potatoes were nicely seasoned too. \n\none of my other friends ordered a breakfast combo and the other one ordered just the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>. both of them had <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> w/bacon, some of the heaviest <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> ever, but it was really creamy, buttery and good. the total wasn't bad either; i can't remember the exact number but i remember thinking it wasn't so bad. my friend and i who shared the chicken/waffles paid around $12 including tax and tip. we left overly stuffed and very happy.", 
            "breakfast orgy!  those are the words i use to describe this place to my friends and family...at least the ones that are ok with the word orgy.  i made my first trip here 3 years ago after seeing the man vs food episode and now it is an absolute must on every vegas trip.  i was there for the week of the 4th and hit it up on the 4th...and the 6th.  <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> is my go to when i have to split with my wife.  when the shackles come off and i can order whatever i want, there's no telling what i'll get.  i'll list a few that i've had:\n\nchicken and waffles: share this.  it's two big pieces of chicken paired with waffles that have bacon baked into them.  i've never come close to finishing but wished i could.\n\nblackberry granola pancake: i was embracing my inner tree hugger and it was delicious.  the berries explode all over the pancake with patches of granola baked right in.  if you like those flavors, get this into your mouth asap.\n\n<mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash: order this if you like actual <mark>Corned Beef</mark> and not <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> food that comes in the hormel can.  it's served in strips, almost shredded, in a skillet with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and a buscuit.  coulda been something i'm missing, but it's all about the <mark>Corned Beef</mark>.  \n\nbanana pecan french toas: take a big ass banana, split it down the middle and cook that bad boy up.  now pair it with some of the best <mark>French Toast</mark> you've had with pecans also invited to the party in your mouth.  if you want some serious sweet for breffas, do this.\n\ndrinks- i've been wanting to order drinks for a while now.  i always fixate on the food and skip the exotic drink menu. not this last time though.\n\nsmores mocha: are you f'n kidding me?  first it comes in an oversized mug (surprise). it's a mocha which marshmallow fluff on top that's browned and then garnished with two pieces of graham cracker.  it's very sweet, so i'm not sure if it's an option, but an extra shot would probably be the only recommendation i could give to make this any better.\n\ncaramel mocha (?)- not sure of the name, but it comes in a tall glass that makes it look like a shake because it's topped with a bunch of whipped cream which is toped with drizzled caramel and chocolate.  like the above drink, very tasty, but very sweet.  i like my coffee strong, so i'd add an extra shot next time if possible.\n\ni believe there are at least 4 locations in vegas, the m, the plaza, the imperial palace and this one.  i like this one because it's a free standing building well off the strip, so i avoid a little of the vegas madness.  it gets packed pretty early.  if you think you're going to sleep till 9 and show up and get a table at 10 like every other lazy ass, you're mistaken.  you need to commit to breakfast, wake up early and show up as close to opening (i believe it's 7:30am) as possible.\n\nif you go to vegas and don't eat breakfast here, you're doing it wrong.",

            "i actually love hash house, believe it or not.  but this last experience was pretty horrible.  i went there with my girlfriend and daughter.  all the entrees had problems but i will only review mine.\n\nit took 10 minutes for a server to stop by the table.  when he finally showed up, i showed him the restaurants.com certificate i had and he took the orders. i don't know if the certificate had anything to do with it, but we didn't see him again until the food arrived 25 minutes later.  this was slightly alarming since i realized in the interim he never asked me how i wanted the meat in my entree done.  \n\ndisinterested service aside, when the food arrived, it looked and smelled delicious.  i had the special, which was a mixed grill with duck breast, lamb chops and a boneless ribeye.  i soon realized however, why he didnt ask how i wanted it done.  the lamb chops were just medium, well prepared and tasted good.  however, the ribeye was only about a centimeter thick, and i'm thinking they could have cooked it for a minute on each side and it still would have turned out how i got it, which was well done, dry and flavorless.  very disappointing for a cut of meat that is pretty easy to get right in my own experience.  \n\nthe duck had the skin left on which i was excited to see at first, until i realized they made no effort to crisp it at all.  it was so chewy i had to peel it off just to be able to eat the meat, which was now devoid of seasoning. \n\nthe best thing about the entree was the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>.\n\nvery very disappointing experience considering what i've come to expect from hash house, which is big, well prepared portions of delicious food.",

            "blech! please pile more schlop on my plate. seriously? does anyone need a mountain of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> under eggs, cheese, and chicken? no. there's a reason all of the chairs in this place are widebody. quantity over quality.", 
            "we recommend <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>! husband and i shared this plate with a side of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and were seriously blown away. he nearly had tears  in his eyes because the chicken was do tender, the food piled so high and the flavors so perfect. \n\nadditionally, the service was fast (we went around 930am on friday) and very friendly. we had to take some of the meal in a to go box, too, though we are not lightweight eaters! \n\npros: prices are reasonable, service is great, portions are large, restaurant is aestheticly fitting, food was hot, flavorful and filling. \n\ncons: a person's stomach can only fit so much.", 
            "really closer to two stars but that feels harsh. \n\ni had the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash. it was a tough portion of meat (which for brisket means it needed a bit more slow cooking) with some decent potatoes that came on a cold skillet. with the biscuit and side of fruit, it felt like a lot of food but it was overall just....heavy and bland. \n\nalso, will you people stop this bullsh*t of putting bacon into everything?! bacon mixed into the waffle. bacon in the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. i don't eat the stuff, but even if i did, bacon is not a cheap substitute for knowing how to season your food. \n\non the positive side, service was really nice and attentive, and we didn't have to wait too long before being seated. \n\ni don't know if i'd go back, honestly. its sort of out of the way, a little pricy, and the few things i could eat were more calorie bombs than bombtastic. maybe if someone else is paying, i'll try it again.", 
            "i have been here a couple of times and i finally ordered the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. i really enjoyed the meal, it was an amazing portion but i really could have done without the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> on the bottom. the potatoes were just too heavy and drowned out the other flavors in the dish. the staff here is always very friendly and quick to serve which is really nice when you're starting out a busy day. i would go here again, it was a nice change of pace.", 
            "got the chicken bemedict. delicious! love the different flavor combos. moist <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, spinach, egg, <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark> all smothered in chipotle cream. sitting on top of a huge pile of waffles and biscuits. didn't eat much of the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> because i felt like that was the filler on the plate. this could definitely be shared between two people if you aren't that hungry. my dad got the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles which looked delicious as well. i will be sure to come back and try the hash.", 
            "i have to confess i was skeptical about coming here because i thought it might be one of those places that's really famous because it was featured on man v. food but doesn't live up to the hype. i am pleased to report that this place definitely lives up to expectations.\n\nfirst, if you're looking at this review i'm guessing it probably won't be news to you that the portions are huge. seriously, huge. the plates are more like dinner platters that you'd see in a buffet. lots of people seem to order the mvf featured item: <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. i did not indulge, but my buddies did. let me tell you, this thing was impressive. it's a sky high platter filled with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, homemade biscuits, fired chicken, eggs, and chipotle cream sauce. they bury a knife in it for scale.\n\ni opted for the mushroom, artichoke heart, sundried tomato hash for a healthier option and it was really well done. flavorful and served with perfectly crispy potatoes and one of their flaky homemade biscuits. \n\nif you're into bloody mary's, they make a really great one. spicy and tangy, exactly how it should be. <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> double lattes are also really great.\n\nthis place is definitely worth checking out if you're in the area (go here and not to the one on the strip). next time i'm planning to try one of the burgers, they looked incredible.", 
            "i have a love-hate relationship with hash house.  it's always busy and i've ordered wrong before, but overall the good far outweighs the bad.  the one on sahara is the only one i like.  they had a pork roast scramble special once that i still fantasize about, but for me, it's mostly about the breakfast and the pancakes.  the blueberry pancakes are good but the banana brown sugar are amazing.  if you like pancakes, they are the best and worth every penny.  the vanilla waffle is pretty blah.  the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> are crazy good.", 
            "you have to ask yourself sometimes, how crappy do i want to feel after i eat this? if the answer is - not at all, do not eat here. while in vegas i wanted to sample some non-strip fair and drunkenly asked a bouncer where he liked to go eat - he said hash house a go go. given that he was about 6'5\" and weighed 250 pounds, it all makes sense now. my girlfriends and i arrived around 11:00am on sunday morning and were told it was about to be about a 40 minute wait. that wasn't too bad - the line seemed to be moving quickly and there were some benches outside where you can sit and take a look at the menu. we were called inside to eat and the overall ambiance is pretty neat. like a tin shed that is crossed with a barn? i decided to really go for full sickness feeling and order the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> (with their famous <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>). i have to say that i don't eat <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> often - in fact it has probably been about 10 years since i last had some, but sometimes you have to make your stomach beg for mercy. the portion that i received could have easily fed me for 2 weeks and i am not a light eater. it probably weighed 20 pounds. it has <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, eggs, bacon, hollandaise and who knows what else since you could not see the bottom of the plate. despite the gargantuan portion, the taste was excellent. truly just tasty, greasy, cheesy diner food that does not apologize for using 3 pounds of butter in each dish. the service was fast and the coffee was great! really, what else can you really ask for from a diner? the only reason that i am not giving 5 stars is that the portions are really (embarrassingly if not annoyingly) large. there is no reason anyone should need to eat that much food (now if you want to eat it, that's another story). but if you're looking to lay around for the remainder of the day in a food coma while wearing stretchy pants - then make sure you eat at hash house!", 
            "okay, so i eat really clean and exercise a lot, but on the weekends, i like to have my cheat meals, and this is my place of choice!  the portions are gigantic.  this place makes claim jumper's portions look like kid's meals.  the food is amaze balls!  seriously.  like i said, i eat really clean, so i avoided this place for years, because i thought it would be all greasy and gross until finally trying it about 6 months ago.  since then, i've returned at least 2x a month.  not greasy or gross at all!  the food is \"farm fusion\" which basically means they take midwest type food and put a spin on it.  i am a good cook and can make basically everything at a regular breakfast joint.  but not hash house.  nope.  i would not even attempt to make anything they make.  it is perfection.  perfection i tell you!  complicated dishes that melt in your mouth.\n\ni have tried many of their items, but my favorite is their <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles. we also love their biscuits and gravy dish, served on the most wonderful <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> i've ever had in my life.  we also love the pancakes and the banana <mark>French Toast</mark>.  okay, so we love everything!  the prices may look a bit steep for a breakfast to some people, but the fact that the food will truly feed 2 people per portion slashes that price in half!  and, if you are bringing your kids, they have pancakes that are bigger than a traditional dinner plate and they are $3.  that is just nuts.\n\ngo now!  if you haven't, you're truly missing out.  but, don't go at like 9 am on the weekends, though.  that is when i go and i don't want to have to wait behind you for a table. ;)  (we go early b/c we have kids, and we've never had to wait longer than 5 minutes for a table.  but, when we are leaving, there is usually a wait.  man, i'm sharing all my secrets now.)", 
            "this place is great. had the meatloaf with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> for dinner. it was pretty good. the meatloaf was a little dried out, but not bad. the portions are huge!", 
            "if you're a bacon lover, you have to taste the bacon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>!  i ordered the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> & biscuit dish and it was soooo good.  real bacon, tasty sticky maple syrup, and juicy <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>...also, they throw in a few crispy bacon strips on top of the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>.\n\nthe kid's chocolate pancake was ridiculously huge...probably 12 inches in diameter.  my 6 year old and 2 year old barely could eat a quarter of it.  it was nice they gave them plastic water cups and crayons/paper to keep them occupied until the food came.\n\nhusband ordered the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash and it came out in a skillet.  he said it was delicious too.\n\nthe only thing that i didn't like was the coffee.  it tasted pretty bitter but the waitress told me they brew their coffee strong.  i'm from seattle and i know what a good cup of joe taste like.", 
            "i actually like it here, but i'm not going crazy on the stars because i agree with the gist of some other reviews: the food is big, and the menu is interesting, but the food just doesn't taste as good as it sounds. there is always a long list of ingredients in the description, and while you are promised what sounds like an orgy of chipotle cream, smoked mozzarella, caramelized onions, basil pesto, and other tastebud stimulators that sound great on paper, what you get seems a little more like a pile of somewhat dry <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, tasting more like the paper than what you imagined. there are dishes i enjoy- the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> is consistently good, though the waffles are not crispy and deteriorate too fast, and, number one complaint, the huge portion is accompanied by a thimble-sized pitcher of syrup. what the hell? same for those hubcap-sized pancakes(which come in various flavor combos but with very little flavor, and with insufficient syrup to wet them down, it's like trying to eat a blanket). and how about those giant biscuits they serve before dinner? i'm a fan, but they went from supplying one barbie-sized pitcher of honey to the whole table, to skipping that entirely and just drizzling on a little (very little) before serving them. for a place that's so generous with the portions, and that must plow through a field of rosemary daily, garnishing even the plates that have nothing to do with said herb, why are they so reluctant to part with the condiments? maybe they could save a couple of bucks by ditching their other inexplicable practice of adding what can only be described as french-fried broom straws to all their dishes. you spend the first few minutes just picking weeds from your plate.  the meatloaf is quite good, as is the grilled cheese, and baby girl loves the salmon. the side vegetables are usually well cooked and seasoned. i've never tried dessert, because i can't fathom ever getting that far, and i've been tempted to try  one of those giant burgers, but never do because i know i can't finish it and re-heated burgers are just not good. strangely, though, the leftovers we do bring home (which is always), seem to taste better than the original did. who can explain it? but the hh brown bags are always seized upon by the family vultures with midnight munchies. yes, i'll keep coming here to dine, but i will never again make the mistake of ordering the thanksgiving dinner to go. the fried turkey was ok, the veggies were raw, the dressing was dry and flavored only with salt, the portions of potatoes were shockingly small- less than they serve on a single dinner in the restaurant, and the snickers <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark> dessert wound up in the trash. unprecedented. oh, and the number one reason i will keep coming back? you can almost always get your hands on a half off coupon. then it's really a bargain!", 
            "hash house a go go is the place to go if you've been deprived of food for a few days. heard about it from my sister, who recommended it after seeing it on man vs. food.\n\ni went here on my birthday. ordered the <mark>HH Original</mark> farm benedict. wow! it was a mountain of food. one dish can probably feed a family of 5. not really what i expected in terms of eggs benedict. the biscuits <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> gave it some good texture. q: is it still eggs benedict if there's no hollandaise sauce? it took me about 30 minutes to annihilate that dish. the server said he was impressed with that accomplishment. washed it down with a banana latte biatch! a-ok, but not spectacular. needless to say, i fell asleep 15 minutes later (food coma).  low carb diet? forget about it - not at this place!", 
            "best food ever!!! (sorry mom!)\n\nfavorite: <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles. i could have easily spent my entire life not knowing that chicken & waffles were supposed to be that damn good! (sorry mom!) the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> are stupid good too. my son ordered a pancake (either blueberry or cranberry & walnut) that was as big as a domino's medium-sized pizza. just way better! the look on his face when it was brought to the table said it all.\n\nyes it's crowded people!!! when something is this good, people tend to show up in large numbers and then they want to stick around to enjoy all that buttery goodness. that's just the way it is. some things will never change. when the food stops being good and the service turns for the worse, there won't be as many people in front of you. then there won't be as many good reviews because bad service & good food rarely coexist anwyere in the world.\n\nthanks bin laden! :-p\n\ni've never had any issues. probably because i'm a fan of the food. if i know we're going there, i'm prepared to wait because it's well worth it. i've been to this location as well as the one inside the golden nugget downtown and the food and service were both excellent, although i enjoyed the vibe at this location better than at the golden nugget.\n\nif you're not a fan of the super-sized & delicious, this is not the place for you. i promise i won't complain if you're not there because it'll only mean that i'll get to my table faster if you ain't all up in the way!\n\nmy only complaint is that there isn't a hash house in los angeles (message!!!)",

            "prepare to unzip your pants and possibly vomit (in a good way)!\n\nthank you vegas foodies for rating this spot so high and posting so many foodgasm shots of their popular <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles plate. you guys led us here. and surprisingly, this place was packed on a random weekday during the daytime. we sat at the bar since there was no wait for the seating there. \n\ni ordered myself a monstrous hot chocolate to start. i seriously probably took about 3 sips of that thing. i felt so bad wasting all that warm, chocolatey goodness in that huge mug.\n\nfor grub i ordered one of their farm benedicts, hoping it wouldn't come out as huge as the the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles plate. boy was i wrong! my benedict came with <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, fresh tomato, fresh spinach, this roasted red pepper cream and topped w/ two basted eggs. what makes these benedicts so special is that they serve it on a fresh split biscuit with griddled <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. talk about carb overload! since i don't have a binge-eating disorder anymore, i barely made a dent even into this plate. boo!\n\nthe bf ordered an actual plate that didn't come out monstrous. i believe it was just a simple breakfast plate with eggs, meat and some potatoes. if he ordered a flapjack (which are the size of a thanksgiving turkey serving tray) he would have been screwed for sure.\n\neven if you plan to swing into this restaurant hungover, i suggest sharing a plate with 1 or even 2 other people! portions are more than plentiful.", 
            "we couldn't leave vegas without another trip to hash house a go go, but we wanted to avoid the strip location because i was afraid we'd miss our flight. we ate here right before dropping off our rental car and our friendly server was really good about making sure we were out of there in good time.\n\nsince it was tuesday afternoon, there was no wait (and plenty of parking right out front), but we already knew we wanted to have <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. the portion was enormous, bigger than your head (at least my head...). we shared an order with extra chipotle cream on the side. when our mountain of food arrived, we happily dug into a delicious combination of <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, fresh spinach, bacon, tomato, mozzarella, spicy chipotle cream, scrambled eggs, <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and a yummy fluffy biscuit until we could not eat another bite. i was stuffed for days!\n\nwhile we were waiting for our food, we watched other people tackle towering plates of pancakes, waffles, <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, benedicts... incredible if anyone could actually finish! \n\ngreat location and the prices are about a buck less than the location on the strip.\n\n<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> farm benedict. get it! it's good! man v. food. <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> likely will win 99% of the time. it beat us, and we shared! are you up to the challenge???!?!", 
            "i always pay a visit here on my trips to vegas. who ever knew imperial palace would have a gem like this. the portions are crazyyy here, and it's what they're known for. you really should share an entree because you would either be gaining 5 pounds or wasting a lot of food if you don't.\n\nanyhow, the food itself is pretty good for southern country style food. nothing spectacular, and after the 20th bite of the same thing (like <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>), it does start getting a little old. however, the presentation is spectacular when it comes out because it comes out on a griddle and they stick a knife into the mass of food.", 
            "this place was pretty good but seriously not mind blowing. i may have felt differently if i had ordered something else but i kept it simple because i needed a breakfast feast after 2 nights in vegas. i ordered a snickers pancake which was so damn huge i could only manage to finish half of it. i also have some <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> which were good but not at all spectacular. the pancakes was really sweet but that's what i would expect when you add snickers candy to pancake batter. the service was also a bit weird but i am used to that in a city like vegas. unless you're shelling out $200/person, service in vegas is always hit or miss. if i ever go back i will certainly try the chicken and waffles!",

            "this place is the very definition of a gut-buster. \n\nportions are so huge, it's ridiculous. there's no way you'll be able to finish everything on your plate, unless you stick with a side of toast. even then, you'll probably end up with an entire loaf. i was drawn here because of man v. food, and ended up ordering the dish that adam made famous: it's advertised as a \"farm benedict,\" but what benedict have you ever seen that included a mound of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>? in addition to <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, fresh spinach, <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs? this thing isn't a benedict, it's a house! a very tasty house, as it turns out, but still. i have a pretty good appetite, but was finished only halfway through. my wife ordered the riddled <mark>French Toast</mark> dipped in banana cinnamon cream w/ pecan maple syrup, and lest you think her portion was any smaller, you'd be wrong. like i said, this place thrives on excess! the <mark>French Toast</mark> was chewy and delicious, with a hint of vanilla, and the warm bananas were a divine accompaniment. it all paired perfectly well with smoky bacon. again though, it was impossible to finish more than half. because we were on the road, this sadly meant wasting some of that delicious food, as there wasn't really an opportunity to eat the leftovers later. \n\nyou've gotta love a place that sells a hangover dish called <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark>: a 24 oz budweiser in a bag with a side of bacon.\n\nclassy? nope. but fun? absolutely. \n\nno matter how hungry you are, you will leave hash house a go go stuffed to the gills, vowing never to eat another bite of food again for the rest of your life. \n\nand the next morning, you'll be yearning for a return visit...", 
            "after reading so many positive reviews, we decided stop here after the mall. i had read some reviews at the mall of so the hype was definitely set. when looking at the picture this place for me seem like \"comfort food\" with a twist. when we pulled up to a near empty parking lot we knew we did not have to to wait for a table. the hostess quickly seated us. the menu was massive and t took me a good 2 or 3 minutes to figure out where to start. our server according to our receipt was jay. he quickly took our drinking order and was prompt on service this evening this is a bonus. our waiter brought out the drinks and offered us complementary biscuits big portions. for hash house a go go \"big portions\" is a complete and total understatement. warning this place has monster size plates of food leaving the kitchen! this is not the restaurant to be eating with your eyes. \n\nnow, let's move onto the food quality. we had a total of four dishes the first  is the hash house meat loaf pasta. it had charred tomato, basil pesto and crispy parmesan cheese. this pasta was an a decent dish but my taste for pasta has changed since i went to italy. pasta in the united states is unable to compete with it. the slow grilled bbq pork ribs was amazing. i highly recommend this dish. the ribs are braised with a house soy bbq sauce and served with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. the ribs was tender and the meat just fell off the bone.the potatoes was the only disappoint on this dish since is was dry. the kokokmo, is meatloaf with tomato and griddled smooth mozzarella cheese on milk bread. reminded me a lot of a mozzarella grilled cheese sandwich with meatloft. it took an extra couple of minutes for the last dish to arrival comared to the other dishes for some reason. the last dish was the famous one pound stuffed burger. we had the <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, avocado & cheddar it comes with two patties with lettuce tomato and red onion. the prices were a little higher than i usually like to pay, but once we saw the plates of food coming out it didn't matter anymore. the presentation of all the dishes was well done (picture will be posted soon).\n\nhighly recommend the kokokmo and slow grilled bbq pork ribs. so if you are planning to eat here get hungry and make sure to wear some sweatpants!", 
            "ok let me say that i was here over a month ago but wanted to still write a review. be prepared to wait at least 20 minutes of more for a table. this place is extremely popular and it does get packed. my friends and i waited a long time before we were seated which was understandable. all the eats are close together and there is outside seating available. it does get noisy so i would not recommend this place if you are looking for a more intimate setting.\n   i ordered the maple reduction chicken and when it came out i was not expecting how huge the portions would be! honestly my plate alone was large enough to feed two people! it came with a homemade biscuit and a side of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> all of which were delicious. one of my friends ordered the pancakes which was enormous! the prices are very fair considering the extremely large portions. i hear there is a location in san diego also which i will visit soon!", 
            "i was taken to hash house a go go with a major fan and was expecting so much better. the portions are huge and if portion over taste was my thing, i would have loved it. i orered the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> and in theory it sounds delicious and even has a man vs. food endorsement, but it was gross. it should have been called the trash plate or the left over plate because it seemed like something you'd make when all of the left overs from the week came together in one dish. the biscuits here are the worst biscuits ever made as they aren't flakey or buttery but big dough blobs. there were too many flavors on the plate and at the end i just felt sick. i am not a huge fan of mash potatoes to begin with but <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> under chicken, biscuits, eggs, cheese, and this sauce was just too much. oh, and the food was not hot at all just slightly warm leftovers on a huge plate...\n\ni did taste my friend's banana pancakes and they were delicious, but everyone else's food was just meh.",

            "wouldn't usually pick this place but was getting an oil change and needed to kill time. i ordered the ham, spinach, and cheddar scramble. looked great, was totally excited until i dug in. there was more cubed fat then ham, gross. the eggs were really runny...just pretty much grossed out by the whole thing. <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> were good but i couldn't finish them. on the bright side, the biscuit and homemade peach jam was awesome. won't be back, i'll stick to the mom and pops spots in town.", 
            "brunch win! others seem to know this too so expect a wait (ours was over an hour but it was mother's day).\n\nthe food is very good and the offerings have some creativity which is awesome. everyone mentions the portion sizes but not everything comes out as a serving for 3. but some things do...holy cow! that's cool though....split it or take if home for leftovers. just please don't be the person that destroys a plate that will feed a small family (i.e. chicken and waffles). i witnessed this and it was gross. \n\ni'd recommend the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> - it comes with a biscuit, some eggs, and a bunch of bacon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, which were rather unremarkable actually. but remember...doggy bags, people!", 
            "looked extensively for a local breakfast place and decided on hash house a go go based on the fact that they had biscuits and gravy. of course had to order it - very tasty!nice peppery gravy atop a split biscuit that was decent atop grilled <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> which i didn't even try because there was way too much food. could barely make a dent - i would suggest you go in groups of twos and split one dish!\n\nmy friend had the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> which she said were okay. not enough bacon - just two slices over four waffles - she said she had better elsewhere. i didn't even try them. i was too busy digging out the few pieces of sausage in the gravy! i don't even think i got through a third of it.\n\nwhy so many stars? because of how nice our waitress was - everyone working had really good senses of humour - and the sheer fun of watching the huge portions that went by!",

            "everything about vegas is over the top.  one of the most over the top breakfasts can be had at hash house a go go.  they are known for their crazy concoctions of burgers stacked high, pancakes larger than pizzas, and breakfast plates big enough for three, four maybe. i have been to the one in san diego, and the long wait was rewarded with plates of impossible to finish food.  delicious at that.  going to vegas, knowing there was a hash house off the strip and on the strip, my breakfast was set.\n\nwe ordered the iced pistachio mocha to start things off.  it was milky and ice cold.  the pistachio taste was subtle, but there.  it was similar to the nutella shake at burger bar. the chocolate was a nice background flavor.  imagine chocolate hazelnut (nutella) but then replace the hazelnut with pistachio. it worked!  tasty!\n\nthe craziest dish i have ever seen was the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>.  it had scrambled egg <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> which was normal.  this was i guess their version of sausage and biscuits, but mutated to a giant monster.  the bottom was a bowl formed by an upside down hat made of a biscuit type bread.  inside the bowl was massive amounts of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> which kind of sucked. there was even a bunch underneath the makeshift bowl.    i was looking for more <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>, though there were some.  after a few bites of this dish, it was a bit tiring.  i don't see how anyone can finish this dish.  carb overload is an understatement.\n\nmy chorizo hash was sensible, but still came in a skillet.  it had jalapeno, red onion, cheddar cheese, and fresh tomatoes.  the kick from the jalapeno was a wake up call, especially compared to the monotone of the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>.  chorizo is spicy as well, so this dish had a lot of flavor. the eggs were perfectly cooked over easy.  though there was nothing special about this one, it at least kept me interested.\n\nhash house a go go is a place to go eat.  they make sure you are full, and you leave with a doggy bag every time. this is the opposite of tapas small plates.  you get one big plate, and a lot of it.  the food isn't boring for sure.  they try to keep it interesting with interesting combinations and portions that are too big to make sense. i guess that is the fun of it all.  vegas is all about buffets, but with hash house, you will get enough -- don't worry.", 
            "my family and i went to dinner last night and it was a complete disappointment. first off, walking in there was no hostess to greet us. we saw maybe 4 front of house employees total. we ordered our drinks, mine a tangerine mimosa and someone else ordered a bloody mary. no bartender, so our server, who was very nice, went behind the bar to make our drinks. after looking at the menu i was so excited! so many delicious sounding items. it took me forever to decide. i went with the skillet chicken with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and asparagus. other plates ordered were the meatloaf sandwich and a <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> of some sort that was running as a special. we also ordered a cheeseburger from the kids menu. our food arrived and everything looked phenomenal. absolutely mouth watering to look at. the flavor, not so much. my chicken was doused in maple syrup, which wasn't listed on the menu description, the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> was terrible and the cheese in the meatloaf sandwich was burnt. the only tasty things were the kids burger and biscuits. that's it. i've never dined somewhere and had to send all 3 plates back. and when the manager came over, he didn't even know that the menu didn't list maple syrup under the description of the chicken!! he's a manager and doesn't know the menu?!?! that's scary. the whole experience was a huge disappointment and i have no plans to ever go back. 2 stars because the staff were all pretty attentive and nice. the manager needs a bit more product knowledge, but he was helpful and understanding. maybe breakfast items might be better. good luck!", 
            "delicious menu but obscene portions . i recommend sharing if you can't take to go. my biscuit <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> were cold and daughters <mark>French Toast</mark> was drowning in butter and syrup . <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> pancake was the size of a pizza. quick service. just a shame to spend so much on food and half of it gets thrown out.",

            "i've been to this location twice. both times exceeded my expectations. i've learned the quickest way to get a seat, is to go to the bar. i probably shouldn't tell you that secret, but it's not like i go there everyday so, i'm fine with that. \n\nanyway, i had a scramble the first time i was there. their breakfast potatoes (crispy) are great. the eggs are the usual and i had sausage and spinach in my scramble. while i was eating i noticed this monstrosity of goodness going by me twice. i decided the next time i go here, i will eat this. \n\nit turns out, it was the dish that was featured on the man vs. food show. it's the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> with fresh spinach, <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs this thing is monstrous. i, being a big dude, was able to finish it all because my friend challenged me to do so (prick). i was also hungover and wanted something to soak up all the booze from the night before. \n\nthis thing was tasty and took quite a bit to eat. the only thing i would change, and which i will ask of next time i get this, is to have it with the crispy potatoes. i love <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, but for breakfast i prefer the crunchy hash potato browns.\n\nthe service was great. the bartender was very attentive. she got everything out quick, made a damn good iced coffee, and i didn't have to worry about going empty. \n\nanother cool thing, i saw dee snider, lead singer of twisted sister, at the restaurant. nice guy. didn't bother him for a picture, but i did shake his hand. \n\noverall, very good restaurant. definitely a fan. the only reason i gave one star is because it could be pricey. breakfast shouldn't be that expensive, but then again, the portions are hugggggeeeee.", 
            "it's so so good! \n\nhash house should hand out yoga pants at <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark>. a host should greet you and say, \"hi, welcome, our food is delicious and served in ridiculous portions so here are some stretchy pants to help you feel better about eating until you hate yourself!\" \n\nwe ordered the man vs. food benedict, the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> and red pepper skillet, the salmon sandwich and the artichoke, sun dried tomato hash. all of which were pure deliciousness! the benedict... unreal. it has <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, cheese, eggs, <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, a biscuit and it's smothered in a sauce you could bathe in. the strawberry jam that's served with the biscuits tastes so fresh and real. not smuckers jam, real grandma made it type jam. \n\nour service was pretty good but the it took almost 15 minutes to get our bill. the only negative thing i can say about the good is that the salmon sandwich needs a different bun, it's too much bread to sandwich ratio. \n\nwe will be back, with out stretchy pants on!",

            "my review is based on my multiple very pleasant exprience in san diego in comparison.\n\nhash house has been our brunch go to spot in sd so we didn't think this location would be this bad. we ordered two dishes, salmon benedict and corn beef.  i think it is a crime if benedict's egg white is very thin and yolk is not runny - and, that was how the benedict was made here. hollandaise sauce was way too cheesy and thick. <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> at the bottom was cold. i couldn't even finish a quarter of the portion because it was really not enjoyable. corn beef was cheesy as well. the browned potatoes were good though. english muffin was way too dense. this location did not fully display the farm to table culture and was definitely not on par with the original location in sd. if i had taken the warning from the sd peeps that this location was a franchise and different from the sd one i wouldn't have to have two brunches in a day. no wonder this location did not have a line and an hour long wait. but franchise or not, hh should make sure the food quality is consistent throughout different locations so you don't get bad reps and damage the brand!",

            "after going to bed around 6am and getting up at noon, and before hitting the road for the long drive back to la sunday afternoon, we decided to come here for brunch since our friend that lives there raved about it.  we had to speed there from our friend's house since they stop serving on sundays at 2:30pm, but thankfully we made it in time.  they serve \"twisted farm food\" and plenty of it.  their menu is filled with plenty of heavy meat, eggs and potato dishes.  the kind of food you want to eat a lot of and then take a nap.  they have various brunch food including hash dishes, scrambles, flapjacks, <mark>French Toast</mark>, waffles, stuffed burgers, sandwiches, salads and benedicts, as well as a section titled \"indiana favorites\".  being from indiana, i knew i'd love this place once i saw that.\n\ni decided on the \"tractors <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark>\", which includes 2 eggs with bacon, sausage or potatoes and flapjacks, waffle or griddled <mark>French Toast</mark>.  since half the items on the menu feature bacon, i decided to get that as the side.  i had to get the griddled <mark>French Toast</mark> dipped in banana cinnamon cream with pecan maple syrup.  the eggs and bacon were good, but the star of the dish was definitely the <mark>French Toast</mark>.  2 pieces of fluffy <mark>French Toast</mark> with pecan maple syrup, whole pecans and a cooked banana sliced in half lengthwise.  amazing.  possibly the best <mark>French Toast</mark> i've had.  maybe not the best thing to eat before having to drive 5 hours since i just wanted to sleep afterwards, but worth it nonetheless.  \n\na couple of interesting dishes on the brunch menu are the \"<mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark>\", which is a 24 ounce budweiser with a side of bacon and the chicken and waffles, which unfortunately didn't look as good as chicken and waffles from roscoe's in la, but did include a full piece of bacon cooked into each waffle.\n\nthe atmosphere was very cool, kind of hip and kind of country, and the service was adequate.  the prices were reasonable, given that you get big plates of food.  i think our bill for 4 people came out to around $80 or so.  in addition to the great food, they were playing a very interesting mix of music.  from rem to notorious b.i.g. to sting to the beatles to gwen stefani to justin timberlake to elvis costello.  something for everyone i guess, but thankfully no country music.",

(mid-week, 6pm-ish).\n\nthe look of the place is cool. i like the rustic, shabby-chic thing they have going on. the staff were great. the hostess was busy seating someone when i came in, but the very nice lady at the bar informed me she'd be right back. i was seated within 5-minutes of walking in <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark>. a fantastic start.\n\nmy server was tiffany, same woman from the bar when i entered. she was so nice and friendly and has a great sense of humor (as i asked her if she was stalking me). she took my drink order and let me look at the biiig menu. i had gone in to the restaurant craving bbq, but saw the chicken and waffles on the menu and had to have them. \n\nas i waited for my meal to arrive, someone brought me the hhagg (horrible acronym) version of pre-meal bread. a big-ass-biscuit (no, they didn't call it that). buttermilk biscuit with honey glaze on it served with whipped honey butter and honey on the side. i only took a couple of bites because i saw the dishes coming out for other diners and i knew i'd better not eat the whole thing. flavor of the biscuit was good. it was, however, a bit on the dry side.\n\nmy meal showed up and i had to bust out laughing. seriously? that is one giant tower of food. all held together with a giant skewer and a knife stabbed through it. tiffany said they 'don't mess around'. clearly!\n\nand here's where the mixed emotions come in. the chicken was definitely missing something. i wish i knew what, but it was just so bland. i thought perhaps i was missing some nuance of flavor, so i took a moment to drink some water and pulled a piece of just chicken. the meat was just slightly dry and completely void of flavor. huh? i tore off some of the fried skin/coating and tired that, which was also bordering on flavorless. how could this be? i can see flecks of .. well .. something in the coating. i don't get it. bummer.\n\nthe waffles, however, were heaven. waffles with bacon cooked right inside, covered in syrup. mmmmm. sweet and salty heaven. if i could have had just a plate of those waffles, i'd have been a happy soul. tiffany mentioned that they sometimes have a pancake with bacon and chocolate chips in it. holy cow! i'd love to try that.\n\ni would definitely come here again, preferably with several hungry friends that all order something different and are willing to share tastes. and i'd probably ask to sit in tiffany's area because she was a real superstar, fun and friendly.",

            "when people write <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> of america, hash house a go go must be included.  i say that because if we all go here, it will makes us fat, happy and complacent.  i ate there five days ago and i think im still full.  giant portions are but a small (large?) measure of hash's greatness.  \n\nworking under the moniker \"twisted farm food,\" hash has the decor of an industrial style barn.  while being seated, you notice every table gawking at other tables in sheer awe of what is being delivered to other tables.  imagine being at a hospital nursery and all the babies are 25 lbs, and the fathers are just looking at each other and smiling.  that's whats going on here.  \n\nfirst thing i noticed was the prices...they're really cheap for the amount of food i saw coming out.  i dont think anything was more than $15.  the waitress explained that the restaurant makes everything from scratch and that there are no heat lamps meaning food can be brought out at different times.  working under that guise, i contemplated what would i like to try in giant form and made of scratch that ive probably never had before.  i settled on the pounded <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> sandwich with crispy french fries.\n\nwhen my sandwich came out, i desperately asked my waitress for tactical help on how to eat it.  the sandwich was so large i had no idea where to begin.  she laughed no doubt having heard that 100's of times before.  i finally dove in and found the pork cutlet to be tender and tasty.  not the absolute best i ever had, but for the price and the portions i felt it was more than acceptable.  the fries were excellent and actually crispy...rare is it when a restaurant advertises crispy these days and actually delivers a crispy product.  my party also really enjoyed their oversized sandwiches of various ilk.  \n\nas we descended into dreams of wearing elastic pants for our expanded waistlines, we became part of the peanut gallery looking at other peoples tables and what they had ordered.  the burgers are ginormous and the breakfasts really steal the show.  pancakes the size of pizzas, hash brown servings that must be made of two full potatoes and toast truly of the \"texas\" variety.  there are so many things i need to go back and try but these trips must be rationed for health's sake.\n\nservice was very friendly and accommodating and there was relatively little wait to be seated although i do know on weekends at brunch time you will wait awhile (i see it whenever i drive by).  another great added benefit was that with my $13 sandwich i was able to get a full 3 meals out of it.  three!!!   \n\nthis restaurant truly embodies the ethos: \"only in america.....:", 
            "vegas gets a lot of international visitors, many of whom are in the u.s. for the first time.  so as a public service, let me explain a vital aspect of american culture: we like things to be big (note the casino-resorts on the strip, the grand canyon and monster trucks).\n\nthis goes for food as well--we want it tasty and in massive portions (if it tastes great on the first bite, it'll be excellent on the 2,456th bite).  so, foreign tourists, if you haven't fed at the american food trough, you should, but make sure it's a tasty place.  \n\nenter hash house a go go (\"hhagg\").  the pancakes come bigger than your head (and in a stack of three).  prefer eggs?  the omelettes coming out of the kitchen are the size of a chicken.  and, unlike the generic buffets being offered at the casino-resorts, the food at hhagg has flair.  the plating is creative and the food is simple, but imaginative--picture the classic steak and eggs just back from a european vacation and testing out french fashion on american soil.   \n\nso why only four stars?  well, for all the food's glitz and gigantic size, the taste is relatively straightforward.  hhagg advertises that it serves \"farm food\" and while they do a good job with the classic tastes, there just isn't anything unique or amazing.  \n\nthat said, after a rough night on the town, there are few dishes that satisfy as well as <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> (24 oz beer in a paper bag and 7 strips of bacon).  final take: the food is solid and the place offers a great experience.  one of the better breakfast places in vegas.", 
            "if size mattered, hash house a go go would score stars off the charts.  if service mattered, it would get three stars.  if flavor mattered... well, there would be a slight dilemma. \n\nlet's start with first impressions.  forget \"line was out <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark>,\" it was more like mob surrounding the front patio.  once inside, you're greeted with such a busy atmosphere (on a weekend, at least) - all the tables were seated, families and friends getting together for a breakfast-version of thanksgiving.  if you haven't worked out those forearm muscles, not sure if this place would be for you.  their plates are ginormous (yes, this word has been officially quantified due to the portion sizes at hash house).  \n\ni would like to invest in whatever machinery they use to squeeze the orange juice.  \"fresh\" is an understatement.  that cup of orange juice is so amazing - it's as if someone took an orange, magically stirred up the juices inside an orange (without disturbing the peel), gave me a straw and offered me heavenly orange juice.  i was mesmerized by the juice, as i watched the pulp inside the glass, sway back and forth, taunting me with its citrusy-goodness, waiting for me to finish the entire cup, and ask for seconds or thirds.  i resisted - for i waited patiently for the food.  \n\nit's hard to not turn heads every time a server came by with a plate.  every plate looked like a mountain of food, with a twiggy-herb sticking up, followed by \"holy gamoly, that plate is huge!\"  pancakes looked like they were used as blankets to keep the plates from getting cold.  if it's true that you eat with your eyes first, you better close your eyes before the plates arrive at your table - you'd be full just by watching the plates make their way to the tables! \n\nwhen the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles showed up, i was amazed the table didn't tip over to one side.  the waffles piled against one another like mattresses, lending support the pieces of <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> that sat so gallantly on top.  once you cut into the waffles, bits of bacon are nestled inside the waffles, playing peek-a-boo, and tickles you with savory flavors to off-set the maple syrup, while making you yearn for the juicy <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>.  i'm telling you, it was all very well thought out.  four out of five stars is fair. \n\nsecond attempt - featured menu item: nappanee hash.  potatoes, tomatoes, strips of beef, eggs, (and other ingredients that i cannot remember) all glued together by smoked mozarella.  the potatoes were nicely crisped around the edges, eggs were made to order, and tomatoes danced around <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark>, teasing with freshness.  among the different flavor combinations came the strips of beef.  problem - they were just that: beef.  if we did role call, the character \"flavor\" would be followed by silence, because it was completely absent.  \"tenderness?\"  -- nice try.  that too, was absent.  two out of five.  \n\nas busy as i've seen this place, i would think that they would want more servers/waiters to make sure that the tables are flipped as quickly as possible.  service is a little bit on the slow side - and this is not just applied to the busy days.  on a day where there were no more than 6-tables, it took two or three attempts before we could get the waiter's attention to place an order.  three out of five.  \n\nif you don't have much patience for long lines (on the weekends) or slower service, steer clear.  if you've got a big group of (hung-over) people looking for some not-so-fancy foods at big quantities and little price, you're in good hands at the hash house.  if you're just tired of really watered down orange juices from the poker tables at the rio, just follow that holy-looking-glowing light to the hash house a go go.",

            "after keeping myself alive on a steady diet of strip buffets and large amounts of liquor, i wanted to fill up on something delicious before heading back home.  the last time i came to vegas, we'd wanted to try this place but the wait was long and we were all cranky and bitchy, so i knew this was the day!  we were determined.\n\nwe woke up at 8am feeling like a train had run us over, repeatedly.  starved, we headed towards hash house a go go, conveniently located about 5 miles from our hotel.  when we got there, there was a fifteen minute wait for a table, or we could sit at the bar right away.  we opted to wait for a table while we looked at the menu.  i was hesitant about ordering the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> just because it was on man vs food, but it genuinely sounded freaking awesome, so we did.\n\nmy friend and i split the damn thing, and we still didn't finish our portion.  i believe it consisted of a biscuit, tomato, fresh spinach, eggs, bacon, <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, griddled cheese (oh my god, griddled cheeeese), topped with chipotle sauce, on a bed of mofuggin potatoes! shiiiiiiiiiiit.  i think i just came.\n\nfrom arrival to consumption of said <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, we were only there for about an hour, which was great considering i was expecting to be waiting for at least one.  when we headed out <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> i heard someone say there was an almost hour wait.  so i'd suggest if you're planning on heading home early or managing your time for whatever reason, go early!  the food was delicious (seriously deserving of a five) and everything else on the menu looked just as good.", 
            "adam richman you are an idiot for recommending this place.\n\ni went in with high hopes as i like places with big portions and creative food. we were seated right away on a friday night, but then sat for the next 20 minutes watching servers walk by when someone finally noticed us. i could tell the server knew we had been waiting a while when she noticed that we didn't even have water. she asked if we wanted to just order as no one had bothered to see if we wanted drinks. i ordered a coke and the chicken and waffles. after another 10 minutes we finally got our drinks. another 5 minutes later they brought us biscuits which were big and looked good, but ended up being dry and kind of tasteless. they did bring the equivalent of about 1 pat of butter and a tiny bit of honey (imagine a mcdonald's honey \"spread\" container). it just wasn't enough for four adults. then after another pretty decent wait (our server came and reassured us twice that our food was coming up), the food came. i have to say that everyone's entree looked awesome. after we took photos, something i have never done at a restaurant, we dug in.....\n\nmy first bite made me gag a little bit. imagine as a kid experimenting with the food in <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> of the refrigerator: maple syrup, soy sauce, garlic powder, green onion? no matter how you combine these things they are not going to mesh well on a waffle with bacon. ok, i understand the spin on chicken and waffles, but when this is your signature dish and it tastes like shit-something is wrong. the waffles were inedible-thick and doughy. the bacon was limp. the chicken was cold and dry. i basically just picked at the deep fried green onions and spaghetti noodles and took the 1/4\" thick breading off of the chicken and had some protein. \n\nthe other diners in our party didn't like their dish either; the pork cutlets. the bastards at hh even charged them $2.50 for splitting a meal that could have fed eight people. needless to say, we didn't take any leftovers home.\n\none last warning for good measure: if you are sensitive to msg, don't order the waffles. the soy sauce in the dish contains msg. i get a huge headache when i have even little bit and this must have had lots. \n\ni was totally disappointed with the whole experience. i would like to go back and try breakfast, but it was so bad i just can't stomach it.", 
            "i have been told for years that amazing food is found off of the strip, but i never did the research prior to my vegas trips to put this wise advice into practice. thanks to my handy yelp app. i easily found hash house a gogo and is forever in my app's debt. first of all, this place has moxie. the staff are fun and have character. the menu ranges from run of the mill (eggs, bacon and toast) to original masterpieces (snickers pancakes), of course there is room for plenty of crazy as well (<mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark>, which consists of a 24oz budweiser and a side of bacon). i loved the drink choices, lots of creative mimosas! hash house will become a new tradition for saturday morning, i can't wait to return. word to the wise, show up before you go into starvation mode, you will be waiting for at least 20 minutes.", 
            "probably like many, i made it a point to show up here after seeing it on man vs. food. while i know (being in the industry) that television effectively glamourizes everything, i was particularly caught-off guard by <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark>-to-earth-diner feel it had. very low key. \ni sat at the bar and my coffee was served immediately and hot and it tasted pretty good too boot. i ordered up a chorizo hash and it was served fast and hot and extremely tasty. i can't complain about this place a bit. cheap, great food, great coffee.", 
            "hash house a go go is a place that you might both fear and love. it's like a roller coaster or a hot temptress. you know it's bad for you, but you still want it. hash is definitely a true battle of man verse food. they contribute to our the great over-sized nation of ours. please check your diets at <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark>. \n\ni was extremely excited to try out hash house, because all the reviews i read made it sound so amazing. it is very hard to find a great place for breakfast in vegas. i was tired of waiting in a huge line at paris buffet, so i thought it's time to go on a man vs. food trip. most of the time, i cannot stand places that have too much hype. most things that are over hyped usually suck like the crapple iphone and verizon's i can't hear you now network. also, in-n-out... it's good, but not crack like most people say it is.. (i don't endorse or use crack). even though, i tried to come here without the high expectations, it was unavoidable. i felt like a little kid on christmas morning. first off i am not a idiot! a lot of the bad reviews i read were from people that waited 2 hours and didn't like their food. i'm sorry, but if you waited 2 hours to eat anywhere i would be bitter too! i only waited 5 minutes maybe 10 minutes max, so suck on that! haha. i went on a weekday around 9am. brilliant!!!!\n\ni know the portions are big, but how's the quality? did you finish dish by yourself? i don't like pigging out should i still go?\n\nthe key is bring a friend and share. the quality is good! don't expect a 5 star restaurant or a new cuisine from a top chef. this is simple breakfast food on steroids. i highly recommend having 2 stomachs and consulting with a doctor before coming here. to my surprise the customer base was a lot smaller than i expected. the restaurant was packed shortly after i arrived, but there were no plus sized models here. i saw some normal sized patrons and a few gorgeous model types. i really was set on trying the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, but since my friend was not a fan of hollandaise sauce i went with the chicken and waffles of course! let's just say roscoe's has nothing on hash house! i thought roscoe's clogged arteries, but hash made roscoe's look like a diet soda verses a milk shake. the chicken was very juicy and extremely crispy! i really like the corn flake batter, although the spices were a bit lacking, but nothing hot sauce can't fix. the chicken cannot beat roscoe's, but that's not a fair comparison. you definitely get 4 times the food of roscoe's for the same price. i am very picky <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eater, so i wish they would find some grandma's secret recipe for chicken so this dish could become 10 instead of a 7. the waffles with bacon inside.... wow. a tear came to my eyes... you had me at bacon. i thought that waffles couldn't be any better, but you took my fork away! if i was lucky enough to have the genetics of brad pitt or ll cool j, i would eat these waffles everyday.\n\nshould you try hash house a go go? yes! unfortunately, i only have one stomach and i could not finish half of a dish by myself. if you are a picky eater, you may want to take your snobby as$ else where. if you are a huge breakfast fan, like me, give hash a try. bring a huge appetite and go early. note to self, don't order the large orange juice next time, it was so large i did not finish it. fresh oj with out much water, it was like trying to drink a huge carton of concentrate. i will go for a tasty small next time. stop staring at the pictures and go try it already!!! come onnnnnn. :)", 
            "had to make a stop at thee famous hash house a go go, as a man vs. food fanatic, i made it a must for this trip to sin city. stopped by in the late morning, early afternoon and was able to get a seat right away, definitely made me happy because i expected a long wait, and the cherry on top was the cute little hostess that took us to our table, i don't remember her name, but i was madly in love (maybe foreshadowing the love i was soon to encounter with the food? possibly).\n\nthe menu does not do the culinary artwork of their entrees any justice. when the waiter came around to deliver our food, i felt like i was in a dr. seuss book, or was having a \"bad acid\" trip (and by \"bad\", i mean good). the artistic expression that they display in their food is something that you don't see everyday, or at least in a meal in which the bill won't total over $300 for two people. the food here, is breakfast food, or \"twisted farm food\" as they call it, and believe me, it will live up to the name. you will find stuff on their menu that isn't available at just any breakfast joint, some of which includes snickers flapjacks/pancakes (yes, you read that right! snickers pancakes!!!) and something called the \"<mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark>\" a 24oz. tall can of budweiser in a brown paper bag!!!, with a side of bacon. \n\ni couldn't come to hash house and not order the man vs. food special, it was the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. it came towered upon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, topped with a biscuit, fresh spinach, <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, scrambled egg, and the chipotle sauce. and yes, it was as tasty and delicious as it sounds. one bite and the culmination of all the flavors will both blow your mind, as well as bewilder your taste buds, but in the best way possible. all the elements of the benedict are on point and good quality, the portions of their food are huge, it was ($14.95) for my benedict, and that could easily feed two people. as i watched the waiter frantically walk back and forth from table to table, i couldn't help but become hypnotized by the aroma and the visual creativity of the other dishes served here. <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles looked and smelt really delicious, that will have to be for next time however. \n\nneedless to say, food won this battle. food:1, man:0, until we meet again hash house a go go, until we meet againnnn!!!!!!! (shakes fist)", 
            "this place is ridiculous! i came here after seeing it on man vs. food... so naturally i had to try the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. so  mouthwateringly delicious and seriously enough food for at least 4 meals. hash house is such a fun atmosphere and such a creative menu and concept. you have to go early if you don't want to wait forever. this place is constantly packed. if you're having a rough morning after drinking... definitely try <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark>! :-)", 
            "i love this place, but i don't like it. it wreaks havoc with all my good intentions to eat little, and eat healthy. there's not a dietitian alive who'd condone a dinner of mounds of deep-<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> piled atop four, count 'em four belgian waffles, garnished with more than a few strands of fried leeks, unless you count the sprig of fresh rosemary as a green vegetable.  that's hubby's favorite dish at this spot, which bills itself as \"twisted farm food.\"\n\nthe best i can do in my perpetual diet world is the stuffed meatloaf, and i love it. two slabs of meatloaf, with cheese, fresh spinach, and tomato stuffed inside, atop a mound of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  the bonus is fresh green beans, which have the cooked-but-crisp quality i love at chinese restaurants, and carrots.  i can continue to be delusional as i dig in!  i always order this dish without the marsala cream sauce, but whichever server i have always brings it on the side anyway.  the dish doesn't need it, and i sure don't need the calories.  my cousin dipped a pinkie in the sauce and pronounced it bland, so i'm sure i'm not missing anything.  and <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> bonus is that i have enough of the meat loaf left over for a substantial dinner the next night!\n\nwe usually come to hash house when we have out-of-town guests, because it something our [east coast] visitors can't get at home.  this time was no exception, and it's a hoot to watch their reactions when the food is brought out, either to our table or surrounding ones.  even we gaped at a foot-high dish at a nearby table, and couldn't figure out what that pile on top of a slab of watermelon was.  we found out later that it's the fried green tomato appetizer, and we marveled at that couple's ability to polish that off and continue on to main courses.  it looked fabulous, but i don't think we'll ever be ordering it.\n\none thing i take exception to here is the wine list.  they've crossed the $7 line as their least expensive glass of wine, and at $10 and $12 a glass for my coveted rieslings, i vote with my wallet.  as non-strip eaters, we're not used to paying these prices, and i missed my customary wine with dinner.\n\nstill, hhagg will stay on my bucket list for our visitors, and we sure get enough of 'em.", 
            "breakfast orgy!  those are the words i use to describe this place to my friends and family...at least the ones that are ok with the word orgy.  i made my first trip here 3 years ago after seeing the man vs food episode and now it is an absolute must on every vegas trip.  i was there for the week of the 4th and hit it up on the 4th...and the 6th.  <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> is my go to when i have to split with my wife.  when the shackles come off and i can order whatever i want, there's no telling what i'll get.  i'll list a few that i've had:\n\nchicken and waffles: share this.  it's two big pieces of chicken paired with waffles that have bacon baked into them.  i've never come close to finishing but wished i could.\n\nblackberry granola pancake: i was embracing my inner tree hugger and it was delicious.  the berries explode all over the pancake with patches of granola baked right in.  if you like those flavors, get this into your mouth asap.\n\n<mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash: order this if you like actual <mark>Corned Beef</mark> and not <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> food that comes in the hormel can.  it's served in strips, almost shredded, in a skillet with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and a buscuit.  coulda been something i'm missing, but it's all about the <mark>Corned Beef</mark>.  \n\nbanana pecan french toas: take a big ass banana, split it down the middle and cook that bad boy up.  now pair it with some of the best <mark>French Toast</mark> you've had with pecans also invited to the party in your mouth.  if you want some serious sweet for breffas, do this.\n\ndrinks- i've been wanting to order drinks for a while now.  i always fixate on the food and skip the exotic drink menu. not this last time though.\n\nsmores mocha: are you f'n kidding me?  first it comes in an oversized mug (surprise). it's a mocha which marshmallow fluff on top that's browned and then garnished with two pieces of graham cracker.  it's very sweet, so i'm not sure if it's an option, but an extra shot would probably be the only recommendation i could give to make this any better.\n\ncaramel mocha (?)- not sure of the name, but it comes in a tall glass that makes it look like a shake because it's topped with a bunch of whipped cream which is toped with drizzled caramel and chocolate.  like the above drink, very tasty, but very sweet.  i like my coffee strong, so i'd add an extra shot next time if possible.\n\ni believe there are at least 4 locations in vegas, the m, the plaza, the imperial palace and this one.  i like this one because it's a free standing building well off the strip, so i avoid a little of the vegas madness.  it gets packed pretty early.  if you think you're going to sleep till 9 and show up and get a table at 10 like every other lazy ass, you're mistaken.  you need to commit to breakfast, wake up early and show up as close to opening (i believe it's 7:30am) as possible.\n\nif you go to vegas and don't eat breakfast here, you're doing it wrong.", 
            "so, consider this my big fat first official las vegas yelp review since moving here to sin city.  my partner, bear, strongly recommended this place after having lunch here with his cousin, who's a 'local'.  and i can see why...hhagg takes their \"twisted farm-fresh\" sensibility really seriously, all the way down to the rust-covered \"green acres\"-era tractor perched out front near the parking lot. \n\nbut all else you could notice about the place - even the wall of fame at the entrance, that contains the autographed photos <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> of celebrity past-diners - falls away once the food takes front-and-center stage.  it is no surprise that man vs. food's adam richman considers this one of his all-time favorite places to eat.  the portions are huge.  and i mean so big, even ravenous farmhands just in from a full day in the fields might have to step off a bit. \n\nour friendly, animated waiter warned us away from having individual side orders of fries with our sandwiches, having us opt instead to share just one order between us. wise call.  the stuffed one-pound burger that i had (with the incredible applewood- <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark> and melted cheddar), was cooked to perfection, but more like a two-pounder than just a single.  and i was hungry.  if you are gorge-a-phobic, i would strongly suggest that you bring a friend, order one entree and split it.  uhh, actually, you might even want to make it a couple of friends....\n\nthe amazing thing here, though, is that the food doesn't sacrifice the quality for the quantity, which is nothing short of amazing. i do plan on coming back and trying more of the scrumptious-looking items on the menu...just probably not until thanksgiving!", 
            "this location offers plenty of parking located in a major parking lot. the servers greeted upon entering <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark>. after never visiting before the server seated us and took the time to advise on local favorites and specials. after the food was ordered which consists of burgers and breakfast options, the food arrived. i ordered a stack of pancakes and let me say they were huge! if your hungry and you want something under $10 that will fill you then come here! i did and left full. however, once the food arrived to the table the customer went down hill. server did not visit table frequently and she failed to offer me more water until i asked for more. \n\nrating is based on good price, large food portions. not so much for customer service which was below average.", 
            "operation hash house a gogo complete!!!!\n\noh boy was this place amazing!!! we pulled an all nighter and my friends were raving about this spot. we got there as soon as they unlocked <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> for business and were serviced very quick!!!\n\nour party of 8 ordered the following:\n\n-banana flap jack : amazing!!! super huge and we all shared it because apparently it was the homies appetizer.\n-the trucker something- it came with <mark>French Toast</mark>, eggs, and sausage. omg the <mark>French Toast</mark> was amazing!!! it had walnuts (or pecans) and bananas on top. the sausage was delicious and very flavorful!! \n-biscuit & gravy: best i have ever had... definitley had a twist of flavor but it was great!\n-<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles- i did not have any but it was a masterpiece of food!! it looke delicious and smelled amazing\n-eggs benedict - gigantic protions and the boys smashed their food!!\n-corn beef hash - i didn't eat this but it looked great!! \n-snicker pancake : if i ate peanuts i would have devoured the pancake because it looked so good!!!\n\nall in all it was an amazing first time experience!! ps they have tangerine juice... freshly squeezed i'm assuming... but it was amazing!! \n\ni hope you're experience is giong to be as great as mine!!!", 
            "i have to confess i was skeptical about coming here because i thought it might be one of those places that's really famous because it was featured on man v. food but doesn't live up to the hype. i am pleased to report that this place definitely lives up to expectations.\n\nfirst, if you're looking at this review i'm guessing it probably won't be news to you that the portions are huge. seriously, huge. the plates are more like dinner platters that you'd see in a buffet. lots of people seem to order the mvf featured item: <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. i did not indulge, but my buddies did. let me tell you, this thing was impressive. it's a sky high platter filled with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, homemade biscuits, fired chicken, eggs, and chipotle cream sauce. they bury a knife in it for scale.\n\ni opted for the mushroom, artichoke heart, sundried tomato hash for a healthier option and it was really well done. flavorful and served with perfectly crispy potatoes and one of their flaky homemade biscuits. \n\nif you're into bloody mary's, they make a really great one. spicy and tangy, exactly how it should be. <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> double lattes are also really great.\n\nthis place is definitely worth checking out if you're in the area (go here and not to the one on the strip). next time i'm planning to try one of the burgers, they looked incredible.", 
            "i liked their food. it is different. pretty good sized portions too but i still feel i paid too much by the time we walked out <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark>. over $30 for breakfast is not pretty when there is only two of you.", 
            "this review is primarily focused on the service. came to this location last sunday for brunch. it was very busy considering that it was around 1:30 pm. this is the only hash house that is located in a single standing building. the others are within hotels/casinos.  the wait took about 40 minutes for a table for 4. our waitress, erin, had a very flat affect straight from the start. she wasn't very friendly nor helpful.  i asked her if the couples could split the bill and she said it would be fine. we ordered our entrees, which consisted of the sun dried tomatoes, basil and <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark> farm scrambles, buttermilk flapjacks and the <mark>French Toast</mark>. all were very tasty and had good portions. one <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> to the food was the amount of syrup they gave with the <mark>French Toast</mark> and flapjacks. they gave a tiny shot glass worth of syrup for each dish. we had to ask for extra syrup about 3 times because these dishes needed the syrup. so when the bill comes, it had not been split, so i quickly reminded her to split the bill. i was going to mention which dishes on the credit cards but she replied \"i know what dishes you guys got\" in a very rude tone. yeeesh. she looked at my boyfriend and asked which card was his. he told her his name. the other couple's card had his picture on it. so when she returns with the split bills, she still managed to screw everything up and mix up the items with the cards. at this point, i was quite frustrated so i went back to look for her and just told her what had happened. she apologized but it honestly didn't seem like she cared.  we wanted to leave so we just signed the bills without changing them and left. \n\nthis experience left a sour taste in my mouth. the service at the other hash houses are pretty good. not sure if i want to go to this location again.", 
            "i am extremely disappointed.  hhagg use to be my favorite restaurant.  after last night i will never go back!  not only was the service terrible, but the food was not up to par either.  \n\nthe waitress messed up our order by putting in the wrong plate, this after she told my daughter what she ordered was one of her favorites!  took us about 30 minutes to get the appetizer.  when i saw food going to another party that came in after us(about 15 minutes later), with more people, i asked our waitress why they were getting food before us.  she argued with me that there was no food on or going to that table.  three times i told her i saw it with my own eyes.  finally she came back and said it was because we ordered an appetizer.  it was another 10 minutes before our food started coming out.  once the error was recognized on my daughters plate, it was another 8 or so minutes before hers came out.  \n\nwe got there at 7:30 but did not walk out <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> until 8:50 pm.  we have had problems in the past with the service and still we returned, but this one takes the cake.  worst part is that they weren't very busy so you can not use that as an excuse. \n\nafter 7 years of loyalty i will take my business else where!", 
            "this place is the very definition of a gut-buster. \n\nportions are so huge, it's ridiculous. there's no way you'll be able to finish everything on your plate, unless you stick with a side of toast. even then, you'll probably end up with an entire loaf. i was drawn here because of man v. food, and ended up ordering the dish that adam made famous: it's advertised as a \"farm benedict,\" but what benedict have you ever seen that included a mound of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>? in addition to <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, fresh spinach, <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs? this thing isn't a benedict, it's a house! a very tasty house, as it turns out, but still. i have a pretty good appetite, but was finished only halfway through. my wife ordered the riddled <mark>French Toast</mark> dipped in banana cinnamon cream w/ pecan maple syrup, and lest you think her portion was any smaller, you'd be wrong. like i said, this place thrives on excess! the <mark>French Toast</mark> was chewy and delicious, with a hint of vanilla, and the warm bananas were a divine accompaniment. it all paired perfectly well with smoky bacon. again though, it was impossible to finish more than half. because we were on the road, this sadly meant wasting some of that delicious food, as there wasn't really an opportunity to eat the leftovers later. \n\nyou've gotta love a place that sells a hangover dish called <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark>: a 24 oz budweiser in a bag with a side of bacon.\n\nclassy? nope. but fun? absolutely. \n\nno matter how hungry you are, you will leave hash house a go go stuffed to the gills, vowing never to eat another bite of food again for the rest of your life. \n\nand the next morning, you'll be yearning for a return visit...", 
            "harsh. this is the best word we could come up with to describe hash house. just call it harsh house.\n\nwe wandered here while waiting for our car to be serviced at autonation. 11am on a saturday there was a line out <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark>. it smelled promising. we were seated in less than 10 and our waiter appeared in under a minute. coffee and waters were back in less than 2 minutes. they place was packed so the service really is excellent. the food, eh. \n\nthe music is loud, and harsh and abrasive. the d\\u00e9cor is harsh; i get they're going for a certain look, but it's not very comfortable. the food is, well, harsh. the spices just a tad more than the tastebuds are comfortable with. it was weird. i wanted to say i liked my giant heaping portions of salmon eggs benedict with weird plastic cheese sauce, but i couldn't. they were too... harsh. \n\nif i were a tourist completely hungover from a night of debauchery on the strip and my tastebuds were fried from cigarettes i might like this place. but we won't ever eat here again.", 
            "<mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> caf\\u00e9 in donald, oregon, used to be a must-go for breakfast lovers. i have breakfasted there many times when visiting the area and savored the buttery hash brown logs, fluffy biscuits and local ham slabs. it was the ultimate man breakfast stop, sometimes with stretch limos parked out front and waiting lines. regrettably, those days seem passed. my last visit yielded a modest smattering of sliced dry-fried spuds, no tomato juice (\"we used it in the soup!\"), and an out-of-the-bag, unfluffy, razor-sliced \"biscuit\", which appeared to have been sprayed with butter paint, for an extra 50 cents. this was my second disappointing visit there over a couple years, so it doesn't appear to be a \"bad day.", 
            "i just dined at the location off of sahara. wanted to let you know about the staff and food.\nstaff we waited five minutes at an empty hostess stand, empty bar with a bar tender who wasn't serving anyone.\nwe get seated our waitress (caucasian, blonde spikes hair) was outstanding.\ni didn't know if something was wrong with my taste buds or my meal was prepared incorrectly.\\u00a0\ni get home and google pictures of my duck dish and there it was, the chef forgot the cashews and spice. my duck was so bland, i didn't even taste salt, and it was suppose to be spicy. plus it was over cooked. 3 major issues! what!?!?\n\nalso at 830 the staff mopped the bar area, started prepping the table for i'm sure tomorrow's breakfast, ketchup, hot sauce and sugar. it blew my mind that they were prepping so early for the next day, i'm sure trying to get out as soon as they close <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark>, and they couldn't spend an extra 5 minutes on making my dish right.\n\nthis made me feel invaluable to them and unwelcome. i heard a lot of great things about this place and was shocked they messed up 3 major components of my dish.\n\nlarge portions / share your dish / skip appetizer, you get a huge delicious complimentary biscuit.", 
            "delicious!   copious portions.  bloody to wake up for!   line out <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark>, lucky to grab bar seats.     <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with maple was good worth fighting for!    unreal grinds!   so worthy if your time!   i can't recommend high enough!", 
            "about a thirty minute wait but mostly due to it being a sunday morning i bet. i'm not sure why they don't hand out the \"your table is ready\" electronic notifier disc things...because of that you end up standing around outside <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> so you don't miss the verbal call of your name. in the heat and limited waiting seating, that can be a bit of a drag. once inside you'll find the meals are massive. i had the meatloaf hash, it was really good and filling. service a bit slow, had to wait a while for coffee refills. a definite stop though!", 
            "living in vegas for all these years, it was time to finally come here. they used to have a location at the m, but they closed down so we made the shlep across town in the hopes of experiencing a vegas icon.\nsunday lunch time and line was out <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> with the promise of seating after a 45 minute wait. we waited in the car since there wasn't much wait seating. ok, busy place is always a good sign of good food, right? well, maybe it's more about the ginormous portions.\nas you can already tell from the 2 stars, i was not at all impressed. however, i must give props to the friendly and cordial service we received from our server.\nclientele that day was mostly tatted up hipster crowd with piercings and stretched out lobes. to each their own.\nwe ordered a spicy bloody mary that was very good and perfect for a sunday afternoon.\nwe've been on a <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles kick as of late and eager to try the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles. the pictures of it show a tower of chicken stacked high on a huge plate. we thought sharing this enormous entr\\u00e9e would be the best option.\nwe were amused at the nearby table of 3 petite diners, each having their own tower of chicken & waffles. how ambitious.\nwe finally got ours and though the presentation looked impressive...it was a huge disappointment.\nthe chicken was soggy and skin was wet and fatty. the overall flavor of the sage and rosemary mixed into the batter was awful. we both choked down a couple bites but hated it. the waffle was ok with the bacon cooked into it, but not enough the redeem this nasty dish. this was the only thing on the menu that made hash house a remote possibility for us, but after this experience we will definitely not return.", 
            "so i checked this place out last weekend.  it was mad packed with a waitlist and all.  the atmosphere was very boisterous with a full bar , people gathered both inside and outside <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> waiting to be seated, as waiters/waitresses zipped through serving patrons.\n\nmy wait wasn't that long considering how busy the restaurant was.  i was seated in the bar area at one of the \"high-tops\".  it was fine because i had a great view of the bar, the patio and the front door area.  there wasn't really anything special to see but i still enjoy people watching.\n\nok, so i had to order the chicken and waffles everyone raves about.  must i say, it truly did deliver.  i have to admit that i was a bit awe-struck on just how i was going to attack the towering monstrosity that lay before me.  needless to say, i had to request a to-go after on eating about 1/3 of my breakfast.  \n\nspecifics:  \nthe crunch on the chicken was to die for.  the waffles were very good and i think they would be good with or without being laced with strips of bacon.  the dish comes with a drizzle of syrup which was not enough for me so i requested a side of syrup.\n\nservice was quick and efficient.  like when asked for a clean fork instead of the one with left over stuck on food that was waiting at the table for me as i sat down.    my order came out way too fast which is always  an eyebrow lifter.  i mean just long was my food sitting under a warming light before it was plated?\n\noverall, i enjoyed the restaurant and the food (good atmosphere, good food).  i would like to visit again when it is not so busy.", 
            "i tend to go to hash house as my go-to \"oh god we're starving we just off the plane ehhh i don't know what i want, what do you want, i don't know, what do you want\" frustration ender when i've got friends and family visiting, and at that it excels.\n\nthey have beer if it's ridiculous family, and coffee if the hours are atrocious, and the menu's huge enough to please any crowd i've thrown at it. i've been about 7 times or so now, to both this location, as well as the one at the plaza. \n\npros:\n- you will never leave hungry. the portions are gargantuan. my father is very much the target demographic, a big, burly former farmer who likes his steak <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> measured in pounds, please. he's the only person i've ever seen casually finish a meal at hh. just back from a early morning hike at red rocks and ready to eat a bear? eat here.\n- the food's delicious. i've had the chicken and waffles a few times, the chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>, some pancakes, and a few of the skillets, and have had nothing to complain about on any of them. the chicken and waffles are my favorite, because ooooohhh the skin on that chicken. yum.\n- mellow atmosphere, warm, friendly staff, and even when the place is super busy you never feel prodded or hurried to clear a table for the next person. you feel welcomed. i reaaaallly like that in a place like this, where you might be eating brunch for an hour. \n- great hours for a family that insists on getting up at the crack of freakin' dawn, and even when they are busy, they have a dedicated place for you to wait, not just a curb or a crowded entryway. \n- price is darn good for the food quality and quantity. a bottomless cup of coffee is about the same price here and at egg works; which means i'm not getting a fun surprise on my bill. that chicken and waffles is usually lunch, dinner, and lunch the next day for me. as long as you have a fridge at hand for your leftovers, hash house is a great deal. \n\ncons:\n- you will never leave hungry. holy balls there's a lot of food. if your mom raised you to clean your plate, or you are from europe and have never heard <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> bag this place will give you pangs. \n- you can definitely eat yourself sick. be aware of your tummyfeelings.\n- both locations are popular, and they can get busy. and i mean really busy. saturday morning around brunch time? call ahead for wait times, and be ready for a wait around an hour if you get unlucky. this is not the place to come for fast food, or a quick nip in and out. settle in, bring a newspaper for the wait, and enjoy that bottomless cup of coffee. if you come here with expectations for other than a leisurely meal, you made a mistake.\n- i can't imagine this place would be good for very large groups. anything more than maybe 6-8 people, and i feel like you'd be waiting a while for food to come out and be fresh and hot, but i've honestly never tried it.", 
            "hash a go go is making me slow slow...\n\ngive me some vanilla waffle and one of twenty coffee syrup flavors to choose and i may be able to get a little boost from that espresso\n\nbut wait, i ate too much of that delicious hash a go go...uh oh! \n\ni've heard and read amazing things;\ni woke up this morning with a stomach ready to be filled up...\nwhat i didn't know was i was going to have breakfast, lunch and dinner all in one sup!\n\ni devoured my plate, maple syrup and all.\nthe problem now, is all i want to do is get home to my bed, fast asleep i will fall. \n\nmy friends birthday celebration was what got us to go, \nno sing along birthday song, but that's okay, we were too far in a coma, to mention that they were wrong. \n\nluckily the scene was interesting,\nthe waitress was great and the place was really clean. \n\nthere was no wait, parking was a breeze, \nwe got into our table, in the booth, with nothing but ease.\n\nnot sure if it would be the same on a sunday morning or full moon, \nmore than likely getting a table would mean sitting in a state <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark>.  \n\nhappy i got a little hash a go go, \neven though i'm kinda a little slow slow...\ni'm sure once i get some rest,\nmy words will have more flow flow...", 
            "size matters.  but does it matter enough?  the first thing that strikes you about hash house, even as your hostess walks you to your table, is the size of the breakfasts on the tables you walk past.  ranging from ample to massive, the breakfasts seem to dare you to finish them.  eggs benedicts piled so high you have to peak around them to find your bloody mary.  pancakes the size of a small trampoline.  you're going to need a bigger fork.\n\nbut this is vegas, and there are at least a couple <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> hotels offering massive breakfast buffets.  here, eating your fill is not enough to knock your socks off.  so, hash house, what else you got?\n\nwell, as it turns out, they got pretty good food and a lot of attitude.  by \"attitude,\" i mean a mildly \"holier-than-thou\" approach to their menu, reminiscent of prius owners' approach to their cars.  hash house makes it a point of pride that nothing on the menu is quite what you expect.  they offer a variety of benedicts, but none of them with the traditional hollandaise sauce because that would be so, you know, traditional.  (i know that's the reason, because i asked the waiter.)  breakfast potatoes are mashed or crispy-roasted, but not hash browns.  \"favorite\" scrambles (according to the menu) are salmon, chuck roast, and smoked chicken.  and if you're really curious, you can order the \"old school fried mush.\"  (don't ask me; i didn't order it.)\n\nthe service was friendly, but a little slow.  one of our party ordered hash with a poached egg on top.  the hash arrived, without the poached egg.  we asked for the egg.  five minutes later, the server came over and told us that the chef had broken the egg and would have to cook another one.  another five minutes, and the egg arrived.  five minutes?  what, were they waiting on the chicken?\n\nanyway, the one thing you have to say about hash house is that if popularity is a metric, they must be doing something right.  our wait to be seated was only about 15 minutes on a saturday morning, but judging from the size of the outdoor waiting area there must be times when the line outside is longer than the dining room inside.  \nhash house is quirky, but definitely worth a try.", 
            "it's so so good! \n\nhash house should hand out yoga pants at <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark>. a host should greet you and say, \"hi, welcome, our food is delicious and served in ridiculous portions so here are some stretchy pants to help you feel better about eating until you hate yourself!\" \n\nwe ordered the man vs. food benedict, the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> and red pepper skillet, the salmon sandwich and the artichoke, sun dried tomato hash. all of which were pure deliciousness! the benedict... unreal. it has <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, cheese, eggs, <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, a biscuit and it's smothered in a sauce you could bathe in. the strawberry jam that's served with the biscuits tastes so fresh and real. not smuckers jam, real grandma made it type jam. \n\nour service was pretty good but the it took almost 15 minutes to get our bill. the only negative thing i can say about the good is that the salmon sandwich needs a different bun, it's too much bread to sandwich ratio. \n\nwe will be back, with out stretchy pants on!", 
            "the one in san diego always always has a line out <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> and it's no different in las vegas. all the plates look so appetizing. each plate is enough for 2 people. the service was great.", 
            "i have been to this restaurant before and it was pretty good. however, today i was not as pleased. first off when i walked in <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> this place was full of people everywhere waiting to be seated (not that this is a bad thing, but don't pick this location if you're in a rush!) so we put our name on the list. after a 10-15min wait we were seated and this is where the problems began. we were given menus to look over, after 10minutes i asked a waiter walking by if she could send someone to take our drink orders. she apologized and said someone would be right over. so then the waiter came and we placed our drink and food order. both came out promptly. i ordered the chicken and waffle dish which if you like bacon is pretty good. the waffles have strips of bacon cooked inside. other than the customer service mix up the food was good and i would've given this restaurant a 4/5 star"

            "just visited hash house for the fourth time this past tuesday. has become one of my favorite restaurants to visit on a regular basis. however, this is my first review. right away you would think, wow 4 visits must mean that i am going to give it 5 stars. nope. sorry to let you down there. so here it goes.\n\n1. food - love, love, love the menu! they have a great selection of \"twisted\" farm foods that will have your mouth watering. the presentation of the food, although sometimes a bit over the top, is crazy and interesting and has not heard anything short of \"wow\" from the people i have gone with. i have tried a few different items from the menu, my favorite so far being the hash house meatlof with pasta. on this most recent visit i had their version of chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> and it was big on the wow factor but a bit short on the flavor and taste. the first meal from here i can honestly say i was a bit disappointed in. the veggies needed some seasoning and the weird hat pie crust thing (don't know how else to describe it) was almost a bit stale and really difficult to eat.\n\n2. service - have had no problems here. nothing to rave about or complain about.\n\n3. atmosphere - pretty relaxed and calm nothing too exciting. i did enjoy eating outside on the patio when the weather was nice.\n\n4. drinks - had to use this just to mention how amazing the strawberry lemonade is. i haven't tried anything else because i can't stop drinking this stuff. mmmmmm... i might have to stop in and get a to-go cup now.\n\nto be quite honest, i'm not sure why i keep going back so much. there are places cheaper with just as good quality food. but the portions are huge, the prices are fair for a good restaurant and i always am finding coupons to go.",

            "awesome. we saw it on mvf and had to check it out. definitely mvf worthy. our plates were piled comically high. the initial sticker shock was quickly eased ( about 15 bucks a plate) with the mountain of food that the waiters brought us. i had the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> which had many golf ball size sausage balls in a delicious country gravy, a pile of scrambled eggs, and not one, but 2 giant scoops of roughly <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. this was so big that i ate my left overs the next day and still have another meal. my only complaint on that was that the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> crust was pretty hard and cooked separate so not really a compliment to the meal. \nthe wife got a stuffed quesadilla that hung over the giant plate. it was covered in a delicious queso sauce with just the right amount of kick. my favorite part was that they put fresh jalapeno chunks in the quesadilla. \nmy mother in law got the salmon scramble which was more salmon than eggs i think. but really delicious.  \nwe all had left overs which were still awesome the next day. definitely a must do in vegas.\n\nthe only bad part was that they don't have sweet n low for my iced tea.. but i'll live without it.", 
            "so hash house a go go...  most people have heard of this place because of man vs. food, but i've been a fan of this place for a long time.  its one of the few places i can say that almost every meal i've had here is a hit.  the prices are decent when you discover that the portions are huge.  beware, you might not finish a meal here.  i've been here countless times, and i've yet to manage to avoid having to take out.\n\nmy 2 favorites would have to be either the chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> or the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict.  both of which are ridiculously awesome, and both are one hell of a twist on a classic dish.  the chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> is essentially a deep fried sombrero on some mash potatoes with the \"filling\" poured on top.... its just magical.  \n\nthe wait usually is pretty long if you go during the peak hours, ie brunch, lunch, dinner, but its totally worth it.  one of my favorite restaurants in vegas, if not my favorite restaurant in vegas.  a must go.", 
            "ambiance - nice.\nservice - good to very good\nfood - i've had better\ni had the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles.  for some reason the food was to greasy.  the chicken was over cooked and dry.  i wonder if the chicken is fried beforehand and then re-fried at order.  i like my waffles crunchy on the outside and tender moist in the middle.  the waffles were soggy and pliable.  my buddy tried the waffle and agreed.  i didn't even finish the dinner, which shocked my friends.    it was not the amount of food that stopped me.  it was the grease.  i have been known to power down 2 entrees at restaurants, including soup/salad.\n\nmy buddies had chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> and the meat loaf pasta.  i got to try both of them which were very good.  i would order either of those next time.  the biscuits are very good\n\nthe question is... would i go back again? no.  if a group a friends went, i would go and not order the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles.  would i recommend the restaurant to friends.  no.  but since the hash house has been on tv, they may want to go no matter what.  just don't order the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles.", 
            "i'll be honest. while the rest of my party who went here may not have liked what they ordered, i loved the food. \n\nwe went here because the driver of the other car, who was the organizer of the trip, saw it on tv on drivers, dine-ins, and dives, and said it looked good. \n\nwe arrived in vegas and set about finding this restaurant based on general directions from the other driver. honestly, if you're not paying attention to the signs on the right side of the road (heading eastbound on sahara) you can easily miss this location. the location opens at 730, and we arrived here at about 6am. we pretty much spent an hour and a half sleeping in the car. \n\nthe menu is simple, however it would do good to have photos of all that you would be ordering. what you may not realize when you first come to this restaurant is that the portions are very generous. \n\nwhat i mean by this is that two of our people ordered a pancake combination. when you order pancakes, you think that they'd be like ihop pancakes or like mcdonald's hotcakes, but this thing, according to the server, was about the size of a medium pizza. he sure as hell wasn't kidding! i mean, that thing was the size of a newborn! two people shared one of the pancake platters, and the other person gave up on eating the pancake without eating it. (i wolfed the whole thing down in about two minutes for him) \n\ntwo other people ordered a hash house combination plate, which i believe was hashed potatoes and some green pepper and <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>. one ate most of it, the other person finished only a small portion of it, and shared with the rest of the people on our side of the booth.\n\nmy coworker ordered a waffle platter, and finished only one corner of a waffle and part of his hashed potatoes. he saved the rest in case we were hungry later on in the day. \n\nthe driver of the other car ordered what i believe was <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>. when it came out, it looked about the size of a small child's head. the chicken portion that i cut through (to get a bite) was boneless and covered in a delicious sauce. with my help and the help of some of the other people on the table, we finished a little under half of the platter. \n\nthe item that i ordered was the one pound hash house mushroom and swiss stuffed burger with a side of fries. when the burger came out, it was a lot bigger than i thought it would be. the hamburger patties had the swiss/mushroom mixture oozing out of the middle, and it pretty much dwarfed the hamburger bun. it came with the fries, about four fried spaghetti sticks, and around the plate, there was this caramel type texture sauce. even with the help of three other people, we only managed to eat under half of the burgers. \n\nthe restaurant began to get much more busier by the time we left, as more persons were beginning to come in to eat the food. the server was very pleasant and came by pretty often to check up on us. \n\nthe next time i go up there, i'm definitely going to stop by here and put myself into another food coma. de licious!!", 
            "disclaimer: ok...i actually went to the location inside the m resort/casino - but whatever, this one will do. \n\nif you watch enough \"man vs. food\" you'll see this place show up in the lv episode. while i was staying at my buddy's place in las vegas this past weekend, i saw that episode, and asked him if it was worth going to, or just tv hype. he said it was definitely not crappy...so...off we went. \n\ngiant portions. crazy food presentation (i dare you check out the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>!). fairly reasonable cost considering the gigantic portions. they make one helluva strong bloody mary too! \n\nthe one thing of note for me was the fact that the ingredients were super fresh, and rivaled anything fresh i could get here in california. you could tell the eggs were farm fresh. the meats were tasty and not full of preservatives, and the veggies were full of flavor. \n\nwell worth the visit...just be prepared to not eat the rest of the day....", 
            "went to hash house a go-go on father's day with a party of 9 people. while the food portions are definitely huge, i just felt the food wasn't anything to make you want to write home about. i had <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, which was tasty and extremely filling. my wife ordered the chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> and was not very impressed with the breading.\n\n     another issue to beware of is that they \"decorate\" the plates with a ring of hot sauce for no apparent reason. i personally like spicy food, but we had family members with us who don't and were not particularly happy about this. please note that nowhere on the menu does it state that your entree will be served with a hot sauce garnish. they need to be more aware that some guests may be have pepper allergies or turned off by this. kind of an odd twist anyway, in my opinion.\n \n     on the whole, the food and service were decent enough. i was just not impressed to the point where i would go out of my way to recommend this restaurant over some others. the \"a go-go\" is just \"a so-so\"", 
            "awesome, massive quantity, filling and delicous place to eat- if you're in vegas, you have to stop by here at least once, it's worth the drive/taxi!!!\n\ni loved their chicken and waffles- everything is massive here, so it's large <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> with crispy chicken on top- the chicken was perfectly crispy and moist.\n\ni ordered their brown sugar and banana pancake- i thought it was way too sweet, and i could only eat two bites, but everyone at the table raved about it, they ate the entire thing for me and said it was their favorite thing here.\n\nwe also ordered their meatloaf sandwich- a nice piece of meatloaf  with a large crispy cheese slice on crispy fried bread- it was really good.  we also got their chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> which was a massive heap of chunky vegetables in a biscuit hat- pretty good, their massive burger with mac+cheese just seemed ok.", 
            "this was the location i first experienced hash house after watching man vs. food.  very happy i came. the food is basically on steroids. a plate can feed at least 2 adults. the food is super sized but it doesn't lose it's quality. amazingly delicious!!! \n\nthis last time that i was there. i ordered the chorizo hash and griddled <mark>French Toast</mark> with a refreshing kiwi watermelon lemonade. \n\nwhat i've had:\n<mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>-i've had it several times and i could only eat 1/4 of the dish. it was certainly delicious. the chipotle cream made the dish even more special. \n<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles-it's a tower of chicken on top of a bed of waffles. \nchicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>-ginormous like all the other plates. it's a deconstructed <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>. \n<mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash (my bf's favorite!!) \ncaramelized banana pancakes-this is heaven!!! it's the size of a large pizza so be prepare to share with 3 other ppl. \n<mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark>-very rich, chocolaty, fluffy and lovely!!! \n\nwon't disappoint!!! you will never walk away hungry. to top it off, every person in your party will walk out with left-overs/an actual meal.", 
            "mmmmm food! this is a great breakfast eatery to visit when you are famished or waking up with the drunk munchies from tying one on the night before. the portions are ginormous and the presentation is pretty extraordinary too. i don't generally like for my food items to be all loved up to each other like they serve it up here but at hash house, it works. everything on the plate is served as though it is one item, if that makes any sense. all i know is, this is some delicious grub. \n\n<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> is so warm, juicy and sage-y. so good. but it's hard to make a decision because the <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> benedict is incredible as well. they offer quesadillas with a sriracha garnish that is a favorite of mine too. i have tried most of the menu items at one time or another and the only thing i would not order again is the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>. i didn't like the cracker crust. just a personal preference. hash house is not a one trick pony either. the lunch and dinner menus have some great dishes. i haven't sampled as many items as i have on the breakfast menu but i definitely recommend the crispy cornmeal salmon sandwich. the wheat bun and chili mayo really make this sandwich sing. love it. \n\nbesides the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>, i also don't like the split plate charge. imho it is inappropriate to charge more money for the exact same amount of food just because more people are going to be eating it. i rolled in with a group of four that selected three entrees to share, which would have been more than enough food to feed five people, only to be told that there was something like a $3.00 split plate charge. i'm not sure of the exact amount. and while three bucks isn't that big of deal it still seems unnecessary. \n\nthose few cons won't keep from going back though. the food is just too good.", 
            "one of my top 3 favorite restaurants in las vegas. the chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> was huge!", 
            "i've been reading reviews about this place's amazing food so just had to go try it out .   wasn't sure whether to go for breakfast or dinner but ended up there for dinner due to poor lack of planning and we only had one more day in vegas.   \n\nwe arrived at 7 pm and there  was only a few people in the restaurant.  we were immediately sat down and a nice waitress came over to help.   \n\ni ordered one of those kiwi watermelon lemonades spiked.   very good but not enough liquor!!  \n\ngot a chicken sandwich with the recommendation of the bacon cheese <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> by the waitress.  i asked for the mayonnaise on the side since i wasn't sure how much they would slather on.   husband ordered the chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> which the waitress warned came with a cracker style crust.   \n\nfood came out very quick and had a dramatic presentation.   \n\nthought the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> on the sandwich was soggy and rather bland.   also the cheese on top of the potatoes was microwaved to the point of being hard.  peeled it off and the potatoes underneath were fine.  i ate a better part of it and the waitress said i did a great job! \n\nhusband thought the chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> was different but good.  \n\ni think i will try this place for breakfast next time i go and see if the food is any better. \n\nwonderful service though!", 
            "was kinda disappointed, but will give it another try. the wife and i went late on a saturday for dinner. we walked in and the place was empty at 915pm. okay it was closing in 45 minutes, but was very surprised. we were seriously the only ones in there, maybe it's more of a breakfast place. we were greeted by the hostess who was very sweet and pleasant. she showed us to the table and made some recommendations since i had announced it was our first time there.\n i knew the portions were going to be huge so no appetizers for us. we looked at the menu briefly since we kinda knew from the website menu what we wanted. i ordered the chicken and <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> tower, the wife had the chik <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>. both were huge. the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> comes in what looks like a crust hat. the chikn waffles is built like a tower. the presentation was vey good, but the food in my opinion didn't live up to the hype. the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was somewhat dry, bland and greasy with a slight sage taste. the waffles on the other hnd were the best part... the bacon inside were crisp. i really didn't like the mound of fried leeks that everything was plated on. i think that's sort of what turned me off to the whole meal. i mean you have the sweet and savory combination of waffles, maple syrup and <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, and then get hit with a bit of onion taste... very off putting. \nthe <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> was different than usual which is fine. i can't really comment on the taste but it was made with real nice chicken pieces and huge chopped veggies <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. the wife liked it but stated not to expect the typical c.p.p. \nbad news... the dessert. we had a restaurant.com coupon to use so we needed to hit $50 on the tab. we ordered a snickers <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark>. it comes out with ice cream on top which didn't taste like ice cream, but more like ice milk. it was not velvety smooth and silky but weird. i asked the waitress if it was supposed to be ice cream she said yes... okay. then we get into the <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark>... it wasn't <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark> at all. it was chocolate cake dipped in some egg wash maybe and i don't know...cooked somehow... i think it was microwaved because i hit a nice frozen section on the bottom. i asked the waitress if it was frozen, she said yes. she then looked at me blankly... i looked at her blankly. my wife said its okay we can't finish it anyways.\n\ni will, call me crazy give it another shot for breakfast, maybe try the benedict. again just to be clear... i believe it is way overhyped so if u go, use a restaurant.com coupon, and don't expect great food. the waffles were decent and my wife liked the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>.",

            "my family and i ate dinner here for the 1st time today after our daughter's high school graduation and it was awesome.  we arrived there close to 5pm and the place was not crowded at all.  no waiting, we were seated immediately and the wait for the food wasnt bad at all.  our server was kara and she was awesome.  we told her this was our 1st time there and she told us about the menu ans details about the sides and also gave us suggestions on what we should try and she was very attentive..we didn't have to ask for anything.  to begin, we ordered an appetizer...the fried green tomatoes and omg...they were so delicious.  we also got a bowl of the biscuits and they are to die for...yum.  my husband had the chicken & waffles, my daughter and i had the chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>, my son had the 1lb burger with bacon and my youngest daughter had the portabello mushroom burger. everyone said their meal was delicious.   be prepared for huge portions.  the 5 of us each had a leftover box to bring home...we will eat that tomorrow...lol.  we really liked this place and we will definitely go back.   especially for those fried green tomatoes.", 
            "i tend to go to hash house as my go-to \"oh god we're starving we just off the plane ehhh i don't know what i want, what do you want, i don't know, what do you want\" frustration ender when i've got friends and family visiting, and at that it excels.\n\nthey have beer if it's ridiculous family, and coffee if the hours are atrocious, and the menu's huge enough to please any crowd i've thrown at it. i've been about 7 times or so now, to both this location, as well as the one at the plaza. \n\npros:\n- you will never leave hungry. the portions are gargantuan. my father is very much the target demographic, a big, burly former farmer who likes his steak <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> measured in pounds, please. he's the only person i've ever seen casually finish a meal at hh. just back from a early morning hike at red rocks and ready to eat a bear? eat here.\n- the food's delicious. i've had the chicken and waffles a few times, the chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>, some pancakes, and a few of the skillets, and have had nothing to complain about on any of them. the chicken and waffles are my favorite, because ooooohhh the skin on that chicken. yum.\n- mellow atmosphere, warm, friendly staff, and even when the place is super busy you never feel prodded or hurried to clear a table for the next person. you feel welcomed. i reaaaallly like that in a place like this, where you might be eating brunch for an hour. \n- great hours for a family that insists on getting up at the crack of freakin' dawn, and even when they are busy, they have a dedicated place for you to wait, not just a curb or a crowded entryway. \n- price is darn good for the food quality and quantity. a bottomless cup of coffee is about the same price here and at egg works; which means i'm not getting a fun surprise on my bill. that chicken and waffles is usually lunch, dinner, and lunch the next day for me. as long as you have a fridge at hand for your leftovers, hash house is a great deal. \n\ncons:\n- you will never leave hungry. holy balls there's a lot of food. if your mom raised you to clean your plate, or you are from europe and have never heard <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> bag this place will give you pangs. \n- you can definitely eat yourself sick. be aware of your tummyfeelings.\n- both locations are popular, and they can get busy. and i mean really busy. saturday morning around brunch time? call ahead for wait times, and be ready for a wait around an hour if you get unlucky. this is not the place to come for fast food, or a quick nip in and out. settle in, bring a newspaper for the wait, and enjoy that bottomless cup of coffee. if you come here with expectations for other than a leisurely meal, you made a mistake.\n- i can't imagine this place would be good for very large groups. anything more than maybe 6-8 people, and i feel like you'd be waiting a while for food to come out and be fresh and hot, but i've honestly never tried it.",

            "everything about vegas is over the top.  one of the most over the top breakfasts can be had at hash house a go go.  they are known for their crazy concoctions of burgers stacked high, pancakes larger than pizzas, and breakfast plates big enough for three, four maybe. i have been to the one in san diego, and the long wait was rewarded with plates of impossible to finish food.  delicious at that.  going to vegas, knowing there was a hash house off the strip and on the strip, my breakfast was set.\n\nwe ordered the iced pistachio mocha to start things off.  it was milky and ice cold.  the pistachio taste was subtle, but there.  it was similar to the nutella shake at burger bar. the chocolate was a nice background flavor.  imagine chocolate hazelnut (nutella) but then replace the hazelnut with pistachio. it worked!  tasty!\n\nthe craziest dish i have ever seen was the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>.  it had scrambled egg <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> which was normal.  this was i guess their version of sausage and biscuits, but mutated to a giant monster.  the bottom was a bowl formed by an upside down hat made of a biscuit type bread.  inside the bowl was massive amounts of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> which kind of sucked. there was even a bunch underneath the makeshift bowl.    i was looking for more <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>, though there were some.  after a few bites of this dish, it was a bit tiring.  i don't see how anyone can finish this dish.  carb overload is an understatement.\n\nmy chorizo hash was sensible, but still came in a skillet.  it had jalapeno, red onion, cheddar cheese, and fresh tomatoes.  the kick from the jalapeno was a wake up call, especially compared to the monotone of the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>.  chorizo is spicy as well, so this dish had a lot of flavor. the eggs were perfectly cooked over easy.  though there was nothing special about this one, it at least kept me interested.\n\nhash house a go go is a place to go eat.  they make sure you are full, and you leave with a doggy bag every time. this is the opposite of tapas small plates.  you get one big plate, and a lot of it.  the food isn't boring for sure.  they try to keep it interesting with interesting combinations and portions that are too big to make sense. i guess that is the fun of it all.  vegas is all about buffets, but with hash house, you will get enough -- don't worry.", 
            "what a great place. the food is top notch to say the least.  saw this place on the tv in the hotel room and decided last minute to come here rather than going to the strip.\n\ni got the pork sandwich and my wife got the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>.  both of them were outstanding. bruce service was as well. we got there at 9, right when they were closing and they still say us.  most places would have turned us away but they welcomed us and told us to take our time.\n\nthanks again!", 
            "my family and i went to dinner last night and it was a complete disappointment. first off, walking in there was no hostess to greet us. we saw maybe 4 front of house employees total. we ordered our drinks, mine a tangerine mimosa and someone else ordered a bloody mary. no bartender, so our server, who was very nice, went behind the bar to make our drinks. after looking at the menu i was so excited! so many delicious sounding items. it took me forever to decide. i went with the skillet chicken with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and asparagus. other plates ordered were the meatloaf sandwich and a <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> of some sort that was running as a special. we also ordered a cheeseburger from the kids menu. our food arrived and everything looked phenomenal. absolutely mouth watering to look at. the flavor, not so much. my chicken was doused in maple syrup, which wasn't listed on the menu description, the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> was terrible and the cheese in the meatloaf sandwich was burnt. the only tasty things were the kids burger and biscuits. that's it. i've never dined somewhere and had to send all 3 plates back. and when the manager came over, he didn't even know that the menu didn't list maple syrup under the description of the chicken!! he's a manager and doesn't know the menu?!?! that's scary. the whole experience was a huge disappointment and i have no plans to ever go back. 2 stars because the staff were all pretty attentive and nice. the manager needs a bit more product knowledge, but he was helpful and understanding. maybe breakfast items might be better. good luck!", 
            "to get here is pretty damn ghetto. the plaza whatever the hotel is called is really ghetto,and downtown las vegas in general is ghetto but onto the food. the portions here are no joke. we had 4 people which each of us ordered something different. we had the meatloaf sandwich with mac & cheese, deep fried pork burger with sweet potato fries, <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles, and big ol chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>. the food is good definitely worth trying out if you're in vegas. we all had to get to go boxes because none of use finished our meal. this was our second option since the oyster bar's wait was literally gonna be 2-4 hours, but what a great choice we made.", 
            "we get it. it's the \"best\" place to get food in vegas. after so many great reviews i feel as if they don't try twice as hard. \n\ncame on monday for breakfast and it wasn't crowded at all. we were seated right away and gave us water within seconds. we ordered the basic, the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffle and i was going for the chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> dish (because i saw it on yelp) and the lady said they don't have it for breakfast.. ok fine. i scanned the menu quick and realize i can't decide quick enough and it'd be better if she came back so i told her kindly to just come back and we'll order when i make my mind and she wasn't so happy about that. \n\nwe let her know i was ready and waited for her to come back to take our order which took about 10-15 minutes. i get it, you got tables to wait i respect that but she was not doing her job. by the time she put the order in for the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> our friend's food was out already. \n\nthe water tasted very funky for a highly raved restaurant so we asked for lemon slices and the lemon slices they gave us had oil all over them...?

            "i was so bummed that i couldn't order the chicken and waffles i wanted....only because i wasn't feeling well. i didn't want to miss my chance at eating here so, i tagged along anyways. i had the <mark>Hot Sticky Granola</mark>. it was really good. if, that's your thing. it's not what i would normally order but it was delicious. my hubby got a combo breakfast and really liked his food. my sister susan has been here several times and always orders a <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>. she loves it. i thought it was just ok. my sister karen didn't really care for this place. she wanted to go down the street to our usual spot the egg and i. but, she ordered the chicken and waffles and said she really didn't like it. but, everyone else loved it. you have to be really prepared to wait or just get there right when they open."

            "we joined our out-of-town guests for breakfast this morning, and we figure hash house a go go would be the perfect place.  there was absolutely no wait on a thursday morning at 8:30 am, but two hours later, there is definitely a wait!\n\n* mushroom, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato & fresh spinach hash ($11.25) - the hashes \"are tossed with crispy potatoes and topped with 2 eggs, served with fresh fruit and biscuit.\" two sunny side up eggs sat in the corner of my skillet along with a large biscuit and a generous portion of potatoes and other good stuff.  i ate it all up, sadly enough, minus the biscuit.  and yes, i am still full from my breakfast.  it's a hearty portion alright! i even managed a couple of nibbles of the biscuit with the jam provided on the table.\n\n* <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> hash house farm benedict \"w/ fresh spinach, <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream & scrambled eggs\" ($14.95) - the husband was looking for the item that was featured on the travel channel's man v. food, and the waitress said it was this one.  all of their benedicts are \"served on a fresh split biscuit with griddled <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>.\"  it was a huge pile of something with creamy sauce dripping all over it.  i took a bite, and in retrospect, i don't think i tasted anything beyond the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and cream sauce!  i did see the generous scrambled egg resting on top of the chicken though!  the husband did box up the other half since it is such a generous order though.  \n\n* <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark> topped w/ ice cream and served w/ a cup of coffee ($7.95) - the waitress said the only <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark> they offered was the snickers one.  i don't recall a snickers <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark> on the menu, and this one didn't taste like there was any snickers in it.  no cup of coffee arrived with it either.  it was good though.\n\nservice was okay, water glasses were refilled in a timely manner. we thought she forgot about our dessert since it was taking longer than usual.  but i think that's when it was busy in the kitchen, so that could explain the lag time.  overall, hash house a go go is the place to be at for big breakfasts.

            "was kinda disappointed, but will give it another try. the wife and i went late on a saturday for dinner. we walked in and the place was empty at 915pm. okay it was closing in 45 minutes, but was very surprised. we were seriously the only ones in there, maybe it's more of a breakfast place. we were greeted by the hostess who was very sweet and pleasant. she showed us to the table and made some recommendations since i had announced it was our first time there.\n i knew the portions were going to be huge so no appetizers for us. we looked at the menu briefly since we kinda knew from the website menu what we wanted. i ordered the chicken and <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> tower, the wife had the chik <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>. both were huge. the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> comes in what looks like a crust hat. the chikn waffles is built like a tower. the presentation was vey good, but the food in my opinion didn't live up to the hype. the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was somewhat dry, bland and greasy with a slight sage taste. the waffles on the other hnd were the best part... the bacon inside were crisp. i really didn't like the mound of fried leeks that everything was plated on. i think that's sort of what turned me off to the whole meal. i mean you have the sweet and savory combination of waffles, maple syrup and <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, and then get hit with a bit of onion taste... very off putting. \nthe <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> was different than usual which is fine. i can't really comment on the taste but it was made with real nice chicken pieces and huge chopped veggies <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. the wife liked it but stated not to expect the typical c.p.p. \nbad news... the dessert. we had a restaurant.com coupon to use so we needed to hit $50 on the tab. we ordered a snickers <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark>. it comes out with ice cream on top which didn't taste like ice cream, but more like ice milk. it was not velvety smooth and silky but weird. i asked the waitress if it was supposed to be ice cream she said yes... okay. then we get into the <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark>... it wasn't <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark> at all. it was chocolate cake dipped in some egg wash maybe and i don't know...cooked somehow... i think it was microwaved because i hit a nice frozen section on the bottom. i asked the waitress if it was frozen, she said yes. she then looked at me blankly... i looked at her blankly. my wife said its okay we can't finish it anyways.\n\ni will, call me crazy give it another shot for breakfast, maybe try the benedict. again just to be clear... i believe it is way overhyped so if u go, use a restaurant.com coupon, and don't expect great food. the waffles were decent and my wife liked the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>.", 
            "i liked this place for the food, the ambiance, and the sassy waitress!\nshe was giving me guff the whole time and my family was loving it.\n\ni joked about speaking to her manager and she literally brought him over!\n\ngave her a decent tip just for that ;)\n\ni had the biscuit and gravy with eggs. also the <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark> with ice cream. decadent! you were warned. this thing is loaded with sugar. i obviously shared, but still i could not finish before the trip was over :p", 
            "we went here for dinner and i can't wait to come back for breakfast.  i had a <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> sandwich, which was amazing.  the chicken is perfectly battered, seasoned, and fried to artery clogging perfection.  i *wish* i had ordered the chicken and waffles, which my husband had, because the waffles were the best i've ever had in my life.  (yes, i snagged several bites).  they are light, fluffy, and delicious, and they have bacon inside!  amazing. my father-in-law also says that the <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark> is incredible.  \n\nservice was friendly and prompt.  prices are reasonable.  portions are huge.  prepare to be a gluttonous pig or plan to take some leftovers back to your hotel room.", 
            "gluttony.  where was it born?  if it had a birthplace one might imagine it was in some imaginary land called \"hash house a go-go\".  seriously, the portions here are epic.  you won't find bigger food serving anywhere except if you 3 time it to the buffet!  even the plates are massive, and weigh as much as small serving platters.  the food is delicious, and not too expensive, but not \"hash house\" priced either.  in fact, hash house is redolent of greasy spoons and truck stop diners, but the prices and quantity here are outside that measure..  \n\nif i could recommend anything, <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles is awesome and if you just pop in and get dessert, sharing the <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark> with a friend is heaven.  overall, its a good eatery, but too expensive for a regular family outing.  if your have a massive appetite though, this place will fit the bill.", 
            "i actually like it here, but i'm not going crazy on the stars because i agree with the gist of some other reviews: the food is big, and the menu is interesting, but the food just doesn't taste as good as it sounds. there is always a long list of ingredients in the description, and while you are promised what sounds like an orgy of chipotle cream, smoked mozzarella, caramelized onions, basil pesto, and other tastebud stimulators that sound great on paper, what you get seems a little more like a pile of somewhat dry <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, tasting more like the paper than what you imagined. there are dishes i enjoy- the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> is consistently good, though the waffles are not crispy and deteriorate too fast, and, number one complaint, the huge portion is accompanied by a thimble-sized pitcher of syrup. what the hell? same for those hubcap-sized pancakes(which come in various flavor combos but with very little flavor, and with insufficient syrup to wet them down, it's like trying to eat a blanket). and how about those giant biscuits they serve before dinner? i'm a fan, but they went from supplying one barbie-sized pitcher of honey to the whole table, to skipping that entirely and just drizzling on a little (very little) before serving them. for a place that's so generous with the portions, and that must plow through a field of rosemary daily, garnishing even the plates that have nothing to do with said herb, why are they so reluctant to part with the condiments? maybe they could save a couple of bucks by ditching their other inexplicable practice of adding what can only be described as french-fried broom straws to all their dishes. you spend the first few minutes just picking weeds from your plate.  the meatloaf is quite good, as is the grilled cheese, and baby girl loves the salmon. the side vegetables are usually well cooked and seasoned. i've never tried dessert, because i can't fathom ever getting that far, and i've been tempted to try  one of those giant burgers, but never do because i know i can't finish it and re-heated burgers are just not good. strangely, though, the leftovers we do bring home (which is always), seem to taste better than the original did. who can explain it? but the hh brown bags are always seized upon by the family vultures with midnight munchies. yes, i'll keep coming here to dine, but i will never again make the mistake of ordering the thanksgiving dinner to go. the fried turkey was ok, the veggies were raw, the dressing was dry and flavored only with salt, the portions of potatoes were shockingly small- less than they serve on a single dinner in the restaurant, and the snickers <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark> dessert wound up in the trash. unprecedented. oh, and the number one reason i will keep coming back? you can almost always get your hands on a half off coupon. then it's really a bargain!", 
            "if you go to las vegas, go to hash house a go go!  and go there hungry.\n\nonce again \"man vs. food\" picks a winner.  huge portions of creative food full of flavor, at reasonable prices (imagine that?).   and pbr for $1.75?  yes please  three of us shared the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, grilled cheese, and bacon cheddar <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  all so good.  we were stuffed but couldn't resist the <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark> which was amazing.  we were so full and still carried out about four pounds of food.  \n\nour server was fantastic; even he couldn't contain his excitement over the food.  so many places in vegas will let you down...this place exceeds all expectations.", 
            "always liked this place in san diego, good to see in lv.  the view is stunning (huge windows show-off the desert) and service is very friendly.  the food is the same so expect huge portions!  \n \ntry to save room for the <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark>!", 
            "this place is awesome. probably the best prices in las vegas for what you get. everything is monstrous, share! we shared two things, the <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark> and a salmon hashbrown, bad combo on our part.", 
            "we picked this place because of all the good reviews.  maybe the one on the strip is better but this place had a lot of issues.  they could not even cook an egg properly and we had to send that back.   it also took quite a long time to get our food even though we ordered simple things.  my wife ordered eggs and i got the <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark>.  the table next to us ordered chicken and they got their food before us.  not sure how you take more time cooking an egg and heating up <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark> and then messing up both so badly.\n\nthere are a lot better places for breakfast than this one.", 
            "very large portions and their food is pretty good. tried some of the <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> and blackberry pancakes (light and fluffy) beware the <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark> though. definitely now what i expected for a breakfast item. looks and taste like a devastatingly soggy brownie. order at your own risk."

            "ive been hearing that this is the breakfast joint to hit up in vegas.  we went to this b/c i was so hungry after completing the first las vegas half marathon.  this place is away from the hustle and bustle of the strip on the west side of town.  it was a very good sign to see how busy this place was and how long the wait was.  just waiting outside and peaking into the heated outdoor eating area, you could see how enormous the plates were.  i should correct myself...they were enormous platters, not plates.  we were told that a party of 4 would be unable to sit in the bar area b/c the platters were huge.  \ni was impressed with the wide selection of breakfast items.  first off, going against the rules of post workout re hydration, i couldnt resist trying a libation from the mixed drink selection, why?  why not?  check this out...hash house bloody mary...premium vodka, bloody mary mix, fresh lemon juice, celery salt, worcestershire and hot sauce, spicy pickled green beans (with extras ordered), 2 jalapeno stuffed olives, and a mt olive kosher petite dill pickle, with fresh cracked pepper sprinkled on top...f@ckin hella savory ...that won me there at that point.\ni ended up choosing the <mark>HH Famous Meatloaf</mark> with roasted red peppers, fresh spinach, and smoked mozzarella all on big chunks of fried potatoes.  my favorite and lovely dining companion ordered the farmer's daughter house hash that came with two eggs your way, biscuit, watermelon, and portabello mushrooms, cheddar cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, etc. on also...big chunks of fried potatoes.  both came on a huge skillet (which they called their \"smaller\" dishes...lies...they were huge...i just finished the leftovers 2 days later)  my other dining companion had a decadent omelet filled with <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> and melted brie.  also, all our orders arrived with flaky biscuits, so you get to top it with some their own homemade strawberry jam (we ended up packaging some of the jam up for home...too bad it doesn't last long enough, not from me eating it all, but b/c it has no preservatives!!!\nthis ranks high in my favorite breakfast places to eat.  i will definitely return here with my lovely dining companion to enjoy the other things on the menu, such as the sundried tomato, basil & <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark> scrambled eggs, or the mushroom, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato and fresh spinach hash, or even the roasted <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark>, charred tomato, corn, baby green beans and mozzarella hash, and definitely for that damn bloody mary.",

            "mmmmm food! this is a great breakfast eatery to visit when you are famished or waking up with the drunk munchies from tying one on the night before. the portions are ginormous and the presentation is pretty extraordinary too. i don't generally like for my food items to be all loved up to each other like they serve it up here but at hash house, it works. everything on the plate is served as though it is one item, if that makes any sense. all i know is, this is some delicious grub. \n\n<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> is so warm, juicy and sage-y. so good. but it's hard to make a decision because the <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> benedict is incredible as well. they offer quesadillas with a sriracha garnish that is a favorite of mine too. i have tried most of the menu items at one time or another and the only thing i would not order again is the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>. i didn't like the cracker crust. just a personal preference. hash house is not a one trick pony either. the lunch and dinner menus have some great dishes. i haven't sampled as many items as i have on the breakfast menu but i definitely recommend the crispy cornmeal salmon sandwich. the wheat bun and chili mayo really make this sandwich sing. love it. \n\nbesides the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>, i also don't like the split plate charge. imho it is inappropriate to charge more money for the exact same amount of food just because more people are going to be eating it. i rolled in with a group of four that selected three entrees to share, which would have been more than enough food to feed five people, only to be told that there was something like a $3.00 split plate charge. i'm not sure of the exact amount. and while three bucks isn't that big of deal it still seems unnecessary. \n\nthose few cons won't keep from going back though. the food is just too good.", 
            "the food is always freshly served and delicious. the <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark>, brie and eggs were really good. staff is really friendly and are good with recommendations when you're not quite sure what you want to order.   counter space available if only one two eating in a hurry.  sahara location is easier access then hotel on the strip.", 
            "if you're a huge eater, then this is probably a good choice for you but on my second visit here i decided that it's just complete overkill with the portion sizes. one breakfast entree is more than enough for two people, yet if you want to share they charge you an additional fee. i find this a little ridiculous, but whatever. \n\nthe food is generally okay (i love a good biscuit, and that they can offer) but on this past visit i was not happy with my entree which was a <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> benedict. it was basically a mountain of heavy and dry components which did not mesh together well at all but most importantly, the salmon tasted really fishy. i'm a pescetarian so i know fish pretty well and there was something just not quite right with this salmon. so i take about two bites and stop. i had my husband taste it too just to be sure it wasn't in my head and he agreed. we are not complainers, but we felt they needed to know about the funky fish. our server finally came by and noticed that i hadn't eaten much and asked if something was wrong, so we told her. she did ask if i wanted something else but i said i was okay. \n\na few minutes later a manager stopped by to find out what the issue was, so we explained it to her as well. so, here's where this establishment went all wrong...this manager proceeds to explain to us the entire process of how they \"smoke\" their salmon. she said their method is a little unique and \"not for everyone\" and that she didn't really care for it either. um, really? that's how you're going to handle this? she didn't offer anything to make it right. we weren't demanding a free meal, or even a refund. we didnt ask for anything different and just wanted to explain that there could have been a problem with old fish. the response was basically, our salmon is not for everyone, and sorry you didnt like it. arrogant, and not the way to keep loyal clientele. in short, poor management response has blacklisted this restaurant for me.", 
            "just kidding.\n\napparently i didn't appreciate <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> benedicts quite enough.\n\nif this restaurant were a person, the first thing it would say is: \"get your fatass back here and eat this damn food.\"\n\ndon't fight it.", 
            "let me start by saying i first went to hash house at imperial.  it was good, maybe what i ordered wasnt the best (<mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> hash).  alas, enter the location on sahara! oh my. i had the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and maple glaze. fantastic! portion was enormous, you definitely need to come with a hungry man here to finish your food.  i split the banana brown sugar pancake with my husband. heavenly. nothing compares.  the caramelization on the bananas and the surprising brown sugar bits in the batter were nothing short of spectacular.  might i say that the batter itself without the bananas and sugar was also delicious. eat here! you won't regret it.  i'm so sad i dont live here, but glad my brother does because this will be on our list of pit stops when we visit.", 
            "this review is for the restaurant as a whole and not specifically this location. my friends and i were in town for a birthday and on the way back to california, we decided to stop by at the hash house a gogo that was at the m resort. i've always wanted to try this place due to the fact that i'm an avid man vs. food watcher. \n\nthe food: the portions are fairly big so i would recommend sharing unless you've got a big appetite and know you are able to consume that much food. i sure wish i had shared my dish with some else. \nwhat we ordered (all very good dishes btw cause we tried each others dish): \n - farm benedict: <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> w/ fresh asparagus, sundried tomatoes, chili cream and two basted eggs\n - the basic: <mark>Two Egg Breakfast Any Style</mark>, potatoes, fruit and biscuit (add bacon, sausage or ham)\n - <mark>French Toast</mark>: griddled <mark>French Toast</mark> dipped in banana cinnamon cream w/ pecan maple syrup\n - <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> & biscuit \n - famous one pound stuffed burger: <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, avocado & cheddar\n\ni thought that the food was pretty rich in the sauces and quite heavy. i'm not much of a breakfast eater but i did enjoy my meal here. although i did have to take a good amount of it to go. \n\nprices: each dish is about 15 dollars ( unless you get the basic breakfast/brunch dishes, which are about 9 dollars) it isn't too bad as compared to the rest of the prices from restaurants on the strip in vegas.  \n\nservice: i have to rate the service at the m resort location to be a 2.5. our server/waiter was one of those who you could just tell hated his job and as a result it showed in his performance and the service that was provide to my party of 8 was not that great. he even dropped a fork on my friend as he was clearing the table and said \"shit man i'm sorry\" in my opinion, that is very unprofessional. from my work experience i know the importance of excellent customer service and i definitely did not feel it here. but the food was pretty good and i was in good company so i was willing to over look that slight annoyance \n\noverall. i recommend you all to try it at least once. :) check out the photos i posted too to see the dishes that my table ordered!", 
            "great big breakfast/brunch/hangover/binge restaurant. first off their drink selection is pretty amazing for mimosa type beverages and bloody mary's and alcoholic coffee drinks.  we orderd of course the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>..l amazing as expected.. great chipotle cream gravy and biscuits and juicy chicken. now i was actually not really happy with what i ordered... wish i would have ordered something else judging from everyone else's food around me. i got a scramble with <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> and cream cheese and it was just like a mushy blob and actually kinda small portion.... tasted like something i'd whip up with leftover salmon/lox at home.  \n\nwe sat at the \"bar\" on high top tables which was fine and way better than waiting.\n\ncan't wait to go back to try a different benedict nd have another great breakfast cocktail!", 
            "wow!  words can't describe the food here!  great food, great service, explained they don't have a microwave or heat lamps, so the food will come out as ready!  food fresh, hot, and wonderful!  try the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffle tower...ahmazing!!'  my husband had the <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> scramble...he said it was de-lish!  well worth the wait!", 
            "taking a break from traditional vegas buffets, i decided to give this place a try with friends. they're located about 5 miles west of the strip on sahara ave. although the place was fairly busy for a monday morning, we only waited about 10 minutes for our seat. \n\nthere rustic and casual take on traditional breakfast and comfort food is insanely good. we ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles, <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> scramble and blueberry pecan flapjacks. we were visually wowed when our food arrived.\n\nthe <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles was massively huge, piled high and beautifully presented. it must have been stacked 8-10 inches high and artistically decorated with huge sprigs of rosemary and sage leaves. i didn't know whether to eat it or pray to the food gods. it was truly amazing and the quality was downright excellent and delicious.the chicken was well seasoned, tender, light crisp on the outside and scrumptious. inside the waffles were infused with bits and pieces of bacon which caught me off guard and happily surprised. gratifyingly savory while still sweet, they're definitely better than any chicken and waffles i've tasted before. it makes rosco's chicken and waffles in la more like a kid's meal. \n\nfor you pancake lovers, their flapjacks are incredibly huge and almost the size of a pizza. most importantly, it was delicious. they don't skimp on toppings either. each flapjack was packed and full of blueberries and pecans. every bite had something in it. \n\non a more civilized level, the <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> scramble portions were smaller and regular size compared to the other dishes. both the brie and pesto provided scrumptious fusion of flavor and texture. accompanied with potato hash and toast, it was tasty and hearty breakfast.\n\nthe food here is crazy good and prices are very reasonable (entree $10-$15). our server was friendly, attentive and refilled our coffee and water promptly. while their over the top presentation and massive portions can be a bit overwhelming and mammoth, they make sure that taste and quality take center stage as well. enjoyed my first visit and hope to come back many more...", 
            "solid breakfast joint. loved the healthy options on the menu in addition to the classic american breakfast bombs. the smart start scramble with <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> and spinach was great! i would come here again and again if i lived nearby.", 
            "arrived shortly after opening and was pleasantly greeted and seated!  \nour server was quick to greet us and help us with drinks and answer any questions. \nthe menu is very unique and varied.  i loved all the different choices of pancakes and <mark>French Toast</mark>.  i opted for the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> (normally <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> is my go to). it was huge (as mentioned in nearly all other reviews)!  it was delicious. i was pleasantly surprised with the small chipotle kick on the side of the plate and in the sauce. \nmy husband ordered the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash and he would recommend that too!"

            "this modern upscale breakfast joint really knows how to tantalize my taste buds. started with a tangerine mimosa to drink, which was highly recommended on yelp. thumbs up! freshly sqeezed juice is always a plus for me. i enjoyed the tangy sweetness and i'll admit it one got me a little tipsy. \n\nthe bf and i wanted to split two plates, so our adventure began. i had to try the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> house hash, eggs, and sausage. they didn't have canadian bacon, what a bummer. \n\nthen the second order was <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark>. <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> included brown sugar banana flapjack, eggs, <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. the waitress ky told me it was the #1 seller. you get to choose your flapjack flavor out of: traditional buttermilk, blueberry pecan, blackberry granola, snickers, butterscotch almond, apple cinnamon, mango coconut, and strawberry frosted flake. \n\nthe food comes out quick, the place was busy for a monday afternoon. i really like the set up, service was amazing, and the food is killer even warmed up in the microwave later on. portions are huge! so you might wanna split an order or have breakfast the next day like i'll be having. that's when you know you have found a jem.", 
            "what a pleasant surprise!\n\ni didn't know what hash house was or anything like that, but i was so glad i got to go here! not only do they offer hashes, but there's a load of other stuff on the menu here too that i wish i would have been able to sample. but what i did end up tasting was the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>... that was pretty tasty, although i think the waffle would have been better if it was chopped up instead of just put in whole (of all the things i could think was weird, i thought that was weird). i had the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> house hash with rosemary, garlic, onions, and asparagus. this was all very good along with a fried green tea (i still don't know why it's \"fried\"), due to my previous night of drinking. \n\nwhich leads me to my next statement: if there's a hangover cure, it's at hash house.",

            "yup, like most people who reviewed this place, we also came here because of man vs. food.  we enjoyed this place so much, we came 2 mornings in a row last week.\n\nmorning 1 - got here a little before 8am. didnt have to wait, got seated right away.  our waitress was cindy, super pleasant and nice.  i ordered one of the house favorite scrambles with <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark>, corn, roasted peppers, and mozzarella cheese. it also came with a biscuit, fruit (which was melon and pineapple), and your choice of griddled <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> or crispy potatoes (i got the griddled <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>).  my wife ordered <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> with 2 eggs, bacon (extra crispy), and the vanilla waffle.  we both enjoyed our meals and really wanted to try other dishes which is why we came back for.....\n\n....morning 2 - got here a little later today. around 830.  and boy what a difference that made. it was a lot more crowded and we had to wait 10 minutes to get seated.  altho nothing compared to the hours that some other yelpers had to wait!  today i ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles.  this thing was huge.  my wife ordered 2 breakfasts today because she could not make up her mind and it was our last day in vegas so we were not gonna be back here for a while.  she got the farm scramble with <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, avocado, and onions (it came with swiss cheese but she ordered it without).  and she also ordered the granola waffle.  that did not stop her from eating part of my breakfast.  she was gonna order the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> but since she saw my breakfast came with it, she decided to do the granola waffle and just help herself to my <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>.  fed wife = happy wife.\n\neverything we had at hashouse was good. the portions were huge tho so you gotta come hungry.  we ended up taking home part of her granola waffle which she did eat later on in the day.  yes, according to her, it still tastes good hours later.",

            "the first stop that we made was a pretty well know spot away from the strip. hash house a go go was amazing. the eatery is well known for their over sized food, and breakfast hash. we decided to order the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> hash. like all of the other hashes it is tossed with crispy potatoes and topped with 2 eggs and is accompanied with 1 huge biscuit, but this hash has <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> breast meat, garlic, onions asparagus and rosemary. it tasted so fresh and the chicken was moist and full of flavor. the biscuit was no afterthought either. each table had what i think was a fresh strawberry rhubarb preserve to top your biscuit with.\n\nfinally, we also ordered the over sized brown sugar banana flap jacks. these cakes were crunchy on the outside and soft and moist on the inside. i wish i had a picture but we were so hungry, it was too late, all the more reason for you to go see it for yourself.", 
            "i went to vegas over memorial day weekend. one of my friends mentioned he saw hash house a go go on man vs. food and wanted to check it out. little did we know the entire city of vegas had the same idea. we went on sunday at noon. there was an hour wait for a table of five. i was fine with the wait since that probably meant the place was good. \n\nwe put our names on the list and went next door to vamp'd for a drink while we waited. i recommend doing this if the wait is more than an hour. vamp'd is a rocker bar. lots of rock memorabilia on the walls, guitars, chopper behind the bar, and a coffin telephone booth (kind of cool, but creepy when you get in it). very cool place to check out. and it made our wait go by fast. hash house tells you their pagers sometimes don't work next door, but we didn't have a problem. our table was ready, but they wouldn't seat us without our entire party. two of us stayed at vamp'd to pay our bill, which took 5 minutes. good thing it didn't take longer because they were ready to give up our table.  just be ready when your pager goes off!!! \n\nwe sat down and it took a few minutes for our waiter to come over. once he did, he was very helpful. i thought the ambiance was great. everything that passed our table looked delicious! it was a tough decision on what to get. i ordered the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark>, garlic, onions, asparagus and rosemary house hash. our food took about a half hour. when my food came out barely warm, slightly cold i was a little disappointed. the manager on duty came over and gladly had the cook make me a new dish. mine was good, the chicken was a little dry. could have used some sauce. there is a lot of food for one person to eat. i highly recommend sharing a meal if your not a big eater. or get a to-go box and give it to a bum. \n\ni would definitely go back. i think they have a lot of creative dishes. i will order something different next time. everyone else liked their meal.\n\npros: atmosphere, food selection, their mango margarita, friendly wait staff\n\ncons: the wait (even though it is worth it)", 
            "this is my second time coming to hash house a gogo for brunch, and let me tell you, it did not disappoint.  \n\nfirst off, the pricing:  while none of the food items would be considered cheap, the pricing is slightly less than what you would pay on the strip.  \n\nsecond of all, portions:  portions here are meant to probably meant to be served towards farm hands who have just had a full days work of lifting  100's of lbs of hay with no break for meals.  they are gigantic.  trust me, you will most likely not finish your meal here.\n\nquality:  everything we've had here is top notch.  i'm hesitant to say that about any restaurant, however the food is excellent.  the drinks are creative and tasty.  it's hard to go wrong with this place.  that being said, here's what i've tasted thus far:\n\nmango coconut pancake:  this is bigger than your head.  heck, it's bigger than the plate.  i think it was about the size of my wrist to my elbow... and with soft sweet mangos (must be quality canned mangos, since consistency and flavor were perfect) and shredded coconut throughout.  the thing about their pancakes is, it's made so well that you're pretty much eating cake for breakfast.  soft, moist, and tender pancake.  \n\n<mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> hash:  not sure how they made these potatoes, but they are perfectly crisp and flavorful.  the chicken is roasted well, with a few dry pieces (roasting a whole bird perfectly tender all the way through is near impossible, mind you), but a good dish overall.  this may be the one dish that doesn't stand out from the rest.  i was surprised, however, to see my wife downing the scrambled eggs since she hates eggs... and she loved the way these scrambled eggs were prepared.\n\n<mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> farm benedict:  here's the winner for me.  a gigantic piece of breaded and fried pork, on top of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, with a benedict sauce over the top.  spinach, scrambled eggs... i was happy to just finish 2/3 of this... and the last 1/3 could have been put between two pieces of bread for a significant size portion lunch.  get this.  if you like fried <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark>, you will love this.\n\nsmores espresso:  gigantic cup of coffee, drizzled chocolate all over, torched marshmallows covering the whole top, and a few graham crackers on the side for scooping purposes and eating.  pricey drink, but beautiful and executed phenomenally.  smores fan?  you'll be in love.\n\nhash house bloody mary:  i don't like bloody mary's.  but i order this one every time i'm here.  great condiments, excellent flavor, just enough kick to help jumpstart the day.  (i'm a lightweight drinker, mind you).  definitely spicy and flavorful, so it's not for those with bland tastes.\n\nverdict:  while off the strip, very worthwhile to make the trip.  great quailty, good pricing, huge portions, and friendly service... i've added this to my list of places to go to whenever i visit vegas.  followed by a nice 3 hour recovery nap to be scheduled every time.\n\nprotips - from the yelp reviews along with other friends who have been there, go for either breakfast or brunch... that's where they shine.  it sounds like dinner is good here, but not as good as the breakfast items.  also, while splitting is a great option since portions are huge, unfortunately you'll have to purchase side dishes so that they don't charge the fee for splitting entrees...", 
            "holy shiz! \n\nthe proportions here are enormous! but it's all so delicious and i love that they make the food look elegant and fun at the same time. i mean, to use a whole stalk of rosemary for platting style, i was quite impressed.\n\nmy friend ordered the basics, the flap jacks, sausage, bacon and two eggs. i ordered one of there egg scrambles with <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark>, asparagus,  that came with a biscuits and roasted potatoes. on top of that, we had hot chocolate which can be easily for two people. everything here is just bigger, yet better :)\n\ncan't wait to come back here and try more breakfast entrees and hopefully get to try lunch and dinner sometime :)", 
            "the following (and final) day started out with a big bang. seriously, that is the noise the ten pound plates made when plopped in front of us at hash house a go go. the portion size would put claim jumper to shame. (side note, i wonder if they bought all of claim jumpers plate inventory when they bk'd...?) so the low down on the mile high plates? we ordered from several section on the menu.\n\nfrom the hash section miles went with the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> hash\n\nand brein went with the meatloaf hash (shocker?) bill went for the indiana favorites section and got <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with eggs.\n\nkerie and i thought eggs benedict sounded good (and possibly a smaller choice...just by looking at the plates being delivered to other tables...we were very wrong). she got the crispy hammered pork benedict\n\nand i the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. starting from the bottom mine had 2 huge home made biscuits, about 2 cups of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> (crisped on the griddle), fresh spinach and tomato slices, 2 slices of crispy bacon, about 8 oz of melted mozzarella cheese, scrambled eggs (looked like 2 or 3), and then the largest <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breast i've ever seen with chipotle creme poured on top. oh yea, a slice of watermelon was in there somewhere too. \n\neveryone enjoyed their meal, brein and i enjoyed taking 80% of the food home with us and i even took my dad there a few days later. all in all this is a must however i will say that a friend got sick from the location at imperial palace and this review only vouches for the location on sahara.", 
            "i want to start out my restaurant reviews - with my #1 pick to eat at in the las vegas valley. the would be the hash house a go go. the hash house is located at four locations in the las vegas valley. the first is at 6800 west sahara blvd. just east of rainbow blvd. the second is in the imperial palace hotel & casino located at 3535 las vegas blvd s. the third location is in the m resort and casino located at 12300 las vegas blvd. s in henderson. and the newest is at the plaza hotel and casino at the end of fremont street in downtown las vegas. they have a great menu for breakfast, lunch & dinner. come dine for breakfast on a '<mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark>, garlic, onion, asparagus and rosemary' hash for only $12.95.\n\nor dine on one of their famous one pound burgers like the 'apple <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark> and mashed potato' burger also for only $12.95. no need for side dishes with this one, even though it comes with a ton of fries. (prices are subject to change) how about for dinner you try one of their '<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> linguine'. all of their food is great to eat and easy on the wallet.\n\nthey say that they serve \"twisted farm food\". i'm not sure if i would call it twisted, but it is some of the best i have had. not only is the food some of the best, i have to say that the servers are some of the best as well. my beverage was never empty and when they asked if i needed something more i never felt as if i were being pressured. they truly wanted to help me. even if they were just pretending, i could not see it. so, if you are looking for something unique and great tasting, get on down to one of the three locations of the hash house a go go.", 
            "i have been to hash house before but not at this location. my prior experience were not so good. but i decided to give it another chance. and i have to say that this location is far better than the other one in imperial palace. the food and service was just awesome.\n\nso, we got there early and were seated right away. the waitress was nice and attentive. \n\ni ordered the benedict andy <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>. ^_^ this was extremely good. just thinking about this dish is making my mouth water. additionally, my b ordered the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> which was another great dish. not to mention, the portion are huge. \n\nwith that say, i would totally come back to this restaurant.", 
            "came here for a birthday breakfast after a recommendation from a friend.  i'm glad we came here.  we ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs and the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> benedict.  the portions were huge!  we definitely could not finish in one sitting.  our meals were delicious.  the chicken was not too dry and seasoned well (not too salty, which is a common downfall).  i really liked the fact that they had tangerine juice!  yum!  because it was a birthday breakfast, i had to ask if they would give us a free dessert, which they didn't.  however, we were able to get a candle on the birthday girl's order.  that was nice.  the staff was friendly and the atmosphere was casual and perfect for families and larger parties.", 
            "took an extended weekend trip to vegas. yelped a few good places to eat at. came across hash house a go go. i ordered the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> with red peppers scramble with a side of potatoes. it was good not very seasoned but ehh cant complain. it was a good amount of food, i wasnt even able to eat it all. they had fresh homemade strawberry jam for the biscuits ( loved it ). the server was friendly and there was no wait. we wanted to sit outside on the patio however there was this thing shooting out a mist of water and we asked if that would be going on the whole time they said yes. i am not sure why any one would want to be sprayed with a mist of water while they are trying to enjoy their breakfast but whatever lol. i would recommend this place but dont sit outside!", 
            "this is the most overhyped place i've ever tried. i had their <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> hash and it was the most bland tasting thing i've ever had in my life. in fact, it was even served to me lukewarm. to top it off, the waitress and management did nothing to rectify the situation when i complained. bad food, bad customer service. save your money for one of the many better food options out here.", 
            "add me to chorus of positive reviews, you really can't go wrong with this place. \n\ni'm not a pig, but i get frustrated when you pay good money at a restaurant and you leave hungry. this will never happen to you here. the portions are huge, you always have a doggie bag, and they make your favorite menu item so well that you'll find it hard to try some of the other menu items (but you should, i have yet to try anything here that isn't first rate). the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> hash is my favorite (for the moment).\n\none thing i particularly enjoy about hhagg is the excellent micro-brew choices they have. it's not a massive list, but it's an excellent, rotating list, and it complements a lot of the meals really well. \n\n there is always a wait at this place, so plan accordingly. but you know when you see a big line in front of any restaurant, it's usually for the right reasons, and that is certainly true of hhagg.", 
            "it's so so good! \n\nhash house should hand out yoga pants at <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark>. a host should greet you and say, \"hi, welcome, our food is delicious and served in ridiculous portions so here are some stretchy pants to help you feel better about eating until you hate yourself!\" \n\nwe ordered the man vs. food benedict, the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> and red pepper skillet, the salmon sandwich and the artichoke, sun dried tomato hash. all of which were pure deliciousness! the benedict... unreal. it has <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, cheese, eggs, <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, a biscuit and it's smothered in a sauce you could bathe in. the strawberry jam that's served with the biscuits tastes so fresh and real. not smuckers jam, real grandma made it type jam. \n\nour service was pretty good but the it took almost 15 minutes to get our bill. the only negative thing i can say about the good is that the salmon sandwich needs a different bun, it's too much bread to sandwich ratio. \n\nwe will be back, with out stretchy pants on!", 
            "we had the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> and artichoke skillet and both were delicious. huge portions and everything was cooked to perfection. best biscuit in town. be prepared to experience a food coma."

            "ive been hearing that this is the breakfast joint to hit up in vegas.  we went to this b/c i was so hungry after completing the first las vegas half marathon.  this place is away from the hustle and bustle of the strip on the west side of town.  it was a very good sign to see how busy this place was and how long the wait was.  just waiting outside and peaking into the heated outdoor eating area, you could see how enormous the plates were.  i should correct myself...they were enormous platters, not plates.  we were told that a party of 4 would be unable to sit in the bar area b/c the platters were huge.  \ni was impressed with the wide selection of breakfast items.  first off, going against the rules of post workout re hydration, i couldnt resist trying a libation from the mixed drink selection, why?  why not?  check this out...hash house bloody mary...premium vodka, bloody mary mix, fresh lemon juice, celery salt, worcestershire and hot sauce, spicy pickled green beans (with extras ordered), 2 jalapeno stuffed olives, and a mt olive kosher petite dill pickle, with fresh cracked pepper sprinkled on top...f@ckin hella savory ...that won me there at that point.\ni ended up choosing the <mark>HH Famous Meatloaf</mark> with roasted red peppers, fresh spinach, and smoked mozzarella all on big chunks of fried potatoes.  my favorite and lovely dining companion ordered the farmer's daughter house hash that came with two eggs your way, biscuit, watermelon, and portabello mushrooms, cheddar cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, etc. on also...big chunks of fried potatoes.  both came on a huge skillet (which they called their \"smaller\" dishes...lies...they were huge...i just finished the leftovers 2 days later)  my other dining companion had a decadent omelet filled with <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> and melted brie.  also, all our orders arrived with flaky biscuits, so you get to top it with some their own homemade strawberry jam (we ended up packaging some of the jam up for home...too bad it doesn't last long enough, not from me eating it all, but b/c it has no preservatives!!!\nthis ranks high in my favorite breakfast places to eat.  i will definitely return here with my lovely dining companion to enjoy the other things on the menu, such as the sundried tomato, basil & <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark> scrambled eggs, or the mushroom, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato and fresh spinach hash, or even the roasted <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark>, charred tomato, corn, baby green beans and mozzarella hash, and definitely for that damn bloody mary.", 
            "when visiting my parents in las vegas, my husband likes to try all the different buffets.  this weekend i wanted to try something different, and i'm glad we did.  their slogan \"twisted farm food\" encapsulates the menu pretty well.\n\nwe went to hh for breakfast around 10:30 on sunday morning and sat down immediately.  lucky timing -- because when we left about an hour later the line was huge.  much like the huge portions of food we were served.  my husband had one of the sunday specials -- a giant skillet with <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark>, home fried potatoes, green beans, corn, sun dried tomatoes, mozzarella, 2 fried eggs and a huge biscuit.  i had a scramble that consisted of salmon, pesto and brie that was also served with home fries and huge biscuit.  we switched plates half way through and still brought home a (you guessed it) huge box of leftovers.\n\nmy husband liked the very strong coffee that was refilled often.  i liked the homemade blackberry jam atop the biscuits.  the food was good, but needed a bit more salt then we're used to adding.  the service was top notch, especially considering how busy the place was the entire time.  and the music was all 80s alternative which made my meal that much more enjoyable :)",

            "hash house is a great restaurant to go to for massive portions and delicious food! we had a group of 6 and couldn't finish all of our food for dinner. it was a shame to see the food wasted. we could have ordered 2 dishes and finished everything.\n\nwe started off with humongous biscuits. they were the size of my fist! the biscuit was pretty good; it wasn't dry. the honey and butter gave it some better flavor. we also asked if there were any fruit jams available from breakfast. there was strawberry jam in the fridge and it was very fresh tasting. yum!\n\neveryone practically ordered from the breakfast menu. who wouldn't want breakfast for dinner? we had the following dishes:\n\n+ pacers hash ($12.95) - the potatoes were crispy and the pork as moist. fresh corn, green beans, asparagus, scrambled eggs, and fruit also came with the dish. one small gripe was the cheese that covered the dish was a bit too heavy for me. otherwise, great flavors!\n\n+ boston hash ($14.95) - the crab cake was pretty good, and the horseradish cream was not overpowering. the tomatoes in the hash made the potatoes a little soggy though. dish came with asparagus, fruit, and scrambled eggs. \n\n+ <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> benedict ($14.95) - wow! this dish was awesome! the pork was so moist. i couldn't believe the size of the pork. the creamy sauce was yummy too. also comes with a biscuit at the bottom.\n\n+ grilled portabello mushroom sandwich ($12.95) - i didn't get to try the sandwich, but i heard that it wasn't bad. \n\nsplit charge is $2.50 per person. \n\ni would definitely come back again and try breakfast during the morning/lunch time. the food is very fresh since the restaurant doesn't own any freezers. \n\nyou can also visit the hash house in san diego. our waiter told us that there would be another hash house on the strip in the near future. yay!\n\nseparate men and women bathrooms are in the back of the restaurant.", 
            "definitely a place to go if you are uber hungry, and with quantity also comes quality at this establishment.  i have gone to the hash house in san diego many times, mostly for breakfast and once for lunch, but i gotta say although this one is so distant, it still has the same standard of quality.  it may seem pricy, but for the portions you get (enough for maybe 1-2 other meals), it's worth it.\n\nfor dinner our first night on a week long road-trip, we stopped by vegas to try this place out.  i had the boston hash- the crab cakes were pretty tasty- the only other kind i have to compare it to is the one from rainforest cafe (ewwww!!) and fisherman's wharf in san francisco (specifically sabella and torre- delish!)  but the breakfast that takes the cake here is the <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> benedict.  the pork is just bursting with flavor and the creamy benedict sauce really complements it really well :)  \n\ni requested jam for the huge biscuits that usually come with the entrees, and although they don't have any in the evening, the server was able to find some that was saved from the morning (thank you!!).  it was strawberry preserves, and although it was really good, the best is the fresh fruit one made with blueberry/strawberry/peaches.  i commend them for their excellent service, and hope they perhaps open one in nor cal ;)",

            "we stopped by this place one saturday morning and it was packed to the gills, which should have warned us that we too, would be packed to the gills!  the wait for a table was about 30 minutes, which wasn't too bad.  our waitress was very attentive and took good care of us.  i started with a blood mary (yum!) and my hubby had the mocha latte - both drinks were very good! the bloody mary was spicy and adorned with jalapeno stuffed green olives.  i ordered the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> and my hubby ordered the <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> sandwich.  \n\nto say the portions were obscene is an understatement.  the portions were ridunculous!!!!  mine was less ridunculous than my hubby's - the <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> was three times the size of the bun!  why add the bun?  seriously.  there was no way in hell that anyone could have picked that thing up and ate it.  at any rate, the chicken breast on mine was delicious, tender and juicy.  it was a mountain of food, to put it mildly.  i ate the chicken breast, cheese, eggs and bacon - i had no room at all for the biscuits, spinach <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> underneath it all.  i believe mine came with a side of shame and guilt because i felt like crap the rest of the day.\n\nwhile our food was very tasty and worth the wait (they do make everything to order, so be patient), it was too much food for 4 people, let alone 2.  for the love of god, if you go, order one meal and share it!! yes, they charge you $2.50 for a split plate, but who cares?!  it's a small price to pay to be able to enjoy the rest of your day and not be in a vegetative state!!",

            "wooooo, this place literally almost kicked my a**. saw it on the hotel channel (702 something) & saw pancakes the size of rims & burgers as big as a basketball & i had to try this place. went there on a saturday am for brunch i guess. 12:30 arrived and the place was packed. \n\nbar was hopping with a ton of people getting blood mary's & mojitos. friend got a bloody mary, it was huge & only 7 bucks. wait was 30 minutes, but since we made the effort to venture off the strip we were committed. \n\nlooking @ the menu literally 80% of it caught my interest. i settled on the \"<mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> w/ market yellow tomato, spinach, barb'que cream and topped w/ scrambled eggs\" copy & pasted straight from their website. but my goodness it was amazing and i was breathing heavy in between bites to finish the thing off.\n\na must now for me & my buddies that can eat when we're in vegas. didn't know there was 1 in san diego so looking forward to trying that 1 as well.", 
            "when people write <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> of america, hash house a go go must be included.  i say that because if we all go here, it will makes us fat, happy and complacent.  i ate there five days ago and i think im still full.  giant portions are but a small (large?) measure of hash's greatness.  \n\nworking under the moniker \"twisted farm food,\" hash has the decor of an industrial style barn.  while being seated, you notice every table gawking at other tables in sheer awe of what is being delivered to other tables.  imagine being at a hospital nursery and all the babies are 25 lbs, and the fathers are just looking at each other and smiling.  that's whats going on here.  \n\nfirst thing i noticed was the prices...they're really cheap for the amount of food i saw coming out.  i dont think anything was more than $15.  the waitress explained that the restaurant makes everything from scratch and that there are no heat lamps meaning food can be brought out at different times.  working under that guise, i contemplated what would i like to try in giant form and made of scratch that ive probably never had before.  i settled on the pounded <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> sandwich with crispy french fries.\n\nwhen my sandwich came out, i desperately asked my waitress for tactical help on how to eat it.  the sandwich was so large i had no idea where to begin.  she laughed no doubt having heard that 100's of times before.  i finally dove in and found the pork cutlet to be tender and tasty.  not the absolute best i ever had, but for the price and the portions i felt it was more than acceptable.  the fries were excellent and actually crispy...rare is it when a restaurant advertises crispy these days and actually delivers a crispy product.  my party also really enjoyed their oversized sandwiches of various ilk.  \n\nas we descended into dreams of wearing elastic pants for our expanded waistlines, we became part of the peanut gallery looking at other peoples tables and what they had ordered.  the burgers are ginormous and the breakfasts really steal the show.  pancakes the size of pizzas, hash brown servings that must be made of two full potatoes and toast truly of the \"texas\" variety.  there are so many things i need to go back and try but these trips must be rationed for health's sake.\n\nservice was very friendly and accommodating and there was relatively little wait to be seated although i do know on weekends at brunch time you will wait awhile (i see it whenever i drive by).  another great added benefit was that with my $13 sandwich i was able to get a full 3 meals out of it.  three!!!   \n\nthis restaurant truly embodies the ethos: \"only in america.....:", 
            "yuck! this place was a complete let down, we queued for about an hour to get a table here. by the time we were seated we were starving, but it was hard to get someone to take order as they were so busy. i had the farmhouse benedict with <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> with fruit instead of potatoes, which was awful beyond words! it was a fried <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> still swimming in oil, with a sickly sweet creamy sauce on top, the only edible bit of the meal was the fruit. the portions are massive, enough to feed about 30 people, so if you care for quantity over quality then this is the place for you.", 
            "so i was in vegas this past weekend and my friend wanted to try out this place before heading out to oc. he saw this place from the show man vs food. i guess for what it's worth, i love american food and i love brunch.\n\nthe place is quiet far from the freeway (about 15 min local drive) and can be easily found from the street. the place has a rustic/barn feel from the outside. it was a bad idea to come during lunch time without any reservation (we had a party of 8) because the wait was about 1 hour.\n\nthe portion is ginormous!!! i ordered the <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> w/ market yellow tomato, spinach, bar b' que cream and topped w/ scrambled eggs. the pork came out crispy and delicious. it's really a comfort food and it's highly recommended if you come with a big group. don't try to eat everything alone because sharing is caring .... ^_^\n\nthis place redefine the word gluttony and i'd love to come back again to try out other food.",

            "i had no idea the portions were this huge!!  my family decided to have brunch here after seeing it on \"man vs. food.\"  all five of us ordered our own meal, but what we should've done is ordered two or three meals max.  we had sooo much leftover food.  it was sad we couldn't just box it up and take it back home.  \nwhat i really enjoyed were the mimosas (mmm...fresh tangerine), the fries that came with the \"bacon, avocado, and cheddar 1lb. burger,\" <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> salad (minus the actual flavoriess chicken), and <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> benedict.  i also tried the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> and <mark>HH Famous Meatloaf</mark> hash, which were both quite disappointing.  there's a problem if my mom makes better meatloaf.", 
            "this is my second time coming to hash house a gogo for brunch, and let me tell you, it did not disappoint.  \n\nfirst off, the pricing:  while none of the food items would be considered cheap, the pricing is slightly less than what you would pay on the strip.  \n\nsecond of all, portions:  portions here are meant to probably meant to be served towards farm hands who have just had a full days work of lifting  100's of lbs of hay with no break for meals.  they are gigantic.  trust me, you will most likely not finish your meal here.\n\nquality:  everything we've had here is top notch.  i'm hesitant to say that about any restaurant, however the food is excellent.  the drinks are creative and tasty.  it's hard to go wrong with this place.  that being said, here's what i've tasted thus far:\n\nmango coconut pancake:  this is bigger than your head.  heck, it's bigger than the plate.  i think it was about the size of my wrist to my elbow... and with soft sweet mangos (must be quality canned mangos, since consistency and flavor were perfect) and shredded coconut throughout.  the thing about their pancakes is, it's made so well that you're pretty much eating cake for breakfast.  soft, moist, and tender pancake.  \n\n<mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> hash:  not sure how they made these potatoes, but they are perfectly crisp and flavorful.  the chicken is roasted well, with a few dry pieces (roasting a whole bird perfectly tender all the way through is near impossible, mind you), but a good dish overall.  this may be the one dish that doesn't stand out from the rest.  i was surprised, however, to see my wife downing the scrambled eggs since she hates eggs... and she loved the way these scrambled eggs were prepared.\n\n<mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> farm benedict:  here's the winner for me.  a gigantic piece of breaded and fried pork, on top of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, with a benedict sauce over the top.  spinach, scrambled eggs... i was happy to just finish 2/3 of this... and the last 1/3 could have been put between two pieces of bread for a significant size portion lunch.  get this.  if you like fried <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark>, you will love this.\n\nsmores espresso:  gigantic cup of coffee, drizzled chocolate all over, torched marshmallows covering the whole top, and a few graham crackers on the side for scooping purposes and eating.  pricey drink, but beautiful and executed phenomenally.  smores fan?  you'll be in love.\n\nhash house bloody mary:  i don't like bloody mary's.  but i order this one every time i'm here.  great condiments, excellent flavor, just enough kick to help jumpstart the day.  (i'm a lightweight drinker, mind you).  definitely spicy and flavorful, so it's not for those with bland tastes.\n\nverdict:  while off the strip, very worthwhile to make the trip.  great quailty, good pricing, huge portions, and friendly service... i've added this to my list of places to go to whenever i visit vegas.  followed by a nice 3 hour recovery nap to be scheduled every time.\n\nprotips - from the yelp reviews along with other friends who have been there, go for either breakfast or brunch... that's where they shine.  it sounds like dinner is good here, but not as good as the breakfast items.  also, while splitting is a great option since portions are huge, unfortunately you'll have to purchase side dishes so that they don't charge the fee for splitting entrees...",

(not that i did, mind you, but i could've.) our total bill for the 2 of us sharing these two items and a soda pop each was a reasonable $41, and we each had a to go box for lunch the next day left. i desperately wanted to try the cheesecake for dessert but i literally could not eat one more bite. the only criticism i have is that there is not one close to seattle. i hope they get on that soon.",

            "so good.  it was a $20 cab ride from the strip but hash house a go go had a good menu and everything we ordered was really tasty so it was absolutely worth the effort.  we had to wait 15 minutes for a table but when we left around 1, there were a whole bunch of people waiting so i'm glad we were able to get there by noon.\n\ni got the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> since if <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> is on the menu, i am almost sure to get it.  it was a biscuit sitting on a mound of mash potatoes with egg, a well spiced <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breast, bacon, tomato, spinach and a red pepper cream sauce.  it was a ridiculous amount of food and i'm suprised i didn't go into cardiac arrest just looking at it. \n\ni understand what another reviewer said about their food looking too messy because when my benedict came out, i was overwhelmed thinking about how i was going to eat it.  usually, when i get a giant plate of something, it makes me kind of sick but because it was so delicious, i got over it.  i couldn't even finish half. \n\nmy beverage of choice was the bloody mary.  it was tangy and spicy with a lot of stuff in it, just how i like it.  i didn't think it had much alcohol but as i got progressively more giggly during the meal, i realized i was wrong.\n\nmy friends got the  blueberry pancake (it seriously is the size of a big pizza), the meatloaf hash and the veggie hash and they all really liked their food but the best thing we had may have been the strawberry jam.  none of us are into big chunks of bread and had not touched our biscuits but once we decided to try some of the jam, we basically empied the container onto them and had to have them for later.   it was not too sweet and had a really good consistency. \n\nnow, i'm sad i didn't end up eating the leftovers because we were too busy drinking and gambling.  i would definitely recommend it if you want good, non-buffet food.",

            "my wife and i have eaten here several times. it has always been very good. the best time to go is around 11 am, when they will usually let you order from both the breakfast and lunch menus - (breakfast menu is better).\n\nfor breakfast, i like their scrambles better than the hash. but my favorite for breakfast is the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. it's a huge piece of boneless chicken on top of a buttermilk biscuit, topped with scrambled eggs, tomatoes, bacon and mozzarella cheese. it comes with a side of griddled (mashed) potatoes. it is all drizzled in a chipotle cream sauce, which is a little spicy. it is huge!! you will be eating leftovers! \n\nfor lunch i like the one pound stuffed hamburgers with a side of au gratin potatoes. the ham and egg stuffed hamburger is very good. \n\nis any of this stuff good for you? probably not. they do have some salads with vinaigrette dressings for the more healthy diets, but most of the menu is heavy meals and outrageous portions.  it's a great place to go for the \"wow\" factor.  the prices are moderate, the quality very good and the staff has been friendly.  we will keep going back and trying new menu items.",

            "i want to love this place, but in the end i ended up just liking it. \n\nmy husband and i went here to try something different from our normal breakfast/brunch haunts like the coffee cup in boulder city or one of the champagne brunches at the bellagio or mandalay bay. \n\nwith that said, the place was ok. there was a bit of a wait and for some reason the chef either really likes rosemary or his supplier gave him an excess that was unreasonable that he had to get rid of it somehow. \n\ni ordered the chicken and waffles and my husband ordered the meatloaf hash. for drinks i had the bloody mary and he had the orange juice since he had to go into work in a few hours. you can't really complain about orange juice and the bloody mary was just ok, the whole time i was drinking it i just kept thinking about the bloody mary i had at rosemary's, which was awesome!, and i guess nothing could really compare to that so i can't really complain. \n\nas for the food, the meatloaf hash....well i think they got the order wrong because it actually looked like it was a sausage hash or something like that. my husband gave me a bite and i just couldn't believe that that bite contained anything that would resemble meatloaf. one it was pale, and it was somewhat rounded like it was a chicken sausage. he said that it was meatloaf but honestly, unless it was a chicken or turkey meatloaf i just couldn't understand why the \"meat\" was pale like that. as for my chicken and waffles, it was ok. maybe i'm used to roscoe's in la, but the chicken was dry and the waffles was just too soft for me. the only saving grace was the fried leeks. the long piece of rosemary running through it was just ridiculous! with every bite all i smelled and tasted was the rosemary, i thought it was supposed to be \"sage\" <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>? why not have fresh sage on the dish? the dish was bearable after my husband took that branch of rosemary off my dish and onto his side of the table. i felt bad cause he also had a branch of rosemary on his plate however it would have been considered a \"mini\" compared to the huge branch i got on my plate. new york times favorite or whatever they claim on their menu?!?...either i got screwed on the chicken and the extra rosemary order the day before or maybe the new york times critic was high when he/she decided to make it a favorite. sorry i'm just not a fan of inedible garnishes that just don't make any sense on a plate. \n\nthe ambiance and building itself was pretty cool, the staff was dressed as greasers, you could see their \"real\" hair under thier wigs. haha. for the same price of breakfast for the both of us we could have gotten champagne brunch at either mandalay bay or bellagio and that is with just one of us getting a drink, just one drink! \n \nwe want to love this place so we will try it again and order different things, hopefully it won't be as bad as it was our first time.", 
            "everyone has got to try this place at least once in their lives. it is a random find on my brother and his gf's part, but dang it's good, on a sunday morning after waking up from a long night of partying in vegas, you want something good to eat. i went there with my family on a sunday morning and it was a bit crowded but worth the wait. i had their breakfast special and i think it was <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> on top of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, onion straws and toast, and bacon and it was just unique but hella good! check out their website too theres some great stuff there, i wish they had one in la area...",

            "it was nice to get away from the bustle of the vegas strip to come try hash house a go go for brunch. the wait took around an hour for the 5 of us since it was pretty darn busy on a saturday afternoon. we just sat around and admired all the autographed menus lining the entry way. their menu had an incredible selection too! i think i would have had trouble deciding if my friend marti l. hadn't already suggested a dish that sounded delish.\n\n<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> meal ($13.95 and $2.50 extra to split the dish) - omg!! the portions were humongous! no wonder hh was featured on man vs. food before. haha the prices are totally worth it if you share the dish with one or 2 other people. my faves were the bacon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and fresh baked biscuit. the chicken didn't taste of sage at all to me and a was a little dry...there wasn't enough maple reduction but was fried to perfection! (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/g8onv26ywjlzpezdbnowuq?select=rocmimasg_k3yc-aopggpa)\n\ni sampled the kiwi/watermelon lemonade (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/g8onv26ywjlzpezdbnowuq?select=avvdot4cdksnfccsuuy5vg) which looked pretty and was really tart just the way i like it. i also tried the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> which were to die for! (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/g8onv26ywjlzpezdbnowuq?select=avvdot4cdksnfccsuuy5vg) the batter was soft/chewy and the bacon complimented it very well. the food took around 20 min to come out but it was well worth the wait! our waitress was dressed like the chiquita banana lady too. lol\n\nfun meal and great, affordable food!", 
            "first off--yes, i went because i saw it on man vs food. \n\nnow that is out of the way... \n\nthere were three of us. i ordered what i saw on tv, the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. friend #1 had the <mark>French Toast</mark>. friend #2 had the chicken salad sandwich. \n\n<mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>: it was big as my head, without exaggeration. this will server 3 people. i barely ate 1/3rd.. but i am not a huge portion eater anyways. i saw a biker kind of guy next to us eat 3/4 of it, which i though was super impressive. flavours? a little too much on the plate. you get a mixture of spicy, creamy, zesty, etc.. it's really hard to describe. if you don't know it by now, i'll call it out from bottom up; <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, biscuit, tomato slice, spinach, bacon, griddled cheese, <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breast.. and all drizzled with chipole cream sauce. it is definitely a brunch item, not breakfast. i have to say, i saw a someone else order it, but with the sauce on the side. smart! \n\n<mark>French Toast</mark>: more like, french loaf. again, massive insane portions. only half was eaten. but i sampled this, and it was quite delicious. probably one of the best <mark>French Toast</mark> that i had. \n\nchicken salad sandwich: by far the best chicken salad sandwich i have ever tried. nice dill flavour, and moist chicken meat. the multigrain bread was excellent too. fries were super hot and fresh. they had a bit of coating on them (very very lightly), and helped stay crispy until the end. \n\nyou must try the waltermelon-kiwi lemonade. very delicious, and thirst quenching. \n\nprice-wise, it can be considered as a good value, just because of the portions. i would say, share dish. do not attempt at it alone. \n\nservice was prompt and friendly, despite the hectic atmosphere.", 
            "whoahhh.....what else can i say but....whoahhhhh...this place is probably the best breakfast place i have ever been to!  i also went here with my group on this weekend trip to vegas.  we came here for brunch, was around noon and the place was hopping.  fortunately my friend's friend had arrived earlier to put our name on the wait list for a party of 8. i definitely recommend getting here early, or making a plan to wait for a table.  they close at 2:30 on sundays and the place was still full when we left here close to 2.\n\nhad been told the portions here were ginormous and that you should share..but when it comes to breakfast, i get serious.  when it comes to anything eggs benedict?  i get even seriouser...lol.  i had every intention of finishing this.  when the plate arrived, i was scared.  if you just look at the pictures you will see what i mean.  i ordered the original hh benedict which was served on their homemade biscuit with spinach, bacon, griddled <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> (i opted for the crispy thinking i was going to get something more along the lines of hash browns,  but they were just red potatoes.  were still good though) and covered in this chili cream sauce.  the presentation was beautiful.  and did i mention huge?  oh yeah, i did.  their specialty here seems to be the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, which, by the way, comes with scrambled eggs also.  i just couldn't fathom eating all that but my tablemates who ordered it definitely enjoyed!  i also tasted someone's pancake.  so fluffy and yummy.  and huge.  the guy at the table behind us ordered some kind of burger and as soon as i saw it i knew...i have got to bring my husband here when we come to vegas next time..not to mention anyone else i may be travelling with.\n\nthey had a large variety on their menu, was very hard to choose.  lots of different fun coffee drinks and oh..the tangerine juice is so sweet and delicious.  this is a locals type place, but it is worth getting too for every inch off the beaten path that is located.", 
            "what a pleasant surprise!\n\ni didn't know what hash house was or anything like that, but i was so glad i got to go here! not only do they offer hashes, but there's a load of other stuff on the menu here too that i wish i would have been able to sample. but what i did end up tasting was the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>... that was pretty tasty, although i think the waffle would have been better if it was chopped up instead of just put in whole (of all the things i could think was weird, i thought that was weird). i had the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> house hash with rosemary, garlic, onions, and asparagus. this was all very good along with a fried green tea (i still don't know why it's \"fried\"), due to my previous night of drinking. \n\nwhich leads me to my next statement: if there's a hangover cure, it's at hash house.", 
            "not that far off the strip rests one of the greatest breakfasts you've ever had. we went at about 10:30 and had to wait for about 45 minutes, but it was worth it. ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>. it was amazing. \n\nstarts off with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, then two great biscuits on top of that. then comes the delicious crispy <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with tons of scrambled eggs on top, a grilled piece of cheese, and then the chipotle hollandaise sauce. i left the place being one of the most food-drunks i've ever been.", 
            "huge portions, great presentation, interesting atmosphere (modern industrial look with black and white photos from the farmland in indiana, clubbing music in the background, and servers wearing punk rock outfits), lonnng wait!\nforrest y and i were in vegas for less than 24 hours so we were bummed when we had to wait for 30 minutes to get a table and another 30-45 minutes for our order to arrive. advice for you: prime time is noon so arrive early to beat the crowds or swing by around 1:30pm or thereafter.\nas recommended, we ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with 2 eggs, bacon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, biscuit, and fruit. food was overall tasty and the portions were big (plates are larger than steering wheels!) but i thought the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> wasn't terribly exciting - you get mostly white meat that isn't well-marinated and tastes more shake-and-bake chicken than <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> southern style. next time i think i'll try one of the benedicts or sample the burgers.\n \na great tip from our waitress: it costs $2.50 to split an order but orders are way too big to reasonably polish it off by yourself... so go with a friend and order one dish on the menu and a side dish (ex - crunchy potatoes).", 
            "it's ok for the prices you pay.  there's a ton of food, but some of it is hit or miss.  service is spotty, iced tea was very weak for the first round, better the second round.  <mark>French Toast</mark> was a bit soggy, <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> a little bland, eggs were eggs (can't really mess that up).  don't know if i'd go out of my way to go back and it's not like i'm 'in the area' of sahara and rainbow purposely to just 'swing by'.", 
            "i was really excited to come here when my friend described it. unfortunately, my experience was less than satisfactory. the food was decent, but not great. the portions were amazing, i'll give them that. apparently they have really rigid policies on their cooking because the friend i was with wanted to make a very simple substitution (grilled chicken instead of <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> on a salad, how difficult is that?) and they wouldn't allow it. the waiter was especially unhelpful. honestly an all-around shitty meal. i hope i just caught them on a bad night, but regardless it's enough for me never to return.", 
            "hash house rocks my socks... huge plates of perfectly seasoned deliciousness! \ntoday i munched on the bacon mashed potato burger, with their homemade mac-n-cheese on the side. my boyfriend got <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> with the smores latte. omg worthy of an updated review on it's own. it was heaven, 2 inches of marsh mellow with chocolate overload. i licked my lips the entire time we waited for our food. \n\nonce my burger arrived my mouth dropped, i felt very woman vs. food. lol\n\nthen the waiter told me, adam the star of man vs. food stopped by hash house when he was in vegas. he ordered the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> damnit i almost ordered that. next time!\n\neverything was amazing, including the server and the hostess. i love this place soooooooo much. go here now!!!", 
            "you have got to be one hungry heffer/cow to give this place 5 stars!?!\n\nif you're dumbfounded why the average cud chewing american women weighs 160lb (men probably put this number to shame), you can thank hash house a go go because this place is all about size. so if you're a size queen, then you'll want to get your big ole' booty down to the hash house.... oh, and don't expect a vegas style lounge with \"go go dancers\". it's just a breakfast joint with feed sack sized portions.\n\ni prematurely ordered the chicken and eggs, and i should have read \"karen y's\" freak'n review cuz she got it right about the chicken being dry which brought out my \"o\" face! \"ooooh, wtf! why did i order the chicken because i can't stand dry overcooked chicken! the chicken was so dry i would have gladly taken some supermarket <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> over it any day. even the side of chipotle sauce couldn't save this overcooked bird.\n\nmy other biggest pet peeve is to plate food with huge chunks of herbs if it's not intended to be eaten. hash house is one of these perverse offenders because they serve up their dishes with a big ole' sprig of sage. isn't that classy.\n\nthis place isn't just a total hog farm cuz even though the interior is awkwardly designed with angled steel/diamond plated elements blended with antique looking wood pieces, they do have some decent <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and the bacon was decent. i just highly doubt i'll be going back for seconds..... i'm sure there's some heffers up for thirds.\n\ni didn't see the man vs. food episode with adam richmond, but i'd just like him to know how it went down for me:\n\ncows 1 vs greg 0",

            "i don't know what other people are eating here, but this is definitely not a 4* establishment...it was a borderline 2.5* for me and my group...especially after it made us waste 45 mins of our time, which made us sit in horrendous post-thsnkgiving traffic and we ended us missing our flight. yikes\n\nour group of 8 decided to stop by for an early b'fast before hitting the road and driving back to la where we were to catch an evening flight. i mean, really, we left an 8 hour buffer for a typically 4 hour drive...but alas, it took us 8.5 hours to get to lax and we missed our flight. and to top that off, the food @ hash house was not worth missing the flight for.\n\nbecause we got there at 8.50a, there was barely a line. in fact, the restaurant was only half filled. phew. \n\ni was excited to be here since hash house  has been all over food network and my foodie friend liked the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles (which was kinda a theme for me this weekend)\n\nso i ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles\n- <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>- breast meat only. i was 'assured' by my friend that it was brined and so it should be juicy. \nnot. \nthe chicken was dry and the skin was tasteless and soggy. it was hard to compare it with roscoe's, which i happened to have just tasted the day before. \n- waffles- the waffle was way too cakey and doughy. it looked like a waffle but tasted like a fruitcake stuffed with bacon and drenched with some sweet nastiness and bits of fruits. seriously. each large  'quarter' of waffle was stuffed with a strip of bacon, which i normally would have loved...but it didn't add anything to the waffle/ fruitcake. \n\nthe presentation was certainly impressive and huge. but i don't need a huge serving. i need a tasty serving. \n\nour server was very nice though and attentive. the 2 stars were for her...not the food. \n\ni will definitely not be back...the overly huge portions were also a turn-off. that's really saying something for someone like me who actually likes to eat. but a huge portion of nastiness is just a waste of ingredients.", 
            "don't sit at the bar.  we were at a table in the far corner, as the place was packed on a friday morning.  it took a long time to get drink refills, orders taken, and you know somebody f'd up when the manager brings out your breakfast, which has been sitting on the counter for 30 to 45 minutes.  i think the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles would have been delicious, rather than average, if it had been warm, or if we could find somebody to get more maple syrup from.  the waffles, by the time they reached us, were dry and brittle, and the chicken was room temperature and soggy.  we couldn't find anybody to ask if we could somehow get our meal fixed, so we ate it glumly.  it's a huge portion, two of us couldn't finish it.  and it had such potential to be good, there are good flavors and creativity, but the crappy service made it just another lukewarm meal at a crowded place.  however, the coffee is good, i asked what kind it was, and the waitress said she would find out and get back to me.  given the service issues, is it surprising she never came back?  i may give this place another go-go, but only if i can sit where the real diners are allowed.",

            "having heard about hash house a go go from the show \"man vs food\" we gave it a try on our last trip to vegas.  we went to the branch that just recently opened in the imperial palace rather than the original one on sahara blvd.\n\nthey call it \"twisted farm food.\"  i call it \"mutant meals.\"  everything is so out of proportion that you would swear it was injected with steroids.  my son ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffle combo.  my wife and i had the banana-cinnamon waffle with grilled mash potatoes (our ten year old daughter opted for a bowl of frosted flakes--oh well). we really enjoyed our fare.  the pancake was outstanding and the grilled mashed very good.  needless to say, we couldn't finish it (just barely half).  my son ate most of his chicken and waffle duo but said the chicken was dry.\n\nthe service is very friendly but not very swift (they make everything to order and it is quite likely that the size of the portions restricts what they can cook at one time.)  we liked the atmosphere and would definitely go back.\n\nenjoy but don't expect any diet plates.  in summary, when in vegas, i i recommend that you \"go go\" to this place.",

            "i went here with my friends during our vegas weekend and i was not disappointed. the meals seem pricey but you get portions made for amazon people, no joke! i had the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles. the chicken was perfect and the waffle was slightly above average and that is because it had bacon in it. why didn't i think of that? bacon in waffles.... genius! the sage in the chicken tasted great, some bites had more sage than others but that's how it goes. i also had a smores mocha or latte and it was good. a little too big for one person to drink, i had to share it. so i really liked this drink because the marshmallows were toasted to perfection and the bitterness of the espresso mixed with the sweetness of the marsh mellows and chocolate syrup made my palate happy. i can't wait to go to the hash house in san diego, yummy. if you are in vegas or san diego, check this place out. \nfyi- go there hungry, k",

            "came in on a sunday for brunch and the wait was about 30 minutes. the place was pretty packed. i'm assuming that both locals and tourists frequent here. it's a nice drive off the strip.\n\n$5 for a kiwi watermelon lemonade. pricey but it was well worth it. you get a nice wedge of watermelon with it. perfect if you're a little parched from the previous crazy night.\n\nwarning! the portions here are massive. it's funny because when i first got seated, i walked by this huge table that were waiting for their tab. two things i noticed was that everyone had a togo box in front of them. second, everyone looked like they were sitting in that post-food coma stage mode (waiting to knock the f out!).\n\ni had the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles of course. i barely put a dent in this plate. had to box up at least half of it. i don't know if it beats roscoe's chicken and waffles but the amount of food sure was over whelming. actually, everyone on my table did not finish their food, not even close. i felt like we were wasting so much food and that some poor kid in mogadishu could've been feasting on our leftovers.\n\nunless you can chow down like no other, you might want to share a plate with someone rather than all order something individually. btw, the flapjacks here are a size of an oldskool 99' acura integra gs-r stock rim.\n\nit's a little pricey but you do get a lot. i say, try it out one time so you can at least say you have dined at this infamous spot. it doesn't seem like a diet friendly joint.", 
            "who's house? hash house! i have not had as satisfying a breakfast as the one i had here in a long, long time. you can't get a breakfast experience like this in la, period. ginormous portions, doting service, and a price tag that doesn't leave you wondering why you didn't just make eggs for yourself. hash house eats places like square one diner for snackies. \n\nthe <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> dish here is better than bouchon's. there i said it! *dodges tomatoes* it has obviously been brined and dredged twice for a super crispy  crust and  moist and juicy interior. it's stacked on top of 3 waffles that are stuffed with bacon. i love that they drive a knife and stick of rosemary right through this tower of power... it says screw daintiness, i am some serious breakfast up in your grill. and the maple reduction and caramelized leeks on the side added more complexity of flavor that made this dish a journey for the taste buds. \n\nthe single flapjack was like the size of my entire torso. jam packed with blueberries and bits of pecan and more than enough to share for 4. also for good measure, i ordered a classic breakfast plate - 2 eggs over easy, toast, fruit, <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. thought i was disappointed by the size of the 2 eggs, this can be overlooked by the awesome crispiness of the potatoes. we also got a scrambled egg dish (with lox, brie, and green onion) that i did not like at all... but i tend to hate everyone else's scrambled eggs besides my mumsies'. great value and wonderful flavor in a relaxed environment.", 
            "best and biggest breakfast i've ever had! \n\nthis is definitely the breakfast place to visit when you are in vegas...the portions are huge so go in with a big appetite ....everything looked great, but i would recommend the man vs. food favorite = <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> w/ fresh spinach, <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs! the best part is...it is all layered on top of eachother...yumm! \n\ngreat mimosas too!",

            "good food in large portions. just happened to pass by while in vegas with my wife. she mentioned it looked like a good choice for breakfast the next day. man was she right. i had the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash. it was first rate. tasty and not fatty. the biscuits were huge and the strawberry jam fantastic. my wife had the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and i couldn't complain about the taste of it i got, nor could she. when i go back to lv i'll go back to the hash house a go go",

            "huge portions.  nobody can finish it.  i had the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & Waffles</mark>.  take a close look at the photos.  look for the plate with chicken on waffles with a steak knife protruding out the top.  that steak knife is huge. there are 4 waffles that are about 3\" x 3\" x 1\" and i'm guessing conservatively.  two <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breasts on top.  deep fried leeks on top of that.  a maple reduction sauce on the waffles and plate for presentation.  i only ate 1 piece of chicken and 1.3 waffles.  i couldn't finish half of this.  the chicken has a sage batter and is juicy.  they must low temp fry this because the batter isn't burned and the chicken is cook perfectly.  they leave the wing drumstick attached for presentation of a bone in the chicken.  a good presentation trick.  the waffles have slices of grilled bacon in the middle.  full slices. not pieces.  the bacon sticks out of the side of a waffle.  the fried leeks with the sage in the batter and the maple sauce just is all kinds of flavors going on in the mouth.  don't go to roscoe's.  for the same price, hash house puts roscoe's to shame.", 
            "kickin hash, towering dishes, and good service.  get there before 10 on sundays!\n\ni've actually been avoiding this place just because i am not a fan of the places that sell the large portion gimmic (claim jumper, big salad, macho sized fries).  if you know me you're probably saying to yourself \"are you kidding me, your the big daddy of going big with food\".  if i'm cooking i go big because i want left overs, if i'm paying for it i'd like to feel satisfied without gorging myself.\n\nbut this place gets it, i couldn't imagine you doing a <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> hash with a wing and tenderloin, it wouldn't work.  i love how there were layers to my breakfast and everything worked together, there wasn't something out of place.  i love the presentation, shows the commitment to quality.\n\nfor an off strip location this place just became one of my favorite breakfast spots, can't wait to try it for dinner--chix and waffles i hear you calling my name...", 
            "definitely a yummy and unique experience. ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles plate to share with my wife. two plump, juicy, flavorful chicken breast fried golden brown were served over 4 belgian waffles and topped with fried leeks with a maple reduction and spicy chili oil with diced bell peppers. simply amazing. all of the flavors worked really well together and the portion was more than enough for 2 adults (we could have actually shared the waffles with our 3 year old. we got him a kids lil tractor breakfast: one giant pancake, scrambled eggs, and a slice of bacon. he ate 1/2 of the pancake and the bacon. so the only thing that we didn't love was the price. they kind of gauge you on the drinks and the kids meal prices -- which aren't exactly comparable to  other restaurants. i totally understand, \"you get what you pay for,\" and don't get me wrong, the food was great. but a $40+ bill after tip for one adult meal, one kid meal, and 2 coffees is kind of a bit much. it cheapened the experience. oh, and even though it doesn't state it on the menu, the waitress said there was a $3 split charge. she  tells us if we order something else that they can count it as a meal and waive the split -- i know, it didn't make sense to me either. so we order a side of scrambled eggs al a carte -- which we didn't eat -- and never got the plate split. i kind of felt tricked into spending a whole $3 more. again, 3 bucks not a big deal, but it cheapened the experience.", 
            "liked eating at the one in imperial palace so much, i had to try this one.  the service was much better here and my food came out quickly.  i didn't like chicken and biscuits as much as i did <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, but still very good.  actually biting into honey and biscuit this time, i found it rich and fluffy, the honey glazed over it at exactly the right amount.  definitely at the top of my places to eat around town and take out guests.  only trouble is the location of this one, all the heck up near summerlin.",

            "located inside the imperial palace... we arrived here with a party of 5 and was asked to wait about 30 minutes. it looked pretty full in the waiting area so we just went back downstairs for 20 minutes to mess around on slots and craps (came up $100 because of the wait!). just keep in mind the buzzer they give you doesn't reach the casino floor so go down there at your own risk. \n\ni got the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict and it came out in a heaping portion (with a very very decent price). it came with bacon, swiss cheese, spinach, tomatoes, these most perfect mashed/hashed potatoes and a sauce to marry them altogether. i definitely would suggest splitting this place. i'm a pretty heavy eater but even this one was a hard one to take down. i ate about 80% of it and was full for most of saturday.\n\ni noticed that the actual wait time between ordering and getting the food seems to be quite awhile-a surprise for ordering breakfast food, but of course, i got over that quickly. i also noticed that there were tables empty for awhile yet people were still waiting outside to be seated... not sure if there was a reason they weren't seating people immediately...",

            "i ate at the establishment inside the imperial palace. thank gawd they replaced that awful teahouse cafe with this restaurant. it rocks! now as you probably already know..the food portions are not for the weak or sorta hungry people...you better be friggin starving cause you have no business being in a place like this! if you share a meal they will charge you about $3 or $4 to split. a tip..if you're gonna order a side salad (btw anything \"side\" here is a full order of fatness) or a side of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> or even just the biscuits, then they won't charge you the split fee. when we had breakfast, the nice waitress recommended i get the biscuits which were only $2.95 so that i didn't get charged that dumb fee. by the way, the biscuits are yummy and the fresh made jam of the day (we had peach but i got to try strawberry at dinner) just complimented that goodness. ok on to breakfast...my boo ordered a spicy bloody maria to start..their version of a bloody mary but with an extra kick and i had a mojito...both were liquid delights and both gave us that nice buzz to prepare us for the behemoth of behemoths chicken and waffles!! it's a monster rraaaaahhhh!!...2 pieces of a breaded then <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> along side a stack of not 1, not 2, but 4 bacon stuffed (yep bacon stuffed) waffles. a steak knife is stabbed literally thru the middle of this mount fiji of wonder. the syrup is a sweet and yummy and the waffles are dee-lish. the chicken could be a tad less dry and they were a little bland but everything else on the plate was fatty already so i overlooked this. i guess we felt like we didn't get enough cholesterol running thru our arteries, so we headed back for dinner! yay!  this time we shared the <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. no need for sides so we just took the split charge fee. my daughter ordered the \"kids\" burger. ok...the plate that held this shamu of  a <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark>  was literally about 2 feet wide! no jokes..this plate probably weighed almost 10 pounds!  the <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> was pounded thin, breaded and fried to a crispy goodness and laid atop a mound of bacon cheese <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. there was some cool fried thin spaghetti pasta decorating on top of this that was actually edible......yeah go big or go home i say! my daughter's burger was definitely not kid size..no surprise here..and it was juicy and lovely. ahhhhhhhhhhh.....hash house...my food memories of you will always haunt my dreams..i don't know if i consider you a good dream or a great nightmare. my hats off to you imperial palace..you just found yourself a \"winner winner chicken dinner!\" kind of place :)", 
            "if size mattered, hash house a go go would score stars off the charts.  if service mattered, it would get three stars.  if flavor mattered... well, there would be a slight dilemma. \n\nlet's start with first impressions.  forget \"line was out <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark>,\" it was more like mob surrounding the front patio.  once inside, you're greeted with such a busy atmosphere (on a weekend, at least) - all the tables were seated, families and friends getting together for a breakfast-version of thanksgiving.  if you haven't worked out those forearm muscles, not sure if this place would be for you.  their plates are ginormous (yes, this word has been officially quantified due to the portion sizes at hash house).  \n\ni would like to invest in whatever machinery they use to squeeze the orange juice.  \"fresh\" is an understatement.  that cup of orange juice is so amazing - it's as if someone took an orange, magically stirred up the juices inside an orange (without disturbing the peel), gave me a straw and offered me heavenly orange juice.  i was mesmerized by the juice, as i watched the pulp inside the glass, sway back and forth, taunting me with its citrusy-goodness, waiting for me to finish the entire cup, and ask for seconds or thirds.  i resisted - for i waited patiently for the food.  \n\nit's hard to not turn heads every time a server came by with a plate.  every plate looked like a mountain of food, with a twiggy-herb sticking up, followed by \"holy gamoly, that plate is huge!\"  pancakes looked like they were used as blankets to keep the plates from getting cold.  if it's true that you eat with your eyes first, you better close your eyes before the plates arrive at your table - you'd be full just by watching the plates make their way to the tables! \n\nwhen the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles showed up, i was amazed the table didn't tip over to one side.  the waffles piled against one another like mattresses, lending support the pieces of <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> that sat so gallantly on top.  once you cut into the waffles, bits of bacon are nestled inside the waffles, playing peek-a-boo, and tickles you with savory flavors to off-set the maple syrup, while making you yearn for the juicy <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>.  i'm telling you, it was all very well thought out.  four out of five stars is fair. \n\nsecond attempt - featured menu item: nappanee hash.  potatoes, tomatoes, strips of beef, eggs, (and other ingredients that i cannot remember) all glued together by smoked mozarella.  the potatoes were nicely crisped around the edges, eggs were made to order, and tomatoes danced around <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark>, teasing with freshness.  among the different flavor combinations came the strips of beef.  problem - they were just that: beef.  if we did role call, the character \"flavor\" would be followed by silence, because it was completely absent.  \"tenderness?\"  -- nice try.  that too, was absent.  two out of five.  \n\nas busy as i've seen this place, i would think that they would want more servers/waiters to make sure that the tables are flipped as quickly as possible.  service is a little bit on the slow side - and this is not just applied to the busy days.  on a day where there were no more than 6-tables, it took two or three attempts before we could get the waiter's attention to place an order.  three out of five.  \n\nif you don't have much patience for long lines (on the weekends) or slower service, steer clear.  if you've got a big group of (hung-over) people looking for some not-so-fancy foods at big quantities and little price, you're in good hands at the hash house.  if you're just tired of really watered down orange juices from the poker tables at the rio, just follow that holy-looking-glowing light to the hash house a go go.", 
            "after watching man vs food, i really, really wanted to love this place. like adam, i got the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> and on the first bite, i thought i was \"in love\". the benedict had chicken, bacon, tomatoes, mash potatoes, biscuits, and eggs topped with chipotle cream. the chipotle cream was amazing! the cream was  so good, i ate it all and realized i still have to eat the chicken, eggs, and biscuits (i guess i ate all the cream with the mash potatoes?). and after that, it was just dry from there. i thought it was just me, but my friends also experienced the same scenario. delicious at first, but a bit bland at the end. maybe if there was just a little bit more delicious chipotle cream, i'd be good. \n\nwith that aside, the wait can be a bit long so be prepared for that. the portions are huge. i suggest sharing. if you do share, i guess you pay a fee, but they waived that fee if you get side orders.", 
            "i was in vegas recently and we were watching that vegas channel that tells you the hot spots to eat and party at, right when i was the snippet for this place my mouth started watering. \n\nlittle did i know man v. food ventured here, so i took the waiter's advice and ordered the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. it had a huge piece of chicken, with mash potatoes, bacon, this amazing chipotle sauce and eggs it was on a a biscuit, no lie, the size of my head. \n\n\nthis place was delicious. it took me breakfast, dinner and breakfast again to eat the greater of it, i didn't finish it at all, but close enough. \n\ntheir banana pancake was prob 15\" around. it was so yummy!", 
            "hmm, i think the reason they are so high in rating is cuz of the gigantic portion! chicken and waffles consisted of 4 waffles and 2 huge <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breast! <mark>Corned Beef</mark> is special cuz they hand pulled the beef and it's tender. the reason i said it was over rated is bec i was dissapointed with the taste. although presentation is 'wow', the taste is kinda bland. chicken was tasteless and waffles are not that great either, too much flour and not as fluffy as i like it to be. another hassle is that every person needs to order soething - even my 1 year old?? are you kidding me?! good thing we can order sides for additional person..... kiwi lemonade is just so so. the reason many people likes it was bec of the nice color it was presented - green/ yellow/ pink color! again, i would rather go to other place for breakfast next time.",

            "this is a review for breakfast.\n\nthe skinny: extreme portion sizes but hit-or-miss execution (3) service: not bad however we usually get there when it opens to beat the rush (3) value: pricing is a little pricy however you will for sure have leftovers unless you order 1 entree/2 people (3).\n\nwe come here for breakfast whenever we feel like a) we can get here early enough to beat the rush, b) we have to take the car in for service, c) we feel like pigging out in the morning.\n\nby far, the best dish here is <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benny. it sounds kinda gross - <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, bacon, <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, biscuit and gravy - but it's kind of a guilty pleasure. it's a total heart attack on a plate but very flavourful - sweet, crunchy, buttery goodness.\n\ntheir biscuits are great with their homemade strawberry jam. delish.\n\nnow for the bad news.\n\nthe pancakes here aren't bad either however their batter lacks the mild crispiness likely due to their size. blueberry pecan is better than blackberry granola in imho. \n\n<mark>French Toast</mark> is okay but a little too sweet.\n\ntheir chicken 'n waffles were not that good - the waffles were too saturated in syrup and were soggy. the chicken was fine though.\n\nyou need to bring a crew with you when you come here to eat because of the large portion sizes. i would suggest ordering maybe 1 entree per 2 people and then order the minimum amount for the second (such as a biscuit with butter). seriously - one entree will keep you nibbling for at least 2 days.\n\noverall, some good stuff, some not so good stuff. 3 star review.", 
            "maybe my expectations were too high but hash house a go go kind of disappointed me on every level. \n\nafter months of lusting over the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> after seeing it on food network i could hardly wait, too bad i had to. we got there around 11am on a thursday and the place was pretty packed inside. the hostess was friendly and quoted the wait around 30 minutes unless we wanted to sit outside. being hung-over and starved we chose the patio and thats where the experience became unpleasant.\n\n our waitress was cool but it took her 10-15 minutes to bring us our drinks and being that we hit the sheets around 5 that morning we needed that coffee and water badly. i ended up ordering the boston hash because at the time it sounded amazing, and my bro got the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> so i was just gonna steal bites from him. our friend just got some scrambled eggs and we ordered one of those giant pancakes to split.\n\nafter we ordered we got to talking about the night before and kind of lost track of time before i realized our food was taking wayyy too long. i was able to estimate exactly how long from a text my bro sent as we were ordering and it was going on 36 minutes and we still hadn't seen a plate. after i caught up to the waitress she assured me the food was coming and after another 5 minutes it did.\n\nthe plates looked delicious! everything was piled high, too bad the quality didn't match the quantity! my crab cakes just weren't good at all, they had a good amount of crab but just weren't that tasty, and the horseradish cream that came with it didn't help. plus my potatoes were soggy and burnt tasting! i tasted my bros benedict and while it was better than my breakfast it wasn't stellar, the pancake was kinda dry and seemed like it was cooked way before it was brought out. the best thing about the meal was the watermelon kiwi lemonade i ordered and to add insult to injury it took us another 20 minutes to catch a cab out of there. i don't think i'll be going back anytime soon.",

            "i liked my meal here and there were so many awesome-sounding things on the menu that i am definitely going to go back. i wanted to preface this review by giving an overall positive comment despite my somewhat low rating.\n\ntoday was my first trip. i ordered <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with bacon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, eggs, and a biscuit. the biscuit was decent, the eggs were pretty standard, the potatoes were ok, and the chicken was absolutely mind-blowing. if you like <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, your only complaint might be that it was a boneless breast, but otherwise it was amazing. there was also a lot of fluff on the plate - a big watermelon wedge, an unripe strawberry, and some thin crunchy straw-like things that really did nothing but get in the way.\n\nepic portions, lots of dishes i want to try, and apparently since i didn't get the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>, i missed out. i'm going back, but if this place didn't get so many other positive reviews, i wouldn't go back to give it another try.", 
            "a friend was visiting so we took him here.  this time, there was a 30 minute wait, and it took a while for our orders to come again (but since  i expected that on a saturday, i wasn't so upset this time). besides, just order a delicious blood mary and you'll be perfectly satiated until the food comes.  \n\nwe ordered a couple dishes to share, and our friend was skeptical that it would be enough food.  i wish i took a picture of his expression when the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> was set on the table. i had been raving about this dish, and once again, it did not disappoint.  three of us polished off this plate easily.  you just can't go wrong with this item. \n\nwe also shared the brown sugar banana flap jacks which bigger than the actual plate is was served on.  and upon first bite- i was in heaven.  it is sooo delicious.  the crispy brown sugar pieces combined with the ripe banana is a flavor explosion.", 
            "(also located in imperial palace and m-resort)\nunreal probably in my top 5-10 places i have ever eaten. the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> is devilish and so perfect. the chicken and waffles is also really good except i prefer the benedict because the chicken has no bones in that. the portion are just unreal. no human can finish these portions regularly and really just plan on sharing it. i wish they had half size portions because i hate wasting food and i stop by usually for work luchches. so, good and can't wait to check out the one at the m resort.", 
            "gianormous portions!  i had the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict and hubby had the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles.  the layers of flavor explode in your mouth.  the syrup was fabulous, too.  i wonder if i could buy a vat of it!  there was a bit of a wait, but i guess the word is out that this place is phenomenal!  if you are in vegas, make it a point to eat here at least once. you will not be disappointed!", 
            "i came here expecting gigantic portions of delicious food and hash house did not disappoint. my recommendation: share your entree with a friend and order one side dish to waive the dish splitting fee. my friend and i shared the chicken and waffles and got a side of fruit (just to be a little healthy). \n\nthe chicken and waffles were so good! the waffles were very dense and thick and they had strips of bacon baked inside. wow!! that's a genius idea!! the chicken was so crispy and tender; just perfect. they drizzled syrup over the entire plate which i thought was weird at first since i never thought that syrup and <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> would go together, but the pairing of the sweetness of the syprup and the salty chicken was just heaven! give this place a try! \n\nyou'll see me back here trying all their other skillet delights!", 
            "one of the rare spots i've experienced here in vegas that totally reminded me of hollywood/los angeles. came here ona sunday afternoon/brunch and this place was stuffed to the rim! there was no line out <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> but once i opened it, it was like new year's eve on the vegas strip! well, it was nothing new to me as this is a common occurence in my  home town. \n\nthe hostess tells us that the wait was gonna be around 45min - 1hr. so, i squeezed my  way to the bar and ordered the infamous brunch beverage - mimosa. about 10 minutes later, i was still thirsty, so i ordered a tangerine mimosa. i never tried this combination before and i must say it was awesome! finally, get seated, about 40 minutes later, and by  this time i practically  memorized half the menu. \n\n<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>..: served on a big plate, stacked architecturally sound and i couldn't wait to have a bite! the chicken, bacon mashed potaotes, eggs, biscuit.. everything just worked and was more than filling!\n\n<mark>French Toast</mark>: another enormous dish! extra thick bread with galloping amounts of pecan maple syrup and pieces of banana. it wasn't great but not bad either.\n\n\nkiwi watermelon lemonade: awesome combination and  came with a fat slice of watermelon as its garnish.\n\n\nconsidering the long wait, the alright tasting food, the claim jumper sized portions and the great drinks.. i can't say i'd be back for a second round. i can only vouch for the generosity of food and the beverages at most..", 
            "love. love this place! the serving sizes are huge and the food is awesome. the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles exceed expectations. and <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict is a must try. \n\nit's always super packed in the mornings but worth the wait!", 
            "been here a few times now and all i can say is wow! everything is huge and extremely tasty. ive tried the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles and the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. i loved the benedict. it was an amazing blend of flavors. the staff is always very attentive and full of information. definitely recommend this spot for anyone with a big appetite.", 
            "oh man.  \n\n<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> w/ fresh spinach, <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs.\n\neek!  how can you not fall in love?  they call this \"twisted farm food.\"  and with menu items as interesting as this, you really can't help but get excited.  the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> benefit was yummy and huge.  i had it for lunch and leftovers for lunch.  i also got to try some of hubby's \"griddled <mark>French Toast</mark> dipped in banana cinnamon cream w/ pecan maple syrup.\"  like dessert!\n\ni hope i get to go back to try some more \"twisted farm food!\"", 
            "my goodness, this place is uber busy. my friends and i went on a weekend around 12 pm. that was probably a huge mistake. there were so many people and they said the wait was well over an hour. i felt a bit sardined in there and the bar area was totally full. we decided to just order our food to go and to eat it in our hotel room. \n\ni really wanted to try this place after it was featured on man vs. food, but i did not have high expectations because of the fact that i have been disappointed by many places i have seen on food network/travel channel. to my surprise, i was not disappointed in the food, but i didn't care for the wait. even though we ordered our food to go, it took a while to get it out, but i guess it is better than waiting for a table, ordering and waiting again for the food. \n\nso, there were 4 of us and we decided to get 2 dishes and split it. thank goodness we did because those plates were ginormous! we got the griddled <mark>French Toast</mark> dipped in banana cinnamon cream w/ pecan maple syrup ($12.95) and <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> & biscuit ($15.95). both were really good. \n\nthe <mark>French Toast</mark> was surprisingly light and not too sweet, which i liked. it was topped a banana what was sliced in half and grilled. it looked really pretty when we opened up the box. the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was amazing too. fried well and really flavorful. it was a very heavy breakfast, but it didn't feel that heavy. i would totally go there again to try other things on the menu.", 
            "first and last place to eat during our vegas stay. all i have to say is bring an appetite and maybe some friends to help you finish off some plates with you.\n\nfirst time there i ate the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>-chicken was tender and delicious and again the portion...huge!\n\nthe second time going there i tried the <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> benedict -lightly <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> over house <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, homemade biscuits and a creamy sauce, again delicious and huge.\n\ncouple of my friends also tried the <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> benedict and <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles; i was a able to try both and they were great.\n\ni will be going to hash house during my next stay in vegas for sure.", 
            "like most folks, i saw the man vs. food special and had to go for the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. was smart enough to share it with my mama bear...<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was delicious. i wasn't a big fan of the chipotle cream and was eying my cousin's country gravy. \nwait can be long especially on the weekends. but, for our party of 4 and baby, we waited less than 30 minutes.", 
            "i recently saw a cable show where a limousine company turned a ferrari into a limo.  it had never been done before. frankly, it was preposterous. one of the guys interviewed said their biggest challenge was finding a way to make the supercar a stretch limo while maintaining the driving characteristics of a ferrari. and somehow, they did it.  although a bit less of an engineering challenge, the folks at hash house a-go-go construct entrees that ride this fine line between quality and mega size.\n\nfeatured on the travel channel's man v. food, hash house specializes in their self-proclaimed \"twisted farm food,\" basically jumbo-sized offerings and off-beat interpretations of traditional american favorites.  while their \"twisted\" fare is available at breakfast, lunch, and dinner, they're probably best known for their breakfast.  we visited the day after thanksgiving around 10:30a and had a predictably long wait (45-50 mins). consistent with the rebel streak they're going for, walls at their sahara ave. location are adorned with diamond plate textured metal and large nuts and bolts. the industrial look suggests that guys into bikes and hot rods would feel right at home.\n\nwe ordered their signature <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> and tractor driver special with mango coconut pancakes (and for the record, it was my petite wife who chose to order the benedict). there's no denying the benedict was a monstrosity: a layer of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, scrambled eggs, <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, tomato, mozzarella, and spinach topped with <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and generous amounts of their chipotle cream (gravy). and because anything this big merits a tree-topper, they plant a long sprig of fresh sage right on top.  good grief.  i have to say my initial impression was genuine awe with undertones of mild disgust. this was clearly a dream for anyone who derives regular enjoyment from kfc's \"famous bowls.\" pushing past our bizarre feelings of hunger laced with nausea, dorothy and i started picking at the gravy-laden structure. and to our surprise, there were some nice flavor combinations depending on where you chose to bury your fork. the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> itself was done well--crispy with nice chunks of moist white meat. combined with a bite of potato and gravy, the chicken evoked a holiday meal more than it did breakfast. the chipotle cream had a nice hint of smokiness, but as it cooled down, the self-hatred to taste ratio definitely increased.  \n\nonly lacking tomato sauce and the fact it wasn't tossed into the air at any point during its life cycle, my pancake was basically a medium to large-sized pizza. once again, i was pleasantly surprised, particularly by the lack of any \"doughiness,\" or uncooked batter. the pancake itself wasn't the best i've had, but it was adequately fluffy and a solid effort, bolstered by generous chunks of fresh juicy mango and shredded coconut. not bland, but not too sweet, some pieces of cake could be eaten without syrup. my eggs were soft scrambled just right, and the sausage links plump and tasty (i've found that a decent test of a cook's competency with eggs is to order them soft scrambled; not having them overcooked or gushing of yolk requires just a bit of care and timing). the kiwi watermelon lemonade was a nice way to top things off--tasty and refreshing, but lacking any heavily-syruped sweetness.               \n\nit goes without saying that visits to these kinds of restaurants require a pre-meal regimen of a week-long fast, meditation, and a check-up with your doctor.  i think a regular visit would risk a gross-out burn-out.  although, glancing at the scrambles and other egg dishes of our fellow patrons, it seems that slightly more modest meals are possible.  i've noticed a number of folks complaining about the price, which is perplexing. while the benedict cost $15.95 and the pancacke combo $14.95 (both at the top of their breakfast price scale), i'd point out that you're actually getting about $15.95 and $14.95 worth of food when ordering these dishes.  each dish could easily feed two hungry human beings.  sure, maybe they could drop a buck or so off the price, but if you're ever in l.a., go somewhere other than denny's for breakfast. double-digit fru-fru breakfasts are everywhere here, some with decent quality, but typically with a quarter of hash house's portion size.  we have ample experience being ripped off at breakfast places, and hash house isn't one of them.    \n\na lunch at hash house is probably in store for our next visit to vegas.  i'll probably try the \"kokomo,\" the benign moniker for what looks to be another guilt-ridden meal in the form of a meatloaf sandwich. it's probably a good thing we don't get out to vegas too often these days. like the city itself, hash house is a spectacle incompatible with daily living.", 
            "we showed up around noon and there was a one hour wait. i had high expectations and it was a bit of a let down. i had the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with biscuit and scrambled eggs. my eggs were drowning in maple syrup and the biscuit was hard and dry, but the chicken was juicy and flavorful. i don't think i would go back again.", 
            "if you love big portions then your in the right place. the wait for a 2 person table did suck though. my wife had the huge blt, it the best blt i have ever eaten. i had the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> hash house farm benedict. man vs. food really hyped this dish up. it was good but i thought the chicken was not seasoned enough. next time i am in vegas i will probably go back and try out the chicken and <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>.", 
            "i was so hyped up about this place. so we decided to take a 15 minute drive off the strip to try this mo fo. we get there and we have to wait over an hour. \n\nfinally, we get seated, server was rude. food took another 30 minutes for the food to come out. \n\ni order the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles.. chicken was dry... waffles had barely enough syrup. but it was tasty, but not worth the wait or price. for those of you that have been to roscoes.... that's the place for chicken and waffles.",

            "holy cow! the portions here are ginormous! i ate like a pig, but felt like a cow. i guess that's keeping with the farm theme. \n\nthe first time i ate here i had the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash. freakin' bomb. i've recommended it to two other people and it was a hit for both of them! \n\nthis time around i had <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, which was pretty good too. i'm not going to go into it because other people have described it thoroughly. it really looks like a hot mess and i'm sure some top chef judge would probably be appalled by the busyness of the dish. i think all food groups were covered in this dish. thought i could tackle this thing, but only ate half. you'd probably have to share this meal with someone or you'll end up with leftovers (which isn't always a bad thing!) \n\nthe mango coconut pancake is something that i probably will have every time i eat here. when i told our server that i was ordering it for my three year-old, she said, \"it's pretty huge.\" i replied, \"yup, we're sharing it!\" even though it was a shared piece, we still went home with half of it. \n\ni failed to mention that perhaps the main reason why i couldn't eat all of my food was because i had a blood mary. it's definitely a meal in itself. it was sinfully good and perfectly balanced. wished i could've taken my leftover drink with me:d \n\nif you're going to eat here, make sure you come with an empty stomach and loose pants!!",

            "this place is alright.\n\nthere was something about it when i walked in, where it overwhelmingly smelled of heavily delicious breakfast foods. i'm usually a big fan of chicken and waffles back at home so i found it fitting to order the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>.\n\ni definitely hate to compare to roscoe's but hh takes a different approach. i was given 4 pieces of fluffy waffles and two chicken breast pieces for a really decent price too for what it was. i did enjoy my meal, but something about it made me really want the waffles to be thinner and just the use of heavy butter and grease for flavor. (oh yeah, and portions where huge!)\n\ni understand that it was a ny times favorite and that it was featured on man vs. food. it was probably a hit or miss deal ordering the chicken and waffles, but the rest of the items on the menu had looked really good as well. \n\nsomething really wants me to give this place a chance.\n\nchances of coming back? possibly.",

            "i'll be honest. while the rest of my party who went here may not have liked what they ordered, i loved the food. \n\nwe went here because the driver of the other car, who was the organizer of the trip, saw it on tv on drivers, dine-ins, and dives, and said it looked good. \n\nwe arrived in vegas and set about finding this restaurant based on general directions from the other driver. honestly, if you're not paying attention to the signs on the right side of the road (heading eastbound on sahara) you can easily miss this location. the location opens at 730, and we arrived here at about 6am. we pretty much spent an hour and a half sleeping in the car. \n\nthe menu is simple, however it would do good to have photos of all that you would be ordering. what you may not realize when you first come to this restaurant is that the portions are very generous. \n\nwhat i mean by this is that two of our people ordered a pancake combination. when you order pancakes, you think that they'd be like ihop pancakes or like mcdonald's hotcakes, but this thing, according to the server, was about the size of a medium pizza. he sure as hell wasn't kidding! i mean, that thing was the size of a newborn! two people shared one of the pancake platters, and the other person gave up on eating the pancake without eating it. (i wolfed the whole thing down in about two minutes for him) \n\ntwo other people ordered a hash house combination plate, which i believe was hashed potatoes and some green pepper and <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>. one ate most of it, the other person finished only a small portion of it, and shared with the rest of the people on our side of the booth.\n\nmy coworker ordered a waffle platter, and finished only one corner of a waffle and part of his hashed potatoes. he saved the rest in case we were hungry later on in the day. \n\nthe driver of the other car ordered what i believe was <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>. when it came out, it looked about the size of a small child's head. the chicken portion that i cut through (to get a bite) was boneless and covered in a delicious sauce. with my help and the help of some of the other people on the table, we finished a little under half of the platter. \n\nthe item that i ordered was the one pound hash house mushroom and swiss stuffed burger with a side of fries. when the burger came out, it was a lot bigger than i thought it would be. the hamburger patties had the swiss/mushroom mixture oozing out of the middle, and it pretty much dwarfed the hamburger bun. it came with the fries, about four fried spaghetti sticks, and around the plate, there was this caramel type texture sauce. even with the help of three other people, we only managed to eat under half of the burgers. \n\nthe restaurant began to get much more busier by the time we left, as more persons were beginning to come in to eat the food. the server was very pleasant and came by pretty often to check up on us. \n\nthe next time i go up there, i'm definitely going to stop by here and put myself into another food coma. de licious!!",

            "not just huge portions, but very well prepared food with attention to detail\n\n<mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> ... it's american breakfast done to the extreme. definitely order one thing, and share with your better half. no human should finish any of their breakfast dishes solo. hash house a go go is the most exciting breakfast place i've ever been to, and will definitely go back the next time i'm in town!", 
            "oh. my. god....amazing! (if you're coming here, try not to eat for the day because the servings are monstrous!)\n\ni have been to both this location as well as the one in imperial palace and would definitely recommend this one by far. (imperial palace had equally good food, but much lower quality service). the decor is a bit different for both locations, with the sahara location being much bigger, livelier, and more attentive service. \n\nas soon as we got there, we ordered. my boyfriend got the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> and i got the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles....sorry, my mouth started watering just thinking about it.... the wait for our food was unbearable, mostly because waiters were walking by with pancake platters  with pancakes that took up the entire plate (about a foot in diameter)! i ordered a mimosa to ease my nerve. it was okay - too much champagne. \n\nfinally, our food came. two plates of enormous proportions - my chicken and waffles were the size of my head! it looked really good, though: four <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>, topped with perfectly <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> topped with a not-too-sweet maple glaze. (they had to drive a steak knife through it to make sure it didn't topple over). the chicken was tender, but fried in a bit of a spicy batter, which paired with the sweetness of the glaze, waffle, and bacon really well. \n\nlooking at his benedict, though, i had to take a sliver....which turned into half of his plate, haha. it was amazing! a perfect biscuit, topped with <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, two eggs, bacon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, and hollandaise sauce. (oh, and a slice of fruit to be healthy). the flavors came together so well! \n\nwe ate so much, our stomachs looked like two balloons ready to burst. it was worth it, though. it's been a week, and i'm having withdrawals. \n\nif you're looking for a good meal or want to be filled for days, or both, then go to hash house - you won't regret it.", 
            "huge portions, friendly staff, solid food and a decent bloody mary at a reasonable price.\n\nwe have been many times and tried many things.  if you are going for brunch, expect to wait.  as for food, we have tried pretty much everything and the best dish is likely the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>.  the hash plates are solid and (being i like sweet breakfast) the <mark>French Toast</mark> and pancakes are also good.\n\ngo to hash house a gogo for a large breakfast with a large bloody mary and expect to pay a very reasonable bill when you're done.  is it the best breakfast ever?  no.  but you would have a hard time finding a better all around breakfast deal and if you go in with the right expectations, i'd be surprised if you didn't enjoy the meal.",

            "i walked into this place during spring break in the middle of the week with my wife and kids.  i was wearing my pau gasol lakers jersey because the lakers were going to play that night.  as soon as i walked in, the hostess compliments me on my jersey and the bartender asks me if the lakers are going to win that night.  right away they got brownie points for being laker fans and making me and my family feel welcomed.\n\nsince we got there around 11:30am, we beat the lunch rush and they sat us down in less than 5 minutes.  the place is nice and open with lots of noice and ambiance going on, perfect for a family with small kids.  my sons ordered the kids pancakes and my daughter order the chocolate chip pancakes.  my wife and i shared the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles, because i read on yelp how huge the order is.  my kids pancakes where huge.  my 6 year old some how managed to finish his pancake, and he's a skinny boy.  even the waitress was impressed he was able to finish such a large pancake.  i had a taste of the two different pancakes and they were good, were they the best i've ever had, no, but they aren't bad.  as for the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles, yelpers were not kidding, this is a huge order,  it's definitely perfect for 2 people to eat.  the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was extremely tasty and the waffles were like heaven, especially with the bacon made into the waffles.  <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> of the sage friend chicken, waffles, bacon and syrup was delicatable.  i have been to roscoes chicken and waffles in los angeles several times, and i have to admit, this place blows away roscoes for the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles dish.\n\nnext time i'm in vegas or san diego, i will definitely drop on over the hash house a go go to try some of their other tempting dishes.  make sure to come with a huge appetite, because all their dishes look pretty big.", 
            "this is a really interesting place. as mentioned before he portions are huge and they have some inventive monstrous creations such as the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>. in terms of flavor, i remember the first 50 or so bites were good but then i started feeling sick from overeating. next time, i think i'll just order a box with my entree.", 
            "our vegas trip was coming to an end and we had one more stop before taking the long road home, hash house a go go!!\n\nthis place is freakin' awesome!!\n\nwe arrived at the right time (between 11:30a-12:00p on a monday) because we were seated almost immediately. shortly, a crowd of customers were gathering in the waiting area. we ordered our drinks then preceded to take a closer look at the menu.\n\ni was completely overwhelmed by the menu because everything looked so good! there were four of us total and i didn't want to order the same thing as someone else, so that we could all have a taste of something different, i ordered the <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> benedict with fresh asparagus, sundried tomatoes, chili cream and two basted eggs. the rest of the table ordered: <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with waffles, <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash with red onions and swiss cheese, and <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> with fresh spinach, <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs. \n\ni totally surprised myself in ordering the salmon benedict. i'm not much of a fish person and the idea of having it for breakfast sort of disturbs me. but i was glad that i ordered it, i really enjoyed the chili cream because it gave the dish a nice kick. we were kind of disappointed in <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> because it didn't have as much flavor as we had expected. it was  totally under seasoned! another dish that surprised me was the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash. i was sort of expecting a pile of hash that looked like something that came out of the can, but it was actual strips of <mark>Corned Beef</mark>. they were nicely seasoned and quite tasty! i would have eaten more, but it wasn't the dish that i ordered. \n\nthe price for a single dish ranges from $11-15 bucks, which is super reasonable for the amount of food you're served. a single order of food can easily feed two people. \n\ni will definitely visit hash house a go go on my next trip to vegas because you just don't find that kind of breakfast food anywhere else!!", 
            "if you care about value, then this is the place to eat breakfast/brunch when you are in vegas, at the imperial palace.  after hearing about this place on man vs. food, my buddy and i came with the intention of eating our one meal of the day here.  we were met with a half-hour long wait, plenty of time to let our appetites work themselves into a tizzy as we decided on what to order.  as the 2 of us sat down, the group of 5 ladies next to us suggested that we split a single dish.  we scoffed at their suggestion and proceeded to order 3 entrees, intent on guaranteeing a heart attack before the age of 50.\n\nthe first dish to come out was the biscuits and gravy.  now, i love biscuits and gravy in a way that is completely unnatural and unhealthy, some might say unholy, and i'm normally left wanting from weakly seasoned gravy with piddling amounts of sausage.  not here!  there are meaty chunks of pork sausage in a nicely peppered gravy base over a couple hearty and moist biscuits, covered by scrambled eggs and sitting over a mound of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  hot damn, this was definitely one of the best breakfast items i've ever had and i will be back for this and only this when i come back to vegas.\n\nthe item that had been featured on man vs. food and found its way into my dreams was the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>.  overall, it was pretty satisfying but here's my beef with the dish. #1, you should call it a benedict if you don't poach the eggs, the yolks need to run all over the place and threaten you with delicious salmonella, scrambled eggs is simply weak sauce.  #2, the benedict was served on biscuits, which was awesome cuz they were delish, but everything was then surrounded by a wall of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> that turned the base into a gloppy mess.  #3, the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> sounded fantastic as described by adam richman, but overall the seasoning left me wanting.  #4, i know bacon makes just about everything better, but this was a bit much.  and what's this about tomato slices?  is this becoming a salad?!  the flavors together would've been better off in some god-forsaken breakfast sandwich but this was just too unwieldy.  overall, i felt like less would've been more.\n\nfinally, the 3rd item ordered was the kokomo, aka the meatloaf sandwich.  whoever their baker is, they deserve a prize, because the milk bread that they grill for this sandwich is simply fantastic, just as good as their biscuits.  the meatloaf was well-seasoned and extremely satisfying with good quality beef.  the only problems were the overload of roasted tomatoes, which gave me immediate heartburn with a single whiff, and the side of mac and cheese that, contrary to what our nice waitress said, was the most pedestrian mac and cheese i have ever eaten (you're better off eating kraft easy mac), unsalted and watery penne in a strange mish-mash of oddly flavored cheeses.  the best part of all of the meal (other than the biscuits and gravy) was that we housed 3 plates of food with people staring at us in awe/fear/shame, and i felt i channeled my inner adam richman to successfully defeat our challenge.\n\nfor the prices, i'm not sure if any place in vegas will give you as good a deal as the hash house.  if you're a sane person, you could probably split a dish or order one and take the remnants home.  if you are looking for a gourmet breakfast, however, you may need to move on.", 
            "opmg can't go wrong with anything! but my favorite is the the <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> eggs benedict with cream sauce!!!!!!!!!1 its bigger than my freaking head and i only finished 2/3s of the damn thing soooo goood.... the bacon cream sauce they put on that thing is so delicious.... and my runnder up is not the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict pretty massive and really good..... coming here is my new vegas tradition!", 
            "the $15-$20 cab ride off the vegas strip was totally worth it here.  we first heard of this place when a local roulette dealer told us good brunch places to eat that does not have long lines like the wynn brunch.\n\nwe got seated immediately since we went to this location before it was on the tv show man vs food and the imperial palace location.\n\nfresh juice:  lemonade, watermelon, and oj.  all juices were freshly made, without any additives.\n\nthe portions are large, so order 1 entree of each type of food you want to try and share!  \n\nfood:  <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> massive strips of chicken strips on top of eggs that had a chipotle cream sauce rather than the typical hollandaise sauce.  a side of yellow watermelon was served with this as well.  i guess fruit can be seasonal so who knows what you will get when.\n\nchicken and waffles:  3-4 pieces of waffles with additional 3-4 pieces of <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> strips, that is topped off with syrup, and fried scallions\n\nbanana pancake:  the size of this pancake is as twice as big as your head.  pretty fluffy, but nothing too different about this dish.  i would have preferred ordering something else that was more unique to the place.",

            "yes yes yes i went here because of watching man vs food..... i ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benny with the chilpolete bernaise sauce. i can tell you i was impressed all of the flavors together was amazing if you are in san diego, ca. or las vegas (about 5 miles off away from the strip) you should stop in and order this dish. portion is way tooo much!!! i suggest sharing it and paying the split charge :)", 
            "why: i have been here a couple times, taking my touristing friends and family to see what everyone is and has been raving about.\n\nwhat:  the food certainly comes in huge portions, so i've always shared.  the dish that i suggest everyone should try at least once, is <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>! it is named after the dude on man vs. food. i love condiments, so i usually ask for a side of gravy just in case there isn't a part of the benedict that hasn't been slightly drizzled with gravy, haha.\n\nthe hot drinks are really good too, but my all-time favorite drink is the kiwi watermelon lemonade! this drink alone is what keeps me coming back! they puree watermelon, add kiwi syrup, all into lemonade which makes it heaven! try it!",

            "this place is actually really good!\n\nwent here once with my girlfriend awhile back.  we both mistakenly ordered two of the scrambles that were on the specials menu.  we were not impressed at all..  i'm glad we gave it a second chance..\n\nwe ordered two items and split them.  \n\nthe first was the <mark>French Toast</mark>.  it was delicious!  there was nothing simple about this dish.  it is dipped in a banana cream batter.  and topped with fried bananas.  if you don't like bananas, avoid this.  they put the maple syrup on prior to serving, which is fine because it would just make the <mark>French Toast</mark> soggy.  the banana batter helps to keep the <mark>French Toast</mark> from being dry.  \n\nwe also ordered the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>.  this was great as well.  it's a little messy, but every ingredient was good.  i did not see anything spectacular about the fried part of the chicken.  not much seasoning in the batter.  but the chicken itself was moist and flavorful.  i would prefer other egg options than just scrambled in this dish.\n\noverall, the food we ordered was great!  and surprisingly, we ate most of these large portions.  the service was also good for us.  \n\nwe will definitely go back to try other dishes!", 
            "i think my expectations were just too high. like what other people have said in their reviews, i saw this place on man v. food so i expected it to be absolutely fantastic. but it wasn't, it was just...ordinary. which makes me sad. maybe i shouldn't have got the scramble, it was just boring and plain, there was no kick to it or anything that made it special. i tried a friends '<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and eggs benedict' and it was also just boring tasting to me. \n\nthe portions are huge though, if you are staying at a hotel i would recommend sharing a plate, because you won't have anywhere to put your leftovers. i maybe finished half of my food. they do charge a split-plate charge, which is just absolutely ridiculous to me. they should offer lower portions sizes at lower prices, but that's just my opinion. \n\nalso our server was kind of rude. we went with a group of 8 and she brought out one bill. when we told her we needed the bills seperated she got all pissy. why would you just expect a group of young adults to pay one bill? give me a break lady.", 
            "hash house a go go is a place that you might both fear and love. it's like a roller coaster or a hot temptress. you know it's bad for you, but you still want it. hash is definitely a true battle of man verse food. they contribute to our the great over-sized nation of ours. please check your diets at <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark>. \n\ni was extremely excited to try out hash house, because all the reviews i read made it sound so amazing. it is very hard to find a great place for breakfast in vegas. i was tired of waiting in a huge line at paris buffet, so i thought it's time to go on a man vs. food trip. most of the time, i cannot stand places that have too much hype. most things that are over hyped usually suck like the crapple iphone and verizon's i can't hear you now network. also, in-n-out... it's good, but not crack like most people say it is.. (i don't endorse or use crack). even though, i tried to come here without the high expectations, it was unavoidable. i felt like a little kid on christmas morning. first off i am not a idiot! a lot of the bad reviews i read were from people that waited 2 hours and didn't like their food. i'm sorry, but if you waited 2 hours to eat anywhere i would be bitter too! i only waited 5 minutes maybe 10 minutes max, so suck on that! haha. i went on a weekday around 9am. brilliant!!!!\n\ni know the portions are big, but how's the quality? did you finish dish by yourself? i don't like pigging out should i still go?\n\nthe key is bring a friend and share. the quality is good! don't expect a 5 star restaurant or a new cuisine from a top chef. this is simple breakfast food on steroids. i highly recommend having 2 stomachs and consulting with a doctor before coming here. to my surprise the customer base was a lot smaller than i expected. the restaurant was packed shortly after i arrived, but there were no plus sized models here. i saw some normal sized patrons and a few gorgeous model types. i really was set on trying the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, but since my friend was not a fan of hollandaise sauce i went with the chicken and waffles of course! let's just say roscoe's has nothing on hash house! i thought roscoe's clogged arteries, but hash made roscoe's look like a diet soda verses a milk shake. the chicken was very juicy and extremely crispy! i really like the corn flake batter, although the spices were a bit lacking, but nothing hot sauce can't fix. the chicken cannot beat roscoe's, but that's not a fair comparison. you definitely get 4 times the food of roscoe's for the same price. i am very picky <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eater, so i wish they would find some grandma's secret recipe for chicken so this dish could become 10 instead of a 7. the waffles with bacon inside.... wow. a tear came to my eyes... you had me at bacon. i thought that waffles couldn't be any better, but you took my fork away! if i was lucky enough to have the genetics of brad pitt or ll cool j, i would eat these waffles everyday.\n\nshould you try hash house a go go? yes! unfortunately, i only have one stomach and i could not finish half of a dish by myself. if you are a picky eater, you may want to take your snobby as$ else where. if you are a huge breakfast fan, like me, give hash a try. bring a huge appetite and go early. note to self, don't order the large orange juice next time, it was so large i did not finish it. fresh oj with out much water, it was like trying to drink a huge carton of concentrate. i will go for a tasty small next time. stop staring at the pictures and go try it already!!! come onnnnnn. :)",

            "i got the famous andys <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>.  it was a little on the bland side, but because the portions are so big and the presentation really makes the atmosphere fun and exciting ill be going back for more..", 
            "this place is ridiculous! i came here after seeing it on man vs. food... so naturally i had to try the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. so  mouthwateringly delicious and seriously enough food for at least 4 meals. hash house is such a fun atmosphere and such a creative menu and concept. you have to go early if you don't want to wait forever. this place is constantly packed. if you're having a rough morning after drinking... definitely try <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark>! :-)", 
            "went to hash house a go-go on father's day with a party of 9 people. while the food portions are definitely huge, i just felt the food wasn't anything to make you want to write home about. i had <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, which was tasty and extremely filling. my wife ordered the chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> and was not very impressed with the breading.\n\n     another issue to beware of is that they \"decorate\" the plates with a ring of hot sauce for no apparent reason. i personally like spicy food, but we had family members with us who don't and were not particularly happy about this. please note that nowhere on the menu does it state that your entree will be served with a hot sauce garnish. they need to be more aware that some guests may be have pepper allergies or turned off by this. kind of an odd twist anyway, in my opinion.\n \n     on the whole, the food and service were decent enough. i was just not impressed to the point where i would go out of my way to recommend this restaurant over some others. the \"a go-go\" is just \"a so-so\"", 
            "what can i say that hasn't already been said about this place.\n\nmoderate prices but you get awesome presentation, quality, and portions.\n\ni got the fabled <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles.  i really enjoyed this dish on every level.  the maple reduction was nice in that you got some sweetness in the dish but the waffles were still able to stay crispy by not being drenched in it.  in addition, the waffles are stuffed with bacon, how can you go wrong with that?!?!  the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> had a crispy crust but was moist and tender inside and had very little fat and the fried leeks rounded out the dish nicely.\n\nmy wife had one of the scrambles with egg whites avocado and bacon and it was nice to see that a place that is known for unique dishes can execute something simple just as well.  the avocado was fresh and the bacon seemed to be at that perfect in-between state in that it was crispy yet had some chewy texture; not overly well-done that it looks burnt or under cooked and gummy.  the biscuit had a nice crumbly outer texture and the inside was fluffy and moist.\n\nwe'll definitely be coming back upon our next return to vegas.", 
            "i had the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> when i went on vacation. i flew all the way from maine to try it, and my honest opinion is \"it was worth it!\". all the different ingredients and flavors come together to make one savory breakfast dish. it was the best breakfast to ever tingle my taste buds, and for the price you get more food than you may handle. it may take the rest o0f my life to get to vegas again, but i will be back for more!", 
            "<mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> is my fave! if you are in las vegas... you have to come here! come hungry and ready for some grubbing. i have tried so far everything here so i can not tell you what not to get.....they are all bomb!! just depends what you are craving for.  the staff is real friendly and helpful :)  huge portions and great price!",

            "this place is absolutely amazing! \"twisted farm food\" is how the describe their menu, and it is so true. from their handcrafted cocktails, fresh squeezed juices, and eclectic country cuisine, this place is by far one of the best breakfasts i've ever had! i highly recommend the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>, or the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict. delicious! get your grub on, y'all!", 
            "i have been told to go to hash house a go go since i moved out to vegas 7 years ago.  i was excited when my boyfriend finally set a date for us to go.  we went last sunday morning, and after reading the reviews i was prepared for the wait.  if you aren't expecting to be waiting for 45 minutes, then i can understand being upset, but expecting the wait made it ok.  the place is a complete zoo!!  they honestly need to expand the restaurant or at least the waiting area.  we waited in the car because almost everywhere you stand is in somebody's way!  the restaurant is also pretty loud due to the amount of people in there.  i really like the decor as well, it's kind of country meets modern?  and the music was awesome, very original and fit the restaurant perfectly. \n\nthere is a reason for the busyness here -- the food here is great and extremely reasonable considering the portions are huge!! i'm talking 2 meals... i took mine home and had it for dinner! i ordered <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark>.  it was delicious!! the pancake that they delivered was insane... i would say it took as much batter as 6 regular sized pancakes to make that thing!  i was a little upset with myself for going with such a basic breakfast menu item at a restaurant like that, but i don't care... that pancake was amazing.  plus i got to share with my boyfriend who ordered <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>.  i honestly don't like chicken for breakfast, i think it's odd, but it was good... there were so many different flavors in every single bite.  it's almost impossible to get them all in 1 bite because the plate is so big! \n\ndrinks  : must try the bloody mary!!! i am not a huge bloody mary fan, i normally have a few sips and then give it away because i don't like tomato juice... but a friend of mine told me i had to try it!! so i did and did not regret it one bit.  i wanted 5 more when i was done for the flavor alone.  it was really spicy and the garnishes are deliciouss. i have been craving it ever since.  my boyfriend ordered the watermelon kiwi lemonade (i think that's what it was called) and wow that thing is delicious and so pretty!!  all the drinks they were making at the bar (alcoholic and non alcoholic) looked wonderful. i am really looking forward to going back and trying different things!! i have to try the banana latte next time i'm there... it sounds unreal! \n\ngo here!!!!!!!", 
            "we came here in a big group one night for dinner.  as everyone says...the portions are super huge and you won't be able to finish it.  but even though you get huge portions the food itself wasn't all that great.  we got huge portions of mediocre food...not very exciting.\n\ni personally got the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> pasta and it was just ok.  two people ordered the meatloaf sandwich and they liked that a lot.  maybe next time i'll go for that.  i have no idea why it took us three hours to eat and pay the bill but it was ridiculous!!!  we called ahead so they knew that we had a large party...why not assign another waiter to our table because one was not enough.\n\nthe best part of the meal was the honey biscuits.  but i think they only come when you have a large party because i didn't see them on any other table.  i would come again and try something different.  maybe a breakfast item would be better.", 
            "i've been wanting to try this place for the longest time ever. but seriously, they should warn their customers how huge their portions are. and when i mean huge, i'm talking about huge. my friend ordered the chicken and waffles (that was featured on man vs food) and the 4 of us could have ate that. and us 4 girls love food. \n\nher chicken and waffles were good. i'm picky with <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and i liked it. her waffles had a strip of bacon in them. for me that was eh- i'm not a huge bacon fan.\n\ni ordered their breakfast quesadilla. our server kindly warned me that it would be pretty spicy- i love spicy. it actually wasn't spicy for me, just incredibly ginormous! but the quesadilla was amazing.\n\nthe service here was great, their food was fresh as well. loved it. i would recommend this place greatly.", 
            "well, i broke my own rule and tried this place again. i am so angry at myself for doing it. i could have gone to the peppermill and really enjoyed the fantastic food and the whole vegas feel of the place. but i didn't. i went here instead and got the same thing i got last time i was here. pre-made warmed over tasteless mush. \n         it shocks me that they tell me i can't substitute anything because it will compromise there dishes. now, how the hell do you tell someone that and then refuse to allow eggs over easy after 11am? completely ruins some of the dishes that need the yoke to make the taste and keep it moist. scrambled eggs in the salmon benedict turns it to dried out crap. just floors me every time i think about it.\n         i ordered what used to be my favorite, the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict. this is a rather complicated dish to make and it took them less than 5 minutes to bring it to my table. can you say pre-made? no way are they cooking this to order. the chicken is a full breast of chicken with corn flakes and a few other things on the outside then deep fried. this takes much longer to fully cook than about 3 minutes. \n         when i took the first bite it was just how i remembered it the last time i was there. luke warm, mushy, rather tasteless crap. this place has literally dropped right off the scale as far as i'm concerned. it used to be absolutely fantastic and now i would rather microwave a frozen low cal dinner than to eat here. \n           i was with my mother and she ordered the biscuits and gravy. what the hell happened here? this used to be excellent and now it actually tastes synthetic and rubbery. my mom only finished about half of it and could not stand anymore. this will be my last time eating at hash house. the peppermill is absolutely fantastic every single time and they don't skimp on anything. that is where you will find me at breakfast time from now on. really to bad how they ruined such a good thing.",

            "pros\nbest bloody marys on the strip! seriously. they're a drunken meal in itself. the blt bloody mary was incredible.\n\nthe <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was amazing.\n\nwe got one of the farm benedict entrees. the individual items on the plate were really good, but the way they poured/drenched the plate with hollandaise sauce was a bit nauseating. we'll def order the sauce on the side next time.\n\nour server was one of the best we'd  had all weekend! she was on top of it like no other and seriously made our morning.\n\n\ncons\nthe hostess had her head up her a**. she was rude and lazy. the restaurant was mostly empty and yet somehow she couldn't bother to find us a table. she just glanced behind her into the dining area and made us wait for another 15 minutes. \neventually what looked to be the the manager offered to seat us. but then on his way over he literally stopped to chit chat & shoot the sh*t with another staff member right in front of us. then he moseyed on over to come seat us.\n\nall in all...\n\nthe imperial palace isn't the prettiest hotel to walk through to get to breakfast & the hostess sucks, but if you love a good bloody mary it might be well worth it. \n\nextra tip: consider sharing a plate if you're not a giant eater. lol it's really tempting to want to try as much as you can, but it might be worth it to split one good plate & save a few bucks.", 
            "3.5 stars \n\nwe went around 4:30 pm and the restaurant was pretty empty. upon arriving we were seated promptly by the hostess. the layout of the restaurant is very open with a bar, many tables and a few booths. looking around you can see that their theme of \"twisted farm food\" runs consistent throughout the restaurant decor & its menu items. our server was pretty slow and forgot about several things, granted she was new though. \n\nwe ordered a couple bloody marys to start out with which were deliciously refreshing. they had the perfect blend of spiciness and tanginess and were garnished with a dill pickle, jalepe\\u00f1o stuffed olive, lemon and a pickled green bean. if you prefer tequila over vodka opt for the bloody maria instead. \n\nas entr\\u00e9s we got the hashhouse meatloaf pasta and the hashhouse chicken & waffles. which are two of their most popular dishes. oh yea don't forget to ask for some complimentary honey drizzled buttermilk biscuits! the meatloaf pasta was in a light pesto sauce with one slice of meatloaf on top and garnished with some sort of cheese basket looking thing. the chicken and waffles come with 4 waffles with a slice of bacon cooked right into each one stacked high up with two pieces of <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>. it is garnished with fried onion shreds, drizzled with syrup and conveniently has a knife stuck right into the middle of all of it. the waffles were too soft for my liking yet the chicken was nicely fried. but to be honest with you there was nothing too special about both of these dishes.. because at the end of the day, it's simply just meatloaf, waffles & <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>.. so easy to make & hard to mess up. \n\nyes, the portions are huge but the prices aren't cheap either. so basically what you are paying for is the presentation of the dishes. i'm sure i will be back again to try some other things but not any time soon.",

            "let me preface this review by saying, i've been to both this hash house and the one at imperial palace and this by far is a shitton better in terms of wait time, service, and dare i say even the food. \n\ni had a large group of famished, sunday-after-vegas-weekend-exhausted friends. all of them more than ready to show hash's infamously large plates what was up. okay well maybe that could've just been my thoughts, really.\n\ni was fortunate enough to have an eating partner willing to partake in my fatty adventure. the original request of a not so detrimental eggs benedict had been replaced by the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> and a chorizo hash. mind you, two very gargantuan orders. what a good sport, i almost kind of felt bad. almost. \n\neveryone got a variety of things which was of course, more food than anyone should ever force to digest in one sitting. we really enjoyed the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and chorizo orders --and were also the only two who finished all of our food. \n\nside note, the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> in and of itself was a bit dry. luckily there was enough fat off the bacon, and the fried cheese to keep it moist. lol. \n\nmy friend got the kiwi watermelon drink thing which she seemed to have liked. no one else bothered with drinks. \n\nbellies full, albeit painfully. back on the road for a very long comatose drive home.", 
            "i love this place!! i don't even know where to begin. they have the best breakfast ever and large portions. i checked this place out in vegas first and fell in love with their food. i have also went to the one in san diego every hash house a go go i've been to always a huge wait. i have had the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles plate its bomb.com! and i've also had the andy's famous <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> which is also bomb.com. i always share my plate with someone because its way too much food for me. i think for the amount of food the prices are reasonable and the staff is always attentive and friendly. i will keep going to this place whenever i have a chance. mimosas are always good here but i wish they had bottomless mimosas.", 
            "the first time i went here i was hooked.\n\ndrink - i strongly recommend the bloody mary, even if you don't like them try someone's in the group you go with if possible and i think they will change your mind.  it's a bit spicy and is not tomato-y.  it's just 100% awesome.  every trip to vegas gets me to this place just for this drink at least once, its a must have.\n\nfood - i've tried a couple different dishes and andy's sage chick is my favorite.  piled high with awesomeness, <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, chipotle sauce, bacon and eggs.\n\nif you go during peak hours prepare yourself to wait, its worth it but you will be standing there for a while.  peak hours from my observation is weekends and nights.", 
            "this was the location i first experienced hash house after watching man vs. food.  very happy i came. the food is basically on steroids. a plate can feed at least 2 adults. the food is super sized but it doesn't lose it's quality. amazingly delicious!!! \n\nthis last time that i was there. i ordered the chorizo hash and griddled <mark>French Toast</mark> with a refreshing kiwi watermelon lemonade. \n\nwhat i've had:\n<mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>-i've had it several times and i could only eat 1/4 of the dish. it was certainly delicious. the chipotle cream made the dish even more special. \n<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles-it's a tower of chicken on top of a bed of waffles. \nchicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>-ginormous like all the other plates. it's a deconstructed <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>. \n<mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash (my bf's favorite!!) \ncaramelized banana pancakes-this is heaven!!! it's the size of a large pizza so be prepare to share with 3 other ppl. \n<mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark>-very rich, chocolaty, fluffy and lovely!!! \n\nwon't disappoint!!! you will never walk away hungry. to top it off, every person in your party will walk out with left-overs/an actual meal.",

            "i'm going to round this up to a 3 star rating because i've never really ate at a place quite like this.  they actually have really interesting stuff on the menu that sound really appetizing.  i wish i could've just ordered everything i wanted, but there was no way no how i'd be able to do that.  my bf and i decided to split a plate since it was our first meal of the day.  we had the rosemary <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> and leeks- $14.95.  it's definitely not chicken and roscoes!!!!  the chicken was extremely dry, hard and almost inedible.  waffle was too thick and not moist and fluffy; it was also dry.  the only saving grace on that plate were the leeks, and i would say it was there more for decorative purpose.  i'd pass on this dish.  we also had two eggs, sunny side up, for an additional $2.95.  this excluded the $2.50 fee they add on for those who split a plate.  the rest of my party enjoyed pancakes and the basics!.  everything is just ginormous!!!  the pictures posted give a rime example of the sizes/portions.  even the kids pancake is huge, and definitely not bad for 4.95?  it was cheap!  \n\nthe restaurant is pretty spacious and i appreciate the big booths they have.  i can't really say the decoration stood out to me though.  i can't pinpoint anything specific about it.\n\nservice was slow and rushed at the same time, if that even makes sense.  she took really long to greet us, but when she finally did she was eager to take our orders.  no \"good morning\", or \"welcome to hash house\".  it was my first time there so it would've been nice to have been greeted with a welcoming hello.  after she took our orders, it was a realllllllly long time before we saw her, or our food.  i flagged someone down inquiring about our food and then they finally came out, cold.  blah.\n\noverall, i think i want to give this place another shot, but it will probably be a while before i venture out again.  in the mean time i'll stick to the more \"normal\" breakfast spots out there....\n\noh yea, btw, happy thanksgiving to all my friends, all the people i've been blessed enough to cross paths with, all the people i have yet to meet, and most importantly my family! thankful to have everyone of you in my life!  enjoy", 
            "hash house a go go, as seen on man vs. food!!!\noverall, i give this place a 9/10, but for stars a 4/5.\n\nthe good: great location, off the strip, small parking lot but not crazy like every other restaurant in vegas. good, neighborhood diner with great food.\nour main waitress was very nice, answered or questions, suggested what to get, checked in on us, etc.\n\nwe oredered the sage's <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, as seen on man vs. food, and one order of flapjakcs to split between three people.\nthe flapjack was warm, fluffy, moist, soft, and absolutely delicious, it was made how a pancake should be made. \nthe benedict was also absolutely dilcious, and huge!!\ntheres bacon  <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, biscuits, bacon, spinach, scrambled eggs, <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, cheese literally grilled on the flat top, and all stacked and topped with chipotle cream sauce.\nit is warm, juicy, tender, spicy(not too spicy has a kick kinda spice) ooey gooey positively delicious!\n\nthe one bad thing we did not appreciate was some punk kid who brought us extra plates, and when we asked for bigger plates (he had brought us small bread plate things) he came back with bowls....which did not resolve the situation and he jsut dropped them on the table and said \"here\" and walked away.\n\ngood thing though our kind waitress brought the right plates.\n\nif your in vegas, then go!!", 
            "fun restaurant, it was insanely busy when we showed up of course but it was worth the wait. we had decent service considering they had a packed house and the food was great. i had the salmon bendict. scarfed that thing down. one of my friends had a scramble which wasnt the best dish on the table and my other friend had the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles which was surprisingly scrumptious! only downside, i desperately wanted more syrup! the waffles were pretty dry despite the slight drizzle of syrup. \n\ncoffee was good a strong just how i like it!", 
            "we saw this  place on man vs. food and decided to seek it out on our next lv trip.  needless to say, we were not disappointed with hash house a go go.  i understand that there are some hotel versions of this closer to the strip, but we trekked out to the original on sahara blvd. and it was well worth the drive.  we were seated within 30 mins. on a saturday, we expected to wait longer, as this place is a magnet for locals and visitors alike - perhaps the casino versions of the restaurant keep it down to a decent wait if you drive out to the original hhagg.  service - probably the only thing that wasn't stellar here.  i won't take a star off for that, but it could have just been when we were there - the servers seemed a little green and the hostess had about as much class as what you might see in a local trailer park, but i digress.  \nnow, on to the reason to eat at hash house a go go - the food - omg - some of the biggest portions i've ever seen and not just big but good big food.  i had the indiana favorites - <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> w/maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon, <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> & biscuit.  and i ate every single thing on that plate - come hungry.  it was magnificent!  the chicken was tender and crunchy, drizzled with just enough maple reduction (i.e. syrup) to give it such a nice sweet taste to the the coating on the chicken.  more potatoes than you probably eat for a thanksgiving dinner including 2nds and 3rds but i kept that fork moving through everything, savoring each bite and not wanting this food to end.  the biscuit - oh man- the biscuit - you have to have a biscuit - take an order of those to go...they're that good.  and the whole thing was around $15.  this is now a must visit spot on any trip to vegas.  we may try the casino version to compare, but if you are in town and hungry - give the gaming tables and cicque shows a rest and grab a fork and napkin and dig in - you will  not be disappointed.  save your workout for the next day.", 
            "i was looking for a place to have brunch and i had heard from word of mouth that hash house a go go was known for their huge portions so i figured it was worth a try. my friends and i arrived around 12:00pm or so and the place was super busy. there was a 30 minute wait which gave me more than enough time to look over the menu so that i could be ready to order once we sat down.\n\nfor drinks we ordered the watermelon kiwi limeade and the smores espresso. both drinks were amazing and i would highly recommend both. however, just know that there are no refills on specialty limeades.\n\nfor food we ordered the trucker combo with the snickers flapjack and the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. the snickers flapjack was enormous! it was probably larger than my face, it was larger than the plate it was served on. it came with 2 eggs and sausage. very filling combo with a nice sweet touch added from the snickers. i had a few bites of the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> meal. this combo was an enormous serving of <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, bacon, biscuits <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. the meal as a whole tasted pretty good but i would have to say that on an individual level, i was a bit disappointed in the chicken. the chicken was supposed to be the highlight of the dish but it unfortunately tasted the most bland. \n\nall in all, i wouldn't mind going back to hash house a go go but it probably won't always be at the top of my list of choices simply because the type of food served is something that can be found at other establishments and i am just not over my disappointment in the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>. however, the environment was very casual and fun and the price is right considering the amount of food you get. i would be interested to try some other items on their menu as well as enjoy more of their very delicious drinks.", 
            "\"go go\" to hash house, but \"no no\" dancing -- i'm a bit embarrassed, but i want to provide in advance of you going, advice and a warning.  no need to dress up in your leotards, a tutu, and/or your dance shoes (not that i did that or anything, because i always wear my capezio's when going for breakfast).  i just thought with the name, i'd go all out.  while dancing is not discouraged, it's also not a dance club (like i may have thought).  instead, i partook of what they do offer here: grossly huge food.  \n\nbreakfast -- you have to try their famous breakfast items: <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles (comes stacked high practically to the ceiling), the pancake (size of a fiat), and lots of good egg/omelet choices (i like the chicken hash & eggs), and warm buttermilk biscuits with freshly-made jam.  good lord!\n\nlunch/dinner -- meatloaf (be civil, it's a massive portion.  eat half and be sure not make a spectacle of yourself.  then, drive 2 blocks away to an empty parking lot and eat the other half in the car), the bbblt (mmmmm lots of bacon, a whole pig worth), and their stuffed hamburger (1 pounder, impossible to eat the whole thing...again, head for the parking lot 2 blocks away).\n\nsalads/healthy -- huh?  whatever. \n\nservice -- my favorite is melina - whenever she was working, i'd always ask for her.  she's fun, and shows great customer service. always terrific.  the hostesses are super sweet, and keep the waiting hungry customers moving as quick as possible.  the only way they could be nicer is if they offered small pieces of <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> to customers while waiting to be seated. \n\nwaiting -- no reservations, so my recommendation is to be there early before 930am.  if you get there at 10am or later, be prepared to wait 20-45 mins.  again, no <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> served while you wait.   pffff!\n\nparking -- ample private lot, and since it is way off strip by a few miles -- you have elbow room on the streets, so no need to play bumper cars.\n\nconclusion -- it's awesome.  i love, i love, i love  i've returned many times, and you will, too.",

            "i love this place, but i don't like it. it wreaks havoc with all my good intentions to eat little, and eat healthy. there's not a dietitian alive who'd condone a dinner of mounds of deep-<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> piled atop four, count 'em four belgian waffles, garnished with more than a few strands of fried leeks, unless you count the sprig of fresh rosemary as a green vegetable.  that's hubby's favorite dish at this spot, which bills itself as \"twisted farm food.\"\n\nthe best i can do in my perpetual diet world is the stuffed meatloaf, and i love it. two slabs of meatloaf, with cheese, fresh spinach, and tomato stuffed inside, atop a mound of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  the bonus is fresh green beans, which have the cooked-but-crisp quality i love at chinese restaurants, and carrots.  i can continue to be delusional as i dig in!  i always order this dish without the marsala cream sauce, but whichever server i have always brings it on the side anyway.  the dish doesn't need it, and i sure don't need the calories.  my cousin dipped a pinkie in the sauce and pronounced it bland, so i'm sure i'm not missing anything.  and <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> bonus is that i have enough of the meat loaf left over for a substantial dinner the next night!\n\nwe usually come to hash house when we have out-of-town guests, because it something our [east coast] visitors can't get at home.  this time was no exception, and it's a hoot to watch their reactions when the food is brought out, either to our table or surrounding ones.  even we gaped at a foot-high dish at a nearby table, and couldn't figure out what that pile on top of a slab of watermelon was.  we found out later that it's the fried green tomato appetizer, and we marveled at that couple's ability to polish that off and continue on to main courses.  it looked fabulous, but i don't think we'll ever be ordering it.\n\none thing i take exception to here is the wine list.  they've crossed the $7 line as their least expensive glass of wine, and at $10 and $12 a glass for my coveted rieslings, i vote with my wallet.  as non-strip eaters, we're not used to paying these prices, and i missed my customary wine with dinner.\n\nstill, hhagg will stay on my bucket list for our visitors, and we sure get enough of 'em.",

            "i want to start out my restaurant reviews - with my #1 pick to eat at in the las vegas valley. the would be the hash house a go go. the hash house is located at four locations in the las vegas valley. the first is at 6800 west sahara blvd. just east of rainbow blvd. the second is in the imperial palace hotel & casino located at 3535 las vegas blvd s. the third location is in the m resort and casino located at 12300 las vegas blvd. s in henderson. and the newest is at the plaza hotel and casino at the end of fremont street in downtown las vegas. they have a great menu for breakfast, lunch & dinner. come dine for breakfast on a '<mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark>, garlic, onion, asparagus and rosemary' hash for only $12.95.\n\nor dine on one of their famous one pound burgers like the 'apple <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark> and mashed potato' burger also for only $12.95. no need for side dishes with this one, even though it comes with a ton of fries. (prices are subject to change) how about for dinner you try one of their '<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> linguine'. all of their food is great to eat and easy on the wallet.\n\nthey say that they serve \"twisted farm food\". i'm not sure if i would call it twisted, but it is some of the best i have had. not only is the food some of the best, i have to say that the servers are some of the best as well. my beverage was never empty and when they asked if i needed something more i never felt as if i were being pressured. they truly wanted to help me. even if they were just pretending, i could not see it. so, if you are looking for something unique and great tasting, get on down to one of the three locations of the hash house a go go.",

(and i enjoyed the leftovers.)\n\nwhat really speaks to the level of service at this place is the experience my mother in law had.  she has celiac, and cannot eat any gluten.  she made her allergy known to our waiter, who took the time to double-check with the chef about what dishes had flour.  she settled on a scramble that had asparagus, pot roast, cheese, tomato, and obviously, egg.  she remarked that the vegetables were very fresh and everything was cooked to perfection.\n\nother recommendation:  get a s'mores mocha.  wow.\n\noverall - it was worth the wait.  and given that i paid with my craps winnings, it was the right price.  stop by if you're in vegas, san diego, chicago, or anywhere else they open one of these.  it's worth the time.",

            "pretty damn delicious food, pretty terrible service.\n\nfirst the good news...food was excellent. huge portions, so be prepared to doggy bag it, waste it, or share it.  our party of 6 girls split the chicken and waffles, blackberry granola pancake, and chorizo hash.  the chicken was flavorful and crispy, and made up for the terrible <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> i had at the wicked spoon buffet the day before. the chorizo hash was cheesy, spicy, and yummy.  the granola pancakes were great as well. \n\nnow the bad news...it took us about an hour just to get our food, and our waiter was a little too pushy on trying to make us order more food. we were fully prepared to just split two entrees, but he claimed we really needed three. when we asked if we could put in the order for the two entrees and think about the third, he flat out refused and said he'd come back. he asserted that because of the crowded restaurant, our order would throw off the course of the meal since everything is made to order (like every other damn restaurant).  we were considering getting a salad, which i highly doubt would throw off the delicate timing of the food. at any rate we wouldn't eat for a long while anyway. we did let ourselves be guilt-tripped into buying the pancakes, as we were hungry. it also took about 10 minutes to pay the bill.\n\ni'd definitely go back with a big group to order some food, but i hope i wouldn't have the same experience of being pushed around.", 
            "was kinda disappointed, but will give it another try. the wife and i went late on a saturday for dinner. we walked in and the place was empty at 915pm. okay it was closing in 45 minutes, but was very surprised. we were seriously the only ones in there, maybe it's more of a breakfast place. we were greeted by the hostess who was very sweet and pleasant. she showed us to the table and made some recommendations since i had announced it was our first time there.\n i knew the portions were going to be huge so no appetizers for us. we looked at the menu briefly since we kinda knew from the website menu what we wanted. i ordered the chicken and <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> tower, the wife had the chik <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>. both were huge. the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> comes in what looks like a crust hat. the chikn waffles is built like a tower. the presentation was vey good, but the food in my opinion didn't live up to the hype. the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was somewhat dry, bland and greasy with a slight sage taste. the waffles on the other hnd were the best part... the bacon inside were crisp. i really didn't like the mound of fried leeks that everything was plated on. i think that's sort of what turned me off to the whole meal. i mean you have the sweet and savory combination of waffles, maple syrup and <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, and then get hit with a bit of onion taste... very off putting. \nthe <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> was different than usual which is fine. i can't really comment on the taste but it was made with real nice chicken pieces and huge chopped veggies <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. the wife liked it but stated not to expect the typical c.p.p. \nbad news... the dessert. we had a restaurant.com coupon to use so we needed to hit $50 on the tab. we ordered a snickers <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark>. it comes out with ice cream on top which didn't taste like ice cream, but more like ice milk. it was not velvety smooth and silky but weird. i asked the waitress if it was supposed to be ice cream she said yes... okay. then we get into the <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark>... it wasn't <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark> at all. it was chocolate cake dipped in some egg wash maybe and i don't know...cooked somehow... i think it was microwaved because i hit a nice frozen section on the bottom. i asked the waitress if it was frozen, she said yes. she then looked at me blankly... i looked at her blankly. my wife said its okay we can't finish it anyways.\n\ni will, call me crazy give it another shot for breakfast, maybe try the benedict. again just to be clear... i believe it is way overhyped so if u go, use a restaurant.com coupon, and don't expect great food. the waffles were decent and my wife liked the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>.", 
            "came here for a birthday breakfast after a recommendation from a friend.  i'm glad we came here.  we ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs and the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> benedict.  the portions were huge!  we definitely could not finish in one sitting.  our meals were delicious.  the chicken was not too dry and seasoned well (not too salty, which is a common downfall).  i really liked the fact that they had tangerine juice!  yum!  because it was a birthday breakfast, i had to ask if they would give us a free dessert, which they didn't.  however, we were able to get a candle on the birthday girl's order.  that was nice.  the staff was friendly and the atmosphere was casual and perfect for families and larger parties.", 
            "people aren't kidding when they talk about the portion sizes. \n\nhash house a go go, you are just fascinating!\n\nwe came here on a wednesday morning for breakfast. the wait wasn't too bad. it took about ten minutes for them to give us a table for two. \n\nwe enter the restaurant. hrm, it was a bit loud. my girlfriend and i could not take our eyes off the plates being served as we walked in. patrons around us were gorging on gargantuan plates, while a few packed lots of leftovers into to-go boxes. we decided to share a plate.\n\nwe ordered <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>. we got the option with a biscuit, two pieces of chicken, two eggs, two slices of bacon, <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. the food didn't take too long to come out. but it would have been worth the wait. the dish looked divine!\n\nthere was a huge rosemary stem sticking out of the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. the scent was deliciously fragrant. the chicken was seasoned very well. it was a bit sweet! my stomach is craving for more as i write this :[ ahh. the biscuit was good, and the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>.. oh myy, there was just so much. even though we shared the dish, we could not finish it. we were too full. oi.\n\nbe warned that it's no joke when people say that the plates are huge. be mindful of your order and don't let your eyes deceive you. your stomach will hate you for it when you're wolfing down the rest of your meal. \n\nhash house is a win for me.", 
            "honestly this place is overhyped. i got <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>,eggs,biscuit, and bacon. my food had no flavor whatsoever. i don't like my food too salty but this was just too bland. the only thing i probably finished was the bacon and biscuit lol. the wait service is excellent the food is just not up my alley.", 
            "this is definitely a spot in las vegas to come to if you're looking for a famous restaurant that sells quality food that is presented well. i almost want to say that even if you don't have a car in vegas, it's worth getting a taxi out here even though it might be like $30 to get here. since i had a car on my last trip, i dropped by here. i'm pretty sure this place gets a lot more attention and fame since man vs. food came here.\n\ni ordered the \"<mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> & biscuit\" and the \"kiwi watermelon drink.\" the presentation was amazing and i would recommend getting it especially if you're into chicken & waffles. personally, i am not into that combination but i wanted to try it anyway because of all the recommendations. i don't think anyone puts bacon in the waffle--interesting. i sort of wish i got something else after seeing other peoples' dishes but i still enjoyed what i got.\n\nthe service was amazing and the atmosphere was lively. i would come back for sure but maybe at a different location to see how different they all are. i think that this one is the main location. since it's not on the strip, the street isn't that busy and parking isn't impossible.", 
            "the experience  itself is worth more than 5 stars, let alone the extravagant, picture perfect, work-of-art food. plate by plate files by you of simply gorgeously displayed craftsmanship on a plate. does it match up to the visual when it comes down to taste? you betcha! and beyond. \na towering stack of waffles and sagely spiced <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, mounded with fried leeks (do i eat leeks? i do now!!!). added an order of scrambled eggs, which it seems silly to say but they were truly the best prepared i can remember. the two of us shared the waffle creation and had more than enough food. \nthe second saturday of the month apparently they have this rousing dj that sets everybody rocking to breakfast. fun, inventive, artistic food with an attitude and a joint making a statement of swinging for the fences. loved the experiance and the food!", 
            "came here one vegas morning, but i am going to keep this short because it can be described in just two words \"big\" and \"flavorful\". got the typical man vs food favorite \"<mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>\" man that thing was huge. i actually finished it which was amazing (because it was early in the morning and i am not a big eater in the morning).", 
            "<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles!!!! \n\nafter seeing this impressive looking dish in many of my friend's vegas albums, i had to try it for myself. surprisingly the star of the plate is the fluffy waffles (5 of them to be exact) each of which has a few strips of bacon baked in! whoever thought of that is a culinary genius. \n\nthe chicken itself is good but the batter could actually use more seasoning or some form of louisiana/crystal hot sauce to complement it. the crispy leeks are amazing though and i would definitely ask for extra because they are so flavorful. \n\nportions are ridiculous, in a good way. could easily share a plate of chicken and waffles with someone else. though i did see a guy down the entire plate like a champ one table over. i however had extra <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> for the next two days.. no complaints there :)", 
            "tried this place only because i heard it was popular. after i started seeing the food i realized why. the portions are gigantic, almost jokingly so. it sounds like quantity over quality but the food taste was decent. we ordered:\n\nsalmon hash - salmon and veggies over a mountain of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>\n\nvegetarian quesadilla - huge quesadilla with spicy sauce on top\n\n<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> - <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> covered in a layer of melted cheese, on top of open biscuits, on top of a mountain of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>\n\nit wasn't the best breakfast food i ever had, but maybe a little better than average. we enjoyed the novelty of such ridiculous portion sizes, but this isn't somewhere i could be a regular of, it would ruin anyone's diet. i think they have normal breakfast options on their menu as well, but as a first time, we had to try the popular stuff.",

            "yes...this place is located in the imperial palace, which i think we can all agree is a giant petri dish of cigarette smoke and whiskey stains.  but, you can rest assured that hash house is worth wading through the musty, humid, depressing i-palace.\n\ni have seen a few reviews that say you may wait in line before you can get a table at this place, but my husband and i did not have that issue.  we went during the late afternoon/early evening and got right in.\n\nthe wait staff is friendly and attentive.  after placing your order you receive a complimentary order of home made biscuits....did you catch that?  let me say that again...\n\nafter placing your order you receive a complimentary order of home made biscuits!!  i was like whaaat?!?!  :d\n\ntrust me, they melt in your mouth!\n\ni highly recommend ordering the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles.  that was literally the best <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, and the best waffles i have ever eaten.  everything was cooked to perfection.  the chicken is just the right texture of brown and crispy.  the waffles were cooked long enough to where you had that ever so slight \"crunch\" when you bit into them, but the insides were warm and soft.  \n\ni should also mention that the waffles had ribbons of crispy bacon baked right into them!  i am not talking about the semi-cooked soggy bacon that most places sling on your plate in a lazy stupor.  (you know what i am talking about...the kind where you know it's not cooked all the way).  that bacon crunches when you bite into your waffle!\n\nhands down this place is wonderful.  i literally dragged my husband through the sick, sad casino to get a load of this place.  it was well worth it.  this place is likely rocking around 2am-6am when people are just leaving the bars, so if you go late at night, be prepared to wait.  if you go during the daytime, you will likely have better luck.  regardless of what time you decide to go, make sure you stop by this place, you will not regret it!\n\nthe only reason i gave this place 4 stars instead of 5?  you guessed it.  it's in the imperial palace.", 
            "3.5!\n\nif not sd, then it's vegas babyyyy. i chose this location just because it has more reviews than the ones on the strip. just like the other location in sd, the staffs are very nice and friendly people! it must run throughout the hash house chain eh? awesomeeee. love our waiter! we came after 11:30am and it was a tad crowded but they seated us maybe after 15 mins or so? it would have been 45 mins if you were in sd so i'm grateful for that!\n\nsince we loveeeee our dish so much from the last time, we ordered it again this time. andy <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> ($16). it turns out it's the guy's favorite dish also from man vs food. must i warn you that this dish can fill up two people? even then, we couldn't finish it, yet we were stuffed till maybe for another week or so!\n\nthe dish was very very similar to the one in sd, but not quite! i like it but i could tell there was something different about it. instead of bacon bitz, they placed the whole bacon with it, which didn't taste so good. the grilled mozzarella and <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> were both delicious! i'm not sure what else to it but overall, it was good! with that said, it was nice to have hash house again though! great place for breakfast when you're in vegas! it is off the strip but i can't imagine how other places would taste like with the 3.5 stars, when this has 4 already.",

(yes, i snagged several bites).  they are light, fluffy, and delicious, and they have bacon inside!  amazing. my father-in-law also says that the <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark> is incredible.  \n\nservice was friendly and prompt.  prices are reasonable.  portions are huge.  prepare to be a gluttonous pig or plan to take some leftovers back to your hotel room.", 
            "whoever wrote \" i wanna know what love is\" has never been to hash house a go go! apparently, i've been searching for love in all the wrong places and it was hiding all along on sahara ave in sin city. \n\nthe first thing you notice about hash house are the gigantic portions. often associated with vegas, big food is kind of a staple in the city but it is not always of the highest quality. i think i ate a hot dog for a buck that is still wreaking havoc in me. however, hash house offers dishes with flavor even bigger than the portions. their waffles are a god send as they are light and fluffy and stuffed with bacon. the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> is moist and succulent on the inside and popping with crunch and flavor on the outside. their meat loaf is better than any granny will make (just don't tell them that). and their pancakes can be mistaken for blankets they're so big! \n\nnow with all that said, you'd think you would have to drop some serious coin on a breakfast or lunch this epic. that's where you're wrong! the food is so reasonably priced you almost feel guilty! almost! for a massive meal that will keep you warm for days, you're probably looking at around 12-15 bucks. that's a bargain considering the quality and quantity of food you're getting. the hash house people are doing everything right except not having a location in la for me to visit whenever i want.",

            "the wait time is typically long, so it's best to get up early and go before you get too hungry. but if your stomach is growling, then you'll find that their dishes are served in epic proportions to match that rumbly in your tummy. the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles (which are stuffed with bacon) is my all time favorite dish, and every time i visit las vegas and reno, my mouth waters just thinking about sitting down to order my food. one dish is definitely enough for two. my only complaint is that the bloody mary's don't have enough alcohol in them, but that's why you can go and fill up with spirits at the casinos later on.", 
            "i have to confess i was skeptical about coming here because i thought it might be one of those places that's really famous because it was featured on man v. food but doesn't live up to the hype. i am pleased to report that this place definitely lives up to expectations.\n\nfirst, if you're looking at this review i'm guessing it probably won't be news to you that the portions are huge. seriously, huge. the plates are more like dinner platters that you'd see in a buffet. lots of people seem to order the mvf featured item: <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. i did not indulge, but my buddies did. let me tell you, this thing was impressive. it's a sky high platter filled with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, homemade biscuits, fired chicken, eggs, and chipotle cream sauce. they bury a knife in it for scale.\n\ni opted for the mushroom, artichoke heart, sundried tomato hash for a healthier option and it was really well done. flavorful and served with perfectly crispy potatoes and one of their flaky homemade biscuits. \n\nif you're into bloody mary's, they make a really great one. spicy and tangy, exactly how it should be. <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> double lattes are also really great.\n\nthis place is definitely worth checking out if you're in the area (go here and not to the one on the strip). next time i'm planning to try one of the burgers, they looked incredible.",

            "ok. i like this place, i really do. taking everything into account this is a great place to grab a bite. i've gone a few times and i must say, my first impression was the best impression. the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> and <mark>French Toast</mark> were super tasty, impressively plated, and epically portioned. there is a very vast and creative drink selection for coffees and non-alcoholic thirst quenchers. i was slightly disappointed with the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles. even though 95% of society loves bacon and are under the impression it makes everything better, i thought having the bacon inside the waffles was superfluous and totally took away some key factors that makes bacon so great. the waffle iron must be what made the bacon rubbery and tasteless, which in turn, kinda ruined the waffle, which was chewy and meh. other dishes i have had were filling and hit the spot, but weren't really anything to write home about. the staff, atmosphere, random but good music, and creative options make up for any entree which may be less than \"super fucking awesome\".",

            "we recently took a family road trip from san jose all the fricken way to las vegas and it was one of the best road trips i have ever taken.  the desolate scenery was exactly what i needed to get away from the hustle and bustle of the busy city.  because we came in right before the new year, everything was packed, and the hotels no longer sold those buffet of buffet passes.  but surprisingly, the imperial palace, now known as the quad, was our jewel on the strip.  because the dining at hash house is way up at the top of the quad, it was not swamped with people.  after escaping the mad crowds and taking several escalators to something like the fifth floor, we got to hash house.  the service is prompt, they seated us quick, and were oh so kind to talk about the menu to let us know what we were getting into.  hash house's theme is \"freaky farm food\" and it is so true to its nature.  everything on the menu is some traditional classic like waffles, <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, steak, pork chops, all twisted into some freakish concoction either through sheer size of portion or some twist in the cooking methodology.\n\nwe were looking for a dinner for three, and know that because we're small and asian, we don't eat that much.  a mcdonald's chicken patty can be dinner for 2 of us with rice.  we went for the most highly recommended item based on conversations with buddies - <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles.  holy !$%^.  the stupid thing is gi-normous.  my good buddy who recommended said not to order more than 1 because it would make us feel guilty.  once you see the thing, you realize you're in trouble.  3 <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breasts over 3 bacon-stuffed waffles, fried herbs on top, and some kind of mash hash thing under it all.  maple syrups is provided to glaze over the whole mess.  at the top, there is an 8\" jagged blade stuck down the entire stack to keep it in one piece.  we ordered a house garden salad, entree style, to help offset the protein rich platter.  \n\nit took 3 of us to down the entire thing.  the way it was fried was beautiful.  something in the batter just made it all the better.  the waffles were crisp, wholesome, and the bacon was just a nice added bonus.  if any one single person were to finish this on their own, i would congratulate them for setting themselves up for their first heart attach.  i don't even want to know the calorie count on that bad boy.  \n\none of the things i love about the place is that they sell gift cups for their blended drinks.  the hostess was so kind to recommend it.  we ordered a couple drinks, enjoyed them, and they washed, dried, and boxed our cups to go - a great gift.  \n\nbottom line: if you are vegetarian, don't go here.  for everyone else, this is as good as a vegas buffet at half the price.  because of its separation from the casino part of the hotel, it was a glad reprieve from the madness and second hand smoke.  nice and tucked away, on a very late evening, it's a great place to eat in peace.  lunch and dinner rush time though ... i'm sooo soooo sorry for you all...!\n\noh yeah, expect to have zero cellular signal in this part of the hotel... i love being disconnected from work calls and emails.  damn you blackberry, damn you!", 
            "you have to ask yourself sometimes, how crappy do i want to feel after i eat this? if the answer is - not at all, do not eat here. while in vegas i wanted to sample some non-strip fair and drunkenly asked a bouncer where he liked to go eat - he said hash house a go go. given that he was about 6'5\" and weighed 250 pounds, it all makes sense now. my girlfriends and i arrived around 11:00am on sunday morning and were told it was about to be about a 40 minute wait. that wasn't too bad - the line seemed to be moving quickly and there were some benches outside where you can sit and take a look at the menu. we were called inside to eat and the overall ambiance is pretty neat. like a tin shed that is crossed with a barn? i decided to really go for full sickness feeling and order the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> (with their famous <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>). i have to say that i don't eat <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> often - in fact it has probably been about 10 years since i last had some, but sometimes you have to make your stomach beg for mercy. the portion that i received could have easily fed me for 2 weeks and i am not a light eater. it probably weighed 20 pounds. it has <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, eggs, bacon, hollandaise and who knows what else since you could not see the bottom of the plate. despite the gargantuan portion, the taste was excellent. truly just tasty, greasy, cheesy diner food that does not apologize for using 3 pounds of butter in each dish. the service was fast and the coffee was great! really, what else can you really ask for from a diner? the only reason that i am not giving 5 stars is that the portions are really (embarrassingly if not annoyingly) large. there is no reason anyone should need to eat that much food (now if you want to eat it, that's another story). but if you're looking to lay around for the remainder of the day in a food coma while wearing stretchy pants - then make sure you eat at hash house!", 
            "if you're a first timer, i would suggest the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles, accompanied by a bloody mary. so very good. those two items are (or should be) considered a hhgg signature dish and drink. the chicken is fried, yet moist, not too salty. the waffle it comes with has a nice crisp texture with a fluffy inside. the bloody mary is zesty and well garnished with the rda of vegetables. it will get you where you want to be.\n\ni'm curious of those who have had less than a stellar experience at this location. i've dined here a few times and have yet to be disappointed. i would consider the wait worth it. the staff is always spot on. come hungry, you probably won't need to eat the rest of the day.  for the herbivore, the menu has a far share of salads as well. two entree's, two adult beverage's and a tip is about $55. \n\nbe careful of the rosemary sprig art piece that garnishes most items, it could poke your eye out.  regardless of that, a total recommend. 4 stars.",

            "i actually like it here, but i'm not going crazy on the stars because i agree with the gist of some other reviews: the food is big, and the menu is interesting, but the food just doesn't taste as good as it sounds. there is always a long list of ingredients in the description, and while you are promised what sounds like an orgy of chipotle cream, smoked mozzarella, caramelized onions, basil pesto, and other tastebud stimulators that sound great on paper, what you get seems a little more like a pile of somewhat dry <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, tasting more like the paper than what you imagined. there are dishes i enjoy- the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> is consistently good, though the waffles are not crispy and deteriorate too fast, and, number one complaint, the huge portion is accompanied by a thimble-sized pitcher of syrup. what the hell? same for those hubcap-sized pancakes(which come in various flavor combos but with very little flavor, and with insufficient syrup to wet them down, it's like trying to eat a blanket). and how about those giant biscuits they serve before dinner? i'm a fan, but they went from supplying one barbie-sized pitcher of honey to the whole table, to skipping that entirely and just drizzling on a little (very little) before serving them. for a place that's so generous with the portions, and that must plow through a field of rosemary daily, garnishing even the plates that have nothing to do with said herb, why are they so reluctant to part with the condiments? maybe they could save a couple of bucks by ditching their other inexplicable practice of adding what can only be described as french-fried broom straws to all their dishes. you spend the first few minutes just picking weeds from your plate.  the meatloaf is quite good, as is the grilled cheese, and baby girl loves the salmon. the side vegetables are usually well cooked and seasoned. i've never tried dessert, because i can't fathom ever getting that far, and i've been tempted to try  one of those giant burgers, but never do because i know i can't finish it and re-heated burgers are just not good. strangely, though, the leftovers we do bring home (which is always), seem to taste better than the original did. who can explain it? but the hh brown bags are always seized upon by the family vultures with midnight munchies. yes, i'll keep coming here to dine, but i will never again make the mistake of ordering the thanksgiving dinner to go. the fried turkey was ok, the veggies were raw, the dressing was dry and flavored only with salt, the portions of potatoes were shockingly small- less than they serve on a single dinner in the restaurant, and the snickers <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark> dessert wound up in the trash. unprecedented. oh, and the number one reason i will keep coming back? you can almost always get your hands on a half off coupon. then it's really a bargain!", 
            "i came here due to some friends recommendation due to the reviews.  the restaurant is very plain looking, looks like an average diner.  after looking at the reviews, i decided to go with the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>.  the portions are crazy.  it is definitely a place to go eat if you are hungry.  i would say that the food was ok.  the price seems kind of expensive for what it is, but i guess the portions make up for it.  it seems that they just pile up a bunch of good together without thinking if it actually works.",

            "best food ever!!! (sorry mom!)\n\nfavorite: <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles. i could have easily spent my entire life not knowing that chicken & waffles were supposed to be that damn good! (sorry mom!) the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> are stupid good too. my son ordered a pancake (either blueberry or cranberry & walnut) that was as big as a domino's medium-sized pizza. just way better! the look on his face when it was brought to the table said it all.\n\nyes it's crowded people!!! when something is this good, people tend to show up in large numbers and then they want to stick around to enjoy all that buttery goodness. that's just the way it is. some things will never change. when the food stops being good and the service turns for the worse, there won't be as many people in front of you. then there won't be as many good reviews because bad service & good food rarely coexist anwyere in the world.\n\nthanks bin laden! :-p\n\ni've never had any issues. probably because i'm a fan of the food. if i know we're going there, i'm prepared to wait because it's well worth it. i've been to this location as well as the one inside the golden nugget downtown and the food and service were both excellent, although i enjoyed the vibe at this location better than at the golden nugget.\n\nif you're not a fan of the super-sized & delicious, this is not the place for you. i promise i won't complain if you're not there because it'll only mean that i'll get to my table faster if you ain't all up in the way!\n\nmy only complaint is that there isn't a hash house in los angeles (message!!!)",

            "i've been here so many times and i was wondering to myself why i've never written about it yet. guilty pleasure, embarrassment, i dunno.. what i do know this hh is style over substance. huge massive portions that are impressive in looks but lame on flavor. i mean the food doesn't really taste that good. so why do i keep coming back  if i don't like the place? easy, out of town visitors. they've all heard about the place with food bigger than you're head. i can't say i don't warn them that it's not very good but hey, what do i know? \n\nwhat annoys me most about hh, the fried spaghetti and rosemary they stab and litter every plate with. i know its their signature but having to remove all the inedible bits from my plate is pretty lame. if it's not edible don't put it on the plate. \n\na few highlights from our last visit.\n\ntraditional buttermilk flapjack - bigger than your head, thick, fluffy pancake. nothing particularly special aside from the sheer size. we had this as a brunch appetizer and had a hard time finishing it. \n\nthe kokomo - huge meatloaf sandwich that was on the dry side. to be fair i grew up on moms meatloaf and trust me seldom any live up to her sweet juicy meat slab. i think the chief problem with the kokomo is that the bread to meat ratio is way off. to much bread. \n\n<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> - very disappointing. the chicken while under seasoned was covered in a thick glaze of maple syrup reduction which just tasted weird to us. unfortunately the reduction was also on the eggs and the bacon. i think if i were to order this again it would be with plain maple syrup on the side. that way i can control the sweet to savory ratio.\n\nwith all of that said of course ill be coming back with out-of-towners. the look on their faces when the food comes out is so worth it.",

            "man did i love this place! i really love how creative they are with their presentation. the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> was almost doing too much, but it was worth it! the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash was great. i have no complaints at all about that. the blueberry pecan flapjack was amazing. we were all talking about the pecans. then later on that night i snuck away to try one of the scrambles. another hit!! everything was amazing!", 
            "awesome!  best food we had the whole time we were in vegas.  the menu selections are so creative & different, and one dish was endorsed by the show 'man -vs- food'.  got the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles and it was delish. when in las vegas, you must eat here!!", 
            "this is one of my favorite places to take visiting family and friends. be aware that the portions are huge. as in, you need to split something with someone else, or be prepared to take half of your entree home. everyone raves about the chicken and waffles, and while it is an impressive spectacle, i found both the chicken and the waffles to be terribly bland. one dish i keep coming back to is the sun dried tomato , <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark> and basil omelette with crispy potatoes. this thing is full of flavor and tastes ridiculously fresh. the biscuits here are out of this world; you have to try it with the house-made strawberry jam and honey butter! i've also had the chicken biscuit benedict, and it's definitely my second favorite meal at this place. the husband always orders the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, and it is always delicious! flavorful, juicy, and you'll have a second portion to take home and enjoy the next day.\n\nfriends i have taken to this establishment always leave disappointed if they order a salad or a sandwich, so, be warned....", 
            "i never would have ordered the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> had i not see the episode on diners, drive-inns, and drives. i'm so glad i did! it was one of the best things i have ever eaten! the restaurant was clean and adorable. there was a bit of a wait to be seated but well worth the wait. staff was friendly, food arrived fast and portions were huge! love, love, loved this place. can't wait to go back.", 
            "my family drove me here after a sleepless night right after edc.  we got chicken and waffles, <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark>,  and a <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. i was not mentally there to remember all the details or take pictures of food that day but i've had other trips to this place before and after edc.\n\nthe food portions are for giants or about 3 people.  it's supposed to be hangover food but i remember feeling sicker after i ate and took 2/3 of my plate to-go. the food is marginal but thanks to man vs food, this place is popular especially with tourists. it's supposed to be food inspired by the midwest. i'm from the midwest and we've had better stuff to eat there. the chicken and the tenderloin were so fried, you can hurt your mouth while eating.\n\ni'd like to write descriptions of each dish but thinking about it make me feel woozy. however, they do have a good watermelon drink with alcohol.", 
            "i have been here once and wasn't as impressed by the food. i ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> pasta and it was nothing special. presentation was amazing, but i went to eat, not look lol. not to mention i'm from the south so maybe i'm spoiled with the good southern cooking that i'm used to!", 
            "the portions here are huge, but the food is tasty and the plating is impressive. who knew you could make so much food look so elegant? i tend to get the same handful of entrees when i come here. the chicken and waffles and <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> biscuit benedict are my favorites and my go to items if i can't decide what i want. if you're not much of an eater, you'll want to share with a friend. i've come to this location during lunch and dinner and its typicaly packed during the meal rush hours. wait times can be around 15-20 min sometimes, but you can always opt to sit in the bar area and not have to wait at all. service is decent here even when it's completely packed and it's better than some of their other locations", 
            "the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>  is one of the best things i've ever eaten. \ncame here because of man v food, but kept coming back every morning because everything was so tasty.\nthe pancakes are huge, and tastes amazing.", 
            "whaaaat?  friends recommended this, yelp had pretty solid reviews, and we got a great vibe upon entering.  the place was packed, which is always a good sign, and we lucked out to find a spot immediately at the bar.  i have to say that despite it being a busy holiday weekend, the service at the bar was impeccable.  they were engaging, friendly, and clearly working their tails off.  \n\nthat's where the good stuff ended though.  the menu looked great at first glance, and we had a difficult time deciding what to order... so we asked for help from the bartender.  she recommended the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, biscuit, potato breakfast dish.  it seemed like a good choice, but when it arrived, it was honestly just too much.  too many components... too large of portions... you honestly couldn't tell where one thing started and another thing ended.  it was just a huge bunch of slop on a plate.  we shared it, and there was still plenty leftover.  i think if they had a more restrained concept of the dish, it would've worked so much better.  the mimosas (tangerine and pineapple) were okay.  i wish we would've tried one of the delicious looking iced coffee drinks we saw headed to other tables.  but, with our lack-of-luck with the meal, we decided to just call it a day and head out!", 
            "this place is awsome there was a wait of 20 min but it felt more like 5 min. the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> is bomb.com it was very much comfort food. i am a big guy and can usually put down a fair amount of food but this is deff something that should be shared with a side of hashbrowns.", 
            "i visited here twice and was impressed with how beautifully plated and appetizing the food looked.  i tried what i believe was the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>. the taste didn't quite measure up to the looks though.  it was kind of bland for my taste, but if you don't mind bland and overpriced, you may very well enjoy hhagg... or make that  hhang for hash house a no go", 
            "the portions here are huge. the flapjacks are bigger than everyone's head. i got the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> & biscuit which was pretty good. the only reason i knocked off a star is because many of the menu items can be a bit pricey. most of the plates range from $13-$17 each dish. i also like how many of the breakfast platters are served in the actual skillet that they used to cook the food in. it was a fun experience, but i do not think i will be coming back here for awhile.", 
            "it was amusing the first time, the second and third time just doesn't make sense. food doesn't taste good, everything is either super gigantic big or piled on a mountain of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> that most people don't even touch. i think it's cement to hold up the over fried oil glistening meat thing they call <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> or pork tenderlion. flapjacks, tasteless unless you drown it in syrup of course, corn beef hash, dry as the atacama desert, really any of the \"hash house\" are inedible. let's just highlight the best thing there..bloody mary. that's it. needless to say i drank my food that day at hash house a go go.", 
            "huge plates.  great service.  <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles are the best\nevery meal serves 2-3 so don\"t order 1 entr\\u00e9e per person unless you eat for free at the heart attack grill!", 
            "i was so amped to try this place on my mini vacay in vegas back in august with my partner in crime. after watching man vs food i placed this spot on my must eat at list.  i must say it lived up to most of the hype. we were greeted and seated immediately. we ordered the chicken and waffles, and the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict. both were presented well and tasted wonderful. quality ingredients and huge portions here,we ate so much we couldn't eat for the rest of the day! service was good, food was good, it was everything i hoped it would be.", 
            "on the last day of my las vegas trip, my family decided to go to hash house a go go and we got there, we have to wait about 35 minutes before we can get our seat and we had no reservation. when we got to our seat, it took a long for the waiter to get here, but we were able to order and i decided to get the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles.\n\nwhen my order was here, i took one bite and it was delicious, even though the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was a little bit dried, it still made the dish together with the waffles and the chicken.\n\nif you are in las vegas and you're looking for breakfast, this is the place to go.", 
            "i finally made my way back after coming here in 2009. this was before all the other locations on the strip opened. on my return trip i wanted to come back to the original location in vegas. i've seriously dreamed about this place. i have raved to friends that hash house will ruin breakfast at all other places. the husband and i ordered enough for 4, but i really wanted him to try everything.\n\npumpkin latte - perfect balance of pumpkin flavor.\n\n<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles - still the absolute best chicken and waffles! chicken breast was perfectly fried and moist. waffles had bacon strips in them!\n\nsnickers pancakes - love that they are the size of a pizza pie! a little disappointed since i love the mango coconut pancake i had 4 years ago. the husband loves snickers and isn't a fan of coconut, so he picked this one. good, but a little drier. pancakes with fruit are the way to go.\n\nsausage hash - tasty with peppers, sausage and <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark>. potatoes were yummy too! \n\nwe finished most of the food as this was our pre-trip home lunch stop before heading to the airport for a 6 hour flight. staff was friendly. i look forward to coming back the next time we are in town. \n\n*chicken & waffles is a must!",

            "the food was great, huge portions.  we couldn't finish our plates.  the presentation was excellent complete with sage and twigs.  the service was great, robert p. was very helpful with the menu.  seeing that man vs food and the new york times liked the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, i had to give it a try, and it didn't dissapoint.  they also have a great wall of fame at the entrance.", 
            "everything from scratch and very fresh. you cannot go wrong here...\n\nthe <mark>French Toast</mark> and <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with waffles were awesome. we also had the best freshest oj ever. waitress was great with awesome personality and attentive. great job folks.",

            "man oh man oh man\n\n<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles sooo good.  chicken breast were seasoned well - fried crispy.  waffles had crumbled bacon and were really fluffy.  friend had the \"pub crawl\" ... <mark>Corned Beef</mark> on rye, caramelized onions, spicy mustard.  delish!!  \n\nservice was quick; very friendly staff!!\n\ncan't wait to try this place again when i visit vegas again.", 
            "alas, i want to like this place more. i mean they have everything going for them.  1) a reputation for having crazy large portions, great breakfast, and creative menu items and 2) great locations.\n\nunfortunately my recent experience did not live up to the hype.  the meatloaf was very dry and difficult to eat. the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> salad was very good but again, the chicken was dry.  service was not great and i had to send the waiter back 3 times just to get small bills for the tip.  the waiters seemed overwhelmed even though the place was only 1/2 full (ever the optimist).\n\ntheir deserts are huge and decadent.  we refrained however.  so much potential, only partially realized.", 
            "though extremely friendly, service was a tad slow. we arrived about an hour before closing to set up for dinner, so perhaps the staff was recovering from the lunch rush. <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles were amazing! the biscuits and house-made strawberry preserves were delicious too. my only complaint - and it's not really a compliant, so much as the only issue i had with our visit - the regular bloody mary was a little too spicy for an early afternoon visit. maybe my hungover taste buds hadn't woken up just yet, or were too sensitive from all the drinking the night before (what? it's vegas!), or it was just too darn spicy, but i just couldn't finish it. and for me saying that, the girl who orders jalapenos on pizza and adds crushed red pepper flakes, that has to say something. other than that...this place has definitely won a place in my heart. :)\n\np.s. my visit was on october 8th. i can't freakin' figure out how to change the date...i thought it would use my \"check-in\" date, but no. whatever. you get the idea. ;)",

            "<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breakfast is amazing!\n\ni went to this spot specifically from the reviews of yelp, boy, it did not disappoint.\n\nprice - very reasonable, my giant <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breakfast was only $12 with a biscuit, two eggs, two bacons, mash potatoes, and fruit. \n\nwait - wasn't very long, took us 10 minutes to get a table for 2 at noon on a sunday.\n\nselection - there was so many options on the menu varying from all different types of dishes for the right occasion.\n\nvery impressed, thank you yelp.", 
            "i love this place! always great food and great service. the portions are huge and so delicious. i have never had a bad meal at hash house. i love their pancakes with coconut and mango. my husband loves the benedict with <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>. we have been to several locations in las vegas and have never had a bad meal.", 
            "i was taken to hash house a go go with a major fan and was expecting so much better. the portions are huge and if portion over taste was my thing, i would have loved it. i orered the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> and in theory it sounds delicious and even has a man vs. food endorsement, but it was gross. it should have been called the trash plate or the left over plate because it seemed like something you'd make when all of the left overs from the week came together in one dish. the biscuits here are the worst biscuits ever made as they aren't flakey or buttery but big dough blobs. there were too many flavors on the plate and at the end i just felt sick. i am not a huge fan of mash potatoes to begin with but <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> under chicken, biscuits, eggs, cheese, and this sauce was just too much. oh, and the food was not hot at all just slightly warm leftovers on a huge plate...\n\ni did taste my friend's banana pancakes and they were delicious, but everyone else's food was just meh.", 
            "the wait was a nightmare. during my trip to vegas, i lived off one meal a day - which was not really intentional but it kinda just happened. night after night of going out and what not really drains you and when you wake up, your famished!!! so here i was, famished. and i think we waited for an hour? hour and a half? but for a party of 8 :\\ so that could have also been a factor... anyways, if your hungry come early is what i learned.\n\non to the food. there are soooooo many choices to choose from! i love breakfast food and everything sounded so delish! i figured i should split because i heard the portions here were skdjfsldkjdlfj outta this world... and they were... but hey - that means i have food to eat when i get drunkchies. i ordered the  <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> which came with mash potatoes eggs? a giant biscuit oh it has bacon lol every fat kid's dream. i dont know how to describe this to you but it was just simply amazing. it was even more amazing eating it at 4 am. each time a plate of food came out my eyes were litereally like o.o dayuummmmmmm. seriously, the portions here are huge. huge. even people who were splitting had a hard time finishing... but yeah place is definitely worth it. it is pricey but for the portion you get, its  pretty cheap.", 
            "so apparently when i'm in vegas, my diet goes out the window. rather than doing our usual brunch buffet at the wynn or other casinos, we opted to get hash house. i wanted to go to this location off the strip because the wait isn't as long (i get very angry when i'm hungry. the snickers bar commercials where ppl turn into crazy angry hungry monsters definitely applies to me haha). also after we left, we met bj penn & got a photo w/ him!!! :d being a girl that's into mma, i was so happy.\n\nthere's patio seating outside for those that want to get your tan on in the nevada sun, but we opted for indoor seating. the service was very friendly, no complaints there\n\nfood:\n\nmushroom, spinach, sun dried tomatoes, artichoke scrambled egg white hash & ordered extra side of ham steak - what can i say? i'm a petite girl w/ a big appetite. i devoured this whole cast iron plated meal except for a few pieces of potatoes. you seriously get enough potato wedges to last for days here. everything was cooked perfectly. eggs weren't overcooked. there were plenty of mushroom, spinach, etc. the biscuit was warm and flaky, i doused it in butter and honey. i was in heaven! the ham steak was huge, but good and not super salty\n\nchicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> - my bf ordered this and i helped him out a little 'cause i was still hungry after eating my dish lol. i loved how this wasn't just ordinary chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>. it's served in a cute giant hat w/ gravy oozing everywhere. dish came out piping hot and fresh! there were plenty of chicken breast pieces throughout each bite and yes...loads of potato wedges. i really like the gravy here, everything tasted so home made. i'd recommend this dish over the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> biscuit benedict\n\n<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> biscuit benedict - 2 of our friends ordered this and it was just ok to me. i know it's a popular item, but it really did just taste like <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> w/ biscuits...nothing too special. at least the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> wasn't too greasy\n\nwatermelon lemonade - it looked so awesome!! check out my pic http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0eh9jlskxjin8n9culnisq/ms.jpg\ntasted really refreshing and not super sweet. the watermelon wasn't overpowering either.\n\ncaramel coffee w/ scoop of vanilla ice cream - so my friend ordered this cause we had serendipity the night before. this basically tasted like any other frappe, but great palate cleanser for all that food!\n\ni love the big portions at hash house and the pricing is just right for what you get!! i know they have one back home in ca,but it's all the way in sd :( they're expanding like crazy in vegas, how about building one in orange county?!", 
            "<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> biscuit benedict for the win! loved everything about it. well over 2 servings, made for perfect leftovers. the fresh squeezed tangerine juice was amazing  as well. food came fast and service was good, i'll be back", 
            "freaking <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles were amazing! stacked high and decorated well. others on here might say no flavor, but my experience was the opposite! my chicken was so juicy and so crispy despite being covered in warm syrup. the waffles alone would be worth the 30-45 minute wait! i am a believer in hash house!", 
            "i first decided to eat here after seeing the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> on man vs. food. since then i've been back several times.\n\nout of all of the times that we've been, i've only tried 2 items. the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> and the mashed potato stuffed burger. both are absolutely delicious and there is no need to order anything else on the menu (i'm sure the rest is good though).\n\nmy wife loves the chicken and waffles, and gets either that or the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. i keep telling myself that i'm going to try something new, but i never do. i'll definitely be going back though, because we always have lots of leftovers.", 
            "ok i really do like this place and their food but today was different. they have large portions which is great unless you order the grilled salmon salad. it's a huge plate with a whole lot of iceberg lettuce and piece of salmon gone in six bites, different than their normal huge plates. stick with the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles. they're awesome!", 
            "a sunday morning excursion here meant a 45 minute wait time. too bad we couldn't get here before everyone slept off the alcohol and partying from the night before...maybe if there was no remnants of leprechaun piss in my own bloodstream...\n\nlong wait, but the food is worth it. i don't usually order pancakes when i'm out, but blueberry and white chocolate is a seductive combo. my dining companion had the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> with a nice chipotle kick to it. portion sizes are ridiculously huge...the benedict could have served 3 or 4 people and the pancake extended over two opposite edges of the giant plate. plan to share or doggie bag! good food, expertly seasoned, and prices are a value taking into account the amount of food served. kiwi watermelon lemonade was tangy, refreshing and pretty to look at with the three layers before i swirled them all together. casual farm ambience with enough stainless steel worked in to not feel cheesy and decent service considering how packed it was. i was elated to learn they have a location back home i can check out after i leave fabulous las vegas ^.^", 
            "delicious!   copious portions.  bloody to wake up for!   line out <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark>, lucky to grab bar seats.     <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with maple was good worth fighting for!    unreal grinds!   so worthy if your time!   i can't recommend high enough!",

            "i wanted to love this place, but i can't. it's just too much of a grease overload without any balance. the portions are the only thing good about this place. everything else was just too much. i tried the salmon benedict, chicken and waffles, and the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, after a couple of bites out of all...you just want to stop.\n\ni was longing for something extra spicy after all that and we even togo'ed the rest of the food and never touched it again. pretty sad that such a great place was not worth it in my eyes.", 
            "well if you starving this is the place to....the portions are huge! i had the mushroom swiss burger and couldnt finish. all the burgers have 1lb of meat. the taste and presentation of the burgers were good, not the best in the world like what was shown on man vs food, but good. i came a second time to try the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles. again huge portions, and very tatsy.", 
            "living in vegas for all these years, it was time to finally come here. they used to have a location at the m, but they closed down so we made the shlep across town in the hopes of experiencing a vegas icon.\nsunday lunch time and line was out <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> with the promise of seating after a 45 minute wait. we waited in the car since there wasn't much wait seating. ok, busy place is always a good sign of good food, right? well, maybe it's more about the ginormous portions.\nas you can already tell from the 2 stars, i was not at all impressed. however, i must give props to the friendly and cordial service we received from our server.\nclientele that day was mostly tatted up hipster crowd with piercings and stretched out lobes. to each their own.\nwe ordered a spicy bloody mary that was very good and perfect for a sunday afternoon.\nwe've been on a <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles kick as of late and eager to try the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles. the pictures of it show a tower of chicken stacked high on a huge plate. we thought sharing this enormous entr\\u00e9e would be the best option.\nwe were amused at the nearby table of 3 petite diners, each having their own tower of chicken & waffles. how ambitious.\nwe finally got ours and though the presentation looked impressive...it was a huge disappointment.\nthe chicken was soggy and skin was wet and fatty. the overall flavor of the sage and rosemary mixed into the batter was awful. we both choked down a couple bites but hated it. the waffle was ok with the bacon cooked into it, but not enough the redeem this nasty dish. this was the only thing on the menu that made hash house a remote possibility for us, but after this experience we will definitely not return.", 
            "i'm disappointed by a lot of breakfast joints, but this one was amazing.  if i could i would eat here everyday.  \n\ni ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles, the portion was literally bigger than my head and was the best tasting chicken and waffles i've ever eaten.  also, the waffles were stuffed with full sized strips of bacon.\n\ndisclaimer : everything brought to the table was dressed with a sprig of sage, so maybe sage is just their thing, but it's delicious.",

            "the food itself was great. it was a late minute decision to come here due to the fact that my favorite restaurant was close on sunday's. \n\ni ordered the chicken and waffles and ate 2/3 of it. the chicken was very moist to my surprise! and the waffles with bacon went well with the chicken. my friend ordered the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. she was nowhere close to finishing! \n\nreasons for the two star deduction is basically customer service:\na) when we entered the young female in the front took a long time to figure out that there were customers waiting on her. and when we asked for an outside seating she said it will take 10 minutes. but her co-worker behind her says a table was ready for us. she seemed confused as we followed the guy to our outdoor seating. so communication on their part needs to be fixed. \n\nb) our food came out in an orderly time (around 10 minutes) which wasn't bad for the humongous portions we were given. however, the servers were sloppy when they handed us our plates. the first lady brought in my friends plate first and clumsily lays it in front of her. as the plate dropped and the server turned, an orange slice slipped off the plate and landed on my friends lap. i've never seen anyone so careless in putting a plate down a table. \n\nanother different lady came in with my plate minutes after that and the presentation was just not pretty. the fried sage was literally hanging off the plate when i saw it coming. that's my biggest pet peeve because either they don't care about the way it looks (i doubt it since all of their food looks spectacular) or they are just overall clumsy. \n\nc) lastly, the lack of customer interaction was just not there. i guess that's it's perks of being outside? after i got my check it took them a good 10 minutes to finally come back and check up on us. \n\neven though my first experience here was rocky, i know i'll be back soon to hopefully redeem this great restaurant. till next time.", 
            "the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> was the best dish.  the portions were way too big for me. overall good but i've tasted better. it's a breakfast version of claim jumpers. i don't see how anyone can finish the dish. wanted to try the  watermelon lemondade but it was $5.50. way too expensive!!!", 
            "2 words.... fuc*!ng amazing!!! we had the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> and it was definitely more than enough for me and my wife. i also ordered a side of biscuit and gravy which was unbelievable but unecessary since we were not even close to finishing it since we were stuffed lol. the wait is kinda long but definitely worth the wait.  hit up the bar inside while you wait. they have great hangover fixes.",

            "the success of hash house may be directly related to the frequency of hangovers in vegas. just the sight of their leaning towers of <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles could cure your hangover faster than iv hydration (which, freakishly enough, is a service you can find easily in vegas). \n\nopting for a fork & knife remedy over surgical needles, our experience at hash house was thoroughly therapeutic, and still very vegas-y. the ambiance is not much different than your local denny's: big booths, neon colored cocktails in tumbler sized glasses, and smiley waitresses. they do have some outdoor seating and a fun 90s playlist in the background, but the real selling point is the menu. \n\nit'll be hard to order anything but those famous sage-<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & bacon-stuffed waffles everyone is yelping about. but in case you're anti-poultry or gluten-free, you'll still find something to drool over on their gigantic menu. homemade biscuits, big salads, scrambles, benedicts, crab cakes, griddled cheese, and meatloaf are all part of the uber-american offerings. prices are also huge: $18 chicken & waffles, $15 cocktails, for example. but, be wise and share everything. these are party portions, and you've had enough of that. \n\nshout out to our waitress who was so cool, and happily split our check 4 ways without an inkling of annoyance. and hooray for fresh grapefruit & pineapple mimosas for $7... because quitting cold turkey isn't good for anyone.",

            "ambiance: 3 - the restaurant is huge with lots of seating. it is very well organized with a lot of space around every table. also, there is usually a good amount of tourists inside. the decor is kinda hardcore-the metal and bolts on the wall make it look rock n' roll, always a nice touch.\n\nservice: 2 - our server was funny and sweet. he was quick and attentive and got us what we wanted when we asked. there was only one problem, and it was a big pet peeve: the restaurant was not busy at all, and it really felt like he was rushing us. \n\nfirst, he came with the bill before we asked for it--which i thought was fine at first. maybe he was being considerate. but way, way before we were even done eating, he asked us if we needed boxes, and that really irritated me. \n\nlook, not everyone stuffs food down their throats and licks the plates clean like savages *cough* really hungry men *cough*. we were in and out in less than 40 minutes for a huge meal that we weren't even done eating! \n\nfood: 3 - i have been here a total of 3 times in the past six years, and i can say with certainty that the drinks are definitely a lot better than the food. that being said, the food also used to be a lot better than it is now. \n\nunfortunately for the food, when it was better, the drinks were still better! my favorite is the kiwi watermelon drink. and don't miss out on your twisted glass, it's a pretty nice glass! \n\ni have had both <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> and the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles. both were in huge portions. i mean huge. but the taste was skating a little above average. the flavors didn't mesh as well as they used to..let's just say it's not my favorite brunch place. i do come back for the drinks, so don't be too sad, it's not a total loss!", 
            "this place is nice. the wait is a little annoying, but we went downstairs to have some drinks during the waiting period. the service was great, i forgot our waitresses name, but she was so friendly, cracking jokes and all. i ordered the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, it was pretty big. it tasted delicious, the biscuit part was a little ry but it was alright because the gravy added moisture to it. i couldn't finish the whole thing, so i took it to-go. it definitely taste better when it's fresh out the kitchen. i am coming here again next time i visit vegas, i might get something else, or just come very hungry so i can attempt to eat the whole thing.", 
            "this place is always busy on the weekends, but worth the wait if its not extemly long.  the andys <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> dish is to die for(man vs food) ive had a few other dishes but that is my phenominal fav. if your hungry, you may be able to get thru it, if not youll have a whole other meal by taking it to go. sometimes my husband and i share. they have some signature drinks also, alittle pricy on some stuff but always huge portions, great presentation and flavors.", 
            "this place totally lives up to its hype.  big portions, reasonable prices, delicious food.  \n\nword of warning: even the kids' sized tractor-style breakfast is more than enough food for some adults.\n\ni loved the maple syrup glazed <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>.  had it in the chicken with waffes, as well as the chicken with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> (we ate their twice during our holiday).\n\nwe drove to this one instead of going to the one on the strip because this one seemed a lot quieter.  both times we went in around 10-11 am and were seated immediately.", 
            "i've been to this location twice. both times exceeded my expectations. i've learned the quickest way to get a seat, is to go to the bar. i probably shouldn't tell you that secret, but it's not like i go there everyday so, i'm fine with that. \n\nanyway, i had a scramble the first time i was there. their breakfast potatoes (crispy) are great. the eggs are the usual and i had sausage and spinach in my scramble. while i was eating i noticed this monstrosity of goodness going by me twice. i decided the next time i go here, i will eat this. \n\nit turns out, it was the dish that was featured on the man vs. food show. it's the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> with fresh spinach, <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs this thing is monstrous. i, being a big dude, was able to finish it all because my friend challenged me to do so (prick). i was also hungover and wanted something to soak up all the booze from the night before. \n\nthis thing was tasty and took quite a bit to eat. the only thing i would change, and which i will ask of next time i get this, is to have it with the crispy potatoes. i love <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, but for breakfast i prefer the crunchy hash potato browns.\n\nthe service was great. the bartender was very attentive. she got everything out quick, made a damn good iced coffee, and i didn't have to worry about going empty. \n\nanother cool thing, i saw dee snider, lead singer of twisted sister, at the restaurant. nice guy. didn't bother him for a picture, but i did shake his hand. \n\noverall, very good restaurant. definitely a fan. the only reason i gave one star is because it could be pricey. breakfast shouldn't be that expensive, but then again, the portions are hugggggeeeee.", 
            "it's so so good! \n\nhash house should hand out yoga pants at <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark>. a host should greet you and say, \"hi, welcome, our food is delicious and served in ridiculous portions so here are some stretchy pants to help you feel better about eating until you hate yourself!\" \n\nwe ordered the man vs. food benedict, the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> and red pepper skillet, the salmon sandwich and the artichoke, sun dried tomato hash. all of which were pure deliciousness! the benedict... unreal. it has <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, cheese, eggs, <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, a biscuit and it's smothered in a sauce you could bathe in. the strawberry jam that's served with the biscuits tastes so fresh and real. not smuckers jam, real grandma made it type jam. \n\nour service was pretty good but the it took almost 15 minutes to get our bill. the only negative thing i can say about the good is that the salmon sandwich needs a different bun, it's too much bread to sandwich ratio. \n\nwe will be back, with out stretchy pants on!", 
            "such good and plentiful food.......great wait staff. <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> is the best - two orders fed us three girls. we keep coming back time & time again", 
            "this was our first experience with hash house.  i had mixed feelings about trying the place...let me tell you i am very glad we decided to come here for dinner.\n\ni had the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles. let me tell you i am not a <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> fan by any means, i usually avoid it at all costs.  not this chicken.  it was moist, the crust was pleasantly crunch and it was not at all greasy. portions are more than generous, good for sharing if you have less than large appetite.", 
            "to get here is pretty damn ghetto. the plaza whatever the hotel is called is really ghetto,and downtown las vegas in general is ghetto but onto the food. the portions here are no joke. we had 4 people which each of us ordered something different. we had the meatloaf sandwich with mac & cheese, deep fried pork burger with sweet potato fries, <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles, and big ol chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>. the food is good definitely worth trying out if you're in vegas. we all had to get to go boxes because none of use finished our meal. this was our second option since the oyster bar's wait was literally gonna be 2-4 hours, but what a great choice we made.", 
            "awesome breakfast of <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles with crispy leeks and a blackberry bellini had me very happy.", 
            "went here after finding out the location at the rio was not open for dinner.  huh?\n\nanyway, i've seen this place featured on those food shows, so i knew i wanted to try it out now that they're in vegas.  it was around 7:30pm on a thursday night when we got here.  not very crowded at all, which was fine.\n\ni knew i wanted to get the mvf featured <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>.  it didn't disappoint.  it is ginormous!  it is also delicious.  i was afraid the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breast would be dry, but it is moist and flavorful.  the flavors work well with the rest of the giant mound of food on the plate.  \n\nget this and you won't be disappointed.  you'll have leftovers too.", 
            "arrived shortly after opening and was pleasantly greeted and seated!  \nour server was quick to greet us and help us with drinks and answer any questions. \nthe menu is very unique and varied.  i loved all the different choices of pancakes and <mark>French Toast</mark>.  i opted for the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> (normally <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> is my go to). it was huge (as mentioned in nearly all other reviews)!  it was delicious. i was pleasantly surprised with the small chipotle kick on the side of the plate and in the sauce. \nmy husband ordered the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash and he would recommend that too!", 
            "great food, great service! cappuccino and hot chocolate were great! the chicken and waffles was enough for two meals for me, and my husband had the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>! also delicious! staff was friendly and our server was really great! all th hash house restaurants have impressed us!", 
            "hh is a diner with a modern spin on farm style comfort food. the place is decorated with rivets and sheet metal with old school black and white family pictures. food portions are huge and lots of menu items with <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, biscuits, gravy, waffles and cornbeef hash. \n\nthe drink menu is really creative with a variation of lattes, tropical cocktails, and fruit drinks. the portions are huge and this place would be awesome for those mornings with a hangover.\n\nthe service is great, didn't have to wait more than 15 minutes to be seated with a party of 4 on sunday morning and waiter was attentive and informative. i definitely will be back!", 
            "hash house is the best breakfast place! this place is super close to my moms house and every time i'm in town we do one breakfast here. this time j got the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> which was recommended by our awesome waitress. \n\nthe meal was sooo delicious! the portion was massive and that is always expected but i sure do try to destroy as much of it as possible. the chipotle sauce is perfectly spicy and the chicken is so tender! the chicken is fried with a maple syrup glaze, wow so yummy! the only part i wasn't huge on is the cheese layer, it's too thick and oddly placed on the meal. i ended up removing it and setting it to the side. my friend however loved the cheese part.\n\nthe service here is always awesome and a lot faster than the one at the strip or in san diego! it's location away from the strip makes it a great choice when you don't wanna wait a long time!", 
            "i am a little ashamed to say that there is a very own hash house in my own city (quite possibly the original one?!) but haven't been until the one in vegas.\n\nto be honest, i was very overwhelmed by all the food, i really had to think about which tasty meal would service my fast-buds. i believe i ordered something along the lines of eggs benedict with chicken, and oh my was it good!!! these people are not kidding when the day the portions are large. this is easily splittable! just berthing about this fish was amazing. the first layer is delicious <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> followed by the eggs benedict and some amazingly tender <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>. plus, gravy and i think tomatoes? i don't even know what the heck was entirely in it but it was so good! i think it's very reasonably priced considering all you get. wow.",

            "straight up. the most american place that i have eaten at in vegas. bacon. beer. alcohol. huge portions. chicken. waffles. bacon in waffles. pancakes. burgers. and so much more. oh and did i mention, these portions a freakin' huge.\n\nmy friends and i came here for breakfast after a long drive from the bay area. we knew we needed a big breakfast to give us some energy for the day and for edc.\n\nwe arrived around 9:45am or so and was promptly seated. the place was already super packed. as we walked by the tables, i took a peek at what other people were eating and wow. i don't know how people can finish an entire portion. (maybe this is why america is so fat...although...the food was bomb).\n\nmy girlfriend and i shared the signature <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles ($18). if you look at the pictures, you can see that the plate comes with two large pieces of <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, 4-6 pieces of bacon infused waffles and a lot of onions and sage. i was pleasantly surprised. everything tasted really good. the chicken was soft and tender on the inside and the bacon/waffle combination was amazing. forreal though, it was more than enough food for 2 people. one of my friends, did however, finished his entire meal...\n\nour server was amazing. he kept coming back to check up on us and made sure we were good. he encouraged me to eat my greens as well!! \n\noverall, great food, huge portions, great to split! come if you're on a date or hungry enough to eat for 2!",

            "if you have managed to starve yourself for a month and looking for a place to fill you up this is the place. their portions are not for the dieters. ordered the chicken and waffles and it was massive. my friends ordered their meals and none of them can finish. a returns ordered <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> and i could have written it as a hat. and my head is pretty big. the waffles came with maple syrup on the side which i didn't need with two large breast cut breaded chicken. the waffles was good but to soft for my liking. i like a little crunchiness in my waffles. the the chicken was really good. considering it was breast it was very moist and the bragging had some sage seasoning which just elevated it. it's the best <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & Waffles</mark> i've had. the place itself was pretty cool. it has a unique interior. somewhat rustic. it was a good way to start our day of drinking.", 
            "had an amazing time here with my family for our sons birthday! everything was amazing , food portions are huge! big enough to share. i loved my <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>! my youngest son had a huge  blueberry pancake off the kids menu. every dish here is over the top and well worth every penny. this was our first time here and my family from california enjoyed every bit of our dining experience. this is a family place that i will recommend to everyone visiting and our new local favorite.", 
            "this was my third time visiting hash house and the 3rd location i've seen. this particular location was off the strip and the outside looks similar to the one i went to near san diego. since there is one directly on the strip in a casino, this location appears to be frequented by more locals instead and less obnoxiously crowded. no need to wait over an hour or so for a table which means we were in and out of there before trekking back to phoenix in 40 minutes total!\n\nthe service was awesome and quick! we especially loved our waitress izzy! the waiters and waitresses were on top of \"question and answer\" sessions with newcomers. although there was only my hubs and i at our table, there was a group of 8 next to us with one cranky customer. despite the customer being unreasonable, their waiter handled the situation with such finesse and ease that it really wasn't such a problem anymore. whew! mini crisis averted!\n\nour food was predictably good. i ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with bacon stuffed waffles while bry ordered the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash skillet. from the pictures i uploaded, one could tell that these dishes were mighty and grand in stature and had the flavor to match! anyone who's \"hangry\" can appreciate how this food can quickly cure and almost overwhelm what you thought would be an insatiable hunger. bravo hash for you consistency is pleasing your customers on multiple levels! and bravo on the awesome bloody mary variations and even classic bloody mary!", 
            "i live in southern california and have been meaning to try the hash house in san diego, but i never had the opportunity.  when i arrived in vegas, i realized that there are a handful of these around, so i had to try it.  i of course got the chicken and waffles.  when my food came out, i was wowed by the presentation.  looks totally amazing and over the top.\n\nfirst bites of <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and fried leeks were very tasty.  the first quadrant of the waffle was also pretty good.  but then, it just got overwhelming.  the chicken is unevenly cut, so certain parts of the chicken were overcooked, the center was good, but obviously not as crispy.  the waffles were on the soggier side - i like my waffles crunchy.  the batter was a little too chewy for my taste as well.  and the syrup was just decent.  a nice pat of butter would have helped.  personally, my favorite part of the dish was the fried leeks.\n\ncoming from southern california, of course i have had some great chicken and waffles - roscoe's, hello!  roscoe's blows hash house out of the water in terms of the chicken and waffles as separate entities and as an entire well constructed dish as a whole.  i only ate one piece of <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and two squares of the waffle, not because i was full, but because it was just so overwhelming.  the chicken and waffle both sogged up a little too fast and i decided that it would taste pretty similarly if re-heated in the microwave the next day (i was right).  i actually went home and ate a second dinner because this meal left much to be desired.\n\n+1 star for novelty, +1 for huge portions, +1 for the fried leeks.", 
            "first off let me just say the portions here are huge!! me and my girlfriend probably should've shared one, but we didn't know what we were in for. \n\nthe restaurant has a classic vibe to it, and the service was nice okay, they didn't refill our drinks, until we flagged the waitress down and asked for refills.\n\nthe food here is good, unhealthy... but very tasty lol. the start you off with honey biscuits that are really good, but in my opinion too big.\n\nfor the entree i got the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash and my girlfriend got the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash was good! but be prepared for a mountain of potatoes on the side. i liked the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> more, it was soooo good.\n\nall in all large quantity of comfort style food for very reasonable prices, definitely recommend trying this place out", 
            "the waffles and <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>.... yum! \n\nmy wife ordered the waffles and chicken, i had the pancakes. while the pancake (singular) was impressive, there is only so much pancake i can eat in one sitting. \n\nthe waffles and chicken was very good. the waffles had thick cut bacon cooked into it and literally a mountain of food. the waiter told my wife good luck as he dropped it off and i could only roll my eyes as i knew it was on. four waffles and 2 pieces of chicken which next time we are going to split.\n\nthis location was absolutely packed with a short waiting list which was worth it. we'll be back!", 
            "better be ready to eat coming to this place i had the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict and it was wonderful but the helpings are so big you can feed an army of men", 
            "amazingly awesome service, food quality, food quantity, and prices!  the hash was fantastic and fresh made.  the pumpkin flapjacks was not to sweet but just right.  it didn't even need the butter or syrup.  and the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> was off the charts!  the chipotle sauce had a nice heat to it.  just perfect with the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, chicken, spinach, tomato, biscuit, and egg.  excellent!", 
            "tons of great food! be prepared to share or take a lot home. the pumpkin flapjack was delicious. the corn beef hash was very good and included potatoes and eggs. but don't skip the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. the tower of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, biscuits, <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, tomato, spinach, and bacon is smothered with a nicely spiced chipotle cream sauce. over all a lot of food for a very reasonable price. definitely on our list of places to stop at when in las vegas. and since they have a location off the strip, it is a place to stop when passing through lv.", 
            "this is one of my favorite restaurants in las vegas. their food is comical proportions and ridiculously tasty. i recommend the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles. their drinks are pricey but amazing as well, the bloody mary comes with bacon and mini toast!", 
            "food quality is 3 stars, but serving size/service bumps it up a star.\n\nthe portions here are massive.  each dish can easily feed 2-3 people.  in terms of price, you can't beat it.  quality of food is ok.\n\n<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles - $15 - decent/average 3.5/5\nthe <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was pretty good.  had good texture & flavor.  the waffles on the other hand sucked.  they were kind of soft/soggy.  i prefer my waffles to be hard/crispy.  dipping sauce is ok.  huge portions as well.\n\nchicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> - $15 - decent/average 3/5\nthe chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> was massive.  it's pretty much a bucket of chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>; the serving size is easily big enough for 4-5 people to share this thing.  its served on a \"bread bowl\", which is very reminiscent of a bread hat;  this bread had wasn't that good and tasted like a graham cracker (which does not go well w/ the soup).  anyway, the dish itself is ok but i got bored eating it after a few minutes.  i mean, who can eat a bucket of chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>?\n\n\ntips\n-portions are massive.  each dish can feed 2-3 people easily.", 
            "my ultimate favorite is the waffles but i tried the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and loved it.  everything i have had was cooked to perfection.", 
            "great food. everything is enormous. the presentation is top notch. \n\nwe went on a wednesday at 8:45 am and there was no crowd, no wait. i hear it gets pretty busy though.\n\nwe had oatmeal and the chicken and waffles. the oatmeal was a huge bowl, buried in fresh, yummy fruit. i was nervous to try the chicken and waffles because, well, those aren't supposed to go together. i was further put off by the fact that they make them with sage and leeks here (like wtf? how does that go with maple?!). but it did. it was soooo did. \n\n<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles with leeks and bacon: a+++\n\nin sum:\n1. if you're in vegas, come here for breakfast.\n2. share. this is far too much food. seriously.\n3. if you think the chicken and waffles sound gross, keep an open mind and get them anyway. yolo.", 
            "a mvf stop you must take. great food at a great price. try the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>. delicious. worth the trip from the strip.", 
            "omg!!! this place has to have the biggest food i've ever seen. we went with friends from oklahoma and they told us we won't finish our food, to which i was very sceptical as i always finish my food... well.... out came my \"small\" meal as i wasn't overly hungry and wow was it big...\n  the staff at hhagg were excellent, very friendly and the service was quick. i would recommend to anyone to try the challenge of finishing their meal.. especially if you get the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & Waffles</mark>... they were huuuge...", 
            "<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles with fried leeks was amazing!!! if you want a boss breakfast that's super tasty and portions are awesome sized. my new favorite breakfast spot", 
            "i stopped in for an early lunch. the service was good. they did just remove coke from their menu and now only have pepsi products. i had the mushroom swiss burger. it was cooked well and had a great texture, but the beef lacked seasoning. i got a side of fries with it and they were awesome. some of the best fries i have had in vegas.\n\ncome hungry as the servings are huge. breakfast, lunch and dinner are all good here. the pancakes are the largest i have ever seen and the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & Waffles</mark>... you have to see to believe.", 
            "came here for dinner on our last night in vegas and mannnnnnn was it a dinner to remember. we were seated in this big ass table at the back (there were 7 of us). we went straight to order after studying the menu online before coming! lol. yes i came prepared. we were told about the portion after i order their famous <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with waffles ($18.99) and man vs food favorite, <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> ($15.99). i told her i'm hungry and hey, i'll have the leftovers for breakfast tmr! win-win! \n\nour table also got the crispy polenta with melted brie and grilled portobello mushroom and they hash house salad and chocolate chip pancakes! not forgetting the pretty kiwi watermelon lemonade! \n\nfood came and true to their words, they stared off with a huge plate of giant biscuits. it was really good! super soft. but please don't get carried away eating them coz when your delicious giant plates of food come, you might not be able to devour and enjoy it with a stomach full of biscuits. i learnt the hard way. went back later that night and finished my leftovers! lol! what breakfast? \n\nfood was delicious by the way. for the price, totally worth every.single.bite.", 
            "this place has the best pancakes i have ever tasted. the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> is really good but the sauce maybe a little hot for some. corn beef hash was very tender with excellent favor not washed out like some corn beef hash. service was excellent. popular place might be a little wait. be prepared to take lots of food home they have big portions."

            "one night of pure vegas partying and you will be screaming for a grade a brunch that will cure you of any sinful activities you've endured the night before. \nthis place is it and will provide you the absolute best brunch in town. \ntheir proportions are ginormous no matter what you order so if you come with a friend, plan to split the plate or you'll be walking around the casinos with a handful <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> bags.\ni ordered the <mark>HH Original</mark> benedict which was one of m<mark>Two Egg Breakfast Any Style</mark> of benedict they offered on their menu. the red pepper cream sauce was a sensational twist to a brunch time classic while underneath was a heavenly pile of country style biscuits, fresh spinach, tomato, and crispy bacon. they definitely did not skimp out on anything. \nthe service was friendly and attentive and overall a great experience. \nand though i mainly rate restaurants based on service and quality of food,  if you are going for the environment, you will most certainly be puzzled. this place is definitely confused on whether it wants to be a diner or a mod/urban themed restaurant. the music was laughable, jumping from 80's synth pop to 90's rock ballads to early techno and somewhat distracting.\n\ni truly would have given this place 4 stars but there was one minor detail about the menu that left me a little bit disappointed... while they had an extensive brunch menu that was served through lunch, if you do not make it to sit down before they change their breakfast menu, all of their breakfast items are served with scrambled eggs only and the chefs will not cater to your preference of any other style eggs. that's right, if you are drooling over all those eggs benedict specialties, you will be served your biscuits with scrambled instead of poached how it's supposed to be. bad move, hh, but great creativity with the other items on your menu.", 
            "this review is for the restaurant as a whole and not specifically this location. my friends and i were in town for a birthday and on the way back to california, we decided to stop by at the hash house a gogo that was at the m resort. i've always wanted to try this place due to the fact that i'm an avid man vs. food watcher. \n\nthe food: the portions are fairly big so i would recommend sharing unless you've got a big appetite and know you are able to consume that much food. i sure wish i had shared my dish with some else. \nwhat we ordered (all very good dishes btw cause we tried each others dish): \n - farm benedict: <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> w/ fresh asparagus, sundried tomatoes, chili cream and two basted eggs\n - the basic: <mark>Two Egg Breakfast Any Style</mark>, potatoes, fruit and biscuit (add bacon, sausage or ham)\n - <mark>French Toast</mark>: griddled <mark>French Toast</mark> dipped in banana cinnamon cream w/ pecan maple syrup\n - <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> & biscuit \n - famous one pound stuffed burger: <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, avocado & cheddar\n\ni thought that the food was pretty rich in the sauces and quite heavy. i'm not much of a breakfast eater but i did enjoy my meal here. although i did have to take a good amount of it to go. \n\nprices: each dish is about 15 dollars ( unless you get the basic breakfast/brunch dishes, which are about 9 dollars) it isn't too bad as compared to the rest of the prices from restaurants on the strip in vegas.  \n\nservice: i have to rate the service at the m resort location to be a 2.5. our server/waiter was one of those who you could just tell hated his job and as a result it showed in his performance and the service that was provide to my party of 8 was not that great. he even dropped a fork on my friend as he was clearing the table and said \"shit man i'm sorry\" in my opinion, that is very unprofessional. from my work experience i know the importance of excellent customer service and i definitely did not feel it here. but the food was pretty good and i was in good company so i was willing to over look that slight annoyance \n\noverall. i recommend you all to try it at least once. :) check out the photos i posted too to see the dishes that my table ordered!", 
            "as my friend pre-warned me, the best bang-for-your-buck food situation that i've experienced in a long time.\n\ni was warned that the portions were huge, and this was accurate. we sat in the bar area which had a tv and was separated from some larger groups in the main dining room.  as you can see if you check the menu, they have a wide variety of breakfast/brunch/lunch/dinner options. as it was just barely noon, i was expecting to go for a burger or something, but i was swayed by the lure of some legitimate <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash.  the \"hash\" options seem to be one of their signature items, as per their name. i went with the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> which had, obviously, some deliciously prepared <mark>Corned Beef</mark> (like, not chopped up pre-packaged frozen stuff - it was as if it had been slow-prepared that day), swiss cheese, red onions (but not too much). the kicker is that it was served over a large amount of delicious oven-fried potato chunks rather than standard hash browns, all in a large square skillet (see picture).  oh, and it also came with 2 eggs <mark>Two Egg Breakfast Any Style</mark>, a buttermilk biscuit, and a couple fruit garnishes.  that all was around $13 i think, which might seem like a lot but as i said, it was outrageously proportioned. i didn't even touch the biscuit or the fruit, and it was still very filling.  the taste was great, and i'd recommend it to anyone."
