            "we are currently obsessed with bobby flays (and rick bayless') cooking.  everything he makes on food network always looks amazing.  the few recipes of his i've made have come out great,  the same cannot be said of other food tv chefs... i'm looking at you giada!    \n\nwe've been to mesa grill twice, the first time we were simply floored by the flavors.  the lamb tenderloin salad was great, the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> was amazing and the shrimp perfectly cooked.  the duck pancake had a smoky flavor and that combination of sweet and savory.\n\non our most trip, we again enjoyed the tamale.  we also had the <mark>Fresh Tomato Soup</mark> which was really good and lots of flavor from the fresh tomaotes and cilantro.   i had the chicken quesadilla, which was a boring but still delicious choice.  my wife ordered the buffalo burger, it was relatively lean, but still juicy and had a great natural flavor.   i can't wait to try bar american in nyc.", 
            "we made a reservation for 7pm on a tuesday night.  they require a credit card for any reservation.  no big deal. do it and it will save you a lot of time.  i am a gluten free girl and let me say i was able to select about 90 percent of menu items!!  there is something to be said about high quality fresh food :). \n\nbetween the four in our party we each ordered something different and had a variety of options.  the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> was excellent and i highly recommend it. my hubby had the tortilla soup, it was more like a <mark>Fresh Tomato Soup</mark> however it was full of flavor with a traditional bobby flay kick at the end.  my friend had the bbq duck taco and loved it.  for drinks the ladies had fresh margaritas, i loved the selection of tequilas as the had my favorite available gran centenario blanco.  the gents had beer of course ipa and loved it.  \n\nmain courses included the 20 oz rib eye, which was plenty to share.  score!!  it was cooked to perfection and had a couple of sauces that accompanied it.  the cioppino was served with what taste like cilantro lime base a huge prawn and cooked to perfection scallop, along with halibut, mussels, and clams.  the portion sizes are perfect. i could not finish my soup after stealing some rib eye and twice baked potato.  over all we completely enjoyed our dinner. the staff was fantastic and accommodated my gluten allergy which exceeded my expectations!!  great job bobby, the only negative was that bobby was not there the night we visited :( but apparently was due anytime for a visit so we were hopeful. :) next time bobby, next time!!!!", 
            "really enjoyed this southwestern restaurant. started with 2 appetizers that were shared, <mark>Fresh Tomato Soup</mark> with grilled corn and one with grilled shrimp in tomatillo sauce. shared the pork tenderloin with 8 rubbed spices, extremely tender and flavorful.  side of grilled sweet corn off the cob with a cream mixed in that was yummy!  dessert was churros dusted with anise with a dark chocolate dipping sauce and a coconut dipping sauce. great way to end the meal! definitely recommend this restaurant!", 
            "mesa grill, what a fabulous environment located in busy caesars palace. it's was busy but reservations got us right in no problem. server was great and they all help each other so your drink never sees the bottom of glass. \n\nmy wife started off with a bowl of their famous <mark>Fresh Tomato Soup</mark>, i can't stand tomatoes but this was like a cooked salsa. it was surprisingly tasty. i ordered the roasted corn chowder which was offered for a limited time and let me tell you it was out of this world. next up was their famous <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, i almost licked the plate clean.\n\nfor our entrees, my wife went with the chicken & black bean quesadillas. those were crazy good. i went with their famous spice rubbed pork tenderloin, it did not disappoint. cooked perfect with a spicy bbq sauce drizzled over it. i've had it before but tonight's was amazing. i highly recommend the side of corn & jalape\\u00f1o that might just be the best thing in their menu."

            "visited with a group of 7. \n\nvisited mesa grill 7/7/06 at 9pm. it was a weeknight.\n\nfood: 4 stars\ndecor: 5 stars very trendy, cow hide chairs. casual vibe.\nservice: 5 stars they were attentive and removed plates properly. when my bf didnt touch his entree they noticed and took it off.\ncost: 4 stars. way pricey yo.  \n\nordered:\n<mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark>\nwith her own special dressing + crispy tortillas\n12. this was good, but hell, i can get this anywhere\nspicy tuna tartare\nwith blistered serrano chile hot sauce + avocado relish\n14. one of the best  ive ever had. this one was demolished in 3 minutes, fer serious.\nnew mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin\nwith bourbon-ancho chile sauce + sweet potato tamale with crushed pecan butter\n31. this was my dish. good portions. love love love the tamale. it was sweet and moist. \nyellow corn crusted chile relleno\nfilled with wild mushrooms + goat cheese\n+ served with a salad of grilled vegetables with white truffle oil\n23. this was instantly rejected by my bf and he loves chile rellenos.\n<mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark>-$7  these were tasty enough but $7\nsquash blossoms- deepfried and gooood. only came with 2 or 3 not enough to share.\nquesadilla- overly cheesie. strangely sub par.\n\npros: the sweet potato tamale. great pork tenderloin, tuna tartare\n\ncons: pricey, not many veggie options.\n\noverall: we couldnt wait to return. i dream about these tamales at night.", 
            "i had the most random experience here, but i really liked it.  the decor is really bright, colorful, and fun but in a sophisticated way.  the bottle of wine my boyfriend and i shared was moderately priced and delicious.  the goat cheese fundido was large and yummy, and was a nice change from the usual \"queso\" you can get at texmex restaurants.  and the halibut we shared was large and spicy with really great, complex flavors.  the <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark> was meh- small with typical ingredients and flavors.  i wouldn't get this here, get something more exotic.  the ceviche trio looked amazing, fyi.  overall, the meal was a great success and i would go back in a heartbeat.\n\nthe odd thing were the tables around us, which prevented us from getting really good service.  the table to our right waited thirty minutes for their appetizer to be delivered, were angry, and were comped on the dish.  the table to our left were hicks (seriously) and were demanding, loud and obnoxious.  the worst part is that they were convinced they had *jizz* on their beer glass and were making a big scene about it.  the manager tried to explain to them that the lime on the side of the glass was dripping down and created the liquid on the glass, to which the wife said, \"no thats not lime, i'm a mother\" (wtf?) and the husband yelled, \"if you think it's lime, then lick it!\"  they were given a new beer, and the husband once again complained there was jizz on the glass.  and yes, i mean jizz.  so retarded.  i thought our server (who was their server as well) handled the situation very calmly and rationally, but it was very distracting (and funny, i'll admit, i was laughing my a** off listening to them).\n\nwith all the drama, we saw our waiter very rarely, hence the one star reduction (along with the unmemorable <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark>).  however, in any other circumstance i'm sure he would have been better.  and the busboys made up for our server, as they refilled my flipping camel of a boyfriend's glass at least twelve times.  \n\nthat couple to our left though... man, i thought la had all the crazy people.", 
            "i love the persona that is bobby flay, so i had high expectations going into mesa grill.\n\nthe bread basket with the variety of carbs - corn muffins, some type of raisin bread and jalapeno bread paired well with my <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark>.\n\nfor starters, we had the <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark> (named after his daughter) and the black bean soup.  the black bean soup was amazing.  it was perfectly spiced and delicious.\n\ni had the jerk chicken taquitos.  i was disappointed that they were not rolled tortillas stuffed with jamaican jerk flavored chicken and cabbage slaw.  it turned out to be a half chicken served on the side of a mini puffy tortilla topped with slaw.\n\nmy partner in food had the smoked chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> topped with poached eggs.  it was a nice mix of flavors and textures.  i wish that i had ordered that instead.\n\nthe dessert was not very memorable.  we ate there a few days ago and neither one of us can remember what we had.\n\nthe server that we had was either new or really didn't care because he didnt describe anything in detail and i felt like we were bothering him when we needed anything.\n\nif bobby had been there cooking, i'm sure that everything would have been totally better.  since he wasn't.. everything was just okay.", 
            "i have been wanting to try mesa grill for a while now and finally had the chance to do so over fourth of july weekend.\n\nwe didn't have a reservation and had to wait about an hour for a table but they took us in right away for bar seating, where you are served full menu.\n\nwe shared <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark>, wild mushroom quesadilla, 22 oz bone-in rib-eye and a side of cilantro mashed potato.  everything was sooo good.  <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark> was ok but i could have done without.  mushroom quesadilla was really good, very earthy and had great sauce to go with it.  the highlight of the night was the ribeye.  cooked perfectly medium rare, juicy and i just could not get enough of the red and green chile sauce that came with it.   mesa's food is very flavorful and has lot of depths to each dish.\n\ncocktails were also really good.  and on top that, sitting at the bar, the bartender gave us taste of other left over cocktails from other patrons....yay!\n\nlastly, we ordered blackberry-mango crostada, which was heavenly.  my husband, who normally lets me eat most of the dessert was so impressed by it that i had to fight to get my share of the dessert.\n\noverall, mesa grill met my long awaited expectation and delivered even more.  will definitely come back.", 
            "we went there for brunch on a sat. the flavors were exceptional. we started with the goat cheese fundido. we had as our entrees the grilled lamb <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark> and shrimp tacos with 3 different sauces. \nthe service was good. we would go back for dinner.", 
            "my husband and i cant say nothing but good things about this place. we went to mesa grill in vegas for dinner on our honeymoon. \n\nwe both started off with <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark>, which was very good. he then chose the new mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin which was to die for!! he had never tasted pork tenderloin so good in his life!! i had the 16 spice crusted chicken. that was good too! then for dessert we had the chocolate corn bread pudding which when it came out, it was not what i was expecting ... but, again, very good!!! i would go back to mesa grill to eat again.", 
            "this place was really good. i read mixed reviews and was nervous to give it a shot. i came for appetizers and liked it so much we came back for dinner the next night. the restaurant is very colorful, in my opinion a little bit cheesy, but appropriate for southwestern restaurant. the food was great! we had:\n\n<mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark> - amazing! very simple but bursting with flavor and crunch. i ordered it on both visits. \ntiger shrimp and <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>- excellent! came with jumbo size prawns and a heavenly corn sauce. each bite was heaven!\nspicy tuna and salmon tartares - this was good, but it was exactly what you would expect of a tartar. it wasn't bad by any means, but many of the other dishes overshined this standard plate.\ngrilled lamb poerterhouse- tasty and huge but i like my lamb a little more muted in flavor. my hubby loved it though.\nblue corn crusted halibut - this was my entree. it was delicious!!! the corn crust added a new texture to the juicy tender halibut. the tomoatoe oragano gave a great kick with it's spiciness. halibut needs big flavors and this dish definatley reflected that. \nnew mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin- really flavor full and not dry at all.\nchorizo-goat cheese tamale - i wanted this to be good, but it was very bland skip. this worked better in theory. \n\nall in all we had a wonderful time at bobby flay's restaurant. the service was excellent, the flavors did not disappoint. while this was a spendy restaurant there are much more expensive restaurants on the strip. i would go back.", 
            "surprisingly good for a tourist trap. we popped in for lunch with no reservations and took advantage of a special anniversary special...three courses for $25. considering all the meals we have had in vegas, this was a relative bargain. standouts included <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark>, the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark>, bbq <mark>Barbecued Lamb Cobb Salad</mark>, and steak sandwich. all of these dishes shared bobby flay's signature sensibilities...a bit of heat, a touch of sweetness, maybe a bit of tang, and a mixture of textures. while service was attentive and efficient, we felt somewhat rushed. and while we found lunch to be a bargain at these prices, i don't know if i would feel the same way about these entrees at the much higher dinner prices. nevertheless, mesa grill was a pleasant surprise.", 
            "upon entering the restaurant, one of the men in our group of eight was asked to remove his fedora hat. they said that it was a hotel policy that hats are not allowed in the dining room of the restuarants, yet we also dined in rao's and 9 and people wore hats in both dining rooms. \nwe sat near the kitchen, and a man in a sweatshirt and knit ski cap leaned against the kitchen window throughout our entire meal. when we asked why he could wear a hat, the manager said that hats were allowed in the lounge. if they are going to implement a dress code they should start with shorts and sweatshirts, and make their guests aware of the policy.\nas far as the food, they were out of three dishes and had no specials. i ended up ordering sophies <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark> which should be on the kids menu, it was mostly cheese cubes, tortilla chips and garbanzo beans. for dinner i ordered a coffee rubbed filet, which was so spicy, i went through a tube of tums while out after dinner. the shrimp in the tamale appetizer was good.\nthe margaritas were too sweet. the margaritas at dos caminos in palazzo are much better.", 
            "i hate bobby flay. but i loved mesa grill. \n\nthough i love new york and all its braggadocio, i feel that the food network's brooklyn boy, bobby flay, takes pretentious to a new level, and it's not amusing. i'm completely annoyed by his show throwdown, where he challenges local food legends and presumes to make their dishes better than they do. i'm fully aware that the man has had 9 restaurants, 9 cookbooks, and 8 total tv shows, but there's something about him that i just don't like. plus, he's a ginger. (just kidding, i actually love red-heads!)\n\nbut mesa grill? soooooooo good! r. r. and i sat at the bar for dinner and enjoyed every minute. i had the black bean soup with cumin crema and three relishes, and really, i would bathe in that soup it's so good! i had my face in the bowl and was licking it clean when r.r. gently reminded me that we were in public and ladies generally try not to eat like wildebeests. my bad. <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark> was good, but nothing special. r.r. made some good choices as well - be sure check out the rough-cut tuna \"nachos\" and the shrimp and <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>. and the bartenders were awesome; one mixed us a free taste of his special \"red bull mojito\" - yummy! \n\nso while i'm glad to have checked out mesa grill because the food was incredible, i only wish that my hard-earned money were going to someone other than douchebag flay.", 
            "stumbled upon this place while in vegas, wandering aimlessly through the casino.  we thought \"hmmm...bobby flay?  ok i guess we will check it out.\"  \n\nat the time, we did consider the fact that neither my companion nor myself particularly cared for bobby flay, but we ignored that fact because, hey, he must be famous for a reason...his charm can get him only so far.  perhaps the man can cook.  plus, we were in the mood for mexican-like food.\n\nlesson learned: go with your first instinct.\n\nwe were there for brunch, and my date got a <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> which was small but presented very nicely.  the flavor was just ok and the burger itself was mediocre, but the grilled onion and horseradish mustard on the burger were very tasty.  <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark> were a bit firey and a little on the greasy side, but were an ok complement to an ok burger.\n\ni ordered <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark> and asked the waiter to give me a quick run-down of the veggies in it.  however, when it came, i found out that it had olives, which he failed to mention.  because the olive-flavor was so overpowering (and i dislike olives), i had to send it back.  my date dug into his sandwich, and my replacement salad did not come until he was nearly done the meal.  check minus on service.  \n\ni wouldn't be upset about the delay-time in getting my meal had this been my fault...however when you put something like olives (same goes for mushrooms or onions) in a <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark> and the diner inquires , you should be sure to remember to list the components that have strong or polarizing flavors.  he may have just forgotten but it was not busy at that hour, so i was a bit ticked (and hungry).\n\nside note - the bread basket had some decent items.  the blue corn cornbread muffins were really dry, the jalapeno bites were hit-or-miss on the \"heat\" factor depending on which you ate (perhaps some were mild and others spicy?), and the mini breakfast pastries were very good on sweetness and consistency.  stick to those for your pre-brunch-calorie-consumption.  \n\nthe only redeeming part of the meal were the cocktails.  i had a tequila/fresca cocktail that was light, refreshing, and not too sweet. it was delicious.  my date had a margarita which he claimed to be one of the best he's had...don't know how helpful that is, though, as he's generally not a margarita-guy.\n\noverall, food was mediocre at the high points and awful at the low points, service was spotty, drinks were great.  i would say i expected more from bobby flay, but as i said above, he was just never really my style, so what i really expected was mediocre - and it delivered just that.  expectations met.", 
            "this is the first time that i have been to mesa grill.  i have been to bar americain in new york city so i already somewhat knew to expect at a bobby flay restaurant.  my dinner when i went to bar americain was exceptional and i was expecting the same at mesa grill, but i think that my expectations were a little high.  \n\nwhat we ordered between the two of us:\n- <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>\n- <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark>\n- <mark>Mesa Burger</mark>\n- <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark>\n- buttermilk pineapple upside down cake\n- chocolate chip strawberry shortcake (dessert of the day)\n\npositives....\n- the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> was amazing.  by far my favorite thing that i have had at a bobby flay restaurant.  the shrimp was almost undercooked but was done enough to eat.  the filling of the tamale was sweet and there was an under tone of flay's famous heat in the sauces.  the corn-cilantro cream sauce was perfect to accent the tamale.\n- you could taste the quality of the meat of the burger.  it was exceptional and cooked perfectly.  you can hardly get your mouth around it because it is so large!  \n- the cake itself in the pineapple upside down cake was moist and delicious.\n- as always, the fries and flay's restaurants are great!  we had the <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark> with our meals and then were spicy but good!\n\nnegatives:\n- first off the server was an absolute snob so we got unlucky there.  i would have given this post 4 stars but took one away because of the server.  \n- the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> was served with the meat freezing cold.  i was very surprised by this.  the sandwich would have been much better if the meat wasn't cold.\n- when our server brought flay's \"famous\" bread basket to our table there were only two cold muffins in it that were clearly left from the night before.  one of my favorite parts of my flay meal in the past was the variety of breads in the basket.  the tables around us got a variety like i expected to get.  i attribute this to our sucky server.\n\noverall the meal was a positive one but i don't know if i will be back to mesa grill in the future but i definitely recommend the restaurant to any bobby flay fans that would like to experience his southwestern flavors.", 
            "so we had to come back and have a lunch at mesa!  i had a <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark> and my husband was totally thrilled over his choice...spicy chicken & <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>!  he wouldn't shut up about it, haha!  i did try it and it was absolutely wonderful.  \n\non our way out, we over heard the hostess talking about bobby flay being there!!  i asked if he was still here, and she said he just left pretty much right right after we came in.  just our luck....next time bobby flay, next time!", 
            "wow, i am truly impressed!  \n\nwearing bobby flay's name, i thought this restaurant would be all celebrity chef hype with no delivery, but i am so happy to say that i was wrong!  \n\nhad dinner here the last time i was in vegas, and everything that i ordered was wonderful!  i started out with the <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark>, which was full of flavor and very fresh.  my only complaint was the amount of cheese added to the salad, but luckily it was in larger cubes, so the excess was easy to pick out. \n\nfor my entree, i selected the hacked chicken.  mole is very difficult to do right, so i was kind of worried about this one.  the chicken was so tender and juicy and the mole sauce was prepared perfectly, and it was used sparingly, so it didn't over power the other flavors on the plate.  \n\nthoroughly impressed!  can't wait for my next stop in vegas and my next stop at mesa grill!", 
            "ok, we admit it... we have a ridiculous foodie crush on chef bobby flay!  we have been to almost every restaurant he has, including completing the trifecta of mesa grills... new york, vegas (at caesar's palace across from pure) and the bahamas (at the cove, at the atlantis in paradise island).  mesa offers lunch and dinner, as well as brunch on saturdays and sundays. the food is spicy, inventive and excellent!\n\nfor dinner, start off with the shrimp and <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, the blue corn pancake with bbq duck and the <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark> (with chick peas, olives and tortillas).  famous for southwestern cuisine and grilling, be ready for some spicy meat!  the new mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin with a sweet potato tamale and crushed pecan butter.... damn! the grilled lamb porterhouse chops with red chile, lime and rosemary, with green corn pudding.... whew... sexy!  blue corn soft shell crabs with bacon, green onion and chile vinegar... i could go on and on.\n\nif you can make it for brunch... please do!  i think it may be better than dinner.  first off, a ridiculously amazing bread basket- my favorite is the spicy, corn muffins with pieces of corn in it and swirls of spice.  for your entree, definitely have the spicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> with poached eggs and green chile hollandaise.  i can not even explain how good this is.  sort of like a <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> benedict with chicken and sweet potato <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark>.  some one always orders the eggs and aged sirloin tortilla with roasted peppers and avocado relish... and loves it!  it is simple, but delish... think make your own tacos with steak and eggs.\n\nno matter what meal you eat, the tequila cocktails are the perfect accompaniment.    hands down, the cactus pear margarita wins it!  watch out boys... its pink!\n\nthe scene- always full... full of foodies!  lively!  \n\nfood and drinks- 5: mind blowing and life changing.  \n\ntip worthy- 5: the new yorker 25-30%.  excellent service... 3 to 4 servers at a time... one water, one bread, busy boy and waiter... without being the least bit stuffy.\n\ncoordinates- 4: neighborhood- centrally located! \n\nrestaurant return rate- green light!  between the three mesa's, we have had at least 10 meals.  we bring everyone we know when there is one close by.  \n\nthis review written by angela.", 
            "dad and i are going to be in vegas at the same time. music to my ears. not exactly what you were expecting me say, right? let me explain why, \"oh yes dad, i'll be checking in every day, right around dinner time! would i like to meet you at bobby flays mesa grill, twist my arm\" hello free meals in vegas, i have to take what i can get! \n\nwhere do i start? maybe ill start by saying it was amazing! we were lucky enough to walk in without a reservation, only because it was 4pm. when we left around 7pm i am guessing we wouldn't have stood a chance coming in with out one at that time because the place was packed. we started with the southwestern and <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark>. all three were so good, i kept wanting to eat my dads and step moms too. our waiter must have though i lacked table manners because the whole time i was sticking my fork into my parents plates, but i couldn't help it! everything was so good! the bread, oh the bread! so yummy! everything here has this south western flare to it even the breads. one bread had jalapenos and cheese in it, a match made in heaven. there were little corn muffins too and assorted breads all fantastic as well. i ordered a fish dish and of course it was nothing short of spectacular. my favorite was the pork tenderloin and sweet potato tamales that that my step mom had ordered, they were to die for. the meat was falling off the bone! \n\nthis was possibly the best service ever, hands down! they wait on you hand and foot. it seemed like we had a server and about two bussers per table. whenever we needed anything or even started to look like we might need something one of them was right there to take our order, order more drinks, or clear our plates. i'm definitely going back again even if my parents aren't there to pay for it this time.", 
            "bobby flay, hooray! this was my second time dining at this location and this was simply fantastic but for a couple of small gripes.\noverall a super meal, albeit a bit pricey. \ni started with the <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark>, interesting but not fantastic.  the pork tenderloin, however with a side of brussel sprouts was off the charts amazing. the flavors, the taste was everything you would expect of an iron chef.  it was so tender and perfectly cooked it was hard to tell it was pork. the spicy chipotle reduction sauce helped to make the dish.\nmy gal ordered the salmon, also perfectly prepared and a side of spinach.   \nthe ambiance is good but not great even though the restaurant itself is adorned with ceiling sculptures and has a very open feel for a place of its size. seems they could dim the lighting a bit? again, not the most romantic of spots.", 
            "we always make it a point to visit mesa grill when in las vegas. we have never been disappointed with our meal or service. \n\non our last visit our server went out of her way to make our visit an excellent experience. thank you laura you rock!\n\nthe food was as good as i remembered it to be. we started by splitting the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> and the sophie <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark>. both were incredibly delectable. we then moved on to the green chile cioppino, alaskan king crab cake, smoked chicken & black bean quesadilla and blue corn pancake. now mind you all this food was for two. my husband couldn't decide what to eat so he ordered all of it. the only objection i had was that the crab cake was way too spicy. very close to being inedible. but the rest of our meal was epic. needless to say it was another memorable evening. \n\nthank you bobby flay and staff!!!", 
            "i am struggling between 3 and 4 stars.\n\ni got here at 4:58pm and they technically open at 5pm.  they are letting people give a reservation for a table and then have a seat at the bar.\n\nso i walk up and they tell me just a minute.  it is like panic-mode or something because one person is like \"seat everyone\" and then another person comes and is like \"don't seat anyone until 5pm!\" and there is just madness going on behind the counter where you place your reservations.\n\nfinally, someone looked up at me and asked if they could help me.  i asked for a table of one.  they said they could seat me at 5:15pm.  what?!  it's 5pm and there are plenty of tables that no one is at.  i am one person!  i was a little confused.  so i just stood & waited.  truthfully, i was a little pissed.  but, within 5 minutes i was sat at a table.\n\ni sat for about 5 minutes when finally a waitress, that had been just standing over to the side, talking to another waiter, decided to come over and ask what i wanted to drink.  i only wanted water.  so a couple minutes later, water comes to the table.  i asked her a couple of questions and ordered the sophie <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark>.  \n\nthe sophie <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark>- kidney beans, garbanzo peas, lettuce, olives, chunks of cheese, little blue & white tortilla pieces and a yummy dressing.  i would totally order this again!!\n\nafter i placed the order, about 3 minutes later some bread was brought to the table.  there were 3 pieces of bread- a blue corn muffin, a habanero bread and a cranberry (tasted a little sweeter) bread. then immediately, my salad came to the table.  \n\nthe salad was delicious!  omg!  i really want to go back and get it again!  i loved every inch of it!  the bread was divine too!  my bill came to just under $13.  awesome!\n\nit was just a little strange how almost all of the servers were standing around talking, a few of them bitching to each other and the madness that was behind the reservation stand.  totally turned me off.\n\ni would go back to get that salad for sure!  but maybe not at that time again!", 
            "i can't believe i haven't reviewed this place as many times as i've been here. had a hard time deciding between 4 and 5 stars, mainly because the appetizers, salad, and sides are all 5 star but the entrees i've had are 4. i usually get a salad, app, and a side or two. i end up here on most of my vegas trips and it is one of my favorite spots. you need reservations as it is always booked. i've snuck in and eaten at the bar a couple times but there is usually a wait for that.\ni love the <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark> and get it every time. for me it is the perfect salad, with baby romaine, garbanzos, kidneys, sharp white cheddar cubes, tiny toritlla pieces, kalamatas, cilantro, fresh chives and the dressing is a sweetish balsamic. love the tuna nachos and the tamale side, but all the apps and sides are perfect. the specialty margaritas and mojoitos are ok but i like to get the beer.", 
            "prior to dining here what i've known about bobby flay:\n*d-bag that \"raised the roof yo!\" while standing on a cutting board in kitchen stadium in the episode he lost to iron chef morimoto\n*dude that always adds chiliquiles, poblano peppers, mango chutney, etc. to whatever dish he makes on food network\n*guy that loses 90% of his throwdown battles on food network for adding chiliquiles, poblano peppers, mango chutney, etc. to the dishes he makes in throwdown\n\nso yea the only reason i went here was b/c my friends wanted to eat here while we were in vegas. i actually wanted to like this place & judging from the yelp reviews i thought..maybe it won't be so bad! ugh..i was not impressed. for starters we ordered <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark> & the \"queso fundido.\" sorry sophie, but i think i could have made a better salad it was just a bunch of beans w/ pieces of lettuce & tortilla chips thrown in. the queso was served in a little skillet & was piping hot..but not in a good way more like it had been nuked in the microwave & had a layer of oil on top...no bueno. \n\ni wasn't really in the mood for meat so i ordered the mango spice tuna steak..since i'm allergic to nuts i asked the server not to put pine nuts in the cous cous. i really didn't care too much for the tuna steak..it had way too many peppercorns. the bf had the grouper & didn't really care much for it either. i think the only thing i liked was the margarita i ordered. so yea when i think of mesa grill, i think of a bourgeosie chili's or chevy's where you're likely to find mango chutney or ancho chile sauce on the menu & where you can expect to spend over $100 on sub par tex mex food.",

            "always been a favorite but not tonight!  <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark> was underwhelming...brown lettuce and the cheese cubes were hard...it was like the salad  was from yesterday..just awful.  i was really surprised it was actually served to us.  the ahi appetizer was tasteless.  the ahi entree was really good.  corn side dish good and crunchy!\nall in all, disappointing .", 
            "yum! we got a couple of appetizers: the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> was amahzing. the blue corn pancake with bbq duck was good, but not life changing. the queso was not my cup of tea (but that's because i hate goat cheese).  for entrees: get the pork. it's their house specialty, it's delish, and i just saved you some deciding time. the pumpkin soup was spicy and creamy and just all around yummy. <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark> was alright. a little too dressed for me. atmosphere was ok, nothing too fancy, it's actually smaller than i thought it would be but cute with the exposed kitchen. service was fantastic! overall, an enjoyable meal!",

            "this was my second time dining here, and i do think it's a solid four stars. as much as i love bobby flay and southwestern food, i just wasn't impressed the first time; however, my boyfriend and i were looking for a nice dinner that didn't break the bank all while offering great food and cocktails, so we decided to give it another go (mostly because all of our other \"hot spots\" were closed before christmas, but i digress).\n\ni will say they have excellent service. we had a wonderful waiter who was both polite and prompt. i started with the white peach margarita, which came out perfectly- slightly sweeter than the traditional but not so much that it's overboard. i had a terrible margarita before which really turned me off, but i think mesa grill redeemed itself on the cocktail part after this white peach one. as other reviewers have said, they have a nice complimentary bread basket that we both enjoyed. for my meal, i ordered <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark> and the tiger shrimp and <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> (appetizer) and my boyfriend had the new mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin. the food is great, but my one quip is there is just not enough of it. i honestly felt like the appetizer portion was equal to the pork entr\\u00e9e, which is kind of sad. it is really, really good, just sort of small. i'm not sure if it was just the pork dish or if all of the entr\\u00e9es are like this, but it was a little off-putting. you should not order a meal and still feel hungry after eating, sorry.\n\nwith that said, i've actually recommended mesa grill to a few other people traveling to las vegas and they've all had great experiences. perhaps it's me, but i just can't say it's my favorite place in a city full of so many ridiculously good restaurants.", 
            "sadly this place only get's 2-stars and here's why.\n\nthe place is beautiful, clean and well staffed. we explained to the hostess that we were in a bit of a time crunch so we couldn't take a leisure lunch. we had a plane to catch and needed food first.\n\nwe were seated promptly after a brief sit in the lovely waiting area.  our waiter greeted us and informed us he was aware we were in a bit of a time crunch.  he asked if we wanted waters and would bring the drink menu for us.\n\nwe got our waters and ordered drinks. i ordered one of their signature margaritas - the waiter explained the different between the (i think) 4 of them.  i choose the one he indicated was the sweetest some sort of cactus.  i found it to be less sweet than expected - but it was very good.  he then took our food order.\n\nthere were three of us and i'll list all our food and comment on those items i tried.\n\n<mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark> - with her own special dressing + crispy tortillas --- 13.  my friend ordered it and she loved it - i also tasted it and it was very good, seemed fresh, and had a bunch of interesting things in it. i loved the dressing.\n\nyucatan chicken skewers - peanut - smoked chile barbecue sauce, flour tortillas, pickled red onion + mint --- 16.  beware - the peanut smoked chile barbecue sauce is very spicy - while i enjoyed it - my friend felt it was just a bit too hot and didn't really come with a \"warning\". she's not a fan of spicy food and avoided dipping her chicken into this. this dish was served with the tiniest flour tortillas.\n\n<mark>Mesa Burger</mark> - double cheddar cheese, grilled vidalia onion + horseradish mustard served with <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark> --- 18.  you like cheese? then you'll love this burger. it was ordered medium well and it came that way. meat was very tasty - but i am not a fan of cheese.  the <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark> were a bit salty.\n\nhot smoked salmon club <mark>Spicy Mango - Glazed Bacon</mark>, avocado, tomato, arugula, chipotle aioli + <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark> --- 18.  this is what i ordered. i love seafood and was excited to try a smoked salmon club.  it came cut in half (thank you!) and was piled high with a cold smoked salmon mixture like the way tuna salad is mixed. you could taste the smoke and it reminded me of alder wood smoked salmon from the pacific northwest. the bacon was thick and cooked to perfection. lots of avocado. basically all the toppings were fresh and yummy and the sandwich oozed out from all angles. i loved the chipotle aoili sauce and actually used it to dip my fries into. i also felt the fries were a bit salty but dipping into the sauce sort of muted the over saltiness.  this sandwich is not a hot sandwich.\n\nhere's the reason mesa grill only get's 2 stars - within an hour after eating my hot smoked salmon club - i became sick ... i was in the cab on the way to the airport when it started to hit me and i was like oh great! i'm about to have to wait in lines and my luck there would be no bathroom for miles!!  i warned my friends and one offered some imodium - which i promptly took without water (yuck)!!  this same friend ate the other half of my sandwich on the way to the airport - so i warned her to be careful.  sure enough while loading onto the plane - she told me she wasn't feeling well either ... so that being said - 2 stars. you made me and my friend sick with your bad salmon!  i subtract a star for each time i had to run to the restroom with salmon revenge!!\n\nthe decor was beautiful and like i said waitstaff was terrific. serving bad salmon is no bueno!",

(mr. flay certainly knows exactly how to use chiles and while he likely even includes chile with desserts, it works!  service was excellent. wine list was plentiful and had great options to accompany spicy foods!\n\noh - and i love the dining chairs in the main room -- wood frame with a red leather seat, backed with a cowhide insert on the back side of the chair. if anyone knows where i might find something similar, drop me a note!  any san francisco mesa grills on the way??!",

            "my girlfriends and i went here on a saturday night, it was full but not too overcrowded. we had the following:\n\n*pear cactus margaritas \n*<mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> w cilantro sauce\n*pork tenderloin with chile sauce and sweet potato tamale \n*gala apple salad \n\nall the cocktails were delicious esp the cactus margarita! the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> just melted in my mouth! however the pork was a bit on the dry side and the apple salad was just a bunch of apple cubes w dressing on it.\n\nservice was great, prompt seating.", 
            "this is probably the 2nd most visited restaurant i have been to in las vegas. 1st being oyster bar at palace station. i have introduced most of my friends to this restaurant and they have all loved it. however, having visited this restaurant 5 times, i have noticed that is has gone down in quality, taste, and execution. \n\nmy first and second visits was unbelievable. we ordered all his signature dishes: <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>, <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, queso fundido, tuna tartare, chilequiles, and those wonderful margaritas. every single one of those dishes were well thought out and quite tasty. i understood why bobby flay is who he is and why his food made him so famous. \n\nthen my last three visits. the hash was over doused in green chile holladaise, the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> was overcooked (even medium would've been ok, but please don't give me medium well), and the <mark>Barbecued Lamb Cobb Salad</mark> had no flavor. i was wondering to myself \"what happened?\"\n\ni think that bobby flay has been to the restaurant less, so food quality control is probably not where it should be. hopefully, the restaurant sees that they're going down (they just lost their michelin star this year) and tries to pick it back up. \n\n\n*** at least their corn muffins are still tasty ***", 
            "eh, maybe im a hard critic! but the only thing memorable there was the fact that i knew who bobby flay was before going the restaurant and their <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> was the best i've ever tasted, hands down.\ni was recommended to get fresh fish, so i got their grilled salmon even though it didn't look that interesting. my salmon tasted like cumin; and to me, cumin tastes like bad b.o. my friend's <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> was just whatever...not there is out of the extrodinary besides their <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>! i'll probably give it another chance the next time im in vegas, just cuz it's bobby flay! so why not...as long as i don't have to pay, im good almost anywhere=)", 
            "flay bien!\n\nfood is not hard to find in vegas, a place to get drinks is not hard to find, and you can even find several places to sit and talk, but why not just go to mesa grille and get all three? \n\nthe mesa grill is a friendly upbeat establishment in the dreary heart of caesar's palace. it is a welcome sanctuary of fine dining without the explosive price tag or pomp. \n\nthe food is a down south seafood kind of thing, but it is safe seafood for the faint of stomach (no fried fish heads or anything). we started with several appetizers, but i only really remember one: the tiger shrimp and <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>... wipe the drool off your keyboard. what an incredible appetizer... even the name is appetizing. my entree was the ancho crusted sea scallop, and oh my i am glad i got that. the meal had such a rich flavor and was wonderfully complimented by the cornmeal crusted anaheim chile relleno and, believe it or not, the roasted brussel sprouts with walnuts and pomegranates.  insanity!\n\ni also really enjoyed the emphasis mesa puts on their tequila selection. they have over 30 brands of tequila in blanco and anejo styles to fit your taste, and since tequila fits my taste it was quite a nice way to try new styles.  \n\nat least go for tequila and an app or two. at most go all out because this place has great food, wonderful service, and a light tasteful atmosphere.", 
            "the vision and creativity of bobby flay has surpassed my expectations when it came down to mesa grill. every dish was brimming over with flavor yet not at all overwhelming. instead, you end up craving for more of that spicy, savory, and comforting taste. \n\n-bread basket: jalapeno corn bread, muffins...we ate it all!\n-tiger shrimp & garlic blue <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>: amazing! the tamales are so delicious!\n-mango spiced crusted tuna steak w/ toasted pinenut cous cous: i was pining nuts over this meal. the toasted couscous was crispy so that it naturally coated the tuna steak in a breadcrumb like consistency. mangoes balanced the salty flavors of the spices. good proportions for tuna steak.\n\ni just might admit to being a fan of flay...almost.", 
            "i came here after hearing so much about the ancho chile flavoring that bobby flay uses in many dishes.  we had made a reservation for a party of 3, and were seated promptly once all of us arrived.  it was on a friday night, during a big convention week, so i was pretty impressed by that.  the decor was very modern and cool.  the food was equally impressive.  the presentation of the food was beautiful as well.  i'm sold on this place!\n\nthe one really cool touch i thought they had were the use of agua-fresca jugs in various color patterns on the wall.  first i thought they looked really familiar, and then when i realized that they are the jugs where yummy horchata comes from, i had laughed out loud to myself.  onto the food...\n\nfor appetizers, we ordered the following:\n\nblue corn pancake barbecued duck + habanero chile-star anise sauce - $15:  i remember this tasting more like really tender pork than duck, and i even had to confirm this with the server.  strangely, this was not a bad thing.  i was very intrigued by this dish.  we all really enjoyed the slight peking-duck-like flavoring on the sauce.\n\ntiger shrimp + <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> corn-cilantro sauce- $16: these shrimps tasted like shrimps. :)  with a more intense flavor than i can remember any shrimp that i've had.  the corn was very tasty as well.\n\nfor my entree, i wanted to try the pork tenderloin that everyone's raved about so much here, and all 3 of us ended up doing the same:\n\nnew mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin bourbon-ancho chile sauce\nsweet potato tamale + crushed pecan butter - $36: this dish was amazing.  it had a strong spicy kick, but not overwhelming and lighting my tongue on fire.  the meat itself was tender and delicious.  and, there was more food on the plate than i could finish.  since it was sooo good, i had to pretty much force down the rest, just so that i can continue to enjoy the flavoring and tenderness.  \n\ni am a fan of bobby flay.  i'll have to try his other menu items and locations for sure!", 
            "my friends and i dined at mesa grill saturday night.  we ordered three appetizers- queso fundido, tuna tartar and the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>.  we were blown away with the appetizers, especially the queso fundido and for a lactose intolerant woman, that is saying a lot.  for  4 latinos (who cook traditional food) to rave about a mexican restaurant, it has to be good.\n\ni always judge a mexican restaurant by its chile relleno.  bobby got it right!  it was stuffed with just the right ingredients with a great flavor.\n\nwe spent 2 hours at the restaurant eating and drinking.  mesa grill is be a mandatory stop on all of our future trips.", 
            "yum yum yum!!!\n\ni heart this place!!! it is awesome!!! \n\ni had my reservations with the crazy, colorful decor... but after i stepped inside i learned to quickly appreciate how nice, modern, and unique it was ....and classy too! not to mention most of the food was ooo soo goood!! \n\nyou def have to make reservations to eat here on the weekends! \nthe staff is pretty attentive.  when you walk in, they're waiting along the sidelines, greeting you!  \n\nthey serve you bread -- a basket with jalapeno cheddar, cornbread muffin, and raisin bread... soo yummy! beware, and don't get full off the bread!\n\nwe tried the prix fix menu that came with the:\n\n*appetizer: tiger shrimp & <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> - this was addictingly good.  the corn cilantro sauce complemented the tamale really well.  the shrimp & tamale together was pretty flavorful.\n\n*entree: new mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin w/ bourbon ancho chile sauce and sweet potato tamale - i don't know why, but this dish didn't impress me.  nice presentation.  the pork was really tender, and had the chile sauce flavor to it... but the dish lacked any kick to it.  it also wasn't served very hot. the tamale was good though!\n\n*desert: profiteroles cornflake crunch vanilla ice cream w/ warm mexican chocolate sauce - unimpressive.  it came with cream puffs, that did not taste very fresh.  as for the warm chocolate sauce, i'm not sure how that can be called warm? it was pretty cold to me.\n\nalso tried the wild mushroom quesadilla appetizer with white bean hummus and white truffle oil.  this wasn't very good to me either.  the waiter said it wasn't very oily compared to other quesadillas since it wasn't fried, but it still seemed pretty greasy to me.\n\nthe 5 stars comes when you try the grilled lamb porterhouse chops w/ cranberry roasted jalapeno sauce, pumpkin tamale, and all spice butter.  this was delicious!! the lamb chops were very tender and cooked to order. the dark cranberry sauce complemented the lamb extremely well.  the flavor of the sauce filled with cranberries provided a great contrast to the warm pumpkin tamale... yum!!! \n\noverall, this tops as one of my fav las vegas restaurants!! :d service was good.  good portions.  def must try it!!", 
            "i always pass mesa grill en route to pure or the caesars poker room, but never had occasion to eat there until recently.\n\ni had no idea what was on the menu, i thought it was a standard steakhouse. negative. \n\nsat at the bar, tried a scotch that the bartender recommended. had never tried it before, was smoky and delicious. started out with an appetizer of \"tiger shrimp and <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>\" in a corn-cilantro sauce. out of this world delicious. the tamale was flavorful, the shrimp seemed fresh, and the sauce was awesome.\n\nfor a main course, i had the fire roasted veal chop. i haven't been a huge fan of veal until lately, and this was a well prepared dish. top marks for the meal, the price wasn't so bad, and i'll 100% eat here again.\n\ni came in to eat around 10:30pm and the place was still busy, so take that for what it's worth as well.", 
            "very hit and miss with dinner at mesa. \n\nthe hits: obviously a beautifully/artfully designed layout and location. we had two servers working together which made service incredibly fluid and we appreciated that. the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> was creative, really tasty, and lots of texture. the shrimp was perfectly cooked (read not chewy) and the tamales were great -- you could really taste the masa. the corn-cilantro sauce was super flavorful as well. the crispy squash blossoms were so damn good. filled with ricotta and corn with a slightly sweet and spicy pepper sauce, the squash blossoms were perfectly fried yet not oily. for entrees we had the blue corn crusted halibut and the fire roasted veal chop and ordered a side of mashed potatoes with cilantro pesto. delicious!! the halibut was moist and flaky, with a crust of basil and oregano and a layer of sweet tomatoes. yum! the veal chop was perfectly seared and had a maple glaze and wild rice and sage butter side. i wanted to gnaw on the chop bone all night! the mashed potatoes were also good and the cilantro added a great flavor. \n\nthe misses: i found the blue corn bread to be completely crumbly. the butter was rock hard so when i tried to spread a bit of it on the bread everything crumbled. the first cocktail my friend ordered was a pomegranate martini...easy enough with simple ingredients, but instead the bartender used stirrings brand pomegranate martini mix. ugh...totally ruined the taste and gave it an overly sweet and unnatural taste. how could a restaurant held in such high regard use such a cheap ingredient? i expect more when i am paying almost $15 for a martini. and so should you! \n\notherwise a great experience. some wackiness around us, but an interesting and flavorful dining experience.", 
            "one of my fav's to eat in vegas.....stopped here during my last trip and really enjoyed my pork tenderloin. it had the perfect amount of seasoning (spicy so watch out!) and and was perfectly cooked. the accompanying <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> was just ok though and ended up a bit on the dry side. for an app, we went with the squash blossoms which again were seasoned perfectly; a real treat. \nlike most places in lv, you're going to pay through the roof for dinner which was no exception here. we ordered one of the \"cheaper\" bottles of wine ($48), and the waiter gave us a funny look...but oh well!\ngood times and good eats!", 
            "again with another celebrity chef restaurant review. i really wanted to hate this place cause i am not a fan of bobby flay. the people in my party wanted to go here and the menu looked good enough for me to ignore that it was a flay joint. \n\nman, was i schooled. truth be told, the food was good. everything we ordered was fantastically presented and well prepared. notables were the bread basket, the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> appetizer, the wild mushroom quesadilla with truffle oil, and my favorite, the roasted corn side dish. the rib eye is a monstrosity of a steak and definitely big enough to share. and the butterscotch flan for dessert? perfection. \n\noverall, the food was good... the only drawback to mesa, for me, was the fact it's smack in the middle of the caesars palace casino floor and you can totally smell clouds of cigarette while you eat which is a huge turn off for me.", 
            "graduating college is a big deal, and after receiving the gift of my first trip to las vegas, i knew there was no higher restaurant destination in the country better than mesa grill.\n\ncoming in with expectations and dreams of tasting the best food in america from the best chef to ever grace the planet, i can happily say everything exceeded what i had hoped for.\n\nwith a 6:00pm reservation, we were immediately seated along the back window overlooking bobby flay's beautiful space.  our waitress, who had worked in the restaurant since the day they opened, was passionate and insightful about what to drink and what to eat.\n\nplanning ahead that i was likely to enter into a \"food-coma\" our party of four tried to pace ourselves while also sampling what we hoped were the best dishes the restaurant had to offer.\n\nto begin our meal, we sampled two different margaritas.  one was a original version and one a cactus pear version.  both were delicious and quite strong.\n\nour waitress started us off with a bread basket filled with blue-corn muffins, jalapeno cheddar roles, and even more types indescribable bread that likely will have you begging for more before your drinks even arrive.\n\nfor appetizers, we selected the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, the spicy tuna + salmon tartares, and sophie's chop salad.  the tamale was one of the greatest appetizers i have ever eaten and the actual <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> stuffing itself was licked dry.  the tartares were spicy yet packed with flavor and came with plantain chips that were sweet and crispy.  the salad was ok flavor-wise but had really nice textures and was a big in size.\n\nfor our entrees, we each tired something different.  i ordered the new mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin, which was served with an amazingly flavorful sweet potato tamale.  the pork was perfectly cooked, ultra juicy and was demolished off of the plate rather quickly.  the other three entrees chosen consisted of blue corn crusted halibut, sixteen spice chicken, and a special of tempura soft shell crab.  each dish was completely devoured, along with a side dish of a chile relleno, which i wish we had ordered two of.  if given a choice of my second favorite entree (the pork was first), i would definitely choose the chicken.\n\ndessert is always a must when dining with me, so as a table we decided to split three of them.  the strawberry shortcake, the mango-blackberry crostada, and the cookie sampler.  once again, everything suddenly was missing, despite our stomachs at capacity level.\n\nthe service was phenomenal from beginning to end, and once our waitress found out we were celebrating my graduation, she brought over a small dish of pineapple ice cream with a candle.\n\nif you happen to find yourself in las vegas, please do yourself a favor and stop by mesa grill.  i promise the food will be some of the best you've ever tasted!", 
            "the \"desert outpost\" of iron chef bobby flay's acclaimed ny restaurant, say no more, i'm sold!\n\nthis is just an all-around good restaurant. good food with perfect portions, excellent service, all amid a modern and trendy southwestern-inspired atmosphere.\n\ni ordered the bargain-priced prix-fixe lunch: the popular blue corn pancake with barbecued duck and habanero chile star anise sauce as an appetizer, buffalo burger and fries for the entree, and chef's choice for dessert -- three pastry cream puffs with a light vanilla gelato. i also sampled some of the garlic shrimp and <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> as well as the spicy chicken with <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>.\n\nevery dish was really quite good, no disappointments whatsoever. each dish was very tasty, flavorful and often had a nice little kick to it as the spices were plentiful -- many dishes having a blend of chiles, spices or peppers, but not an overpowering amount, and added extra depth to the taste of the food.", 
            "well, looks like i don't have to upload any of the pictures i took because they're already up. :)\n\nthese were last minute reservations, like the same day. but we managed to get in. we only had to wait about 5 minutes to get seated which was good since i had read that they suck at keeping reservations. \n\nafter we were sat we ordered a couple of classic margaritas and some tiger shrimp and <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> not tamal! haha we were served some bread which came with sourdough bread and some delicious corn muffins with jalapeno pieces in it. the margaritas were just right, with a nice kick of tequila. then our appetizer came, the shrimp were meh but the tamale, it was not like any i've had before. this was a whole different experience and it was a good one. it kinda felt appart and had a kick of spice but tangy at the same time, deliciously weird!\n\nfor our main course i had the new mexican spice rubed pork loin and my boyfriend had the black angus new york strip steak. we also ordered a side of glazed baby carrots in chile de arbol and brown sugar.  now, i'm not usually a big meat eater but i decided to order it and order it medium well. boy what have i been missing out on. the pork was delicious. it almost made my eyes roll into the back of my head. that's how good it was. it also came with a delicious tamale. hmmm..just talking about it makes me wish i was back in vegas. i tried some of the medium rare steak and that did not dissapoint either. i was very suprised since i am not into red meat. the carrots were alright.\n\nfor dessert we had some of their home made churros with chocolate dipping sauce. that should speak for itself! \n\nover all the place is pretty f'n amazing. they even went beyond expectations when i was there and some dumb broads decided it was cold and asked for a blanket. yes, they provided them with a blanket! the decor was modern, the staff was friendly and the food, like candice b said is an \"explosion of flavors in your mouth\". a must go!", 
            "i wish i would've written this review straight after i finished my meal, but i\"ll try my best to accurately describe the joy i felt after each bite. \n\ni will have to preface this review by saying that i never had the urge to try any of bobby flay's restaurant b/c i thought \"how can you turn southwestern food and flavors into fine dining\" especially being that i'm from texas. boy was i wrong.\n\nwe started with the shrimp with blue <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, chicken tacos, and the quesadilla. the shrimp was perfectly cooked, the tamale-delicious. my fave appetizer is the quesadilla. i love goat cheese, i love truffle oil. the combination is electrifying. this is a must try. \n\ni had the veal chop, and let me tell you that each bite sent shivers down my spine. i let out a slight moan every time i would put a piece of meat in my mouth. the veal was so tender, and the flavoring. succulent. each bite sent me closer and closer to nirvana. \n\nmy friend had the duck, which i asked her to order. omfg, excellent. divine. fantabulous. i could go on and on. the duck was perfect. it was tender but had just the right amount of gamey-ness to it. when i go back again, i don't know if i'll have the veal or duck. both were excellent. \n\nbobby flay has always been known for his robust flavors and i have to say that i\"m hitting myself in the head for not trying his restaurants before. every dish i tried was just amazing. each bite is like fireworks in your mouth.", 
            "we are currently obsessed with bobby flays (and rick bayless') cooking.  everything he makes on food network always looks amazing.  the few recipes of his i've made have come out great,  the same cannot be said of other food tv chefs... i'm looking at you giada!    \n\nwe've been to mesa grill twice, the first time we were simply floored by the flavors.  the lamb tenderloin salad was great, the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> was amazing and the shrimp perfectly cooked.  the duck pancake had a smoky flavor and that combination of sweet and savory.\n\non our most trip, we again enjoyed the tamale.  we also had the <mark>Fresh Tomato Soup</mark> which was really good and lots of flavor from the fresh tomaotes and cilantro.   i had the chicken quesadilla, which was a boring but still delicious choice.  my wife ordered the buffalo burger, it was relatively lean, but still juicy and had a great natural flavor.   i can't wait to try bar american in nyc.", 
            "if at any point during a meal i start calculating the costs because i don't feel it's justified, it's probably not worth it. \n\ni had my reservations about dining at bobby flay's mesa grill inside ceasar's palace. the idea of a \"fine dining\" experience featuring \"southwestern cuisine\" seemed like an oxymoron. i could not fathom how this particular genre of food would be successfully executed at an elevated level, because quality tex-mex ingredients are not expensive, rare, or difficult to prepare. i've been to local mom and pop restaurants in new mexico and texas that served fantastic and memorable chili relleno's, taco's, salsas with roasted chili's, creamy black beans, spiky queso fresco (sp?), and fresh blue corn tortilla's made by hand. putting an ancho chili spice rub on a pork loin just doesn't seem to justify the price tag. \n\na friend of mine dined at mesa grill, and so enjoyed his experience he requested a visit on our upcoming vegas trip. i trusted his palate considering he is a product of culinary school, but i should've considered his admiration for chef flay might sway his better judgement. \n\nmesa grill is right around the corner from pure nightclub, (which i suggest attending, you'll have a great time). the decor is quite loud, but i must say a+ for the grill design on the ceiling. clever. \n\nthe staff. our waitress seemed flighty. she might have been new, so i'll excuse her erratic behavior. first, she forgot our bottled water, then proceeded to argue with us that we did not request bottled. i don't mind if you forget our water preference, but to argue with us is ridiculous. then she forgets to inform us of the specials. we overheard the specials from the waiter serving the table next to us. when she came back with our water, we informed her that we wanted hear the specials. again, she argues with us and tells us she already told us. \"so all four of us are lying?\" i asked. she then told us to \"hold on\" as she double checked the specials. interesting, considering she claims she had already informed us. nonetheless, one of our friends ordered the special seared scallop dish with a chili orange glaze. \n\nthe drinks. my friend ordered a mango mojito that was nice and refreshing. i ordered a kir royale. they used chambord instead of cassis, which i didn't love, because i tasted the liquor as opposed to the sweet, tangy cassis. \n\nthe food. we opted to start with the spiced duck taco's, queso fresco dip with blue corn tortilla chips, and deep fried squash blossoms stuffed with ricotta cheese, and basil. the duck taco's were savory, but reminded me of a peking duck dish served at one of my favorite chinese restaurants. unoriginal. tortillas stuffed with duck, a plum flavored sauce, cilantro, green onions, and shredded cabbage. the queso dip wasn't horrible. it was a cheese dip with chips. not really interesting. the squash blossoms were crunchy, but the ricotta and basil were a little too assertive for my taste. i lost the flavor of the blossoms in the goop of the ricotta.  the basil was a little too sharp. \n\naside from our one friend, we all ordered the coffee spiced filet, with a <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, and horseradish potato gratin. the filet was cooked perfectly, and the coffee spiced rub wasn't bad. although, i like to taste my meat. i am a violent carnivore, and i love ripping into a juicy, bloody, fatty, piece of meat. i know, its an illness. in hindsight i probably shouldn't have ordered the spiced rubbed meat, but i needed to decide for myself if spiced meat was a delicious option. unfortunately, not so. the spices in the rub didn't compliment the meat, as much as it overpowered it. the spices failed to dissipate, so i cleared my palate after every bite. the horeradish potatoes were good, and the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> was nice and moist, but like every other <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> i've had at any generic mexican restaurant. for dessert we ordered an exotic sorbetto napoleon: guava, passionfruit, and mango sorbetto, with a carmel crisp. yummy. \n\ni walked away from my experience feeling ripped off. i wasn't impressed. as a professional digester i never look at prices. it's insulting to the food. sadly, i wanted my money back. i felt cheated. i want to walk away from a meal feeling satiated, not calculating the costs. \n\nside note: my uncle wanted to celebrate his birthday at mesa grill, and to our surprise, and luck, chef flay was in the kitchen. he came out to greet the patrons, and was very nice. he patiently chatted with my 89 year-old grandma, as she professed her love for him, and was kind enough to take a picture with her. he asked if the food was to our liking, then sent over a signed cookbook. i may not agree with his culinary vision, but i respect him for what he has achieved, and his compassion for his patrons.", 
            "yumm, the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, veal chop, mashed potato with pesto? super duper yum!", 
            "bobby flay can round out a pretty good meal.  i came here twice and both times, the service was excellent.  they knew their menu inside-out and weren't afraid to say if something was just \"eh.\"\n\ni tried the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> which wasn't incredible but i give b-flay props for his creativity.  and then i had the coffee filet mignon which was excellent.  i feared the coffee flavor would be overbearing and it would taste like a failed dunkin' donuts experiment but it was seasoned just enough to know that it was coffee, not a bit more.\n\nthe second time around -- not on my company's dime this time -- i ordered the mango tuna steak.  now, i feel that this dish is the epitome of b-flay's amalgamations.  the dish was part mango (which seems to be his vice), cous cous (some far-out non-traditional ingredient), and chile sauce (the token traditional ingredient) on a somewhat off-kilter meat like tuna (because cow is never good enough for flay).\n\nthe decor was pretty cool.  somehow, they managed to pull the \"i'm on a plateau but it's fun\" look.  plus, mesa grill logo is pure marketing genius.  my co-workers were pretty sick of my running commentary on the restaurant logo.  \"dude, bobby must have his mba because that logo is so cool.  does bobby have his mba?  guys?  guys?\"\n\ni should comment that the prices aren't for the faint of heart.  if i weren't on full-throttle spend mode, being in vegas, i probably would've balked at the menu.  i hadn't gotten into the food channel before i visited mesa grill so i didn't really care for chef robby fleghue or whomever.\n\ni would probably appreciate the place much more now that i'm a full-on food channel junkie.  all-in-all, it was pretty cool and the food was very good.", 
            "bobby flay did not disappoint.  we had the rock <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> appetizers.  so good!  if i was alone at home, i might have considered licking the plate.  we also tried some of their specialty margaritas which were great with the appetizers.  i ordered the duck breast and i would like to be more descriptive, but it was so good, i ate it so fast, it is just a pleasant memory now.  my boyfriend had the lamp chops, with a peanut/cilatro pesto which was amazing also.  \n\napril, our server was great.  women, you will appreciate this;  i was wearing a black dress and was a little apprehensive about putting a white napkin in my lap for fear of walking around with white lint on my dress all night.  she must have seen the look on my face when i put the napkin aside instead of in my lap.  we got our margaritas and then noticed that i now had a black napkin!  i thought i was losing my mind, but she had switched out my napkin without my having to ask.  now that is service!  it's really the little things that make your experience great and one of them was the great service.", 
            "i'm basing this review on our visit to las vegas and it's location inside caesars palace. \nwhat can i say? being a huge fan of bobby flay, southwestern cuisine, and plenty of heat on my palate, this was a no brainer! three months after our visit, i'm finally getting down and writing this review; i'd still be willing to make the trek to vegas, just to dine at mesa. \n\nthe staff was awesome, from the hostess to the waiter. food was ... well, no words can describe what the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, blue corn crusted rellano, and the new mexican spice rubbed tenderloin did to my mouth. \n\nhighly,... highly! recommended for when you're in the mood for some flava! \n\nand fuck all those flay-haters!", 
            "went here the last night we were in vegas for a friends wedding.went with high hopes cause am a fan of bobby flays cooking style. for the most part he didn't disappoint. the apps were all great, i had pan seared scallops as mine, and got veal for my entree , truly melted in my mouth. the side dish was i guess the standard for the restaurant as everyone at the table ,whether they had seafood,beef, or chicken got the same breaded <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> thing, which tasted ok but i think we should have been given the chance to mix it up, wasn't really an option on the menu. the dessert was very good as well dont remember what it was called because i was being adventurous but tempura bananas figured very heavily into the equation. the only other  turn off besides the all for one side dish was our waiter who was kind of creepy, he wasnt rude or anything but was really prissy and like the nerdy scientist from the simpsons  (ahem mmm yess)as he spoke all nasally to you. haha sorry im being rude now.", 
            "the only word to describe this place= awesome. i thoroughly enjoyed my meal at mesa! we were there during restaurant week, and they had a $30 tasting menu that was out-of-this-world. the service was great too, the waitress explained everything about the dishes and made some wonderful recommendations. i ended up trying the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> to start, the <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> as my main dish, and they had the chef's choice dessert as blueberry profiteroles with fresh whipped cream. so good. i think the tamale was my favorite. the portions were huge too, definitely not what i expected (i figured they'd be small due to the price not being too high and the tasting menu moniker). those at our table who didn't get the tasting menu also enjoyed their meals. oh yeah, and if you go definitely get a margarita. i don't even normally like margaritas all that much, but theirs are awesome. i had their signature marg, the partida margarita, uses partida tequila (100% blue agave tequila), organic agave and fresh squeezed lime juice. this drink is totally worth the $16 price point. if i'm going to drink, it needs to be good. this was awesome. in short, go to mesa, enjoy a meal and definitely have a margarita. i tried a few sips of other varieties of the margs and they were all great too (though mine was the best!) highly recommended! wish there was one in san diego :)", 
            "i love bobby flay, so we had to definitely give mesa a try.  we weren't too excited about the dinner menu, so we opted for lunch.  mesa's decor is very vibrant and i found it to be very inviting.\n\nwe started we the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>.  my husband ate most of it, but i did have a bite and it was pretty good.  i had the <mark>Barbecued Lamb Cobb Salad</mark> and my hubby had the shrimp tacos.  both were excellent and we found the wait staff to be very attentive and informative.\n\ni really wished we would have seen bobby flay at the restaurant, then i would have definitely given it 5 stars....i know the likelihood of that is slim to none, but still ; )", 
            "my 200th review! wow, who knew i ate out so much!! for #200 i have chosen mesa grill. i am torn on giving 4 stars...but i don't want to give 3 either...let's say 3 1/2 stars for mesa. \n\nthe service was definitely 5 stars. we had an awesome, attentive, friendly, sweet waiter who really did an awesome job. the restaurant is clean and nicely decorated. the table was large and the seating was comfortable. \n\nwhen it comes to the food though...i just wasn't that impressed :( i had really high hopes for mesa...i have heard so many people tell me how much they love it and how it will be some of the best food i will ever eat. i beg to differ.\n\nlet me break it down, we had a lot of food, so i feel like me giving 3 stars for food is justified:\n\nappetizers - goat cheese \"queso fundido\", tiger shrimp & <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, blue corn pancake with duck, yucatan chicken tacos. \n\nwe ordered four appetizers for five people. that should be enough, right? wrong. these appetizers are tiny. and expensive for the portion you receive! the total for just the appetizers was $60. yes, 6-0 dollars. one appetizer was barely enough for two people. and let me state for the record, i have no problem throwing down money for good food, but i thought it was absolutely ridiculous the amount charged for tiny little bites of food.\n\nbut how did it taste, you ask? okay. the cheese dip was awesome. i will give mr. flay that - he can make a mean cheese dip. but, if you didn't eat it fast enough, it hardened. so, eat quickly when you order the queso! the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> was also pretty good. the shrimp were large and juicy, the corn filling was nice and flavorful, which a yummy cilantro cream sauce. the blue pancake with duck was alright...i wouldn't eat it again. it was shredded duck in a super rich bbq sauce, just okay. the chicken tacos were served with red onions and \"chile bbq sauce\" that tasted just like thai food...pad thai to be exact. \n\nsides - glazed baby carrots with brown sugar, roasted corn with smoked chile's and cotija cheese, saut\\u00e9ed spinach, sweet potato tamale with pecan butter.\n\ni tried all of these sides. this place is like ruth's chris where you order your meat, and everything else on the side, your entree doesn't come with anything.\n\nthe baby carrots had a nice flavor, but they were a little undercooked for my taste. i prefer softer carrots. the sweet potato tamale with pecan butter - sounds awesome right? sounds sweet and delicious, right? well, it tastes like masa. the saut\\u00e9ed spinach was literally just that. spinach. now, i love spinach, and i can eat it plain or dressed up, but when i pay $8 for spinach, i would expect some garlic, or salt...or anything...nope. this was seriously cooked spinach with no other flavors. \n\nthe roasted corn was the star of the sides. it was absolutely delicious. the corn kernels were crisp and fresh, served in an awesome creamy, cheesy sauce that was spicy, but not too overpowering. just awesome. \n\nentrees - coffee rubbed filet mignon, spice rubbed pork tenderloin.\n\nthree of us had the filet, the other two had the pork. since i can't eat pork, i don't want to say much about it, but i will say bf said it was good, but not the best ever. maybe if he ever gets on the ball and starts yelping again, he can tell you about it himself.\n\nthe filet...very large cut of meat, too much to finish. it was soft, it was coffee rubbed, it didn't really taste like anything. the coffee rub was more of a burnt crust. i got a hint of coffee, but mostly i just tasted burn. \n\nit was served on some mushroom, ancho chile sauce. the mushrooms were very good. spicy and caramelized. i loved the sauce...but the filet? i would rather go to ruth's chris. honestly.\n\nafter dinner our friends ordered dessert and coffee. i tried the coffee, good flavor. i took a bite of their pineapple buttermilk upside down cake - it was very good, rich, sweet, served with a caramelized rum sauce. \n\noverall, this place was just alright. there were a few things that hit high notes with me, but they were appetizers and sides, and i don't think i would come back just for those items. the majority of the food was just okay, not amazing, not the best i have ever had. \n\ni think i will just stick to making my bobby flay recipes at home, they taste better and they are cheaper!", 
            "this is review #476 for this place???  holy cow....what more can i say that hasn't already been said.\n\nafter a day at the convention center, a group of us headed over to watch monday night football at caeser's palace.  thankfully, one of us thought ahead and got reservations at mesa grill.  our previous plan of nobu would have to wait.  the game was entertaining as hell and we headed over to bobby flay's place.\n\ni love a wide open room like they have here.  much better vegas ambiance than tiny little rooms.  very simple decor with the tequila bar and open kitchen dominating the view.\n\nthe yelp reviews gave me a great preview of what to order and my dining partners appreciated the hints i was able to provide.\n\nit took a long time to get a drink order.  when i mentioned a margarita, i had to wait to get the special margarita menu.  how many ways can you make a margarita?  apparently about 190.  the menu was ridiculous.  far too many choices.  geez, it's just tequila.  i took the waiter's recommendation and was not disappointed.  it was not cheap, maybe $15, by the time the extra options were added up.  it was delicious.  \n\nappetizers were next.  the queso fundido (blue corn chips and a hot cheeze dip) was wonderful.  cheesy and spicy.  tiger shrimp and <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> were just amazing.  kind of small portions but the tastes were unique and complementary.  we also had the blue corn crusted squid.  lightly crunchy with a tangy sauce.\n\ni had the blue corn crusted halibut.  off the chart fantastic.  i love a simple piece of grilled meat or fish with a plain starch and veggie.  here, you are subjected to a wild array of seasonings, toppings, garnishes, etc.  they hit the spot....big time.  a meaty fish that held up to the accompaniments.  absolutely delicious.  \n\nmy dining partners had the pork tenderloin, duck breast and the rib eye steak.  four dudes sitting around the table offering each other bites.  so very uncool, so very yummy.  sides of spinach and corn rounded out the main dishes.\n\nwe split the toasted coconut layer cake.  very tasty, indeed.  \n\ni'm not a huge bobby flay, tv star, fan.  i am a giant bobby flay, fill my gut with tasty food, fan.  highly recommended.",

            "this place was really good. i read mixed reviews and was nervous to give it a shot. i came for appetizers and liked it so much we came back for dinner the next night. the restaurant is very colorful, in my opinion a little bit cheesy, but appropriate for southwestern restaurant. the food was great! we had:\n\n<mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark> - amazing! very simple but bursting with flavor and crunch. i ordered it on both visits. \ntiger shrimp and <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>- excellent! came with jumbo size prawns and a heavenly corn sauce. each bite was heaven!\nspicy tuna and salmon tartares - this was good, but it was exactly what you would expect of a tartar. it wasn't bad by any means, but many of the other dishes overshined this standard plate.\ngrilled lamb poerterhouse- tasty and huge but i like my lamb a little more muted in flavor. my hubby loved it though.\nblue corn crusted halibut - this was my entree. it was delicious!!! the corn crust added a new texture to the juicy tender halibut. the tomoatoe oragano gave a great kick with it's spiciness. halibut needs big flavors and this dish definatley reflected that. \nnew mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin- really flavor full and not dry at all.\nchorizo-goat cheese tamale - i wanted this to be good, but it was very bland skip. this worked better in theory. \n\nall in all we had a wonderful time at bobby flay's restaurant. the service was excellent, the flavors did not disappoint. while this was a spendy restaurant there are much more expensive restaurants on the strip. i would go back.",

            "when i lived in new york i always wanted to go to one of bobby flay's restaurants, but at the time they were way out of my budget. i'd thought about going when i went back and visited, but never did. so, when we were visiting vegas and friends asked if we'd like to join them for thanksgiving lunch at bobby flay's mesa grill in caesar's palace, we said \"for sure!\"\n\nmesa grill was featuring a thanksgiving menu, but we decided not to order from it. it would have been nice to actually have turkey on thanksgiving, but we came to try the food that flay is known for, and so we ordered from the regular menu. this is what we had:\n\n- tiger shrimp + <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>: corn-cilantro sauce\n- goat cheese \"queso fundido\": rajas + blue corn tortilla strips\n- oyster special: can't remember exactly what was in these, but they were cooked oysters put back in the shell with some sauce\n- new mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin: bourbon-ancho chile sauce, sweet potato tamale + crushed pecan butter\n- southwestern spiced duck breast: carrot-habanero sauce, chorizo-goat cheese tamale + thyme butter\n- grilled lamb porterhouse chops: tangerine-roasted jalapeno-mint sauce + plantain tamale with molasses butter\n\ni really liked the cheese appetizer, of course. unlike other fundido i've had, the addition of goat cheese added a nice tanginess to the appetizer. i also really liked the tamale. for the entrees, i had the duck, friend1 had the pork and friend 2 and friend 3 both got the lamb. we all tasted each other's food and everyone agreed that the pork was the tastiest. we all enjoyed the duck as well. it was agreed that the lamb was a disappointment. it didn't taste bad, but it wasn't flavorful at all. overall, i was glad to try flay's food, but i wasn't head over heels.", 
            "mesa grill has to be one of my favorite stops for good food while in las vegas. i ended up stopping by for dinner on a tuesday night. i would highly recommend getting a reservation as it will definitely get you seated fast if they are having a busy night. fyi, if you do get a reservation you will have to back up it up with a cc to hold the table. it goes without saying, if you need cancel call no later than the day before to cancel. otherwise, you can just roll the dice, pull up to the desk and hope they aren't busy.\n\ni usually always start with the signature margarita and depending on the size of our party, i try to get the crispy squid and tiger shrimp with <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>. unless you have access to a grandma that cooks authentic mexican foods with recipes that have been in the family for generations... this is going to be the next best thing to having an awesome tamale. the shrimp is always cooked to perfection, but the tamale is the star. the tamale is always light, fluffy, and you can just take your fork to glide right through it to take a bite. i like the crispy squid which is basically just calamari except done right. the breading is very very light and it is never greasy. i hate going to your cookie cutter restaurant only to get some kfc breading on calamari that has been nuked from being fried too long.\n\nfor my main dish, i opted for the new mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin which has bourbon-ancho chile sauce and comes with a sweet potato tamale. i always get it cooked to about medium and it always comes out cooked perfectly. very juicy and tender. the sauce is to die for. you just want take a piece of pork and bathe the thing in the sauce. just thinking about it makes me want to go back for more. i have also had the southwestern spiced duck breast that comes with carrot-habanero sauce and a chorizo-goat cheese tamale. that is also very good. to call it chicken would be a gross understatement, but it has a deep flavor that goes beyond your standard chicken, turkey or typical bird.\n\ncount on me being back on my next trip! you can't beat it.", 
            "mesa grill was extremely overpriced and the service was annoying. i understand it's vegas, but for the prices, i expected better, quieter service. our waiter came up every five minutes trying to take our plates, pouring water in between us and our conversations, asking questions... i understand being diligent but this was annoying. \n\nthe pork loin was the best thing any of us got. it was definitely very good. so was the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>. i think that's actually the best thing on the menu, but quite rich so you can split that and the pork with someone and be totally satisfied as the portions are huge.\n\none of us had the coffee crusted steak, and the rub was just too spicy to really enjoy the meat. the fish was bland and slightly overcooked. desserts were awful. seriously, how hard is it to make good churros? the donuts at a fast food restaurant are better!\n\nif you are a fan of bobby flay's other restaurants -- bar americain is one of my favorites -- you will be very disappointed here. the quality, service and atmosphere are just so mediocre it really disappoints. oh, and the price - i think it's more expensive than eating in his restaurant in manhattan, which is just mind-boggling because this is vegas, for god's sake.",

(just kidding, i actually love red-heads!)\n\nbut mesa grill? soooooooo good! r. r. and i sat at the bar for dinner and enjoyed every minute. i had the black bean soup with cumin crema and three relishes, and really, i would bathe in that soup it's so good! i had my face in the bowl and was licking it clean when r.r. gently reminded me that we were in public and ladies generally try not to eat like wildebeests. my bad. <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark> was good, but nothing special. r.r. made some good choices as well - be sure check out the rough-cut tuna \"nachos\" and the shrimp and <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>. and the bartenders were awesome; one mixed us a free taste of his special \"red bull mojito\" - yummy! \n\nso while i'm glad to have checked out mesa grill because the food was incredible, i only wish that my hard-earned money were going to someone other than douchebag flay.", 
            "every time i walked by mesa grill, i thought about trying it.  i finally made it here last sunday.  the restaurant is big and modern.  because it was sunday at 11:30am, we were told brunch was served.  \n\nthe brunch menu was kind of limited  (http://www.mesagrill.com/lasvegas/pdf/mesalvbrunch.01.08.10.pdf).  we decided on the following:\n\n1)  <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> with creamed corn (not on the above menu) - $16. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xzbupxdya0zttu3azqtqhg?select=bzdgak4kyiolojnnm9giia) this was quite good.  i'm not a fan of tamale but i enjoyed the creamed corn and the shrimps (total of 4!).  \n\n2)  <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> in spicy black bean sauce + roasted jalapeno crema - $22. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xzbupxdya0zttu3azqtqhg?select=zzxiymivp3o1osnjdf4hfg) i ordered it well done.  the salmon was very tender with good flavor.  however it must have sat on the counter for awhile b/c it was barely lukewarm!  \n\n3)  <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> grilled red onion, arugula ancho-chile mayonnaise + <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark> - $16. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xzbupxdya0zttu3azqtqhg?select=qq6qbo2cmswdd7l9owudaw) this was the biggest disappointment of the meal.  my fiance gave it 1 star.  enough said.  \n\nservice was spotty.  at first it was really good, but then it just went down hill.  like i said earlier, our food must have sat on the kitchen counter for awhile b/c my salmon was barely lukewarm and my fiance's sandwich (the pork tenderloin) was cold and hard!  our <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark> were getting refilled until we were done eating.  then they took the plates away and didn't bother asking if we would like another refill.  c'mon, even if we're done, we might still like some more ice tea!\n\ni thought the quality and service didn't measure up to my expectation and the prices.  3 stars is all it gets.", 
            "4 stars solid. can't give 5 stars just for a brunch experience.\n\ni have always been at odds with big celebrity chefs.  namely ones that are famous because of tv and not necessarily because the food network made him big -- like bobby flay. so i went with trepidation.\n\ntook the 9 girls in vegas for the weekend and i must say best meal of the trip!!\n\nthe space is open and modern, makes you almost forget you're in the middle of a casino.\n\neverything i tasted from the girls around me to my own dish was awesome!  i guess flay really likes goat cheese, because it's all over the menu. \n- scrambled egg enchiladas with chorizo:  a very simple dish but made complex by the delicious red chile sauce on the bottom, and the accompanied goat cheese and sprigs of cilantro made it a very well balanced dish!  could hardly taste the chorizo which was fine.\n\n- <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>: many girls at the table had this which was amazing!! apparently it is the specialty on the menu.  large shrimp in a cream sauce which was poured over an amazing <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>.  perfectly made and flavors spot on!!!\n\n- spicy chicken with sweet potata hash: had a bite of this dish; basically it is a large mound of sweet potato with chicken cooked in, topped with a spicy hollandaise and a poached egg.  the one bite was pretty tasty.\n\nothers at the table had his burger which looked perfectly cooked. \n\noverall a great experience.  we even had a few desserts - would definitely go for the espresso flavored flan?  \n\ndo it! brunch. go.",

            "this is the first time that i have been to mesa grill.  i have been to bar americain in new york city so i already somewhat knew to expect at a bobby flay restaurant.  my dinner when i went to bar americain was exceptional and i was expecting the same at mesa grill, but i think that my expectations were a little high.  \n\nwhat we ordered between the two of us:\n- <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>\n- <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark>\n- <mark>Mesa Burger</mark>\n- <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark>\n- buttermilk pineapple upside down cake\n- chocolate chip strawberry shortcake (dessert of the day)\n\npositives....\n- the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> was amazing.  by far my favorite thing that i have had at a bobby flay restaurant.  the shrimp was almost undercooked but was done enough to eat.  the filling of the tamale was sweet and there was an under tone of flay's famous heat in the sauces.  the corn-cilantro cream sauce was perfect to accent the tamale.\n- you could taste the quality of the meat of the burger.  it was exceptional and cooked perfectly.  you can hardly get your mouth around it because it is so large!  \n- the cake itself in the pineapple upside down cake was moist and delicious.\n- as always, the fries and flay's restaurants are great!  we had the <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark> with our meals and then were spicy but good!\n\nnegatives:\n- first off the server was an absolute snob so we got unlucky there.  i would have given this post 4 stars but took one away because of the server.  \n- the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> was served with the meat freezing cold.  i was very surprised by this.  the sandwich would have been much better if the meat wasn't cold.\n- when our server brought flay's \"famous\" bread basket to our table there were only two cold muffins in it that were clearly left from the night before.  one of my favorite parts of my flay meal in the past was the variety of breads in the basket.  the tables around us got a variety like i expected to get.  i attribute this to our sucky server.\n\noverall the meal was a positive one but i don't know if i will be back to mesa grill in the future but i definitely recommend the restaurant to any bobby flay fans that would like to experience his southwestern flavors.", 
            "delicious, i have been here 4 times and it never disappoints.  i would definitely recommend this place to some one who is taking out a group of people that might be picky eaters or in other words not necessarily foodies.  not to say a \"foodie\" wouldn't love it, everything i have had here has been executed perfectly and has been delicious it's just that the menu isn't crazy fancy, which is good.  it's a bobby flay restaurant so you get the southwest influence which is typically a crowd pleaser also.  i recommend the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> appetizer, pork tenderloin, and the veal chop.  it also isn't terribly pricey for a nice strip restaurant and has a cool atmosphere.\n\ni haven't had the brunch but it's only on the weekends and it looks real good.", 
            "this was soooo delicious. i was a little worried about eating at the typical \"famous chef\" novelty restaurant, but i was very impressed. we ordered so many items because i wanted to taste as much as i could.  everything was amazing. i would hold the bites in my mouth so i could fully enjoy the flavor.\n\ni recommend the goat cheese fundido and the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>.", 
            "we arrived at mesa at exactly 5:00 pm, ready to just pop in with no reservations as if we owned the place.  not so much.  the place was already booked well in advance (damn) but lucky for us, we were able to secure some great seats at the bar.  frankly, i think you get great (attentive) service at the bar because you're right in the face of the bartender - hard to be ignored right?\n\ni came here with my partner on the recommendation of a colleague.  she was right.  i really liked it.  okay, the prices were a bit ridonkulous but i'm a foodie and will pay up from time to time. \n\nwe started out with the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> - an appetizer large enough to share.  tasty, yummy, damn fine masa.\n\nmy partner got the filet (he asked everyone).  it was an expensive but expansive cut of meat.  the crusted exterior softly cut through to a medium rare center.  i don't think i've seen a filet mignon cooked as close to perfection as this one.  the spicy crust was incredible.\n\nas for me, i went vegie, which i never do, but was really thinking that the chile relleno with eggplant looked interesting.  it was and is was good.  it's hard to describe this monstrosity of goodness.  it was huge and i ate every damn bit of it.  \n\nwe felt compelled to get a side dish (twice baked potato) but really upon reflection, it was unnecessary.  our bill capped out at close to $200 with drinks but the experience was worth it.\n\ni'd give it five stars but the location inside caesers left a (lot) to be desired.  you can't really truly away from the casino vibe even in a well-appointed restaurant.", 
            "right off the bat, i have to warn my fellow yelpers who might be thinking of dining here: make reservations. alright, on to the review. the decor of the place is vibrant and feels youthful. there was no prix fixe menu at the moment, bummer. the bread basket was nice and tasty (i think they had 3 variety of breads). heck i even asked for 2nd batch and took it home.\n\n1. for appetizers, i ordered the goat cheese queso fundido w/ rajas and ha had the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> with roasted garlic cream sauce. both appetizers were great. i love goat cheese, so using that kind of cheese for a queso fundido was great, but the rajas really added nice flavor. the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> was incredible. the masa was nice and light, and the shrimp were seasoned nicely. you need to soak up as much of the sauce as possible. i know its fatty, but who counts calories these days?\n\n2. for entrees, i ordered the new mexican spiced pork tenderloin w/ sweet potato tamale and she ordered the fire roasted veal chop w/ wild rice tamale. again, both dishes were superb. my pork tenderloin was cooked to a perfect medium and the sauces that accompanied the dish were delicious, but spicy (which is good for me). that sweet potato tamale aided with the bold flavors. the veal chop was velvety, spicy, and absolutely great. \n\n3. sorry, we were too full and did not order desert.\n\noverall the total was around $120, but hey its vegas and you expect to spend that amount for a nice dinner! worth every penny. i'm coming back here and would recommend it!", 
            "loved it.  we went with another couple for dinner on a saturday night.  we made reservations.. the service was top notch.  i usually am the one at the table that finishes her water and then waits...for more.  i never had more than two sips out of my glass before it was full again.  it was awesome.  the waitress was outstanding.  \n\nnow the food.\nthey brought a basket of bread and let me tell you i was in heaven.  there was a raisin nut bread, a jalapeno bread and corn muffins.  they were so good we asked for another basket and finished it. \n\nmy husband and i had margaritas, me peach, him the special agave nectar one.  they were good.\n\nwe had the tiger shrimp+ <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> which was fine.  i didn't like the tamale much but the shrimp and sauce were wonderful.  next i had the grilled lamb porterhouse chops which were out of this world good.  i ate all of them save for the bites i gave around the table and it was a big portion...the tamale that came with it \"meh\" not so good but who had room for it.  my husband had the mango + spice crusted tuna steak and it was delicious too, not as good as my lamb but still really good.  our friend had the black bean soup - which was delicious and he also had the taco dish which i can't find on their online menu but he didn't think much of it.  our other friend had the chicken dish which is also not on the online menu and it was ok...it was chicken.  \n\nwe finished dinner off with the toasted coconut layer cake and it was so good i am now ruined for all coconut cake.  it had a coconut cream over the top of it and the layers were moist with i think a simple syrup.  it was so good.\n\ni want to go again as soon as possible.", 
            "ahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! someone please call bobby flay!! \n\nthe food here was not so great. i've never tried tex-mex food, but from this experience i don't think i will ever try tex-mex again. the restaurant is not at all fancy, but the minute my brother stepped in he was asked to take off his fedora hat. come on, its not a baseball cap!! \n\n***food:\n- they start you off with a basket of bread and this is probably the best thing in the restaurant (sad to say). the jalapeno and the blue berry bread were quite interesting and delicious. \n- i ordered the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> and it was mediocre. i've had better. \n- the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> was not the best. the bread was quite hard so i couldn't enjoy the sandwich.\n- the flavor of the <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> was pretty over-bearing in flavor. \n- the <mark>Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad</mark> was blah. the chicken was dry and nothing was great about it.\n\noverall, mesa grill you have disappointed me and you will definitely not see me again. you would think the restaurant being owned by an iron chief would be good, but i guess not.", 
            "go for appetizers, eat dinner elsewhere.  \n\nall of our starters were great (far better than the entrees).  of particular interest were the tiger shrimp & <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>.  they earned the 3rd star for this review all by themselves.",

            "mesa grill has an upbeat, modern vibe to it. lots of glass, light woods, and metal. the bar is off to the side as you enter and has a warm and inviting look about it. of course you have bobby flay swag for sale right in your face as you approach the hostess stand. i get why it's there, but it upped the tacky level more than i'd usually like (even in vegas). there were a fair number of people waiting, but we had reservations (party of 7) and our wait was less than 10 minutes.\n\nour server was fairly prompt to the table to take appetizer orders, but i had to tell him we needed a drink menu and the wine list first (sorry, this is something that should be noticed by a server). the wine list was decent, but nothing exceptional. prices ranged from 2.0x - 3.0x retail. we opted to do two bottles: one was a joel gott zinfandel and the other was a central coast syrah that carries the restaurant's private label. both were about $60 each. the zin was lovely, with a deep color, soft tannins, and all the mouthfeel you'd expect from a nice zinfandel. the syrah had nice flavor, but was a tad tight on its own. i figured it would shine with some of the meat dishes and it did pair very well with the entrees.\n\nnoise levels in the dining area were pretty loud, but it was also a friday night in vegas and the place was busy. as for the service after we ordered, well it can be summed up with one word: s-l-o-w. our apps took a while to appear and the entrees took even longer after that. close to 30 mins between app plates being removed and entree plates being brought. the server really wasn't checking in very often either and was pretty much invisible after our entrees came.\n\nthe menu is all about showcasing bobby's flair for all things southwestern and you won't find much that doesn't have at least some corn, chile, salsa, and/or spice. appetizers were all in the $10 - 16 range and entrees started at about $30 with most meat dishes over $40. sides are separate (of course) and they're $8 a pop. we ordered a lot of food for seven people, so i will only get into the highlights and lowlights of the dinner:\n\nmenu highlights\n\n    * spanish chorizo quesadilla - this was by far the best thing on the appetizer menu (and arguably on the whole menu). it is served up with grilled green onions, artichokes and a smoky salsa. a fried egg adorns the top of the totrilla to complete the package. this was awesome. the flavors all work together and the chorizo had nice bite without overpowering the dish.\n    * coffee rubbed filet mignon - this was a nice sized filet, cooked perfectly to the requested medium rare. it came with a mushroom reduction sauced spiked with ancho chile. it was very tasty and the coffee rub added a nice nuance to the dish. the person eating it was kind enough to share some of it with us. i knew by the size of the smile on his face that it was a winner before i even tried any of it.\n    * roasted corn - yes, this is a side dish, but it ranks as one of the better options on the menu. the corn kernels were crisp-tender and then tossed with cactus & lime. some cotija cheese is sprinkled on top for good measure, too. very tasty and worth the $8 for a bowl. \n\nmenu lowlights\n\n    * tiger shrimp & <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> - i figured this dish was a no-brainer in this restaurant, maybe that's why it was such a huge disappointment. the shrimp were a nice size, but overcooked and the textured of the tamale itself seemed way too dry. this went mostly uneaten. \n    * green chile ciopinno - flay is known for award winning ciopinno, but let's say that this was not the finest example. most of the seafood was overcooked, which was such a downer because the green chile broth was amazing (i'd order a bowl of the broth by itself if i could).\n    * salmon with ancho-honey glaze - this was a nice sized piece of salmon and, as opposed to the other seafood dishes, it was cooked perfectly. it was served with a spicy black bean sauce and a jalapeno crema. it all sounded like it would go well together, but it really amounted to just too much going on. on top of that, it was extremely salty. it all added up to a dish i wanted to forget about after a few bites. \n\nfinal take \n\nmesa grill was kind of a mixed bag for us. it did some things really well, but there were a lot of things that were 'meh', too. when you're talking about a place that was $100+ per person, i expect a bit more in the food and service department. if i had to do it over, i'd probably stick with having a drink and an app at the bar, then go get dinner elsewhere. my apologies to bobby, but this is one throwdown that he lost because this foodie feels you can do far better on the strip at this price point.\n\noverall grade = c+ (average)\n\nthe ev foodie", 
            "ok, where do i get started...let's see: \n\ndecor/staff: i personally loved the modern open space. lighting was to my satisfaction, color scheme and decorations were exciting. staff was cordial and had good timing. but it absolutely sucked to be eating such a nice meal with a view of the sports betting area, watching two-bit bookies walk back and forth down the beaten path, swilling a high life. walls are non tinted glass so everyone strolling through the area is looking at you and vice versa. don't forget the added benefit of watching the sports betting area. tacky. well it is vegas! \n\nscore: minus -1 star. \n\nprices: \none expects to pay premium at celebrity chef's eatery but also expects great food. but even this seemed to have an extra vegas markup like everything else in vegas. \n\nscore: push \n\nfood/wine: \nok, i saved the best for last. the meal was good...really damned good! i love spices and after having tried mesa grill in manhattan, i knew i would like the food here. i dined with two of my nasa buddies and we started off with three appetizers and would share: \n\n- tiger shrimp + <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>: delicious! was my favorite of the three apps (i loved them all though). but 16 for 3 shrimp? c'mon, man! \n\n- blue corn pancake + bbq duck: another wonderful tasting app. never had bbq duck and couldn't get enough of it. really, because it was about the size of coffee cup in diameter. \n\n- cremini mushroom quesadilla: finally an app as big as it's price! actually this was quite tasty and loved the fried quail egg on top.. delish! \n\nfor my entree i had the fire roasted veal chop. it was maple glazed and served with a wild rice tamale. damn, this was good. after using utensils for as long as i could, i went caveman style grabbed to bone and chewed off the last remnants. yeah, it was that good. i tried a piece of the chipotle glazed bone-in rib eye...ahh hell yeah...i know what my next piece of meat at mesa grill will be. \n\nwe shared a 2006 (?) bottle of the shafer relentless and it was probably the best bottle of wine i 've ordered at a restaurant in a long time. it had a price to match it's taste, as well. i did think the wine list was a little unimpressive though.\n\nscore: 5 starts \n\nit's really annoying and distracting to see the same guy about ten times over the course dinner, obviously placing bets for a number of people in the sports betting area. he literally walked into and out of view so much that we started betting on when he would pass by again. that plus seeing people wheel by with their luggage took away from a very enjoyable meal.", 
            "inconsistent at best.  great expectations entering this food network star restaurant.  after sampling the best tamale i have ever had, a, <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> with a luscious cream sauce, the dinner went straight downhill.  a 22 oz bone-in ribeye did not have the customary vegas char for a medium-rare that i have gotten used to in this great steak town.  while i could live with that, the relish served pepper relish served on the steak and the ancho and chimichurri sauce served on the plate were cold.  the twice baked potato was mediocre and the pear upside down cake was easily forgotten.  not worth the price.", 
            "my wife and i heard many good things about mesa grill, so we decided to give it a try.  we went in around noon for lunch on a thursday and the restaurant was pretty empty.  the waiter promptly told us the specials and asked if we know who bobby flay is.  it seems like they are trained to talk about the iron chef.\n\nwe ordered the shrimp + <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> for appetizer, <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark>, and green chile burger for entrees.\n\nsince bobby flay is known for his sauces, the tamale came with a very creamy garlic sauce that complements the entire dish.  for the salmon, it came with a light black bean, bbq, and honey sauce.  also, it is topped with fresh green salsa that refreshes the palate with every bite.  my wife stated that it was the best salmon she's ever had.  the green chile burger is also very interesting.  the sour component that usually comes from ketchup is replaced with green chile instead.  the patty is also very tasty and moist.\n\noverall, we really enjoy the food and the service at mesa grill.  we will definitely visit it again when we come back to las vegas.", 
            "dined at mesa grill before christmas.  the server was helpful and provided good suggestions on dishes.  we ordered the following items:\n\n1. tiger shrimp and <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> (4 stars)\ngood flavor and nice texture.  just simply delicious.  \n\n2. coffee rubbed filet mignon (3 stars)\nnicely cooked medium rare.  didn't quite get the coffee taste.  the rubbed crust didn't do much for the dish in my opinion\n\n3. mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin (4 stars)\nthe dish was nicely cooked with big flavors.  the spiciness wasn't overpowering, and you can taste the layering of flavors.  the sweet potato tamale was wonderful.  this is the signature dish that everyone should try at mesa grill.\n\n4. churros (2 stars)\nthe chocolate dip provided good flavor, but the churros were fried for a little too long.  the center became too dry.  i still think rick bayless' xoco in chicago has the best churros.",

            "i must confess that the main reason i came to mesa grill (out of all the restaurants in las vegas) is because i have a cowboy brush on bobby flay. despite most negative opinions of celebrity chefs, i think many of them can cook well. personally, i enjoyed dining at mesa grill. \n\nmy friend and i came on a sunday afternoon for brunch. we were both impressed by their staff's cordial and professional service. there was a complimentary bread basket which i was very impressed with and a wide selection of water, yes water, to chose from. so service receives 5 stars. based on the number of parties i saw in the restaurant, reservations are probably not necessary for lunch or brunch. but it might be otherwise for dinner.\n\nwe started off with chef flay's famous tiger shrimp and <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>. i think this appetizer was definitely true to flay's southwestern stile and is a must try. the shrimp was cooked perfectly, tender and sweet; <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> was fresh and fluffy and the his signature sauces were extremely flavorful. each bite has a familiar spice kick.\n\nthen, we ordered the bbq <mark>Barbecued Lamb Cobb Salad</mark> and the eggs + aged strip loin tortilla. the <mark>Barbecued Lamb Cobb Salad</mark> and lamb were divine! i loved the buttermilk dressing, so good!  the tortilla dish was on the mediocre side and made me wish i ordered the spicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> (which has been on the menu for the last 8? years) however, i was mainly looking for a steak for lunch so it satisfied for cravings. honestly, i could have gone without the egg and myriad of relishes (very beautifully plated) because the strip loin was cooked really well (medium rare, which i think is how all good meat should be cooked). it was incredibly tender and melts in your mouth. i will definitely have to come back for dinner to try his mexican spiced pork tenderloin.\n\nalso, i loved the complimentary bread basket. the waiter describes what each bread piece is and each was delicious on its own. :)", 
            "mesa grill gets 3.5 stars in my book.\n\n3 of us came here for brunch on a saturday around 12pm and was told that there'd be a 10 minute wait.  i said to my friend -- there's a table right there, why do we have to wait? 10 minutes later, lo and behold -- which table do they give us? the one that has been empty this whole time.  maybe they just wanted to make it seem crowded with their lounge full of people waiting for a table.\n\nservice:\nservice was slow but decent.  it took a long time to get water refills but we did get everything that we asked for.  the 3 of us drank a ton of mimosas and quickly got really rowdy.  the server didn't seem to mind.\n\nfood:\n<mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>:\nwe shared the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> and it was the best thing that i ate at mesa grill.  the sauce was spot on, spicy and tangy and the prawns were cooked to perfection.  i believe the dish came with 4 prawns.\n\ncrispy bacon + <mark>Crispy Bacon  Hash Brown Quesadilla</mark>\ni wish i would have enjoyed this dish as it sounded super appetizing on the menu.  however, it was just ok in my opinion.  the bacon really wasn't crispy and the quesadilla was on the dry side.\n\n<mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark>\nthe eggs in this dish were prepared well.  it was decent, but nothing to write home about.\n\ngrits\nsurprisingly, the grits was one of the most flavorful items that came to the table.  we joked that we don't even know why we ordered grits but in the end we enjoyed it.\n\ni probably won't be returning to mesa grill since there are plenty of restaurants in vegas.  however, i would recommend it to someone who was looking for tex-mex with signature flavors that tends to be on the spicy-tangy side.  lunch was expensive but i think the prices are fair when compared to hotel cafes.\n\np.s. they have a delicious chocolate tequila on their dessert menu!", 
            "classmates of mine worked at mesa grill when i went there for a private dinner banquet on may 13, 2009.  so with the help of one of them, we were able to get a very good package at a reasonable price, especially compared to the quote we received from the banquet's department at caesar's palace.\n\nthe waitstaff were great at taking our orders and during the meal service.  the back private banquet room was fairly large and accommodated our large party (can't recall the exact number, but we had well north of 60 people, all seated in 3 long rows of tables).\n\nthe tiger shrimp + <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> with corn-cilantro sauce was simply delicious.  the tamale was top notch, and the flay-concocted corn-cilantro sauce will pair up nicely with other seafood and poultry dishes.  \n\n\nfor my entree, i selected bobby flay's signature dish \"new mexican spiced rubbed pork tenderloin, bourbon-ancho chile sauce + sweet potato tamale with crushed pecan butter\".  it was cooked perfectly and the flavors was very unique and complimented each other.  the sweet potato tamale was the best i have ever had.\n\ni tried a sample of my friend's \"coffee rubbed filet mignon, mushroom-ancho chile sauce\".  filet mignon was good, but aside from being tender (which is why most people order it) it lacked the flavor i crave from beef, but the accompaning mushroom-ancho chile sauce was super!\n\nthe blue corn crusted alaskan halibut + salsa cruda, sweet 100 tomatoes, capers, nicoise olives, fresh basil + oregano was also a nice fish entree.  and highly recommended.\n\ni know this review is based on a banquet experience instead of the more typical restaurant dining experience, but the food overall was good to great.  service was superb, and the price we were able to negotiate for the event was unbeatable (big thanks to mitch and the restaurant gm!!!)\n\ndecor: 4/5\nservice: 4.5/5\nfood: 4/5\n\nlooking forward to going back for more.", 
            "like others, i had really looked forward to eating here.  i was not thrilled i had to leave a credit card with my reservation, but got over it.  \nlovely decor, but nothing spectacular.\nhaving been in vegas and eaten here at some other celebrity chef restaurants, i was expecting the high prices.  the food did live up to my expectations here.  big, bold flavors (i had the pork, others at my table had the veal chop and the venison, and the same for those), perfectly cooked pork, delicious tamales, although a little sweet, went well with the very spicy pork and delicious sauce.  portions were great here, almost too much.  unlike the apps - small portions big prices.  duck \"taco\" - 1 small blue corn soft tortilla with about 3 tablespoons of duck -$16.00.  hard to share with 3 other people - about a tiny bite each! hard for me to understand the price,although it was tasty.  the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> with shrimp was delicious, a little better portion, but was described as having 4 jumbo shrimp - they were hardly jumbo, although we each did get one, and the flavors were good. again, overpriced at $14 or $16 i can't remember.\nbiggest disappointment was service.  friendly and knowledgeable, yes.\nwe ordered a pretty pricey bottle of wine, and when we ordered apps and told the waiter we would like to hold off on entrees for a few minutes, he basically informed us that we had to order everything at once, they were busy, yada yada yada.  there are few things that aggravate me more at a high end restaurant than when they dictate when i have to order what.  what is this, dennys?  they can't manage a simple delay of ordering entrees?  mostly, i just felt they were rushing us so they could fill up our table again.  big no,no for me.  \nif you are a bobby flay fan, and want ot see how close you come to making his food at home, eating here is a must. (it's not that hard to duplicate his recipes, they are fairly easy, and from this experience i see i can do it spot on).  the real true test for me of any restaurant is would i go back?\nnope!  there is a lot of great places in vegas i would go back to, and have, but this is not one of them.  easily duplicated, and very pricey, combined with dennys mentality on the service make it a one time only experience.", 
            "we showed up an hour before our dinner reservation because we were huuungrrry, and they accommodated us. the interior of the restaurant is quite nice, but the atmosphere is a bit too casual for the prices it carries.\n\nwe ordered the tiger shrimp with <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> and pan seared squid for appetizers. small portions but just enough and delicious to pique our appetite. the sauces are a tad too sweet. the tamale was very good, with fluffy texture and not seasoned to overwhelm the maiz. the squid was cooked perfectly, not too soft and not too chewy.\n\ni had the veal chop which was recommended medium. i usually take my steak medium rare, but it was cooked perfectly at medium. it was juicy, and i loved the sauce - a little sweet like the other dishes, but the subtle horseradish really gave it a kick. the wild rice tamale was tasty, too, not too sweet.\n\nothers in my party had the rib eye and the filet, both of which i sampled and found the sauce too sweet that it was hard to taste the meat. but my friends loved their dishes.\n\ndouble baked potatoes - delicious! again with a hint of horseradish, it was a great combination of flavors. brussel sprouts - way too sweet like candy and i didn't care for them. but that's my palate, and i'm sure some people like the sweet taste more than spicy.\n\nour waiter was attentive, and our water glasses were never empty.\nbetween the 4 of us, the bill was $300 including tax & tip, with no drinks or dessert. it was a tasty meal and we enjoyed the restaurant. but some of us were still hungry after the meal -- we could do with more filler food.",

(or that a hostess wants to go shopping).\n\nthen, of course, restaurants in casinos bring up another level of concern -- that their business model relies more on traveling salesmen's expense accounts rather than establishing themselves with a reputation for quality food and service.\n\nwith above suspicions in mind, i booked us for sat brunch, as i wasn't about to use up a valuable saturday vegas dinnertime with a place i suspected i was going to hate.\n\nall suspicions were immediately put to rest.\n\nwe were quickly seated and paired up with a very helpful waiter who was genuinely enthusiastic about what was on the menu.  and then, nobly atop the beer list:  aventinus doppelbock.  i was in a good mood.\n\nthen the food: a beautiful combination of sweet, spicy, hearty, and pretty, in particular,  the corn & <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> -- outstanding!  \n\nin other words, next time in vegas, i do intend to give up  -- nay, enjoy! -- a valuable saturday dinnertime there.",

            "we went here a couple of days ago for our 11th anniversary. we had planned to go last year for our anniversary but had to cancel as my wife was found out she had to have surgery and wasn't supposed to eat red meat in the meantime. now that she's all better, we decided to give it a try this year.\n\ni ordered a mesa margarita, and my wife ordered a prickly pear margarita. both were very good. i liked the taste of mine a little better, but the prickly pear was prettier. it had a pretty magenta color.\n\nwhile we were waiting for our appetizer, we were given a bread basket with three types of bread: corn bread muffin, jalapeno bread, and a nut bread. they were all very good. the corn bread was half regular corn and half blue corn which gave it an appealing appearance. my favorite was the jalapeno bread. it had a nice consistent flavoring of jalapeno without being overwhelming.\n\nfor appetizer we split the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>. the shrimp was perfectly cooked. it was like a deconstructed tamale. the shrimp was laid on top of the cornmeal. the sauce was very flavorful, and the dish was well-balanced.\n\nfor our entrees we had the pork tenderloin and the veal chop. the pork tenderloin was perfectly cooked and tender. the sauce wasn't quite as flavorful as i had hoped for, but it was still delicious.\n\nthe veal chop was also perfectly cooked and tender. the seasoning was spot on.\n\nboth entrees were served with a cornmeal tamale thingy that was presented like a baked potato. it was very good and was an interesting presentation. \n\nfor our side, we split the brussels sprouts with pomegranate seeds and pecans. it was an interesting mix of flavors and colors. i never would have thought of combining brussels sprouts and pomegranate seeds, but it definitely worked.\n\nwe took half of our meals to go and were too stuffed to order dessert, though there were definitely some appealing selections on the dessert menu. maybe next time.\n\nwhile we were waiting for our entree my wife asked if there was a celebrity behind her. i thought that was an odd question and asked her why she asked. we were sitting near the kitchen and she said all of the kitchen workers were looking at someone behind her. i glanced over and saw tyra banks sitting a few tables over. apparently she was at caesar's for celine dion's rehearsal show as we later saw her in line to get into the show.\n\nthe service was a little slow, and even though we got there before the evening rush, we had a lengthy wait between our appetizer and our main course. because of this, i'd give mesa 4.5 stars. as we can't pick half stars, i'm gonna round-up and pick 5 stars.", 
            "it's not your average tex-mex spot. the food is fabulous & i can't recall seeing rice and beans on the menu, which was a plus. i personally feel there are more things to tex-mex cooking than those two staples.  \n\nat any rate, we were a party of three & we all thought the food was great. the menu prices were to be expected, after all we were @ ceasar's palace. the service was impecable.\n\nthe bread was fabulous, but don't fill up on it. we ordered a <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> as an appetizer. it was so good, i needed to be home to eat it. the masa was so flavorful that you would want to eat the husk. the only problem was that you get just one @ a cost of about $16., let's not forget it was great!! \n\ni ordered the lobster, it was better than i ever expected. i simply melted in my mouth. i was happy to see that it was a whole lobster & not the tail weighing in @ about 1.5lbs., cooked to perfection. the sides are ordered ala cart & they are large enough to share,. \n\nmy cousin's ordered the bone-in steak & the other the salmon. they stated it was very good & i'm sure it was but i know it couldn;t be as good as my lobster.\n\nfor dessert, i had the creme brule. anytime i see it on the menu, i feel it my duty to order. it was also great. beverages were fantastic, top shelf all the way.\n\nif you want a 5 star meal @ a reasonable price. this is the place", 
            "i was extremely excited to try mesa grill during my recent trip to las vegas and i must say i was not disappointed. the iron chef blew my mind! \n\nmy boyfriend and i made lunch reservations and we were promptly seated even though we got there about fifteen minutes early. the service continued to be wonderful. we were being very clumsy that day - i accidentally spilled my glass of water and my boyfriend dropped his knife on the floor and each time they ran over and replaced the things we needed. i kept apologizing for spilling but the waiter was very nice and told me not to worry about it. \n\n both of us decided to order from the prix fixe menu, since that would give us the most bang for our buck (three courses for $30). my boyfriend ordered the sweet potato soup topped with smoked chiles, maple crema, and marcona almonds for his appetizer and the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> for his entree. i had the tiger shrimp, roasted garlic, <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> with cilantro sauce for my appetizer. i have always lived in places that have given me the best access to fresh seafood, but this was seriously the best shrimp i have ever had in my life! then i had the pan seared wild striped bass with roasted yellow pepper grits and yellow pepper romesco. all the flavors were so complex. there were so many sauces - spicy, sweet, salty, creamy - it really made the food exciting! we topped it all off with vanilla bean panna cotta with macerated berries. they let the berries soak in grand marnier for two days. yum! \n\nwe were so stuffed by the end that we practically had to roll out of the restaurant, but the deal was so good that we could not resist (plus we did not need to spend money for dinner that night). definitely eat here! you will not be disappointed!", 
            "a must-eat-at restaurant. my husband and i wanted to eat at a big name chef's restaurant this trip and had already tried emeril's fish house (also wonderful). after becoming addicted to the food network's competition shows i was excited to eat at a bobby flay restaurant - and caesar's is always fun to walk through.\n\nwe had 10:45 a.m. reservations for the saturday brunch - it's our lunch hour our in our home time zone! we each ordered an appetizer. the tiger shrimp and <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> is worth writing home about - amazing flavors in this unconventional tamale. also tried the goat cheese queso fundido as the suggestion of the waiter - another home run. i was in the mood for a burger so i got the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> - very good, the grilled vidalia onions were the secret to the taste for me. the fries were not as good as i had hoped, but by that point i was so full that was fine. my husband ordered off the specials - a six shrimp / two tortilla taco plate served with three sauces - a guacamole spread, mango puree and green tomatillo. we both liked the mango the best. the guacamole was great on the burger.\n\nthis visit to mesa grill reinforced why bobby flay get's the accolades he gets - you must eat here.",

            "bf and i are a big fan of bobby flay, so we were pretty excited to eat at mesa. sadly, bobby was not there, and to my chagrin our server said we just missed him; he was there the week before. ah well. \n\nthe restaurant is bright and elegantly decorated, colorful, and all the waitstaff were very professional and friendly. they have several lounge \"cubicles\" to wait while your table is being setup too, which i thought was pretty smart for groups that are waiting - you can still talk and everyone can sit and face each other while you wait. \n\nwe ate:\n3 course meal of: \n1) blue corn pancake: bbq duck + habanero chile + star anise sauce - pretty good, but a little on the salty side\n2) <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark>: pretty good, light and fresh, came with mexican spiced fries too that were really good. this is what everyone calls the #1 dish here, but i really think that award goes to the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> (below). \n3) panna cotta: so good - nice and light and the fruit was soaked in some type of liquor and really fresh and ripe. \n\n\nothers:\nappetizers: \ncremini mushroom quesadilla: pretty good, but will try something else next time\n<mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>: omg i could eat this all day, every day, for the rest of my life. the shrimp was nicely seasoned and tender, not overcooked, the tamale was sweet and savory, the white corn was fresh and drowned in this yummy creamy corn sauce. yum....\n\nfriend got the chile rellenos, which was also quite good. melt in your mouth cheesy-ness. mmm\n\nget the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>!!", 
            "i was in town for a convention at caesars and was staying at the hotel.  i made a point of making a reservation a few weeks before arriving to eat at mesa grill while there with some co-workers.  plus, i'm a big fan of eating well when i can bill it back somewhere.  and boy did we bill a nice expensive 300 dollar 3 person meal.\n\nthe restaurant is a very fun festive atmosphere.  its right in the middle of the casino.  if i had one non menu related criticism, it would be the location within the casino.  it's right next to the sports book and its a very hectic location.  having said that, they do a good job isolating you from it once inside the restaurant.\n\nwe had dinner reservations so we were ordering from their dinner menu.  i personally had the venison entr\\u00e9e.  venison seems to be something you like or you absolutely avoid.  others at the table voiced their lifelong dislike for the dish.  i honestly don't discriminate when it comes to meats, so i was all in.  the dish comes with the venison filleted into three pieces and then you get a <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> as a side.  the venison was nothing like the gamy meats you often encounter when eating venison from backwoods hunting trips.  the fillet they served didn't have any more or less of a strong flavor than beef would have had.  the venison was topped with a smoky sauce to compliment the meat.  the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> was good, but it was a ho-hum side.  it wasn't terribly memorable.\n\ni also sampled the jalape\\u00f1o pork chops that another person dining with us had.  it was nice lean pork and the jalape\\u00f1o flavor was great spicy addition to the flavor that really made it pop.   its great to see a menu that wasn't scared to add some spice to the dishes.\n\nwe should have gotten one or two sides to share between the table.  there were others that were convinced we didn't need it.  i think that was a mistake in retrospect.  they're less than 10 dollars and would have complimented the smaller entr\\u00e9e portions.\n\nit was a great meal.  its the type of meal i wouldn't seek to have all the time but once in a while when i'm in town for a convention its great to endulge.  i would like to sample the lunch menu next time i'm in town.  if you're really looking to spend some money on a great meal don't skip mesa grill.", 
            "first off, the bread basket was surprisingly good and different from any other. it was southwestern inspired and def set the bar for mesa. that night we were served blue corn cornbread muffins, asiago cheese bread (somewhat like sourdough, perfect crust & cheesy flavor), and jalepeno cheddar bread (a hint of spice and lots of flavor).\n\nappetizers\nqueso fundido\nyum! made with goat cheese, so it was little on the sharp side, but man oh man-- it was addicting.\n\ntiger shrimp + <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>\nit was a meal on its own!! i loved this dish and wanted to steal it from my friend. the shrimp was plump and flavorful, the tamale was slightly sweet and the spicy, creamy sauces were perfect for the dish. i crave this.\n\n16-spice chicken\nthe juiciest, flavorful chicken that i have ever ordered at a restaurant. amazing. i'm usually a steak person, but i had the urge to order something less filling (so i wouldn't feel like a heffer at the club afterwards). the herb mashed potatoes were creamy, not too buttery, which was amazing with the crisp chicken skin. the cilantro sauce was just right- not too strong, and complimented the spices on the skin. i loved this dish and would recommend it.\n\nmy friends ordered the ribeye, pork tenderloin, and venison-- i tried a bite of each, but i don't think it's enough to judge the entire dish. they were all tasty though, nothing bad to say. love this restaurant though and i'm not even a huge bobby flay fan. he won me over and i'll be going back to mesa next time i'm in vegas.\n\nside note: the water guy was a ninja!!! he was on top of his game and we were really impressed!! obviously, partying in vegas means heavy drinking = dehydration = we needed lots of water to recover. this guy got a big tip from us.",

            "since so many reviews i'll keep this one short.  \n\nmy reivew is just about the food. the food is 5 star. i am ignoring things like location and atmosphere since when in vegas you have to give up on all of that anyway.  at least that's my experience (i'm not a vegas fan) \n\nif an opportunity to go to vegas comes up i usually accept it so i can go eat at mesa grill again. i love it that much. it's my favorite place to eat in vegas by miles. even the bread is amazing and makes me cry. \n\none dish that has blown me away every time is the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> appetizer. i usually share this then irritated because i should have ordered it all for me. it's so good i think about  from time to time then have this longing inside...like the longing i had for certain men in my 20's and 30's. ha! \n\npork tenderloin is a must for me as well.   i'm sure everyone out there knows this by now (but if not) pork tenderloin is leaner than chicken breast. yes, that's right, it's diet food. my only compaint from last week was the pork was undercooked. they did not ask how we wanted it cooked and i didn't think to request it as i thought pork was 'well done' by default? i guess that's not true anymore, so next time i'll be sure to request well done. this is the first time i didn't clear my plate.  but then i asked for more bread and started to cry again.\n\nthe food at mesa grill is fantastic!  i wish bobby would open a mesa grill here in orange county.", 
            "having grown up with basic cable, i never heard of bobby flay until my cousin suggested we try eating at mesa grill. the first time we went, we tried unsuccessfully at getting a table. the dinner wait can go up towards an hour, so plan accordingly. the second time we went, we strategically chose to come during lunch time and there was no wait at all. success!!!\n\npros:\n- shrimp and <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> - best freaking tamale ever. you have to order this.\n- complimentary bread basket -  southwest corn muffin, jalapeno and cheese bread, and cranberry and walnut bread. everything was delicious.\n- ambiance and decor - that wood panel ceiling is incredible.\n- service: attentive, kept our water and bread basket refilled. \n\ncons:\n- they make you take your hat off! it felt a little intrusive, but i guess mesa grill is a nice enough place, where they can request such things. \n- depending on what you order, the food can be so heavy, my cousin and i were in a food coma for hours, and we only shared an appetizer and entree. \n- spicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> - more an appetizer to be shared than an entree on its own. i got tired of it towards the very end of sharing, so i couldn't imagine having it all for myself.", 
            "went with a group of friends.  we're on a celebrity chef kick and were looking forward to trying bobby flay's food.  also, been wanting to trying it as i wanted to take my mom who i suspect is in love with bobby flay.\n\n#1, even with reservations, you cannot be seated unless your whole party is there.  we were never instructed/given the suggestion of having drinks at the bar.  though bar was quite crowded anyway.  the result was a very number of us, maybe 20 or so, standing in the reception area.  a bit of a crowd and much jostling about as people were coming and going and waiters/waitresses were trying to pass by.\n\nwait staff seated us and gave menus promptly.  no specials mentioned and they seemed frazzled, sunday night over memorial day.  had the cactus pear margarita.  very good.  had asked if bartender could make a jalapeno mojito but apparently he didn't know how (don't have a fancy smartphone to google recipe?).  bartender was kind enough to get us the recipe for the drink though.  wait staff continued to underimpress us as a fine dining experience but were adequate if we pretended we were at outbacks.\n\nso the night before we watched a rerun of best things i ever ate vegas.  mentioned was the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>.  wow, it certainly was pretty mediocre.  sauce and shrimp was cooked well but that was one dry tamale.  we ate the shrimp and left the rest of tamale.  also had the duck tacos.  the duck was a bit overcooked but the sauce was good.\n\nonto food, pork tenderloin was tasty, chicken was dry and husband's rib eye steak was mediocre.  i ordered the tuna steak.  i ordered it rare and it came out medium well, there was a light pink center with canned tuna tasting outer layer.  promptly sent back.  they redid and it was ok but it was obvious the grill master did not have the grill high enough for sufficient crisping of the outer layer. we ordered some <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> and corn pudding.  the tamale went mostly uneaten after the first bite and the corn pudding was salty.  we were so disappointed we decided to head elsewhere for dessert.  total bill was $450+tip for 4 people and drinks.  \n\nhaving eaten at rick bayless's restaurant topo in chicago, the difference between having the chef on site vs only their name plastered on the door is remarkable.  on a wed, bayless was there with a stained apron, sweating away in the kitchen.  it's been 2 years and i still remember that remarkable restaurant.  i will remember this restaurant only in terms of it's disappointments.  all hype and no substance.  may try his flagship in nyc, hopefully will be better but not much inspired to do so after this flop.",

            "first i am a celebrity chef fiend. i look for and find all these places they operate/own/are affiliated with and dont stop bugging till my bf takes me. \n\nmesa grill was close to the top of that list and finally this year we went. reservations are very necessary for dinner. it gets packed. prices are well a little ridonkulous but expected. their margaritas are strong and good not overpowering and pink! (well some are anyway, at least the one i got was) \n\nwe gorged on the bread basket, blue corn jalapeno something and raisin bread and just a bunch of yummy stuff. well here comes the four stars...it's just my personal taste...i love bobby, i thought the food was good but the entree selection (like at most of these celebrity chef places) was limited and typically that's fine but i guess none of the proteins stood out terribly and i really wasnt in the mood to pay over 30 bucks for bbq chicken. i'm not a fan of bbq, some other sauce maybe? more poultry selections and less selections of steak by the ounce would have been nice. you can have great steak anywhere i wanted signature stuff. \n\nwell as i mentioned earlier we piggies made the mistake of eating all the bread and when we saw the entrees were limited to like 6 choices other than the 3 sizes of steak we decided to order two apps each and try a bunch of different things. we asked the waiter a whole bunch of questions and let him steer us in the right direction. we ended up getting the two different quesadillas (chicken and black bean and the wild mushroom one) but we both got our own tiger shrimp and <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>. we weren't in the sharing mood. \n\nbig mistake! it was soooo much food! four appetizers for two ppl and two drinks was more than enough food, plus the bread basket...we couldnt even consider dessert (which makes me sad :( i love dessert but i was about to explode). \n\nthe quesadillas weren't huge but they were a good portion i couldnt finish a whole mushroom one b/c it was very rich (cheesy) but sooo freaking good with the mix of cheeses fontina  i think and cotija and this basil/cilantro green chili concoction over the whole thing and and a big ass fried egg with a slightly runny yolk that tied the whole thing together. wow.  amazing.  my bf's chicken one was really good too but very different less rich and had a great chipotle chili sauce (very mild). i couldnt decide which i liked better though i think you could get through more of the chicken/black bean one b/c it wasn't as rich. \n\nthe <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>.....was.....like my aunt's if she were to make tamales out of shrimp. yes that means it tastes like food my family could make but that's a good thing. and i'm only referring to the corn meal part of the tamale. it was flavored beautifully not overly lard-y which always happens at southwest places eww. but the shrimp sauce that was 5 star chef stuff all the way. again after attempting to tackle the entire quesadilla (got through 3/4!) eating the whole tamale was not gonna happen but i made a valiant effort. \n\nin the end we were left very satisfied, aka full and with 4 apps and two cactus (prickly pear) margaritas plus tax and tip we paid about 115....ya it was a special dinner and it was bobby flay's place...otherwise ya 4 apps..100 bucks!...ok well 25 of it is two drink but still! you get the point. \n\nbut you gotta try this place!",

            "i get nervous going to a celebrity chef's restaurant. people love their shows, their recipes and even their tv personality, so the excellence of their restaurant and food are normally blown way out of proportion. however, with mesa grill, i was pleasantly surprised to find out that i was wrong in thinking the food was going to be simply mediocre and left more than satisfied with the 1000+ calories i had just happily consumed.\n\nwhen i sat down i immediately told the server that i was gluten-free. without flinching, he told me that most of the food is gluten-free, but if not, they can substitute the sides, etc, so i won't become ill. this was most relieving since 1/2 the restaurants i have gone to in vegas don't know what gluten-free means, so this was a great start to the meal.\n\nafter watching the show \"the best thing i ever ate: vegas,\" i had to come and try the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>. i asked the server if it was gluten-free and he said absolutely. my fiance told him to definitely get a start on that tamale with a massive smile on his face and the server obliged. however, before he left he told us about the specials and showed how real restaurants should be training their staff. very professional. very friendly. very fantastic.\n\noh the tiger shrimp. i could bathe in the sauce. i envisioned myself swimming in it last night. i could put it on everything and even though my heart would scream each day, it would be worth the lipitor. great flavors, fresh, succulent shrimp and just a small amount of heat. if you are not a fan of garlic, stay away, because unlike the heat, there was a plentiful amount of garlic to keep any creepy twilight vampire away for years.\n\ni cannot say very much about the chile relleno my fiance ate because 1. it was not gluten-free, but most importantly, 2. it was gone in ten minutes. the only reason it took him that long to eat the chile was because we had just eaten a massive <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> and split a bottle of wine. also, once in a while we try to act like we're classy and not inhale our food. all i know is that seeing the cheese slowly pouring out of the chile when he broke the shell reminded me why i love cheese and why it is so dang good.\n\ni ordered the spicy chicken. when you place the words, spicy, chicken and hollandaise sauce all in the same sentence i will pounce on whatever it is immediately. the fact that i was in a breakfast mood was only boosted by the perfectly poached egg on top. texture city and oh the flavors! even though i wish it was actually spicy (please note that i am korean and burn my tastebuds off every other day with chili paste), it was really perfect. first, i picked off a couple pieces of the chicken and then just broke into that poached egg and let it smother the spicy chicken in its happiness. then i would roll a forkful around in the green hollandaise and all cravings, protein, brunch and fatty goodness were satisfied in one quick bite. it took me a long time to eat it because i was still full from the tamale, but you can't take a poached egg as a leftover while walking around in 100 degree weather. i was forced to eat it all. for shame.\n\nyou should go here. great service, the food is creative, colorful and absolutely solid. you will be full, satisfied and leave from this restaurant content and rubbing your belly in sheer delight as you muffin top your way back to your room and pass out from a pleasant food coma.", 
            "my wife and i both spent our birthday dinners here one year because it was so good! the family went out with us to vegas and stayed the weekend at caesar's for her birthday. what better place to spend it than downstairs in the casino at mesa grill. i had called ahead since we had a party of 8 and they took good care of us! they had a separate room set for us so it just added to the experience. everything from the drinks to the food is perfect. both times we've been here we've never been disappointed, from the food to the service. but the food! this is where i fell in love with sweet <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>. the chefs really know how to balance the heat of the chilies, you get a little zing but the flavors in the food are just right. this place is a must...i can't wait to stop in again next time we're in vegas.",

            "upon walking into the restaurant, we'd given our name and were seated within one minute. the hosts were friendly. the restaurant itself is beautiful! we were at the table maybe two minutes before our server (the amazing encina) came over with our menus and a mouth-watering description of the night's specials. we were taken aback by the amazing service and care, not only because encina and the rest of the staff care about their food and their customers but also because lillie's noodle house and grotto ristorante at the golden nugget were such a shit-show with their horrific excuses for service (see those reviews for why).\n\nshe gave us a few minutes to peruse the drink menu and came back with waters before taking our order. we couldn't resist asking for her favorite appetizers and ended up getting two amazing appetizers:\n-roasted corn soup: the soup itself is light and sweet, a delicious puree of sweet corn.  it came out warm and had a slight bit of heat that lingered in your mouth. it was perfectly seasoned and a great way to begin our meal.\n-chicken and black bean quesadilla: it's a great appetizer for four or two. the tortilla was crispy and had a little char to it. inside, the cheese and meat mingled amazingly. on top, the cotija and quacamole beckoned us to the plate like sirens.\n\nwe got our drinks and commented on how the meal was batting-a-thousand so far.\nwhite peach margarita (my friend and one of my brothers): the sweetest of the bunch. tasty and light; great balance between the tequila and white peach flavors.\ncadillac margarita (my other brother): i like to taste my alcohol when i'm drinking and a caddy guarantees that i will. this was a great margarita!\ncactus pear margarita (my drink): i ordered this one because of the rave reviews on yelp and it didn't disappoint. it wasn't too sweet and packed a nice punch. the flavor was great.\n\nencina was back within ten minutes to take our orders. here's what we got (and loved):\n-mango and spice crusted tuna: good god almighty this was good (for an agnostic guy to say this is saying something)!!! the tuna was cooked perfectly. the spicy sear on the outside was enough of a crunch to perfectly contrast the tender tuna. the mango glaze the accompanied the fish was sweet enough to enhance the fish without being too sweet or overpowering. the pine-nut cous cous was soft and delicious. the green and red peppercorn sauces on the plate were the perfect accent. the peppercorns were a soft burst of peppery goodness.\n-sixteen spice chicken: although not the route i would have gone, this was really good. for those who want to play it safe. the chicken was tender and the sixteen spices were definitely a party in my mouth, but chicken just isn't adventurous for me. my brother loved it; we both agreed that the spiciness level was great.\n-coffee rubbed filet mignon: the meat was incredibly tender and juicy. the rub on the outside could very well be the best thing ever put onto a piece of meat. the coffee shined through enough that you knew it was there, but didn't take over the dish. the mushroom-ancho chile sauce was the perfect sauce.\n-grilled lamb porterhouse chops: these were incredible!!! the spices were just right and the meat was tender. the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> was delicious as well.\n\nencina checked on us throughout the meal and kept us laughing. once we were done, she put down the drink menu and the desert menu and said, \"now, i know you're not leaving without another drink and some desert!\" she knew us too well!!! here's the grand finale:\n-pomegranate martini (friend): light on pomegranate taste. tasted a little cough-syrupy. she was not impressed, but our tastebuds may have needed a nap after the amazing dinner we had.\n-mesa pisco sour: very nice! the alcohol shone through without being too much.\n-mango buttermilk upside down cake: not enough to share for more than two, but i was really the only one who wanted desert so it was perfect for everyone to have a taste. the cake was nice, light, and warm. the caramel rum sauce was fantastic and the mango ice cream was great.\n\nwe got to talking about how it was my birthday. at another table, i guess encina heard us. she said, \"i wasn't eavesdropping or anything, but did i hear a birthday over here?\" they pointed to me and she replied, \"ok. don't go anywhere\" and sprinted across the restaurant. she came back, told me to close my eyes as she lit a candle and placed it in a small ramekin of their homemade vanilla-bean whipped cream (best ever!). she told me to make a wish before i opened my eyes and said, \"from my heart, happy birthday.\" it was one of the nicest restaurant birthdays i've ever had.\n\noverall, we couldn't have been happier with dropping close to $300 on a dinner for four. the food was amazing! the service was spectacular. encina is incredibly sweet and takes care of you. she took the absolute best care of us.\n\ndo yourself and your tastebuds a favor and eat at mesa grill!", 
            "amazing, amazing, amazing! every single aspect of this dining experience was stellar. mesa grill was on my radar before arriving in lv so my boyfriend and i decided to make reservations for dinner at around 9:30p on a friday evening. i'm sure there's some room for walk-ins, but i would definitely make reservations in advance if you're planning on going during prime dinner hours. \n\nbobby flay really put together an incredible menu from start to finish. we started out with the roasted tiger shrimp + <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> which kicked off the meal perfectly. all the flavors in the dish just worked together perfectly. we opted to nab two sides instead of a second appetizer and decided on the roasted corn and the cornmeal-crusted chile relleno to go with our entrees. the corn could quite possibly be one of my favorite foods ever -- beyond delicious and seriously a must if you're ordering a side. the chile was great, though didn't quite have the same impact. being a pescetarian, the tuna steak was a pretty natural entree selection for me and it couldn't have been a better choice. a surprisingly big portion and all-around amazing plate. i should say though that we had entirely too much food. we could have just had our entrees and i would have been satisfied. one app + two entrees for two people is probably enough unless you're particularly hungry. by the end of the meal i was at the point where i was beyond full but couldn't seem to stop munching because it was so good! dessert wasn't even an option for us after over-ordering. when you pop in keep in mind that the portions are actually pretty good-sized (which is a pleasant surprise) and order accordingly. all around amazing. i would definitely come back again next time i'm in vegas!", 
            "got to eat here during las vegas restaurant week. it was so delicious!\ni absolutely loved the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> appetizer.  the crab cake was pretty good-- i have had better. the best part of the meal was dessert-- homemade peach cobbler with sweet cream corn ice cream! the ice cream was the best part of the meal! i told the server it was better than real corn and possibly the best thing i had ever eaten! if you can get here in the summer time--- ask for the sweet cream corn ice cream. i can't stop thinking about it!",

            "my husband took me here for my birthday along with two friends.  it was my first bobby flay experience and so i was looking forward to it.  i had little expectations just because it's in a hotel and i didn't know how tex mex would be in a casual fine dining atmosphere.  \n\nthe restaurant's atmosphere is great.  it's bright and welcoming.  this place is busy so definitely make reservations.  \n\nwe showed up early and we were told that they wouldn't be able to seat us until our reservations (completely fine), so we left and came back about 3 minutes before our reservation.  they were behind a little.  10 minutes pass and the host let us know that she didn't foret about us but tables were turning slow (loved that she acknowledged us) and then after another 5-10 minutes she came up to us and said that the restaurant would be buying us drinks for the wait (okay!) we sat about a half hour after our reservation and they immediately sent us out an appetizer to again apologize.  i was impressed with how they handled it.  i worked as a host for years and was happy to see that these hosts worked the front so well.\n\nafter we sat down we were greated by our server and started ordering our food.  everything came out perfectly from the corn bread to the filet mignon.  the rock <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> was oh so good!  i am not a rib eye fan but the flavor of the cut was so good!  i also had the duck pancake.  i would have eaten those all night.  i would stray from the double baked potato and get the corn if they have it on the menu as a side.  it was like eating candy (not sweet, just you don't want to stop eating it!) \n\nthe chef's in the kitchen are trained to perfection.  people it's not bobby flay cooking your steak and it's not him making your menu!  give credit where credit is deserved!  a lot of people don't realize it's just his name and face sometimes but his executive chef's and sous chefs do a lot of the grunt work and creativity! the presentations were beautiful as well.\n\nand i can't forget the backwaits.  our water glasses were never empty, our plates were whisked away silently and we were never bumped into when they were clearing other tables (even though the tables are very close together).\n\nthe prices of the food and drinks are expensive but what do you expect?  other than the quality being top notch you are in caesars eating at bobby flay.  if you don't like a perfectly cooked filet at $44 then go to denny's.  i think they have a $2.99 special from midnight to 6am.\n\nthis was a great meal. i would tell anyone going to vegas to try this place because you will not be disappointed!  i love seeing other foodies enjoy this place as much as i did!", 
            "great restaurant, great food. started with his special maragarita's which were very good. then my wife and i shared the sweet corn with <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> as an appetizer and finished the night with his spice rubbed pork tenderloin. flay has his way with. spice and it is done perfectly to bring out the great flavors of his wonderful meals. enjoyed it very much",

            "alright, i'll be honest. i'd been wanting to come to mesa grill ever since i saw that one episode of best thing i ever ate where the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> were featured. so when my boyfriend and i were about to head back home from our anniversary vacation i just had to get over to mesa grill to try that dish, and wow.. it was so good i'm still thinking about it a whole 11 hours later. if you love a creamy, buttery dish full of corn and shrimp, you will be a happy person. i cleaned my whole plate. though they only give you around 4 shrimps, you will still be happy because of the yummy sauce you can dip your complimentary bread into, and the masa, which i could seriously eat bowls of. my boyfriend ordered the blue corn pancake with bbq duck and he was very happy with it. i would definitely love to come back here again and try some more of bobby flay's yummy sounding dishes. i should also mention that we were seated promptly without a reservation, and our waiter was great.. knowledgeable about the menu, friendly, and helpful. oh and the womens' bathroom smelled like watermelon. an odd observation, but i had to share.", 
            "not much to add that hasn't been said before so i will reiterate what i found helpful. i've been for both brunch and dinner - equally amazing whichever way you go, but brunch is a serious fraction of the dinner cost (less than half). first tip: share everything.  it means you can experiment with more foods, and the portions are pretty crazy (especially the steaks).  personally, for my husband and i we do 2 apps, 1 steak and 2 sides for dinner.  for breakfast, we did 1 app and 2 entrees.  second tip: order the margarita that they advertise as the perfect margarita (it's pretty close).  third tip: order the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> appetizer, the one that was featured on the best food i ever ate (it is that good).  \n\nonly drawback is that the place is popular, which means a few things you have to just accept and move past so they don't ruin the experience: reservations on popular weekends have to be made weeks in advance (on halloween weekend we had to reserve with a credit card and $50 no show commitment), the reservation time doesn't always correlate to the time you will be seated (on busy nights the place is definitely overbooked), bar area is small so waiting for your table with a drink in hand is harder than it should be. lastly, while the servers have always been very knowledgeable, cool and have a pretty iron clad spiel to pump you up about the impending awesomeness of your meal, the front desk is a bit snotty (especially for a place with cowhide covered seats) and you just have to brush off the attitude.", 
            "everything i expected and more from bobby flay's restaurant. i was surprised that it was so casual as i saw many people decked in jeans and a t-shirt. but hey, it's right by a sports book area in caesar's palace. \n\ntiger shrimp and <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> was extremely tasty. might have liked it better than my entree. i got the salmon and wife got tuna steak. both were very good. my salmon had a fantastic crust with a semi-sweet ancho chile sauce. i was jealous of my wife's tuna steak. it was prepared rare as it's sashimi-grade of course and it was bangin! plating was awesome and the flavors popped with every bite. \n\nwe got the pomegranate brussel sprouts on the side. i was nervous because i've never had brussel sprouts and hear all the child horror stories. boy was i relieved. this side was awesome! the pomegranate pairing was perfect and the sprouts were full of this nutty, roasted flavor. yum-o!\n\ndon't know why he lost a michelin star a couple years ago but who cares, i give it a good year star.", 
            "let me first start off by saying that this was one of the places that i was more excited to visit than any other place because i think bobby flay is a bad ass.  i like watching food network and i bobby flay always tries to bring the heat. bring the flavor.  bobby flay, i would be embarrassed to have my name associated with this restaurant.  we were seated to our table, and our waiter came out to speed read us our menu and his recommendations.  i started with a bloody and when my wife stated that water was all she wanted, the waited ignored her and showed her the drink menu, gave more opinions of what he would have etc etc.  when she reiterated that all she wanted was water, he glared, yes folks, glared and walked away.  so our food came out real fast... too fast... as in yeah we had this made already and just warmed it up a touch.  i don't need my food made from scratch each and every time, i just don't want it to taste like it was made days ago and reheated.  so i had the  <mark>Mesa Burger</mark>. double cheddar cheese. grilled vidalia onion. horseradish mustard.  asked for medium rare/medium.  got medium well/well.  if you are going to ask me how i want it cooked you should try to adhere to that level of \"cookedness\" ;-)  the burger was lack luster from bun to burger to onion to my mouth.  nothing about this burger was good aside from the horseradish mustard, which had a nice kick.  if i wanted a mediocre burger i would go to applebee's or something like that.  at least there i would not be let down with a bad tasting burger, i would expect it.  tiger shrimp and <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> is what my wife had.  oh course i ate some too, sharing is caring.  we agreed that the shrimp was overcooked.  i think that this dish would have been pretty good if the shrimp was not overcooked.  it surely had the potential.  the tamale was great, soft moist flavorful.  no wonder this dish has been on the menu since the opening of the restaurant. so overall this place was a let down.  i was looking for flavor and heat, really did not get any of that here.  i was so rushed through my meal and my waiter was so rude that it made me feel like i was at a fast food restaurant.  it seemed, however just an assumption, that once we declared only one cocktail per our table, hey we drank all day gambling and needed a break, it felt like the waiter saw us as a low profit table, and treated us thus.  really wanted to like this place. ;-(", 
            "i had lofty expectations going in to mesa grill and i felt like everything was just \"meh.\" we went in with a party of 5 and got seated rather quickly for a sunday brunch. we had all heard great things about bobby flay's food and we really wanted to try it before we left. i got the signature <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> that bobby flay is known for and it was just sort of bland to me. the shrimp was perfectly cooked but the sauce was \"meh\" and there wasn't enough of it. i really wish there was more kick to it. our table also had the steak and egg which was just okay and my other friend ordered this cold sliced <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> that was actually the favorite of the table. it was very nicely seasoned and what we would have expected for bobby flay's food. also, they give you a nice bread basket at the start of the meal which was really good.\n\nthe service was also medicore (seemed like they wanted to get us out even though there was a bunch of empty seats). all in all, an okay place. i'll have to maybe try it again for dinner.", 
            "whoahhhh!!! now this is what i call a throw down!\n\nof course, i'm referencing bobby flay's inventive cuisine at his southwestern themed restaurant in caesar's palace, las vegas.   \n\nit was our first night and after winning a grip of change form the slots at caesar's, my friend suggested eating at mesa grill for din din.  i wasn't too familiar with the restaurant but when i realized it was bobby flay's joint, my interest was certainly piqued.  \n\ntruth be told, i'm not a flay fanatic by an stretch, but a little star power never hurt anyone imo.  with that said, there's always the pressing issue of hype over substance which in turn had me proceeding with cautious optimism.  \n\nas we made our way across the bustling casino and stepped into the restaurant, i definitely felt the warmth of the contemporary latin theme throughout the communal dining space, which was flanked with rich reds and soft golden hues. \n\nwithin moments, the hostess greeted us and proceeded to lead us to our seats.  our server wasted no time in taking our orders, as well.\n\nin record time, we got our beautifully plated appetizers and entrees. \nlet's just say my doubts melted away with my very first bite! wow, this food had big, bold flavor and the quality was incredible! \n\nhere's a rundown of what we had:\n\n<mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> - plump, juicy and mouthwatering gulf shrimp in a fresh corn meal that was both rich & flavorful. outstanding! \n\ntuna nachos - fresh chunks of seasoned ruby red tuna in a sweet & tangy sauce that had a pleasant citrusy finish. the crisp corn tortilla added a nice contrast in texture to this refreshingly vibrant dish! lip smacking goodness in every bite!\n\npork tenderloin - this dish was absolutely phenomenal!!! the meat was like a perfectly cooked filet! it was soft, buttery and rich. perfectly decadent and oh so flavorful! honestly, the meat was so tender, i kept asking my friends \"are you sure this is pork?\" \n\nspice filet - buttery, tender and succulent beef filet with a pleasant kick from the house spices! scrumptious!\n\nlamb chops - beautiful crust and perfectly pink inside. boasting a magnificent charbroiled flavor that was absolutely addicting! seconds please!\n\ncorn - fresh cuts of corm kernels with explosive flavor and fantastic texture. this is a side you don't wanna miss!\n\nafter consuming all that delicious food, we simply had no additional room for dessert. besides, wehad our minds set on some chocolate decadence at max brenner's afterwards (review forthcoming)\n\noverall, service was attentive, friendly and fast. the food, of course, was incredible and most importantly, it didn't break the bank either!\n\nwhy? because this birthday boy didn't have to pay...lol\n\nhappy eats!",

            "i really enjoyed this restaurant. \n\nfor drinks, i highly recommend the cactus pear margarita. i don't usually order margaritas, but i decided to order one here because it sounded good - and i must say - it was amazing! best margarita i've ever had. \n\nfor the food, we went with the servers recommendations. we ordered a few of the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, and the blue corn pancake. aside from the margarita, the appetizers were the highlight of the meal. amazing.\n\nfor the main course, we all decided to go with their specialty and ordered the pork tenderloin. it was actually a lot of food and was cooked perfectly. it had a bit of kick to it, so if you don't like spicy food, then this wouldn't be the dish for you. \n\nthe service was also great. my only complaint would be the timing of the meal. we got our drinks and appetizers super fast and then we seriously waited another 25 minutes to receive our main course. but other than that, this place is worth trying.", 
            "ever since our first visit we had been longing for a second try.  finally got to go to vegas for vacation again and we reserved for mesa right the way.\n\ntheir food is great as usual.  i couldn't resist ordering the ribeye again medium rare, and it's terrific as ever.  very nice crust on the outside, juicy meat on the inside.  and the sauce pairs so well with it.  my wife ordered the salmon this time, very moist and juicy, she loved it too.  for appetizer we ordered the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> and duck pancake.  but was done very well and very tasty.  mesa grill food are always on the strong side, but you never feel food being too overpowering and i could definitely have more.  \n\nhowever, food aside, i have to say we were not as impressed about their staff services this time around.  on our first visit it was fabulous.  this time our server was very nice but not top notch by my book.  \n\nthe staff at the front though really left us some bad taste.  first of all, when we made reservation, my wife clearly said 7 people, 4 adults and 3 kids.  when we arrived and checked, they said no only 6 people.  fine, things happen and i consider that innocent mistake.  but the staff didn't show any \"concern\" or \"eagerness\" to help fix the problem.\n\nending up my wife stood there for a few seconds and asked \"so is this going to be ok?\"  the male and female staff stood there, looked at each other, talked a bit, and said \"yeah it's fine\".  my wife then said \"ok, thanks.  we will be waiting outside because of the kids\".  both staff did not even acknowledged her, not even looked at her once. \n\nseriously?  to me it's very basic customer service to at least acknowledge your customers.  i don't even we were even asking for the unreasonable.  mesa is not the most expensive restaurant out there but still on the high side, so i personally expect better services overall.",

            "mehhhh! so we had 5pm dinner reservations for 6ppl. 3 of us arrived a few minutes early and checked in, the host advised us we wouldnt be seated until all of our party arrived and that our table wasnt ready. thr waiting area was packed and we sat at the bar. there were a ton of empty tables, but whatev. we ordered 2 partida margaritas and i asked for a frozen one but it was either straight or on the rocks... ok, when anyone thinks of a margarita they think of a yummy frozen drink. this was the second fail.  \n\nthe rest of our party arrived and we let the waitress know... but we still ended up waiting another 20mins. finally we get seated and our waitress gives us our menus and 2 mins later asks if we are ready to order, ahhh! no way man!\n\ni look at the menu and first im in price shock, but then i was like \"is this all?\" the selections werent impressive at all. i usually only eat chicken and here they had only one dish!!! they had a ton of meat and a lot of fish. the entree prices are 25$ and up. we ordered a few apps: the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, the chicken tacos, the chorizo meatballs, and some salads.\n\nok so heres the rundown!\n\nthe apps: ok so for 12$-18$ for apps i expect not just 1 tamale or 3 small balls... but this is what you get. the chorizo had a smooth texture, which i am not used to, and were sooo small! basically each of the 6 of us got half a ball. we also had to share 1 measly tamale and 3 chicken skewers and soft tortillas... ahh! \n\ndinner: i ordered 16 spice chicken. i noticed that the sides were 8$ each... what!? whatever we ended.up ordering 2 mashed potatos which to me were creamy and bland &some brussel sprouts. my chicken came and it was a piece of dark and light rubbed in what seemed like adobo spices. i tried it and it def needed salt imo and towards the middle it looked a little pink so i stopped eating it. sad face for sure. i ended up just eating some jalapeno bread and the dark piece.\n\nmy gringo friends love it here; i am not a fan. its a small amount of food for the price which was whatever. i didnt like that we had to wait for a reservation and my friend had to ask twice for items he ordered. the waitress was ok, a lil weird : ) we dropped 600$ with tip and they were acting like we were bothering them by asking them for things. oh well! i did love their paper towels in the bathroom!", 
            "we've been to mesa 5 times now... very cool atmosphere and a good variety of menu choices. i suggest splitting a few appetizers before your entree (blue corn duck pancakes, <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>). you get a variety of fresh bread and muffins before you order. good wine selection and strong cocktails. i've ordered the ribeye twice... once it was the best steak i ever had the second time it was a little too fatty. filet minon is good as well. i don't normally order desserts but you have to at mesa. churro's, coconut cake etc are great... the menu choices change with the seasons. if you go with a large party 10 or more you get a private room. ps- make reservations at least 30 days in advance!", 
            "i am a sucker for great food, and who isn't? but a was a little worried that mesa grill could be one of those \"just marketing\" or \"just name\" kind of restaurants, as bobby flay owns this. that was not the case.\n\nmesa grill delivers the goods. located in ceasar's palace, it does look a little unassuming from the outside, but once you go inside, you get the full perspective, sections and layers of levels make the most of the somewhat limited space. i strongly suggest you make reservations first.\n\nthe service is quite good, with a very knowledgeable waiter, who knows the menu by heart and can guide you and help you make the right decision. \n\nwe started off with the yucatan chicken tacos, the rough cut tuna nachos, the tiger shrimp with the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, and a crab cake. they were all good, but the tuna nachos and the tiger shrimp were just superb.\n\nour waiter told us that there are two dishes that made this restaurant famous, the spice rubbed pork tenderloin and the coffee rubbed filet mignon. my friends ordered the black angus new york strip steak and i ordered the spice rubbed pork tenderloin. my dish has to be one of the top 10 dishes i've had, period. you would not believe this was pork if they didn't tell you, it was tender and juicy, cooked just right.\n\nwe ate so much that we couldn't finish our dishes even though we tried to.\n\ni must say, that this place is on the pricier side, but this is vegas, and this was a memorable meal.\n\nmake mesa grill a stop on your next vegas trip.", 
            "this is the best restaurant i've been to in vegas.  make reservations in advance or you may not get in.  many of the other \"famous chef\" restaurants in town suffer from quality let-downs.  bobby flay's mesa is the one exception to this.   i have been to this place five times now in the past 5 years and it always wows me.  my two favorite appetizers are the tiger shrimp and <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> (a wonderful combination), and the blue corn pancake with bbq duck.  for entrees, you can't go wrong with the spice rubbed pork tenderloin - very tasty and tender, with a bit of zing.  the fresh fish is also good.  on my last trip we had the grilled dorado - which was tender and flavorful.  for sides, you have to try the grilled brussels sprouts with toasted pecans - even if you don't like brussels sprouts, you'll like these.", 
            "i am not a guy who likes trendy restaurants. so, i was apprehensive when our group of 6 selected mesa grill for a celebration dinner. let me just say that everything was as it should be.\n\nreservations: on time\nservice: the best\nstarters: the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> are incredible\nmain dish: fillets, pork tenderloin, tuna were all excellent\nprice: reasonable\n\ni know this is a tex mex restaurant and the food is spiced. my comment to our group was that my fillet was such a great cut of meat and so perfectly grilled that next time i would request no spice rub on it. it would have been perfect on its own.", 
            "bobby flay really knows how to do some great stuff with corn!  no sooner had we landed in the firey furnace of hell (aka vegas) then we dashed into caesar's and were promptly seated at a spacious table at the mesa grill.  the complimentary bread basket is like your own private bakery chock full of muffins and rolls and bread sticks and bread...made of different textures and colors of corn and whole grains. i loved the blue corn muffins so much that i ate my husband's and my brothers-in-law's and was tempted to creep my fingers over to the next table and swipe theirs too!\n\nmy husband ordered <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark> which arrived with a tiny glass decanter of simple syrup with which to sweeten it--but don't think they limited your selection to the simple syrup---they also offered all sorts of natural sugars and artificial sweeteners!  i go to nice places on occasion but i can't think of the last time i was so impressed with small details!   i felt like some kind of hillbilly!\n\ni ordered the fresh fish of the day which was tasty although i don't really remember it as much as the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> my husband ordered.  i can hardly wait to go back to vegas to have another one of those for myself!  one of my brothers-in-law ordered the <mark>Blue Corn Buttermilk Waffle</mark> with blackberry bourbon syrup and vanilla creme fraiche.  i have to say that it was delicious, but it was fourteen dollars, and compared to the other entrees we had at our table with meat and fresh seafood was comparatively priced--therefore overpriced.  i mean a waffle.  for fourteen bucks.  my other brother-in-law ordered the chilaquiles.  which were also very flavorful and complex.  \n\ni had never had blue corn before so i bought some bob's red mill blue cornmeal on amazon and have begun to experiment.  not quite ready for a bobby flay throwdown, however.", 
            "\"f***ing bobby flay!\" so says ari gold from the last season of entourage. yup, why's the grill master have to have food so good that i keep coming back every time i'm in town? i didn't realize till recently that after all these visits to mesa, i've never written a review. \n\nhere are some brunch items i've tried:\nany of the quesadillas they have on the menu. i had the crispy bacon and <mark>Crispy Bacon  Hash Brown Quesadilla</mark>. \nspicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> - good portions and a nice southwest twist on the regular corned beef hash.\n<mark>Mesa Burger</mark> - a sign of a good burger for me is one that needs no condiments, is juicy, and has a soft bun. this burger has it.\ni'm a sucker for pastries so their brunch bread basket is sooo delicious. the mini fresh scones were the best!\nthe <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark> was really refreshing as well and not too sweet.\nbased on my last waiter's suggestion, i'll have to try the steak and eggs next time.\n\nhere are my thoughts on dinner items i've tried:\ncremini mushroom quesadilla - i order this every time!\n<mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> - heard great things about it but was only ok.\nnew mexican spiced rubbed pork tenderloin - a very solid choice with just the right amount of heat. pork is very tender.\nfire roasted veal chop - this is my fav!\ni still need to try the bone-in ribeye at some point.\n\nyou can ask for a side of their special chipolte sauce. it's great for dipping with the quesadillas or even your fries. i finish my dinner off usually with the deep dish banana cream pie. never disappoints and guarantees that i end my dinner on a high note.\n\nstaff and service are always top notch. there's a side room that can be reserved for larger parties. beverages are constantly refilled. margaritas are tasty, but a bit on the pricier side. food is always solid. portions are just right. price is not unreasonable. i'm always satisfied.\n\nreservations are recommended.", 
            "4 stars for the tiger shrimp and <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>.  good but i didnt wow me.\n\n5 stars for the <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark>.  best salmon i had so far.  it was cooked perfectly!!!!",

            "outstanding.  great service.  the waiter was very knowledgeable about wines, even about  the great zinfandel  that we brought to dinner.  the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> was phenomenal, with layered flavors enhancing the perfectly prepared shrimp and corn.  the rabbit paired with israeli cous cous was one of the best dishes i have ever had.  i am not sue how to describe it, other than be sure that someone at your table gets it.\n\nmesa grill is definitely worth the money if you are looking for interesting eats!!!",

            "when i heard bobby flay owned this joint, i knew i had to try.... i watch iron chef religiously and i believe it caused my expectations to be alittle too high. \n\nbread basket: (yes, i consider this a course) disappointing. i like my bread warm and fresh from the oven. these offerings were too cold to enjoy. \n\nappetizers: got the <mark>Baby Romaine Salad</mark>, gala apple salad, and the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>. i could have skipped all these dishes and saved more room for dessert. the tamale was good, but the flavors didn't have me singing to the high heavens... and the salads left much to be desired. the <mark>Baby Romaine Salad</mark> lacked dressing and the croutons were way too soggy. the apple salad was mostly just chopped apple so it got too filling. \n\nmain course: definitely get the lamb chops or the <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark>. both were perfectly cooked and i licked my plates clean. delish!! however, skip the collard greens. they weren't worth the stomach room. but the table next to ours were raving about the brussels sprouts, so i wish i gave those a try. \n\ndessert: you can not leave the mesa grill without trying the sticky toffee pudding. when i took my first bite the clouds parted, angels were singing, and all the stars aligned. this dessert will go down in the books! yum, yum! \n\nbottom line: it was a good date night. more misses than hits for me. will i return? maybe if i'm craving some sticky toffee pudding.",

            "located inside the massive compound that is caesar's palace; mesa grill is brilliantly juxtaposed between the corinthian columns and marble statues of ancient greece and the impressive sports book and gaming tables of modern vegas.  the restaurant's facade is cool, it is elegant and refined, yet laid back and calls to mind the island feel of the caribbean.\n\nwe arrived a few minutes early for our reservation and were invited graciously to sit at the bar.  we promptly obtained drinks from the bartender, and were ushered to our table without issue.  however, our server seemed displeased that we had ordered drinks from the bar thus lessening his sale for our table.  we ordered two of the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> which arrived at an unsettlingly fast pace.  any hesitation by the \"fast-food\" speed with which they appeared was soon dashed by the overwhelming deliciousness that sprang forth from the plates.  having eaten at many superb restaurants i feel compelled to say that these are some of the best starters i have yet to experience.\n\nafter the table was cleared i sat in anticipation for the main courses to arrive.  our table had ordered two of the coffee rubbed filets, one of the black angus strips and one chipotle glazed ribeye as well as an order of collard greens, mashed potatoes and, upon recommendation of the server, an order of brussel sprouts.  my steak arrived and i noted how truly pleasing it was to the eye; however, i was disheartened that such an exquisite piece of meat seemed over powered by the bountiful amount of sauce on the plate.  once i had cut into my steak and taken a bite i was instantaneously reminded that this was chef bobby flay's house and his cooking was inextricably linked to him.  the protein on my plate was classic and refined and delicious, yet it had been arrogantly and flamboyantly altered to meet the needs of a chef's personality.  the two sauces on the plate competed with the beef and reminded me of an episode of \"throwdown\" except no one won, and my palate was an innocent bystander.\n\ni looked for solace in the sides on the table and it was then i noticed that the recommended sprouts were missing.  after some time, we got the server's attention and asked him to forget the sprouts since we probably wouldn't need them or have room for them at this point.  he blatantly disregarded this request and demanded that we try them, because to do so would somehow be a personal affront to him.  we yielded.  when the sprouts arrived they were undercooked and over-seasoned to the point of sheer carelessness.  we each sampled one for the humor of it but left them on the table as a comedic reminder of how far off this meal had gone.\n\nin summaton, this restaurant has the location, the ambience and the kitchen to be elite.  yet when given an opportunity to let the cuisine evolve into greatness, it seems the staff from the highest to lowest get in the way of their own success.",

            "one of my \"go to\" spots when i take my semi annual vegas trip. never been here for lunch but my dinners have always been superb. i almost always order the coffee rubbed fillet and typically some sort of starter (i saw a few people on yelp  complained about the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> but i have always found them to be quite good). also the bread basket is yummy! sour dough, tomato  and corn bread oh my! todo we are deeeefinately not in kansas anymore!  \n\njust one word to the wise... this is not your typical \"tex mex\" restaurant. sure i suppose it does have mexican flavors and some texan influence. but, you will not be getting refried beans, chili con queso and 5 dollars nachos.  after all people.. this is a bobby flay dining experience and he would never allow such typical dishes that lack innovation. \n\nin short, yessss i am a fan. my favorite restaurant in the world? no... but still one i go back to over and over again. if you are a foodie, this is 100 percent worth at least a meal or two.", 
            "lunch here was unexpectedly good!\n\ni had never ate at a bobby flay establishment before and was not really in a hurry to try.  truth be told i've never really been a fan of his but, after reading several reviews of some trusty yelp friends i decided to give this place a try.  the resto is located in caesar's palace.  the decor is warm but clean and open.  we came here during lunch with no reservation.  waited about 15min and was seated near the kitchen.  im realizing more and more that there are tables for 2 which i get but seriously can the tables be a little bigger!!!  i'm just saying!!\n\nso after looking over the menu i remembered that everyone was raving about the tamales so we ordered that, and another appetizer to share and our main.\n\n<mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> ~ first let me say the masa was very light unlike other tamales i've had.  the shrimp was plump and cooked perfectly.  the cilantro sauce was creamy but also very light and really brought the entire dish together.\n\nblue corn pancake ~ barbecued duck with habanero chile and star anise sauce.  holy moly i would have to say this was the star of the dining experience.  i never would have thought to sauce up duck with bbq.  this was a fantastic dish.  \n\nsmoked shrimp tacos ~ skewered shrimp with cabbage slaw and grilled tortillas.  it came with 3 salsas to use.  the shrimp had a decent smoke flavor to it.  there was not heat to it although it looked like there could be.  to me it was just your typical shrimp taco.  nothing too exciting.  the mango salsa with a bit of kick was really tasty.\n\ngrouper ~ i only had a bit of it.  the portion was really bit and had great flavor.  it didn't appear to be dry which i don't care for when eating fish.\n\nwe passed on dessert since lunch already started off late plus we had other plans.  all in all i would have to say it was a pleasant experience.  i would not mind coming back here to eat.  \n\neyes ~ warm and inviting decor.\nnose ~ even though we say near the kitchen there was not a smell that was present!\near ~ not very loud.  just your usual!\nmouth ~ duck in bbq sauce!\ntummy ~ very well satisfied!", 
            "my expectations may have been somewhat inflated as i sat down to dinner at mesa grill. the food was really good, though i wouldn't say it gave me an apr\\u00e8s dinner foodgasm. \n\nwe started with the tiger shrimp app with a <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>. it was flavorful and well spiced. i dare say it was the most interesting part of my meal. as a main we shared the lamb, which was quite good, with goat cheese tamales that disappointed all around. i mean, points for the intention (tamales and goat cheese! i expected to be in heaven! what happened?). the mashed potatoes and queso were sinful. the toffee bread pudding was delicious, but i couldn't help but compare it to another restaurant's to-die-for toffee pudding, and it didn't quite reach that level.\n\nsince i'm a fan of keeping it real, my first impression of mesa grill is that it would really shine if it were one price point lower and stayed in the mid $20s to low $30s range. of course, you're paying for the casino experience and the fact that it's bobby flay's baby. maybe i'll get another go at mesa in the future and try some other dishes. i will say there were a lot of good-looking choices on the menu.", 
            "***like a lot of upscale mexican restaurants (as well as vegas restaurants), bobby flay's mesa grill feels too expensive; the food is good though and the service is strong and friendly***\n\nbobby flay's mesa grill is one of the few upscale vegas restaurants open for lunch.  their lunch features a lot of lunch style plates--sandwiches and salads, but they actually also have several starters from their dinner menu and a few entrees.\n\nflay's food is southwestern style so there are a lot of mexican influences.  most of the dishes veer on the sweet and spicy side (though the food at mesa grill, at least what i've had, never gets that spicy).\n\nmesa grill is like a lot of upscale mexican restaurants.  it is quite pricey even though what's on the menu is the kind of food you can get at less expensive restaurants.  at least mesa grill uses more expensive ingredients like duck, ahi tuna and scallops.\n\nthe breadbasket at mesa grill was an assortment of cold bread.  there was a blue corn muffin, which while not dry, was too crumbly and a little bland.  the fruit and nut bread was decent, but the bread was a little soft and the fruit did not pop like the fruit in picasso's fruit and nut bread.  picasso's bread was heartier too.\n\nthe jalapeno bread was too soft as well.  there were a few jalapeno bits in it, but i think more of them would have made the bread more memorable.\n\ni started with the rough cut tuna nachos, which was chopped raw tuna mixed with a vinaigrette and capers.  the tuna came with a mango puree, avocado crema and habanero sauce.\n\nthe tuna was fresh, nicely moist and soft.  i really liked the sauces.  both the mango puree and avocado crema were very clean, smooth and creamy.  the mango puree was sweet but not overpowering while the avocado crema was cool and refreshing.  the habanero was noticeable and gave little pops of spiciness (though i think i personally would have preferred more heat).\n\nthe dish was served with two kinds of chips.  the best was the blue corn--light, thin and crispy.  i was not a fan of the other chip--it was thick, sandy on the outside and too mealy.  i've had that style of chip before, but i don't know what it's called.\n\nfor my entree, i went with one of their starters--tiger shrimp with a <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> and a sweet corn cream sauce.  i liked the shrimp--plump and moist.  i prefer shrimp with more color and seasoning, but this was still good.\n\nthe <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> was just okay.  it had a good corn flavor and moistness, but it was uneven.  parts of the tamale were not smooth; the masa clumped together and was even a little dry.  the corn cream sauce was not too heavy and was creamy and sweet.  even more so than the nachos, i think this dish could have used more heat.\n\nfor dessert, i went with their sticky toffee pudding, which was a big portion; it had a good flavor though it was a tad dry.  the sticky toffee pudding came with a salted cajeta, which had a great consistency--very fine, which made it feel more like a red wine reduction rather than a thick and sticky caramel.\n\nsome salted caramel desserts can have a mix of sweet and salty (whether just right or too salty) while others can be just a less-sweet caramel.  it was the latter with this salted cajeta.  the biggest salty component came from the salt sprinkled on top of the cake.\n\nthere was also some vanilla ice cream and it was creamy (and not icy at all), but there was too little of it.  the cake combined with the salted cajeta was quite sweet and there needed to be a different flavor to balance it out.\n\nservice was very good.  the food was upscale but still casual and approachable and this was very much in harmony with the service.  the service was definitely polite, professional and polished, but it was also quite friendly.  the food also came out at a quick pace.\n\nprices are high; mesa grill is probably overpriced, but that is often the case at vegas restaurants.  still, almost the entire lunch menu was below $20.\n\nin terms of decor/atmosphere, the contemporary room (which sits right next to the casino) had warm (but not garish) southwestern accents.  the room was nice enough, but it was not that memorable.\n\nmesa grill is a solid and satisfying vegas restaurant.  if you don't like upscale mexican spots because the food does not seem worth the extra cost, i'm not sure if mesa grill is going to change your mind (though i do think mesa grill is significantly better than some upscale mexican spots out there like border grill and the high quality ingredients like ahi tuna and veal chop from a previous trip are represented well).\n\nthere are definitely some well known vegas restaurants putting out subpar food, but i have not felt that way on my two trips to mesa grill.  for me, mesa grill is a good option for an upscale vegas lunch.\n\nmesa grill is located in caesars palace, which offers free parking (self and valet).", 
            "cuisine is outstanding - unique southwestern creations with excellent flavor.\n\napps\nhighly recommend the tiger shrimp & <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> - shrimp was juicy and the corn was a surprisingly perfect complement. pass on the blue corn bbq duck pancake, taste was fairly salty/heavy and one-dimensional. \n\nmains\nchile crusted rabbit was excellent - serving portion is manageable, plated with toasted couscous (excellent pairing) and fava beans. rabbit was perfectly roasted and flavorful, slightly gamey. there are only 3 steaks on feature - black angus ny strip, coffee-rubbed filet mignon and bone-in chipotle-glazed ribeye. coworker enjoyed the coffee-rubbed filet.\n\nsides\ncauliflower gratin with roasted poblano was delicious and creamy. double-baked potato with horseradish, scallion had a subtle horseradish note, which was a good complement to the meal. \n\nservice was attentive and helpful with recommendations. ambiance is fairly average.", 
            "i brought my honey to vegas last week and introduced him to the mesa grill.  he liked it so much that he asked me to cancel my reservations for the next evening and to just make another reservation here.  so, we ate there two nights in a row.  we have no shame.\n\nthe first night, we had goat cheese queso fundido and the lamb porterhouse, with cactus pear margaritas, and shared two desserts - the coconut cake and the chocolate bread pudding.\n\nthe queso fundido was even better than i remembered it.  i *love* this appetizer.  i could not get every little bit of cheese off the iron dish and that made me sad.   \n\nthe lamb was probably the best lamb we've ever had (and i'm a connoisseur of lamb, it is one of my favorite dishes.  the marinade was perfect - just a hint of mint and a hint of vinegar, not overwhelming at all, and i kept trying to sop up every little bit from my plate.  you get two thick steaks with the order, quite red in the center but absolutely delicious.  it comes with a goat cheese / chorizo tamale which is pretty good (not as good as the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> appetizer but still good).\n\nthe margaritas were good, but aside from being pink i didn't discern any particular flavor other than your normal lime margarita flavor.\n\nof the desserts we liked the coconut cake a lot but weren't too keen on the bread pudding as it was very bitter.  the coconut cake was a very large portion, easily split between 2-3 people.\n\nour server on the first night was excellent.\n\nthe second night we ordered the queso fundido again along with the duck pancake for appetizers.  i had the lamb again, my honey had the ribeye.  we skipped dessert and drinks.  the duck pancake we didn't find that exciting - it reminded my honey of barbeque pulled pork that we had recently but for much cheaper.  it tasted fine but you can do much better here.  the ribeye was good, honey was happy with it - though we both preferred the lamb.\n\nour server the second night was fine but nothing standout.  i think he actually disappeared partway through the meal and got replaced by someone else.\n\ni am upping my rating to 5 stars even though there were a few duds on the menu because between the lamb, queso fundido, <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> and the coconut cake one can get an amazing 5 star meal.",

            "the only reason this place gets business is because it is a bobby flay restaurant.  i was not impressed with the food at all.  \n\ni had a prickly cactus margarita (it was a delicious reddish pink color and was amazing) and hubs tried a mezcal (which is like tequila but isn't).  for starters, we went with the server's recommendation. she said it is the most \"popular\" appetizer - tiger shrimp with <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> and cilantro sauce.  this was small.  there were four medium sized (i think they were smaller than they should have been) shrimp with a tamale on the side. it really looked like the tamale was the main part of the dish and the shrimp were the side garnish.  there was nothing special about the shrimp. they looked like four cooked and peeled shrimp. i was pretty disappointed.\n\nfor the mains, hubs had the rabbit  - cascabel chile crusted rabbit with toasted chile cous cous, almonds, currants in a smoked red pepper sauce and i had the halibut with green chile curry sauce and corn and cactus salsa. originally, this was supposed to be wild stripe bass, but there were some weather issues back east so they didn't get their fish shipment in that day.\n\nmy halibut was good. nice crunch on the top of the fish and the green chile curry sauce was mild.  i liked it. it was a huge portion of fish.  hubs' rabbit was just ok - most people don't like the gamey flavor of rabbit, but that is what the rabbit lacked. it tasted more like chicken than rabbit.  \n\nfor dessert, we had the banana cream pie.  it was pretty light and a good way to end the meal.\n\nthe service was ok. at first, the server was very attentive and quick but after we got our appetizers, she was quite slow. having experience in the food industry, i did notice that her section filled up quickly and she had small tables like us but also parties of 6 or more. she was friendly enough though.\n\ni believe there are better mexican restaurants in vegas.  mesa grill is known for grilling so maybe the steaks are better?",

            "as i write this, i can hardly move.  i blame bobby flay.  last night we dined at mesa grill and the food was amazing.  \n\ni'd planned for this meal all day - akin to preparing for the civilized version of nathan's hotdog eating contest.  a small breakfast of oatmeal, half a sandwich for lunch, plenty of water.  (yeah, this is probably how i should eat every day...but we'll avoid that topic for now).  \n\ni've had lunch at mesa grill before, and that meal had me excited for the dinner.  back then i had the southwestern spice chicken skewers.  think of it as a build your own taco.  the chicken is traditionally grilled on wood skewers (hence the name).  you build it yourself with \"special lettuce\" (a blend of mint, butter lettuce, and cilantro.  genius.) and a new mexico chile sauce that tastes more like a mole sauce that a chile sauce.  i love good food, especially good mexican (excuse me, southwestern cuisine), and i was clearly really looking forward to another opportunity to dine at mesa grill.  \n\nno surprise to anyone who knows me, i arrived on time for dinner.  my guests did not.  but the staff was pleasant and courteous none the less, even though they had to refer several people to the \"first come, first served\" bar area as they were booked for the evening.\n\nwhen my guests finally arrived (ok, they were only 15 minutes late.  'traffic\"), we started with mojitos (five stars), and the self explanatory <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> (a little dry, but tasty none the less).\n\nfor dinner we had:\n\ncornmeal crusted chile relleno with eggplant, manchego cheese, and sweet red pepper sauce.  i love the presentation on this dish.\n\nnew mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin with bourbon - ancho chile sauce, sweet potato tamale, and crushed pecan butter.  it was really spicy.  i mean really spicy.  i had this medium - pink in the center, delicious.  and the tamale (yeah, another one.  let's not count the calories) had chunks of pecan in the pecan butter.  happiness.\n\nfinally the grilled lamb porterhouse chops with blackberry - cascabel barbecue sauce (brilliant!), and collard greens with smoked chiles.  it didn't disappoint. \n\nthe meal took us an hour and a half.  it felt like 15 minutes.  it was a great experience and time literally flew by (mainly because there are no clocks in the casinos).  if you're planning on seeing a show after dinner, give yourself an extra hour or so.  you'll probably need it. \n\nthe meal was a bit pricey ($200+ for three), but well worth it.  i've noticed that the lunch menu had many of the same items as the dinner menu - just smaller portions and priced accordingly.",

            "before hitting  vegas i read a lot of reviews on the mesa grill.  i could not understand all the complaints about the service... just could not see bobby flay owning a place with low standards.  the service was awesome... from the hostess to the waiter.  i'd expect it to be so... i just had to log a good experience.  the food, by the way, was delicious.  my son and i both had <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> as appetizers, based on michael symon's \"best thing i ever ate in vegas\".  they lived up to the hype.  i really enjoyed the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark>... but not nearly as much as my son loved the smoked shrimp tacos.  he wasn't as excited about coming to mesa grill in the first place, but he raved about these.  so,  yes, this is a pricey place... but it was absolutely worth it for us.  the service could not have been better.", 
            "great visit.  about 2 years ago now.  had the pork tenderloin, would recommend to anyone.  also had the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>.  great flavor, great presentation and awesome margaritas.  weekends can be tough to get a seat if you don't have a res 4-5 days out.", 
            "not worth the price for the food here. we ordered the tiger shrimp with the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> to start with, and the porterhouse lambchops entree.  both were really good, but overly heavy, creamy, and overpriced! we were also served a basket of various breads, which were baked fresh and were pretty neat. everyone seemed to be raving about the blue corn muffin, but i found it to be too crumbly and not very sweet for a muffin. my favorite out of the bread basket was the asiago cheese jalapeno bread. \n\noverall, food was delicious, but just overly heavy and overpriced. the service at the restaurant, however, is absolutely superb. fantastic service from our server, and also by the rest of the staff that greets you when you enter and also bids you farewell as you leave.", 
            "for me, it's all about the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>!\n\nit's unlike any tamale you've ever had. the is with a gourmet twist after all. when i'm on a business trip in vegas, i can usually walk in, sit myself at the bar and order one of these and a cocktail with no fuss. if i'm starving, i might get the burger and one of these... the tamale is a must.", 
            "one of he best meals i have ever had. the tiger shrimp+ <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> was a great appetizer and the spice rubbed pork tenderloin was too die for. will definitely eat there again in november.", 
            "after seeing chef bobby flay on the food network channel numerous times, i made sure to put mesa grill on my las vegas restaurant bucket list. the restaurant definitely lived up to the hype for me. the appetizer the glazed ribs and tiger shrimp and <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> was tasty. the glaze on the ribs was unique.the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> complimented the shrimp very well. for my entree, i decided to try the shrimp and grits. growing up in the south, i really enjoyed this dish. the flavors from the shrimp and grits were unbelievable. this dish definitely hit the mark. i had a hard time choosing a dessert. all the choices on the dessert menu sounded delicious. i decided to go with the toasted coconut cake. i made a good choice because the cake was finger licking good. the coconut cake had just the right amount of coconut flavor. the service was good. the waiter was attentive for a packed restaurant. reservations are highly recommended at mesa grill. i got into the restaurant late in the evening. although mesa grill is located in caesars palace, the restaurant has a nice romantic atmosphere. mesa grill is a good restaurant to enjoy bobby flay inspired dishes. this was one of my favorite restaurants in las vegas.", 
            "celebrated  my 60 th birthday here tonight. what a fabulous meal! we had the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, to die for and, a duck taco, equally as good. my husband had the green chili choppino and i had the rabbitt.  what a first class meal. service was impeccable! decore is beautiful. maragritas arn't bad either!", 
            "back again!  ate here for lunch and dinner. totally love this place. you have to try the rubbed pork, roasted corn, green chili mashed potatoes and the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>. you won't be disappointed.", 
            "our group was really disappointed by mesa grill.  while planning our vegas trip, visiting bobby flay's restaurant was at the top of the list.  i am a fan of bobby flay and his food on food network looks amazing, but i would never recommend this restaurant to someone visiting vegas.\n\nthe hostess was rude when i informed her that our original group of 8 was now 10, which should have been a sign to go somewhere else to eat, but we soldiered on.  they split us up into a table for 4 and a table for 6.  the server had a thick accent and was difficult to understand.  the service was poor and the food took too long to come out.  \n\nhighlights:  bread basket- all of it was really good, especially the jalapeno bread, quesadilla was perfection ... the bacon, cheese, onions and bacon were amazing.  everyone at the table enjoyed it.  the ribeye steak, which was off menu, was excellent.  the <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark> were also good.\n\nlow lights:  all of the egg dishes were really bland. the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> was bland and the sauce was too thin.  the mimosa was weak.  everyone hated the <mark>House Ground Hominy Grits</mark> ... our table was full of southerners, so grits have a high bar to meet and it failed miserably.\n\nvery disappointing and truly the culinary low light of our vegas trip.", 
            "bobby flay's restaurant at caesar's palace.  tasty but with mixed reviews.  the first time i went there, everything i had was delicious.  the chicken and pork tenderloin were outstanding.  this time, i ordered the following - duck crepe (soooo good!), <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> (very flavorful and fresh), salmon (mediocre, at best... and our waiter even told us not to order it... but my friend didn't listen), and halibut (tender, flaky, not fishy at all... and so flavorful!).  the halibut and appetizers were my favorites and i would definitely go and order those again.  we also ordered 3 desserts, which were totally worth it!  sweet potato pudding (and i don't even like sweet potatoes!), banana pie tart thingy, and spicy peanut chocolate cake.  mmmmmm would definitely go there for dessert and the appetizers!!! \n\nyou need a reservation for this place.", 
            "my husband and i went here to dinner for the first time last week and it was fabulous.  i had the pork medallions.  i am not one to order pork, but the waiter assured me they would be delicious--and they were.  my husband had the veal chop and it was also flavorful and yummy.  for starter were shared the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>--which was to die for.  should have ordered two--so very good.  each entree came with a tamale with pecans, and it was unbelievably good.\n\ni was so impressed we returned for brunch.  i was not so impressed, and was actually disappointed with my dish.  i had scrambled egg chilaquiles.  i did not like the flavor of the sauces at all, and had really expected something great.  would not recommend at all.  they were more like deconstructed chilaquiles.  my husband, on the other hand, ordered two appetizers.  he had the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>--which was every bit as good as before, and the bacon and egg quesadilla, which again was superb.   \n\nservice was goo, and the bread baskets on both trips were very good.  i would go back again, but certainly would skip the chilaquiles.", 
            "yum! we got a couple of appetizers: the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> was amahzing. the blue corn pancake with bbq duck was good, but not life changing. the queso was not my cup of tea (but that's because i hate goat cheese).  for entrees: get the pork. it's their house specialty, it's delish, and i just saved you some deciding time. the pumpkin soup was spicy and creamy and just all around yummy. <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark> was alright. a little too dressed for me. atmosphere was ok, nothing too fancy, it's actually smaller than i thought it would be but cute with the exposed kitchen. service was fantastic! overall, an enjoyable meal!", 
            "made this a lunch stop, wanted to go to 5 stars, maybe next time.\nthe service was pretty good, the ahi nachos were the best lets be honest, \"poke\" ive ever had, so fresh it was like butter, the sauces and chips were great but it would have been just as good on its own. i got the shrimp and <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, \" the signature dish\" it was good, i'm glad i tried it but i wouldn't order it again, it seems odd to me that the shrimp are not grilled it would add so much. my boyfriend got the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> which maybe we expected too much from, and it was a good burger, but a little under seasoned and as he stated he was underwhelmed, i know we will go back, just for the ahi alone, and there are other things to try..maybe my expectations were too high because i'm such a big fan of chef flay.", 
            "have gone to bobby flay's mesa grill twice in las vegas. the first time it was fantastic, the second time not so much. for some reasons there is huge quality differences in the dishes.\n\nthe first time i had pork tenderloin which was delicious. my girlfriend and son had the filet mignon. for sides we had the mashed potatoes and <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>. everything was delicious and we were looking forward to going back the next time we were in vegas.\n\nthe second time as a big disappointment however. this time i had the grilled lamb chops, while my family had the rib eye steak. the lamb lacked flavor, and the steak as overdone. \n\ni would gladly go back and have what i ate the first time, but would recommend everyone to avoid what we had the second.", 
            "excellent ! this is one of my favorite places to dine in while i'm in las vegas baby! everything on the menu is too die for! the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> for starters; delcious!.. grilled pork tenderloin; amazing! if your in vegas and don't stop by you'll be very dissapointed.. my favorite restaurant love la mesa!", 
            "two days at caesar's palace - 8 meals - and this was by far our favorite.  food, service, ambiance were all excellent.\n\nwe were seated as soon as we arrived, a little early, for our 7 pm reservation.  we were immediately greeted by water service, and our waiter offering me their marguerita menu - oh my.  an enormous list of tequilas and several margueritas.  i was attracted to the peach and ordered that - it was soooo yummy!!\n\nwe ordered the shrimp & <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> appetizer.  it was very good.  the shrimp were cooked perfectly and the dish was very tasty.\n\nhubster ordered the chili relleno - and the moans from across the table told me that it was very, very good.  it was definitely not your traditional chili relleno.  the exterior was crispy, there wasn't a tomato sauce over everything, but there were a couple of colorful sauces on the plate to run your bite through.  the stuffing was eggplant and mechanga cheese - again not a traditional stuffing.  but it was reported to be very, very good.\n\ni wanted something light for dinner, so ordered the chicken skewers appetizer.  this came with little tortillas, so you could make little tacos if you wanted, and a peanut sauce.  the chicken was nice and spicy, but not painfully so.  it was a small portion of 3 skewers, which was exactly what i wanted.\n\ni loved the ambiance.  it's a nice warm room, with warm southwest colors and a copper hood over the kitchen.  the kitchen was behind glass, and you could see the chefs at work, which i love.  we had seen a show on the food channel about the development of this restaurant, so it was really fun to see it in person.  \n\ni would definitely eat here again, there were several things on the menu that i would like to try.", 
            "our family of 4, including two young boys absolutely love everything! my 9 year old said it was the best quesadilla he'd ever had. all of the appetizers were good portions and were all exquisite.  my favorite was the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>. the boys devoured the skewered chicken and barbecue ribs. my husband really enjoyed the lamb chops.  the service was absolutely top notch! we will be back!!", 
            "we came here for dinner and were looking for something light to eat since we'd be meeting up with other friends later.  so we ordered two appetizers (the shrimp with <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> and the rough cut tuna nacho), an entree (chile relleno), and a dessert (the banana creme pie).  these along with the bread basket was more than enough food for the three of us.  \ni can't tell you which was was my favorite, b/c really they were all good.  the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> hit just the right notes of sweet and savory and paired really well with the shrimp.  def a must order.  i think i like the tuna more though, b/c generally i like my seafood raw.  my husband loved the chile relleno, and said that it was the best he's ever had.  he's eaten a ton of this stuff, so that's saying a lot.  the dessert was a good finisher...it was more like a deconstructed banana cream pie.  i thought that the candied hazelnut at the bottom really added to the dish.  \ni will be returning for brunch, since this is what flay is really known for.  can't wait.", 
            "we walked into the place without a reservation because the buffet line was just way too long. a good tex mex place is always guaranteed to please, so we decided to try this out -- plus it is bobby flay's restaurant, right? (yeah, like chefs matter in las vegas anymore...every place is owned by a famous person).\n\ni started out with a cactus margarita, which is sweet, but also strong. then came the queso fundido -- decent, but somehow didn't really hit the spot because of the lack of spices. too mellow, i guess. however, the bread basket was another story -- everything was so good, i just stuffed myself with it. my favourite has to be the cornbread followed by the jalapeno scone. \n\ni had the tiger shrimp with <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, after hearing so much about it from various sources. it didn't disappoint! the sauce and the shrimp were tasty, and the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> was bursting with loads of flavours. it's a must-try.\n\nthe wait service was...ok. our waitress was nice but seemed a bit overwhelmed, and the bus service was just horrible. bread came after we finished our appetizer. things were served out of order and hectic, and cleared out of the way slowly.\n\nin short, bring a big stomach to this place. the plates i got were \"appetizer-sized\" but they were enough to stuff me, especially after i devoured a couple pieces of pastries from the bread basket. plus, you might want to get a couple different things to try since everything looks so good.\n\noh, and just ignore the busboys.", 
            "we were actually headed to the new gordon ramsay pub and grille but they were closed for training so we decided on mesa grille. \n\nthis is our third time to mesa grille, and we love that they change up the menu from time to time. we also love the bread basket, specifically the blue corn muffins! \n\ntoday, i decided to try <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark> .. it was okay .. not bad, not great .. just okay. nothing i would order again though. \n\nmom had the blue corn pancake with bbq duck .. which she enjoyed and said was tasty. she still likes the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> the best though. \n\ni opted to try the smoked shrimp tacos which were delicious. just the right amount of smokiness and just the right size for lunch. (six nice-sized and perfectly seasoned shrimp and two tortillas.) i would have to say i will have a tough time deciding between this dish and the signature <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> the next time we come. \n\nfor dessert we decided to share the sticky toffee pudding .. which is one of my all time favorite desserts. unfortunately this one fell way short. it smelled right, and looked right, but the taste was not right. the pudding part was kind of dry and tasteless and the sauce was overly sweet. a disappointing end to an otherwise great lunch.", 
            "where do i even begin....bobby flay has done something outstanding here - what a meal - what an experience! i have to say, one of the best meals i have ever had.\n\nservice - spot on, our waitress was a joy to have - if we could have - we would have asked her to join us. i wish i knew her name. we liked her so much, my husband proposed to her with a corn husk tie from his <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>.\n\nthe food was outstanding, i had the sweet potatoe soup to start, and had my meal ended there i would have been ecstatic, but lucky for me, there was more to come. the bread selection (yes there was a selection of three different breads) was great - jalapeno asiago bread was a big a+ for me.\n\nmy entree was the grilled mahi mahi - and it was perfect, just a little heat, so much flavor it was a party in my mouth that i didn't want to have end.\n\nif you are on the strip you have to go here.", 
            "i didn't really know much about bobby flay before eating at mesa grill, but left his restaurant with a very high opinion of him. he's not a \"celebrity chef\" with a tv personality but mediocre culinary skills - he's the real deal. first, the service was impeccable. we were greeted and seated immediately by the hostess and every need we could have had was anticipated and catered to by our waiter and sommellier. second, the setting was very warm and open (this is the type of place where one is made to feel welcome whether he is wearing jeans or a three piece suit). third, and most important, the food was delicious. between my friend and i, we had the <mark>Baby Romaine Salad</mark>, coffee rubbed filet mignon (to die for), new mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin, mashed potatoes with green chile queso sauce (another favorite), fresh <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, and toasted coconut layer cake. every bit of the meal was delicious and i truly couldn't have asked for a better dining experience. while this restaurant is a little pricey, it is definitely worth the money and i promise you will leave very satisfied.", 
            "spring restaurant week 2013:\n\nday 5: \n\nmesa grill is known for a handful of dishes and usually restaurant week tends to be the showcase for their best items. i have eaten here a few times in the past couple of years. each time i have had a great experience. the must try items are the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, the rough cut tuna nachos, crab cakes, <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>, the chile rellenos, and their desserts.\n\nthere is a reason why mesa wins every year when it comes to the most money raised for our local food bank. they put out a well balanced menu that gives the guest the biggest bang for their buck. the portion sizes are scaled back, but leaves you feeling full. i started with the rough cut tuna nachos for my appetizer. it is served like tuna poki. the fish is sashimi grade and served raw. tosses with chipotle puree, cilantro, capers, and placed on top of a mango habanero puree and avocado crema. the blue corn and tortilla chips are the only utensils you need to scoop up all of this deliciousness. \n\ni got the crab cakes last year when they ran this special which lead me to order the green chile burger this time around. the meat tends to lose it's form and crumbles easily. i ended up using a fork and knife halfway through. the bechamel cheese sauce is delicious. paired with the pickled onions and pablano peppers gave it a range of depth. if given the choice again, i would have gone with the crab cakes. \n\nthe desserts changes ever day depending on what the chef chooses. we got the deep dish banana cream pie. the frangelico cream only gives hints of the alcohol. the surprise comes from the contrast in textures. the dense custard differs from the soft cream which compliments the bananas and praline disk on top. i am a huge fan of bobby flay's desserts. the sticky toffee pudding is not a traditional version, but it is so good. i also like the strawberry shortcake. pastry changes their offerings seasonally, so keep an eye out for these dishes.",

            "i just read a five star review from a fellow vegetarian for mesa grill on the same day we visited. i agree with the yelper that the side <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> was average at best, lacked flavor, and really small for $9. our corn bread that came out before dinner was very dry as well. what i was most dissappointed by was their lack of ability to make a change to an item on the menu.  i wanted to get the quesadillas without chicken that looked amazing and we were told they couldn't do it, that stuff was pre-made. that was a bummer. so we settled for the goat cheese fundido app and a tamale. like i said the tamale was not so hot and the goat cheese fundido was good. at that point we cut our losses and took off and never got to the chile relleno which i kind of regret based on what other yelper said.\n\n i know this place is mostly a meat type of restaurant but my wife and i love the spice and flavor mesa brings to the table. for some reason i recall more vegetarian options at the mesa grill in new york or maybe they were more willing to adapt. \n\ntheir $16 specialty margarita was just ok. oh, and they could use some customer service training up front. not so friendly, in a cold and indifferent kind of way. just annoying when you see them laughing and upbeat with servers but not customers. oh well, at least our server arnel was nice.", 
            "loved mesa grill. the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> was excellent. i would go back again just for that....fantastic. the blue corn pancake was good, but not as good as that tamale!  my husband had the pork tenderloin, and i had the veal. both were good, but i definitely preferred the veal. no complaints!",

            "\"this is the best thing i have ever put in my mouth\" a common sentence used when nickole and i dined here last monday. christine the bartender is awesome and made the best recommendations for us. started our meal off with a house margarita on the rocks with salt. made up of hurradurra tequila, fresh squeezed lime, and agave syrup it was so good. nickole had a white peach margarita and that was amazing as well. \nfor an appetizer we had the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, wow. honestly the best thing i have ever eaten. with garlic corn, and a cilantro sauce that makes you want to cry... this tamale was sculpted by gods, i swear. i could eat this dish every day.\ndrink #2 pear margarita. yum not too sweet but with a slight hint of pear. very good... and strong!\nfor the entrees we both split the smoked shrimp tacos and ancho chili <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark>. wow x2. the tacos were perfection. with grilled corn tortillas and a cabbage slaw the shrimp being so juicy and perfectly marinated this dish was to die for. the salmon was perfect too. cooked at a medium temp and on a bed of a house made black bean sauce and a cilantro oil the honey glaze complemented the salmon perfectly. both amazing choices. \ndrink #3 pomegranate martini a little on the strong side but pretty good\ndesert- sticky toffee cake. being gluten free i only had a small bite to try it and if my allergy was mild and wouldn't cause me severe pain i would have eaten the whole thing. wow was it good! and with a side of house made ice cream it was truly the cherry on top to our meal. \ni highly recommend this place to everyone. it will not disappoint! i cant wait to come back", 
            "the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> is to die for.  i literally ordered one as an app and one for lunch.  it's slightly deconstructed, and the sweet corn on it is delicious.  i'm not a dessert person either, but the chocolate \"pudding\" is the best dessert ever.  it's more of a cake with salted caramel and ice cream - insanely good, can't wait to go back and order both again!!", 
            "reserved via open table for dinner with my husband while in vegas for the weekend for our wedding anniversary. it was friday night but we got seated pretty quickly even though we were about 5 minutes late due to a bit of a miscalculation on our flight arrival time. place was busy but they were definitely moving people in & out pretty quickly.   we choose this place because we wanted to experience a bobby flay restaurant after seeing so much of him on the food network. we weren't disappointed!\n\ntheir bread basket had a nice cheese bread, corn muffin & a walnut raisin bread. all were good, but our favorite was the cheese bread with peppers. we then started out with these mini (& i do mean mini!!!) blue corn lobster tacos for an appetizer. after laughing about the size (maybe 2\"x1\" tacos) we split the 3 tacos. we weren't laughing then!  we were licking our fingers!  very delicious.  one of our servers was joking with us about how they had tastings of them when the tacos were introduced & they all had the same complaint... they wanted more!  we agreed, yummy!\n\nthen we ordered the <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> & grilled chicken to share. we honestly thought we'd like the salmon better, but both really liked the spicy tangy sauce on the chicken. plus it had this yummy <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> on the side. salmon was good & was cooked very well, but i guess we just thought it was not especially different tasting than what we could get somewhere else. strangely enough, it was our side dish of roasted corn that we liked the most!  what a burst of flavor from the aioli & cheese on it!  at first i wasn't sure i'd be able to finish it because i wanted to save room for dessert, but i couldn't resist because it was great. \n\nbut the absolute best part of the meal (it had us talking about it all weekend long!) was the sticky toffee pudding!  omg!!! it's sweet, yet salty, sticky but not too much & the texture of the cake/pudding was firm but moist. sooooo good!  i didn't have any of the vanilla ice cream it was served with cuz i'm lactose intolerant, but my hubby said it was not really anything special. but he ate it anyway!  \n\noverall, the food was great, the servers really were on top of everything & very friendly. not at all snooty or aloof.  had a great time & would do it again...especially the dessert!",

            "good: yes  \n\ngreat: no\n\ndecor: interesting, colorful, a little in your face and a little tiresome over the course of a meal.\n\nservice: friendly, happy, a little too much, over-the-top, bordering on annoying.\n\nfood: most important !!!\n\nwhite <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> appetizer: original,  well-executed, quality ingredients, however surprisingly salty - weird as i like salt.\n\nsquash blossoms with mango chile sauce: good texture, crispy, visually appealing, however the blossom itself was a little bland and the sauce a little cloyingly sweet.\n\npork tenderloin in ancho chile bourbon sauce: with two complimentary sauces and a sweet <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> on the side: like butter !!! the tenderloin was buttery, moist and decadent. again the sauce was a little too sweet but offset by the red pepper sauce droplets and the cilantro oil. the tamale was tiny and delicious.\n\ndessert: banana creme pie on steroids - gorgeous banana creme mousse piped between two hazelnut toffee thin cookies, which covered beautifully thinly sliced bananas. gorgeous, artistic and tasty.\n\nalso! wonderful margaritas - excellent balance of sweet, salty, acidic and beauty in presentation.\n\nwould i try this again? hard call as there are so, so many choices in viva las vegas.",

            "i had dinner this evening with my family at the mesa grill, celebrity chef bobby flay's restaurant at  caesar's palace in las vegas. i had made reservations on open table prior to coming to town, but was running late because the traffic on las vegas boulevard was pretty bad. after i pulled into the coliseum valet (which is free, by the way), i told the attendant that i was running late. he pointed out to me where the restaurant is located (it was my first time) and told me that he would call the restaurant to let them know that i was coming. much appreciated! \n\nit was an early dinner reservation, even though i was late, and the restaurant was about half full when we arrived. by the time dinner ended, however, it seemed like the whole restaurant was full. \n\nwe had lamb porterhouse chops served with two sauces (preserved serrano sauce and mint chimichurri) and a blue <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, coffee rubbed filet mignon with roasted corn, black angus new york steak strip with mashed potatoes, and <mark>Baby Romaine Salad</mark> with roasted garlic dressing and hominy croutons (how unique). every single entree was cooked perfectly, and each bite was delicious from beginning to end. \n\nthe service at the restaurant was top-notch. we were promptly seated when we arrived (we had reservations), our orders were taken quickly, and our food was delivered to our table within 10 minutes of ordering. our waitress brenda was wonderful, and all of our servers were very attentive. as we left the restaurant, we were greeted by at least half a dozen staff members. \n\nthe food was bit pricey, but well worth the culinary experience. my family and i don't come to vegas often, but i felt that since we were here, we might as well indulge a bit and enjoy ourselves--we certainly did that at mesa grill.", 
            "bf and i ate here on a friday night. we had reservations at 10 pm and were both starving after a long drive from la. \n\nwe were seated promptly, and our waiter came and took our drink orders. after that, a bread basket came out pretty quickly- all the breads were delicious!  because we were starving, we cleaned out the breads before our food came out. \n\nfor appetizers, we ordered the shrimp with <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, as well as the blue corn pancake with barbecued duck. both were delicious!  \n\nfor entrees, i had fish, and my bf had the pork tenderloin. we also ordered sides of corn (omg!!) and baked potato. we were both very happy with our entrees, but between the two, i think i enjoyed my bf's pork tenderloin a tad more.  and if we come back, i'm definitely getting the corn again!\n\nall in all, it was a great meal!  check it out- you won't be disappointed!",

            "my girlfriend and i went to las vegas last weekend for her birthday. as soon as we got to our room in the monte carlo, we naturally began searching yelp for nearby restaurants. when we found out that one of our favorite food network chefs, bobby flay, had a restaurant at caesar's palace, it instantly shot to the top of our list. \n\nwe went to mesa grill for our last night, after going to wolfgang puck's, lupo and emeril lagasse's table ten the nights before. the location was very convenient since caesar's palace is in the middle of the strip and the restaurant itself was absolutely gorgeous, very clean and modern. everything you could possibly want for a classy las vegas experience. \n\npersonally i still had some doubts because tex mex is not my girlfriend's or my favorite type of cuisine, we never seek it out, but i would say i don't have much knowledge about it either. i didn't find the whole idea of tex mex too appealing.\n\ni started getting even more concerned when i found the wait staff to be a little pretentious and more than a little snooty. our main waiter in particular made me feel like we didn't belong since we're a young couple blowing all our money on this short getaway and not some rich established older people who can really afford to got to a place like this without worrying about making rent. anyway he seemed rather annoyed at our amateur etiquette overall ignorance regarding such extravagance. but i think we won him over with our charm by the end.\n\nthe man who took our cocktail orders was by far the best, giving us all kinds of knowledge about the menu, making friendly conversation, sharing his personal preferences and just really making time to stop by a few times just so see how our drink experience specifically was going. the drinks were absolutely delicious.\n\nbe excited about some pretty good free bread to help prepare you for the journey ahead. the bread grew on me as i ate more, but it was nothing to\n\nwe actually tried to save money by getting two appetizers, the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> and blue corn pancake, and only getting one entree, the chile relleno (one of my favorite dishes in life that was conveniently the most inexpensive entree on the menu). but when we tasted the appetizers, we instantly ordered another entree, the pork tenderloin. the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> especially was like tasting heaven. it the shrimp was zesty and bold pairing perfectly with the creamy garlic sauce. the texture of the tamale was very pleasing and the consistency  was tender, but still substantial. the blue corn pancake was also delicious, the flavor was more simple, the duck was very juicy and was smothered in a succulent dark, deep, rich, velvety sauce. it was very aromatic, just a truly seductive dish.\n\nthe chile relleno had the most stunning presentation in my opinion. the cornmeal crust is that perfect amount of golden crisp, not oily. it's satisfying cracking it open like creme brulee and unleashing the cheezy melty, spicy explosion within. there are so many textural layers that make the experience of eating it so dynamic and just adds to the diversity of flavor. i've never had anything like it; by far one of the best dishes i've ever tasted in my entire life. it was like eating art.\n\nthe pork tenderloin was also breathtaking to look at, and my girlfriend would say it was the prettiest presentation, but we would both agree it was the best dish of the whole meal. i never knew that meat could be prepared in such a way where every nuance, every single note of flavor possible to achieve in the universe can sing in harmony together so immaculately. every single flavor that has ever excited my taste buds came flooding back and brought back friends i never knew existed and we danced, danced, danced! pure ecstasy. after that is kind of a blur. all i know is that i had eaten the best thing i have ever tasted.\n\nand that wasn't even the end. we were so drunk on the pleasures of food and drink that we ordered dessert, the toasted coconut layer cake. the coconut shone throughout the dish, the cake was incredibly moist, the icing was soft and delicate and the cr\\u00e8me anglaise just took the cake to another level of decadence. \n\noverall the meal was one of the best in my whole life. the experience was also one of the best in my entire life, but i wouldn't call the restaurant experience perfect because of the service. in general las vegas service lacks in attitude. they do all the right things technically, but their attitude, personality, and what they say always leaves a lot to be desired. there's is rarely genuine friendly service and this restaurant, sadly was no exception in that area. but i still give the restaurant five stars for just being so breathtakingly delicious, the restaurant's atmosphere was beautiful and clean, and the service was still professional, fast and insanely efficient (when we ordered another entree, they still came out at the same time only minutes after we told them). yes, go here! the end.",

            "i recently had brunch at mesa grill, with three girlfriends (four moms with college age kids).  we had a reservation for 11:30 and arrived a bit early, no problem we were seated early at a lovely table.  now, we knew the food was going to be great...but what struck me most was the attention to detail and the impeccable service.   for example, one of my friends does not like ice in her water, the server noticed and every time her glass was refilled they used a pitcher of water with no ice.  we all shared the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> as an appetizer, we were each brought a nice plate and after we finished, we all received clean silverware.  another item, some of the party sitting next to us were wearing black pants and the server switched out their white linen napkins for black ones.  now you may not think that is such a big deal until you get up from the table with white lint sticking to your black pants.\n\nas for the food, everything we ordered was perfectly prepared, flavorful and beautiful.  the shrimp,tamale is not to be missed, the shrimp was perfectly cooked, moist with a nice snap to it.  i had the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> served with apricot glazed ham.  the eggs were fluffy, the goat cheese tart and let's not even talk about how good the ham was.\n\ni was impressed both with the quality of the food and the quality of the service.  my view is that you can have a great meal, but if the service is sub par, the entire dining experience is diminished.  but if get the combo of great food and great service,you have the recipe for a meal to be remembered for a very long tome.", 
            "i've been meaning to come here for years, after hearing superb review after review from friends and colleagues. we made some reservations and came in on a busy saturday evening for a great meal. \n\nservice was superb. let me tell you now that this is the best oiled restaurant i've ever seen. waiters are attentive, tables and cleaned within seconds, and the staff knows the menu inside and out. our waiter said he had been there for over 5 years - so, that's an amazing testament to how great it must feel to work there as well!\n\nwith that said, the food was everything i could ever hope for.\n\npork tenderloin: great, hearty portions of tender pork. cooked in bourbon, giving it a great flavor. tasty ancho chile sauce on the pork. accompanied by a sweet potato tamale with a pecan butter - amazing! must try this. it's supposedly one of their signature dishes, so you really can't go wrong with this.\n\ngrilled lamb porterhouse chops: smaller portion compared to the tenderloin, but still an amazingly well made dish. serrano pepper sauce with a mint chimichurri. comes with a blue <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> with basil butter. this complimented the dish really well, although i preferred the tamale that came with the pork tenderloin. \n\nside of grilled asparagus that wasn't anything special, but complimented the dishes very well.\n\ngive this place a chance and make sure you have reservations beforehand. it's well worth a trip!",

            "after food trucks became trendy in 2010, people loved all things fusion.  craziness persisted.  we saw stuff like sushi in burritos, we saw french fries with kimchi, and we saw bacon in everything.  before the craze, chefs like bobby flay and david chang established their names with their creative fusion blends.\n\njust because foods are creative doesn't mean that they'll be good.  one of the problems with fusion foods is that they tend to be one dimensional.  they're usually spicy or tangy or sweet or bacon-infused to the max.     \n\nyou gain an appreciation for this place as soon as you try one of their dishes.  take their popular \"blue corn pancake\", for instance.  it looks simple:  you have a thin blue cornmeal crepe and it's filled with barbecue duck.  you take a bite and you notice the sweet notes of the barbeque sauce.  that taste fades and you then notice the tender duck meat.  the dish is small, so it forces you to eat slowly to make it last.   as you chew slowly, the subtle, nutty heat of the habanero sauce begins to rise.     \n\nflay's appetizers are full of flavors that are distinct without being over-the-top.  \n\nwhen i came here for my birthday dinner with my girlfriend, we opted to sample several appetizer instead of choosing one main course.  we knew that it would be the best way to get a good mix of flavors.  \n\nyou can't miss the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> with tiger shrimp.  it was a favorite of my girlfriend.  the chef said that it is the most popular appetizer and that the recipe has not changed in twenty years.\n\nmy favorite side dish was their roasted corn.  it reminded me of ordering corn at a park in east la.   you get the flavors of lime, garlic, white corn, various cheeses.  it's great street food, but improved upon.  but their sweet potatoes are good too.  it's served au gratin.  it's creamy - it's very evident that they used a lot of cream here.  but it also has interesting spice that reminded me of pumpkin pie.   it's a nice, flavorful starch to complement their popular pork tenderloin or coffee-rubbed steak.\n\nthis is fusion done well.  its flavor pops in three dimensions, but without the need of glasses.", 
            "i would recommend this restaurant over any others on the strip when you are considering a fancy dinner.  i've dined at all the high end restaurants and keep returning to mesa grill.  chef bobby flay is known for sassy and bold flavors, and mesa grill has never disappointed me.  my favorite entrees are spicy-rubbed pork tenderloin with mushroom couscous and wild rabbit with sweet potato stuffed <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>.  both are perfectly cooked with just the right amount of spicy on the tenderloin, and wonderful flavors.  the jalape\\u00f1o corn muffins are out of this world.  if any had been remaining, i'd have stuffed them into my purse.  the service is superb with good wine list.  reservations are highly recommended for dinner.  mesa grill is the only reason that i visit caesar's palace except to gamble of course.",

            "i have been passing by this restaurant evertime i go to ceasar's palace in las vegas and we usually use this hotel for accomodation. mesa grill is close to the food court and close to the casino, it is one of those restaurants that have been there for a long time and really made it's mark. for some reason thou, i would always pass by mesa grill, look at the menu and move along. to be honest, if you just go with what the menu says it would not wake up your taste buds, the items listed are so simple and sounds..ehhh. \n\nbut time and time again i would always wish i have tried flay's restaurant when i get back to l.a., especially since i am an avid cooking channel watcher and self claimed foodie. this weekend, me and the wife had a quick getaway and i made it a point to get a table in mesa grill, with very high expectations, since i just saw him kick ass in the kitchen stadium and throwdowns....i am glad i finally went!\n\nlooking at the menu outside, i decided to start off with  some tiger shrimp w/ <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> and the wife got blue corn pancake, both tasted wonderful and they really set the mood for the mains. although browsing the menu, nothing really looked exciting to me, luckily i saw some tenderloins, (the bourbon got me) and i went with it. the wife wanted some fish but all they have that night are scallops and a cioppino, both were not her likings so she decided on a filet mignon, medium rare, and we got some spicy sweet potatos on the side.\n\nlet me tell you that the first bite of the tenderloin, mesa grill had me... the meat was soft, very tender, the spices are there and you can really taste them but does not overpower the meat. it was delightful. the wife's filet is holding it's own on the taste department, the rub and the mushrooms are something to behold.  somehow the star of that meal is the spicy sweet potato, the way it was prepared is something that i have not seen nor tasted before. the potatoes are cut in a rectanglein thin sheets and piled high instead of mashed. the texture of the potato changed and the spices are unbelievable, something to taste to believe. bobby did not dissapoint at all with this restaurant and i will continue to cheer on him on tv or up until i come back to one of his restaurant.", 
            "i gave this place a solid 4 stars for lunch. i love menus that are interesting. no lack of creativity here.\n\ntiger shrimp + <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>:\nthis one's a no-brainer. best part of the meal. a \"best things i've ever ate\" feature on the food network.\n\nspicy chicken + <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> (w/ poached egg):\ni got this because it looked interesting, but not exactly sure how the flavors would compliment each other. i enjoyed it, but it wasn't \"love\". the egg didn't do a lot for me on this dish. if the combination above sounds like it will go great to you, then you'll probably love this dish. \n\nblue corn tortilla + barbecued duck:\nagain, it sounded so interesting i had to get it. i'm glad i did, but i didn't fall in love like the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>. if it sounds good to you, it will probably be worth it.", 
            "ate here after the 1/2 marathon!  here's the rundown of the dishes i ate, and what i thought: (first off, a well-deserved cocktail:  i had a margarita, of course!  it was good.)\n\nbread basket - i only ate one slice since i didn't want to ruin my meal, but i thought the bread was average - the butter they served with it was noticeably good, though.\n\nappetizer - 'rough cut tuna nachos':  i have no idea what is 'nacho' about this appetizer, but if you like tuna tartare you will love this appetizer.  the capers, the mango puree, the little chips they served to scoop it up with - all super delicious.  the tuna was high quality.\n\nentree - 'coffee-rubbed filet mignon' - delicious!  my steak was cooked perfectly, was a great cut of meat, and the coffee and ancho chile on the outside really added a lot of flavor.  this was a big win for me.\n\nside - 'fresh <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> + jalapeno pesto butter' - i was not a fan of this.  the tamale was not very moist, and basically tasted like a plain <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> that you would get at any regular mexican restaurant - i didn't really get any flavor from the jalapeno pesto butter that was on it, either.. i can't believe i paid ten bucks for a crappy plain tamale!  \n\ndessert - 'churros' - not so great.  these churros were pretty weak - they were not fluffy, there was no slightly gooey center and crispy outer.  the sauces were also not very good - there was barely any sauce served with the churros (dunking was impossible) and neither of the sauces had strong (or notable) flavor - i would have preferred one small creamer pot of good mexican chocolate for dipping.\n\nservice was very good - our waiter had the right frequency of checking in, and was very tolerant of us being one of the last people in the restaurant.\n\nreally, i want to give mesa grill 3 or 3.5 stars because of the inconsistency in quality of dishes across all parts of dinner, but on the strength of the appetizer and main dish, i will go ahead and give them 4 stars..  i found the pricing to be appropriate to slightly on the high side (but not so expensive where i felt like the food was overpriced).", 
            "while dining in vegas for work, mesa grill was definitely the highlight (in terms of dining). the mesa grill is located in the caesers palace. since i was by myself, i decided to sit at the bar and order appetizers. thankfully there was no wait. \n\nbread basket -- complimentary warm bread basket while you wait. the corn muffin is to die for!\n\n<mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> -- one of their signature dishes, and its a must. i love tamales, and bobby flay has definitely raised the bar with this appetizer. i can see why it was listed on food networks \"best thing i've ever eaten\"\n\ntuna nachos -- thankfully there is no cheese on these nachos. it is sashimi served with a couple different sauce with chips to scoop. good light appetizer with a lot of flavor. \n\nwhite peach margarita -- excellent margarita with high quality alcohol. no syrups were used while making this cocktail, and it gave me a good buzz just after one cocktail.\n\noverall it was an awesome dining experience -- job well done bobby flay!",

            "***bobby flay's mesa grill showcases several good starters and entrees with generous portions, but the menu hardly changes; it is good option if you have never been, but if you have been to mesa grill, a return visit might leave you disappointed with the restaurant lacking the ambition to challenge itself and try new things (you cannot really blame the restaurant though given its popularity as well as customers' satisfaction with mesa grill's signature dishes)***\n\ni have been to bobby flay's mesa grill a few times and it consistently delivers tasty and well prepared food.  unfortunately, the menu also just seems to never change.  that is the case with a lot of las vegas restaurants (for example, picasso's tasting menu features two courses that have been there forever).  still, almost the entire menu at mesa grill has remained the same since my first visit a long time ago.\n\nthe familiar menu has pros and cons.  what it has going for it is that a lot of the dishes are tried and true.  in addition, most guests come to las vegas rarely and would likely only dine at mesa grill once so the limited changes in the menu would not impact most customers.  on the other hand, the menu feels a tad dated; mesa grill does not really capitalize on the latest trends, progression in cooking techniques and popular protein cuts and produce.\n\ni started with their tiger shrimp with <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>.  it is a popular dish and for good reason.  the tamale was hearty and had a tasty and moist cornbread-like texture.  the shrimp was good and plump and the cilantro sauce was also nice though i personally would have preferred it to be spicier.\n\nfor my entree, i went with their new mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin, which was served with a bourbon and ancho chile sauce and a sweet potato tamale with crushed pecan butter.  unlike the shrimp and <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, this entree was incredibly spicy.  the pork had a rub that had a lot of heat (the sauce had some heat too).  there was nothing really there to cut the heat so it was the kind of dish you get tired and bored of eating (and may struggle to finish).\n\nthe pork tenderloin (a very underappreciated cut) was cooked very nicely here.  the pork was tender and had a good amount of moisture, which is rare given the limited amount of fat with this cut.  the sweet potato tamale had a noticeable sweet potato flavor, but it lacked the more tamale-like texture of the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> from my starter.\n\nmy dessert was a sticky chocolate cake.  it was very similar to mesa grill's previous sticky toffee pudding.  the cake had a similar glaze too--warm and a mix of salty and sweet.  the cake itself was not that great--a standard grocery store-like cake (similar ordinary chocolate flavor and similar texture as what you would get at a ralphs or vons).  there was also just too much cake especially given that the ice cream was an almost ridiculously small portion.\n\nservice was fine.  the staff was pleasant and the food came out at a quick pace.  i felt the staff could have been more attentive.\n\nprices are actually not that bad at mesa grill.  prices are very high, but that is common with most las vegas restaurants.  at least, they serve very substantial portions and the quality of ingredients is good.\n\nthe dining room is contemporary and showcases an open kitchen.  it is a very comfortable dining room.  unfortunately, the restaurant is not completely closed in by glass as it may appear.  there are quite a few open areas where the large glass panes do not meet.  given the proximity to the casino slot machines, cigarette smoke does waft in, which might create an undesirable dining experience if you are too close to the restaurant's outside wall.\n\nthere are definitely some good (and even great) things about mesa grill.  they have a few delicious items on their menu and most of the food is well prepared.  if you have never been to mesa grill, it is worth a visit; the restaurant also feels more worth the money than other celebrity chef backed restaurants in las vegas.  if you have been already though, mesa grill is not as exciting; the menu does not change much so it does kind of feel like the kitchen is really just going through the motions.\n\nmesa grill is located in caesars palace.  like most major hotels and casinos on the strip, caesars palace offers both complimentary self and valet parking.", 
            "food was really good. service was ok...the servers were nice, but i don't think service was fine dining worthy. this is more of a casual dining experience that happens to be expensive in price tag. haha. while delivering our food to us, our server dropped my hubbys rabbit on the floor :( i think the leg bone was stuck under the other plate and when he went to place it on the table, something happened and we just saw a rabbit hit the side of our table and fall to the floor. it was so so sad. \n\nthe waiter apologized profusely (well, if \"sorry brah, sorry sorry ah, so sorry bro\" counts as profusely apologizing haha), and then said he will fire up a new one asap! cool. mistakes happen, so that's understandable. what i didn't like however, was that my scallop dish and our other side dishes were sent to wait under the warmer while a new rabbit was fired. it took around 8-9 minutes (umm yes, of course i timed it!). that means my scallop entree sat under a warmer for 8-9 minutes and so did my brussel sprouts and queso mashed potatoes. i don't know if that was the right call. i guess i can't expect them to make all new items, but it just was sad watching my scallops just sit there. it just felt like my food's quality suffered a bit because of their boo boo. \n\nthat being said, the food was damn good. haha. the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> with cream sauce thing was soooooo good. i wanted like 3 more orders. the rabbit (when we did get it) was very tender and juicy and delicious, and the scallops in brown butter were yummy. the brussel sprouts had good flavor, but i wish they were more of a crispy style. instead they were soggy and drowned in liquid. but the pomegranate was very unexpected and surprisingly very yummy when paired with the brussel sprout. queso mashed potatoes was like a really thick mashed potato soup and was really yummmy :) \n\noverall, i would definitely eat at mesa again. i think the food itself was really delicious, i just don't know if service (from the sorry brah action, to the leaving my food on a warmer for 9 minutes) was up to par. i think that for the price tag you are paying (about $30 - $50 an entree), you expect a level of service that you just don't get here.", 
            "absolutely the best meal we had in las vegas.  the food was flavorful, and the service was impeccable.  if you are in vegas, making the trip through the maze in caesars palace to find mesa grill is 100% worth it.\n\nmy husband had the coffee encrusted filet mignon with a side of spiced sweet potatoes.  he swears it was probably the best steak he has ever had! (this from mr. \"always orders the steak\"). i wasn't as hungry, so i opted for an appetizer.  i thoroughly enjoyed the tiger prawns, <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, and cilantro sauce.\n\nthe food was amazing at the tables on either side of us as well - we could hear them exclaiming about it!  \n\nas good as the food was - the service managed to equal it.  i've never had my water refilled so often, the waitress be so knowledgable (we had wine questions), or the bus boys be so efficient.  amazing, and all without ever feeling like someone was hovering over our table.\n\ngo to the mesa grill.  even if bobby flay didn't personally cook our meal, the people there on a daily basis are infinitely qualified!", 
            "pretty good but overpriced.\n\ni was looking forward to eating at mesa but left disappointed. nothing went wrong. i just expected better. service was great. nice ambiance inside. its easy to forget you're in the middle of a casino. however, the meal itself just didn't measure up to my expectations. yeah it's in vegas & owned by a celebrity chef so we expected to spend a few hundred dollars but we also expected it the be a great meal. it wasn't. i'd say somewhere between okay and pretty good but by no means great. of the dishes that i remember...\n\nappetizers\nbread basket - not an app but still worth mentioning. it's full of different kinds of bread and the jalapeno cheese corn bread it good. grab it before someone else at your table does. \nblue corn pancake with bbq duck - pretty good. the bbq sauce carried most of the flavor and you couldn't taste the duck. still pretty good though.\n<mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> - good flavor combinations. proly my favorite item overall. kinda small though. looking at the name i was thinking they were serving tiger prawn but these are just regular-ass scrimps. \ntuna nachos - meh. pretty creative but didn't come with a lot of flavor\n\nentrees\nfilet - filet was good but i wouldn't put it in my top 5 & considering it was $50, i feel like it really should have been better. the temperature was right on the money but it was just missing something. \ngrilled chicken - i thought grilled chicken would be way to boring for a bobby flay restaurant but it's on the menu. it's exactly what you think it is...grilled chicken. it was juicy but again nothing to get excited about. \npan seared sea scallops - these were actually pretty good.\n\ni also ordered 2 margaritas and they were on par with everything else...so so. i really wanted to luv this place but the items we tried just didn't live up to the hype. would i eat there again? maybe for lunch. dinner wasn't worth $325 for 4 ppl in my opinion.", 
            "we visited mesa grill during restaurant week before celine dion concert, it is right next to the colosseum, so perfect for a nice not rushed meal prior to the performance. \n\ni had the cactus pear margarita, shrimp and <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, coffee rubbed filet mignon and trio of sorbet. \n\nthe shrimp and <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> was me given a shot at faith. i had always disliked tamales because of some certain flavor that i always tasted, but i gave it a shot with the limited selection of restaurant week. it was amazing. the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> was creamy and more corn flavored than anything. the shrimps were juicy and chewy.\n\nthe next is the coffee rubbed filet mignon. i don't normally use all capital, but this dish deserve all capital. it was delicious!! the filet mignon is cooked to perfection. even though the chef slice is through the middle making it like sandwich for some weird reason. never had it served that way. i'm still savoring the taste. a definitely must order there.\n\nthe trio of sorbet consisted of cactus, coconut and mango. i was expecting a more slushie texture sorbet like it usually is. i was pleasantly surprised that it was thick and creamy. when i was eating the mango, i was overwhelmed with spiciness. apparently it was mango with cayenne pepper. immediately eating the coconut after definitely soothes it. give it a try!", 
            "very good food, and great service!\n\nthe waiter was really nice and helpful, when we didn't know what we wanted exactly he gave us really good suggestions that we ended up following. his suggestions were great because i had no complaints about the food and the food was amazing.\n\nfor an appetizer we had the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>. it was delicious, the shrimp were perfectly cooked and the sauce went so well with the shrimp. also the tamale really went with the shrimp.\n\nwe had 4 things, the pork tenderloin, veal chop, lamb chop and the roasted brussels sprout salad . the pork tenderloin was very soft and the sauce went well with it. i also liked how all the meat dishes came with a tamale, each with a different taste to go with it. it's been a quite a while since i ate at mesa grill so i forgot what went with the pork tenderloin, i think it was a sweet tamale. the veal chop was so moist and soft. the ratio of fat to meat was perfect. the reason i really liked the veal chop was that it was really juicy, but the juices don't flow out of the meat, but instead stay in the chop. i think the tamale i got with the veal chop was a cheesy one. the lamb chop was also really good, which is saying something as i don't normally like the taste of lamb. the brussel sprout salad was also delicious. the brussel sprouts were perfectly charred, and the pomegranates added a nice sweet touch.\n\ni highly recommend eating here",

            "we dined here june 11th.  we've been twice before with better than average results but this meal was surprisingly good to us ... the best of our trip that included andiamo, joe's, ruths' chris and vic and anthony's.\n\ni had the tried and true southwest pork tenderloin and it was excellent! served with a <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> sweet potato made perfect.  it just couldn't have been better.  my wife had the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> and raved about it.  we shared the roasted corn appetizer which was truly scrumptious. everything gets an a+!  \n\ni tried the signature agave margarita as we'll and while i enjoyed it, it didn't blow me away.  give it a b.\n\nour short visit with hostess was cordial and our service team was excellent throughout.  timely, with helpful menu insight and very pleasant personality and attitude. a+!", 
            "i came here with my brother and sister to do an iron chef's tour of vegas.  mesa grill was the first stop.  \n\ni asked the waiter for a recommendation on the appetizer and he recommended the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>.  it was fantastic!  it's so good that i've been watching youtube videos of bobby making it and am determined to nail this dish.  i ordered the lamb chops for main and it was the best lamb chop i've ever had.  \n\nwhat gives with the 4 stars if everything was awesome?  well, my dishes were excellent, but my sister ordered the grilled chicken and my brother ordered the veal chop.  being a food curious family, we shared our food.  the grilled chicken was just ok.  think of a properly grilled piece of chicken with some fancy buffalo wing sauce.  the veal chop was recommended to be cooked medium so we went with that.  well, it may have been medium on the tip of the edge, but was raw by the bone.  \n\nlooking back, the waiter did say excellent choice when i ordered the lamb chops.  i suppose this means the other items we ordered were not a good choice.", 
            "this was my first visit to a bobby flay restaurant and boy did i love it.  first off everyone was super friendly and had smiles on their faces.  i liked watching the chefs in action cooking our food that was like free entertainment.  i had the pumpkin soup sorry can't recall the exact name it was smokey and creamy.  the only thing i did not like about it was that it was kind of on the sweet side but that's just me and my palate. it looked beautiful and they didn't skimp either.  i loved loved loved the <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> it was cooked perfect nice and flaky.  my hubby had the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> and all he could say was wow this is really good.  we also tried the goat fundio which was the perfect balance of goat and another cheese.  goat cheese for me can be a bit overpowering so they got the balance just right. my one and only complaint was that our table was just too small to fit all our food and drinks. hehe i can't wait to go back and try other things.  i was looking at the table next to us and they ordered the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> those smelled delicious. yes my husband is embarrassed of me when i look at other people's food but i can't help it.", 
            "salty..bland..totally underwhelmed. i have to admit, i had some expectations since the restaurant is owned by bobby flay especially since he's always talking about flavors and southwestern cuisine. but it was just so..whatevers.\n\nwe ordered the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, queso fundito dip, and the chile rellano. the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> was just alright..nothing special. the queso fundito dip wasnt bad but it certainly wasnt worth $18 bucks. my husband ordered the chile rellano and the crust was so dry and dense. overall the food was just heavy and bleh.\n\nthe service was average. the server left us with the dessert menu and didnt come back for 15 mins so by that time i changed my mind and all i wanted to do was leave.  dont believe the hype..", 
            "really?  4 stars for this place?  i don't get it.  we had the chili relano, <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, and queso fundito dip.  chili relano had this really thick dry crust that looked good but didn't go with the chili relano at all.  the tamale was so-so and the queso fundito dip was good but not $18 good.  very disappointed.  expected so much more for the price and an iron chef.  service is whatevers too.", 
            "we went for brunch on a saturday and it was not busy at all - no need for reservations. they started us out with a complimentary selection of their breakfast breads.  six thimble sized biscuits, a cheddar jalapeno corn muffin, two pieces of blueberry coffee cake and two miniature chocolate scones.  it looks pretty, and is a fun gesture, but the only bread of note was the blueberry coffee cake.  the scones and biscuits were both very dry.\n\nwe split the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> appetizer, smoked <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> and the cheese grits.  the tamale was just as good as it looks in photos, and if i came again i would definitely order one (or two) of those.  the sauce was very salty, so if you are sensitive to that you might want to pick a different item.  the hash had a really strong vinegar flavor.  i like vinegar, but the whole thing just tasted like someone had dumped a bunch of cheap hot sauce all over it.  plus, it came out really fast, and was lukewarm.  with all the great reviews of this dish, i was very unimpressed - especially with the $18 price tag. the cheese grits were not at all what i was expecting.  good southern style grits are fluffy, these are very heavy.  they tasted like cream cheese and green chili, so it is hard to say they were bad, they just weren't at all as expected.\n\nthe service was attentive - too attentive!  one of the servers was literally standing over my husbands shoulder waiting for him to take his last bite.  this just felt awkward.  \n\nperhaps dinner would be a better time to go, but i just feel like this place is more about aesthetics and less about freshness and flavor.", 
            "food was great, service was not.\n\nwe ordered:\ntiger shrimp & <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> - the sauce is to die for\ncoffee rubbed filet mignon - perfectly grilled mid rare, and seasoned well. \nsauteed spinach - nothing to write home about\nlobster out of the shell - very tasty, strong citrus flavor in sauce\n\nfood was good, not great, but i can't make a proper judgement on the food because we were still pretty full from a bachannal lunch buffet.  i will say that the open kitchen was a nice touch.  it looks like a well-run crew.  food came out promptly and the presentation was excellent on everything.  these cooks know what they are doing.\n\nwhat ruined the experience for us were the cold hosts and waiter.  these kids had an irritated expression on their faces throughout the entire service.  our first experience with a hostess when we walk in was seeing the back of her head while she spent a couple minutes trying to figure out where to put some sort of vase or jar in a drawer.  i had to say something to get her attention.  \n\nafter we finished eating our entrees, our kid waiter tossed the dessert menus on the table without saying anything and quickly left.  i tried to get his attention to let him know we didn't want any and i guess he didn't hear or didn't care to turn around.  \n\nas we were leaving, the host past by and said a cold farewell with an irritated expression on his face, without having the courtesy of looking at us.  i'm not asking for a chili's-type super excited \"thanks for coming!\"  but i did just drop $160 on a $135 bill.  a little less attitude would be nice.\n\nout of the four people we came in contact with on the wait staff, only the older gentleman acted like he worked in a [former] michelin-starred restaurant.  if i could have personally handed our tip to that older gentleman, i would have and left nothing for the others.\n\ni would have come back for the food, but i won't be back due to the fast-food-like service.",

            "i can say that this place was a delightful experience. came out to vegas for a weekend with my ladies to celebrate a birthday, this place was the groups must have spot. we had made reservations for 8:30pm on a saturday night before our late night shenanigans at light. \n\nas soon as we enter, greeted by the hostess, taken to our table. we then met our waiter, james (he reminds me of an asian version of the actor terrence howard). james was super sweet, charming, he told us the story of the resturant.... it's owned by bobby flay, they are known for their margaritas, lobster tacos, <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, lamb and pork entrees. i told him that my friend viet pham beat bobby flay on iron chef! he just smiled and recommended we start with a round of the house margaritas. those drinks were definitely on point! not too sweet, tart & strong- loveee! they provide a yummy assortment of bread in a basket, the best was the jalape\\u00f1o cornbread muffin, the girls devoured them! james came by to check on us and was so kind to bring us more. i'm in love with the service james provided, he was knowledgable, gave great suggestions, was very direct and efficient - he knew how to handle a table of women! we all ordered the lobster tacos, <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> and had a side of grilled corn & twice baked potato. everything was light, flavorful and delicious. we ordered another round of drinks! by this time we were craving something sweet! james recommended the banana pudding - my pick! the birthday girl didn't fancy banana pudding so she picked coconut cake to share with the table. james saw my sad face :( and he brought me a banana pudding anyways on him! loveee him!! lol. at the end of our meal, he brought out our check and 4 to-go cups to take our margaritas with us - to keep our party going. i love his thoughtfulness and his service is by far the best i have ever seen. \n\nthank you james for your amazing service! next time i'm in vegas, i'm dining at mesa grill for sure. see our pic!",

            "i'll just go ahead and get my main gripe out of the way: mesa grill is one of the most unimpressive looking 'fancy' restaurants that i have been to.  if it wasn't for the fact that it is in the middle of cesar's palace, i would have guessed that it was just your average south-western/mexican restaurant.  it was when the hostess asked me to remove my hat when i realized that they take themselves pretty seriously here, and thanks to the food, rightfully so.\n\nmy meal was delicious! i ordered the tiger shrimp sweet <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> as an appetizer, the new york steak as my main entr\\u00e9e, and mash potatoes as a side.  i actually had a difficult time selecting what i wanted, because although the menu is small, most of the items were unusual dishes that i wasn't interested in trying.  the menu consisted of a lot of seafood and less traditional meats, and i just wanted something basic.  thankfully everything that i ordered turned out to be really good.  the highlight was the shrimp appetizer.  it was ridiculously priced for how tiny it was, but the combination of flavors was outstanding.  the theme of the meal in general was flavor, and everything from the bread to the pear margarita that i ordered pack a ton of it.  \n\nin addition to my food, i tried my date's pork tenderloin.  it was amazing!  i would highly recommend it as a main dish, and it is most likely what i would order the next time i am here.\n\nmesa grill is not a place that i could eat at all of the time, nor is it a place i would take someone to impress with ambiance.  however, they have superbly flavorful food that was well worth the visit.  it will not be one of my 'go-to' places when i visit the strip, but i can see myself coming back from time to time.", 
            "i didn't even know i didn't review this place so here it is since we came here a 2nd time this past week. they provide you w/ some awesome bread(i prefer the nutty bread...i think i ate like 5-6..) oh just to let you know they have jalapeno pop bread that they only have during brunch(so when we came here for lunch they didn't have it :() .\n\nthey have some similarities of food for brunch and lunch but we tried to avoid getting the same thing as brunch. \nwe had the smoked chicken + black  bean quesadilla, <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, swordfish, and cornmeal crusted chile relleno. \ni thought the smoked chicken quesadilla was pretty tasty. i think they grilled/fried the skin so it be crispy when you eat it and obviously goes well w/ avocado. i love the garlic creme fraiche. \n<mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>: i liked it more the first time i had it but it was still really tasty. i thought it was a bit oversalted this time around but the shrimp was very good. i love the corns that are in it. \ncornmeal crusted chile rellano- eh. maybe it would be better w/ some kind of meat but it was a bit lackluster for me. could use some more spice as well. it was pretty cool to see a whole pepper covered in cornmeal but it was very dry due to it as well. barely got any eggplant in there as well. \nswordfish: i thought this was absolutely delicious. the swordfish was cooked in perfection and had a great sauce to go along w/ it. i love the cream green chile rice. it was kinda like risotto but less mushy. it was just an overall very tasty and seasoned dish. \n\ni would recommend it to anybody. it's a bit on the heavier side but i think it's definitely worth a try. love their bread :3", 
            "this was my second time dining here, and i do think it's a solid four stars. as much as i love bobby flay and southwestern food, i just wasn't impressed the first time; however, my boyfriend and i were looking for a nice dinner that didn't break the bank all while offering great food and cocktails, so we decided to give it another go (mostly because all of our other \"hot spots\" were closed before christmas, but i digress).\n\ni will say they have excellent service. we had a wonderful waiter who was both polite and prompt. i started with the white peach margarita, which came out perfectly- slightly sweeter than the traditional but not so much that it's overboard. i had a terrible margarita before which really turned me off, but i think mesa grill redeemed itself on the cocktail part after this white peach one. as other reviewers have said, they have a nice complimentary bread basket that we both enjoyed. for my meal, i ordered <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark> and the tiger shrimp and <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> (appetizer) and my boyfriend had the new mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin. the food is great, but my one quip is there is just not enough of it. i honestly felt like the appetizer portion was equal to the pork entr\\u00e9e, which is kind of sad. it is really, really good, just sort of small. i'm not sure if it was just the pork dish or if all of the entr\\u00e9es are like this, but it was a little off-putting. you should not order a meal and still feel hungry after eating, sorry.\n\nwith that said, i've actually recommended mesa grill to a few other people traveling to las vegas and they've all had great experiences. perhaps it's me, but i just can't say it's my favorite place in a city full of so many ridiculously good restaurants.", 
            "stopped by for dinner on 1/10/15.\n\nwe ordered two house margaritas, <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, chipotle glazed ribeye, spice rubbed pork tenderloin, double-baked potatoes, and finished off with a banana cream pie.\n\nservice sucked, the waiter was obviously untrained. food was fine. i think the food could have been better if we weren't turned off by the service. for most of the meal, i almost forgot that i was in a celebrity chef restaurant.\n\nthe food was not bad at all, but it didn't meet its own standard.\n\nwe won't be back by choice.", 
            "i recently dined at mesa for the first time and i must say the food was quite delicious. for starters i had the blue corn pancake with barbecue duck and the tiger shrimp with a <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>. the tiger shrimp and the tamale was very awesome, perfect combination of flavors. i found the pancake and duck however to be a little too sweet, if they could fix the sauce it would be awesome. for our main course my friend and i shared the spicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>, which was splendid. for being on the strip i didn't think the prices were too bad either.\n\nbiggest downside: it is in caesar's, which is not my favorite place to be on the strip.", 
            "tl;dr  great food, friendly but uninspired service.\n\nmy wife brought me here for my birthday.  almost all of the food was wonderful.\n\ni had the caesar's salad, blue <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, and rabbit.  my wife had a blue <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> and the only chicken dish on the menu.\n\nthe meal started with a basket of 3 different breads.  the jalape\\u00f1o cheese bread and the date rasin bread were wonderful.  the corn muffin on the other hand was fairly bland and very dry.\n\nthe caesar's salad has warm crutons, made from hominy that had a wonderful crunchy shell around a sweet soft inside, with chorizo slices and parmasian cheese crisps.  wonderful.\n\nmy wife and i loved the blue <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>.  they were served in a tied husk, had a great texture, and wonderful flavor.\n\nthe only chicken dish was too spicy for my wife.  she said the flavor was good but very spicy.\n\nas i said, i had the rabbit.  i loved it.  it had a crusty outside and was cooked and seasoned perfectly.", 
            "i was in las vegas for a conference and brought two of my students to mesa grill for dinner. throughout dinner the wait staff were super - very attentive, prompt with our order, and helpful. service is very important and the waiters can make or break a restuarant - in our case they totally made our night enjoyable. \n\nnow moving to our meals. we ordered 2 <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> which were exquisite and i am a huge tamale fan so i know a good tamale when i taste it!!! i would definitely recommend the tamales. we also ordered as our main dishes - a tuna steak, the <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark>, and the spice rubbed pork tenderloin. each dish was prepared to perfection. i had the pork tenderloin and i would go back to mesa grill to have this again any day. it's easy to see why bobby flay is a celebrity chef and although he did not prepare the meal personally he has great chefs preparing meals for his guests.\n\ni know that some folks complain about the small portion sizes at a place like mesa grill, but all i have to say is, if you want a lot of food go to a place that has a buffet that's why they exist; however, i'll continue to go to mesa grill for a great meal experience.", 
            "my fianc\\u00e9 and i decided to try out mesa grill on valentine's day, and we were extremely pleased with everything! \n\nservice: our waiter was friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. he made sure our food tasted great and our glasses were always full. although the restaurant was busy and our server was waiting on several guests, he made an appearance every few minutes. \n\nfood: the food was excellent! i highly recommend the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> appetizer. honestly, i would come back just for that dish and dessert. our entrees were also delicious--i had the grilled mahi mahi and my fianc\\u00e9 had the chile relleno. both were prepared well, though, we thought the prices were a bit high for the portion sizes (most items are served a la carte).  however, if you're eating at a restaurant on the strip, it's to be expected, so i'm not complaining too much. and, the absolute highlight of the meal was the dessert. we ordered the chocolate cajeta cake. don't let the rather simple description on the menu fool you. this cake is absolutely amazing! it's served warm and covered in a rich caramel sauce with a crispy chocolate topping. if you like chocolate, you can't miss out on this dessert!", 
            "<mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>= shrimp were huge, fresh, amazing. this was unlike anything and i loved every moment of eating it.\n\n<mark>Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad</mark>= probably my least favorite thing on the menu and was still awesome.  all the food on the menu is incredibly seasoned unlike anything, and every bite leaves you wanting more.", 
            "bobby flay always seems to whip up the types of food i want shoved in my facehole. stat....... on iron chef. so i was suuuuper pumped to finally taste his food for lunch. (i know, not even the same realm as his iron chef fare. but still.)\n\ni liked the interior. modern, clean, with clear southwestern elements thrown in without it being at all kitschy.\n\non to what's important - the food...\n\nbread basket: jalapeno asiago bread, corn bread w/jalape\\u00f1o cilantro and tomato (?), and blueberry walnut [3/5]\n*** cold crumbly/dry bread, hard butter. was especially excited to try the two jalapeno breads and while you couldn't really taste the cheese nor jalapeno in the jalapeno asiago bread, the corn bread was pretty darn good.\n\nblue corn pancake + barbecued duck w/habanero chile - star anise sauce $15 [3/5]\n*** this was an ok dish. not too big a fan of the sauce. i think they were trying to work with the concept of a peking duck pancake here but was a little off on the execution. sounds like it's been on the menu for years so there might be fans out there. i'm just not one of them.\n\ntiger shrimp + <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> w/corn - cilantro sauce $16 [4.5/5]\n*** the star of the meal. it's got a lot of rave reviews for good reason. it's on point visually, texture-wise, and most importantly, in flavor. \n\nnew mexican spices <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> w/grilled red onion, arugula ancho chile mayonnaise + <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark> $16 [4/5]\n*** the ancho chile mayonnaise was mmmgoot. the pork tenderloin had a tasty rub as well. great flavors.\n\noverall a solid meal but i probably wouldn't prioritize mesa over other vegas favorites. now..... where do i go in california/nevada to eat the kind of stuff he cooks on iron chef? or anywhere really?", 
            "ate here twice, both meals were really good, service was stellar.  had the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> $18, delicious but very, very rich, heavy cream texture.  also enjoyed the ancho chili salmon $32, but would prefer wild salmon over atlantic.  the fish seemed a little oily and although the sauces made it pop, i wouldn't order it again.  the fundido goat cheese dip $16 was hard to scoop, it had hardened in the iron dish and i question whether it was actual goat cheese or a blend.  the chips were chips.  the mesa margaritas $14 each were very tart, but fresh tasting and generous with the tequila. the woman at the bar was not as friendly as the floor staff, but she may just have been having a bad day.  hopefully the tip we left her cheered her up.  it is a fabulous restaurant offering top notch entrees and drinks.  can't wait to try other items on the menu the next time we are in vegas.", 
            "i was very surprised that i really enjoyed dining in this restaurant. i am not a big bobby flay fan so i was a bit hesitant to dine here for the first time but i'm glad my friends and i finally did it! we tried this place for lunch and started with the most awesome complimentary bread basket that included this blue and yellow jalape\\u00f1o corn bread that was to die for! for starters we ordered the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>- scrumptious is one word to describe it! this dish truly got my attention, bobby! we also ordered rough cut tuna nachos- so refreshing and yummy. for our main courses we ordered the southwestern spice chicken skewer-grilled just right. smoked shrimp tacos-very well seasoned and cooked to perfection not dry at all. <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark>-a great panini type sandwich with fine dining quality. for desert we ordered the most amazing banana bread pudding that left me speechless coz all i want to do is savor and eat it! the service we had was great and our server was very attentive. ambiance has a very modern feel with lots of colored vase to reflect the southwestern theme of the place.\nthis restaurant is definitely a must try when in vegas!", 
            "was...  okay.  maybe it's because we live in socal and are exposed to those flavors often, but we found ourselves disappointed.  the margaritas were great and the sweet potato clam chowder was unique and well seasoned.  the blue <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> side was dry, odd for something steamed, the replacement was equally bad.  the meat was okay but nothing to write home about.  for the price point i expected more.  if i was at my local steak house paying half that the value would have been there.", 
            "bobby flay's over gordon ramsey's steak house.\n\ncame here for my birthday, they don't do any free dessert or anything. if you order a dessert they would put a candle on it though. \n\nbread basket ( free ) - super yummy ! we really like the blue corn muffin.. it's soft and taste way better than your regular corn bread. the waiter let us get another order of it for free. \n\nentrees -( grilled lamb porterhouse chops ) the best i ever had, seriously. i'm that one person that always order lamb and i can honestly say this was the place. my medium rare lamb was cooked perfectly.. not to rare either just perfect and ever bite had this explosion in my mouth. so mouth watering good, it also came with a blue <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>! how can a tamale be so soft and moist? ugh, i want to go back and order this again. \n\nboyfriend had the ( new mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin, cooked medium ) so good, i took a bite of it and the pork was moist and juicy. i didn't know you could get pork medium i guess it's just the part of pork you're eating you can. it also came with a sweet potato tamale, sounds weird together but very good. make sure to take a bite of the pork with the tamale together... oh you won't regret it hahaha. \n\ndessert -  ( chocolate cajeta cake ) - wow, moist! seriously every dish is so moist hahaha. best cake ever, try it guys. it's warm chocolate cake with ice cream, who doesn't like that? \n\noverall everything was super delicious, service was good but not top notch. everything was really filling, i honestly thought the dishes were way bigger, but the photos in yelp are all lies hahaha it's actually really small but when you continue to eat you'll actually get really full but  even though you're full you can't say no to dessert hahaha. \n\n2 entrees - 1 dessert = $108 and some change, which is a really good price for our meal.", 
            "we are locals, and came down to the strip for a celebration dinner.  mesa grill books up, so reservations are essential.  we arrived at our appointed time and were immediately seated.  we had a nice view of the open kitchen and serving window, so it was easy to spot some of the popular dishes as we were contemplating our order. the assistant waiter promptly came over and offered water. then, the only hiccup of the evening.  it took 10 minutes for the waiter to stop by and greet us and take drink orders.  service after that was just fine.\n\nfor $240 (inclusive of tax and a 20% tip), our party of two had:\n\n3 really great margaritas.  they have 3 different varieties.  i had the one that was described as part tart, part sweet.  it was pink in color. really good.\n\n2 appetizers:  <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> and lobster tacos.  both were outstanding.  as others have stated, the tacos are small.  however, when paired with a complete multicourse meal, they are perfect.\n\n2 entrees:  veal chop and lamb chop.  both came with a side tamale, so we didn't order extra sides.  the veal chop may have been the best i've ever had.  really delicious.  the lamb was very good, but not as outstanding as the veal chop.\n\n1 desert:  shared the banana cream pudding.  it was good, but could have used a bit more banana flavor.\n\nthe atmosphere here can border on loud.  you are adjacent to the casino, and although the windows separating the restaurant from the casino are floor to ceiling, they have a louvered effect, so both sound, and sadly, cigarette smoke enter the restaurant.  the smoke is not too bad, but it is noticeable.\n\nthis was our second visit, the first being lunch.  would definitely return again.  just remember, for dinner especially, make a reservation!",

            "we were in vegas for a special occasion and chose mesa grill because of the southwestern menu and good reviews. we enjoy sharing small plates so we chose from the appetizers and side dishes. lobster tacos ($20 for 3 tiny tacos) were tasty but overpriced. \"sofie's salad\" was a major disappointment, anemic oxidized lettuce with canned beans and mealy chopped tomatoes, cold from refrigeration. blue <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> side dish was like dry cornbread stuffed into a corn husk. chile relleno and cauliflower gratin were the best dishes we tried but nothing special. i love coconut cake but mesa grill's version didn't have any coconut flavor, it really didn't taste like anything. the ambiance and service get 4 stars, the food 2 stars at best. a huge disappointment. was it a bad night for the kitchen ? that shouldn't happen at a high caliber restaurant in las vegas.",

            "my buddies and i came here one weekend after reading staggering reviews. the food were tasty overall.  the best dish was the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>. the sauce was savory and spot on.\nportions were a bit on the smaller portion scale for the $$$ prices on the menu so doing family style might not be ideal.\n\nthe only thing we didn't like was one of the sides - spinach rossito because of the cheese they put in made it very salty. the waiter was nice enough to replace it with mashed potato. the service was decent but they forgot to bring extra bowls even though they weren't too busy.", 
            "wonderful place at an affordable price.\nhad the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> and devoured it.\nno tank top, casual but cool place to hang out.\nexcellent burgers, been here twice \nbathroom, a must see.\nwaiters are very attentive but when they hand you the bill they force you to pay 18 percent gratuity due to a large group, thumbs down on that. but then again, they don't know that i own a business and i tip generously.", 
            "mesa grill is definitely a restaurant you need to experience in las vegas. this bobby flay restaurant is located inside of caesars palace. the restaurant seating is an open spaced floor plan and has  a nice warm southwestern feel. we came here during restaurant week so  i was hesitant on how long the wait would be. to my surprise we got seated right away! instantly i was pleased as i am not a very patient person when it comes to waiting for a seat. \n\nmy first dish i tried was the new mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin with a bourbon and ancho chile sauce and a sweet potato tamale with crushed pecan butter. all i can say is heaven. it was amazing. i am always nervous to try pork dishes as it is my favorite type of meat and i hold it to a very high standard. this was the best pork dish i have ever had. tender, juicy and the mix of spices took me on a wild tasty ride! \n\nthe next dish i tried was the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> with corn in a cilantro sauce. oh my goodness. i was blown away! the mix of the sweet corn, butter and cilantro sauce was paired so nicely with the shrimp that i ate the whole thing! i couldn't put the fork down it was just too delicious.  the shrimp was huge and the portion of this dish was perfect! i would have never paired shrimp with corn before but am looking forward to finding a way to make this recipe at home.\n\nanother dish i recommend is the <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> with spicy black bean sauce and roasted jalape\\u00f1o crema. i was hesitant to order something with black bean sauce as i have never heard of anything like that before. i am glad i took the jump and tried something new! i was totally impressed with the flavors from the jalape\\u00f1o crema, the salmon and the black bean sauce.\n\ni had such a great experience my first time at mesa grill that i have been back numerous times since. when you visit las vegas make sure to make mesa grill a priority on your \"to do\" list. you will not be disappointed, i guarantee it!\n\nsee my full review here: http://corkedandporked.com/2015/03/23/bobby-flays-las-vegas-restaurant-mesa-grill/", 
            "i have been here a few times for dinner.  this was the first time i had lunch here.  we stared with the goat cheese queso fundido that was creamy and delish. the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> was probably the best thing we had.  the combination of the shrimp and corn, plus the corn sauce is really good.  great combo of flavors. the cornmeal crusted chile relleno is probably the most beautiful plate with gorgeous colors of the sauces.  it looked like a piece of art and it tasted really nice.  it is light, filled with a yummy cheese.  the shrimp tacos were very good.  the shrimp was tender and bursting with flavors and spices.  my friend had the salmon and loved it.  the salmon was flakey and perfectly cooked.  dessert was great.  we had a chocolate cake and and a pistachio cake that were both great.  the pistachio had a strawberry ice-cream and fresh berries.  the margaritas are really good, served on the rocks.", 
            "a wonderful \"foodie' experience!  we shared 4 appetizers and dessert.  we were full and satisfied.  the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> was beyond flavorful... maybe just a little small.  the shrimp were medium size and only 4 of them.\nwe were seated at a small table for 2 even tho the  place was not very busy.  table very crowded.  two couples seated after us each got tables for 4.  guess we should have asked.  our waiter was missing in action alot and we had several people filling in.  \nagain, food full of flavors and fabulous.  wait staff not so much!", 
            "i can't believe this place was as empty as it was on a saturday afternoon. i'm guessing it gets busier at night, but i have no idea. the food was exceptional, and the service exemplary. \n\ninstead of bread, they bring you a basket of little breads, muffins and pastries. we didn't eat all of them, but got them to give us a doggy bag for late night snacks. \n\nthe <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> was soooooo good i'm still dreaming about the sauces it came with. 5 star dish all the way!\n\nwe also got the tuna \"nachos.\" these aren't really nachos - they give you small tortilla potato chips basically you use to scoop up the raw chunks of tuna and the two sauces it comes with - a habanero sauce that wasn't too spicy and an avocado crema.\n\nalso, we ordered the shrimp tacos. they were delicious - i don't know what bobby flay puts in those sauces (other than copious amounts of butter) but i can't get enough. the tortillas are unlike any i've had before, but they might just be the most perfect tortillas ever - soft and strong so that they don't fall apart. \n\nwill be back for the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> next time i'm in vegas.", 
            "the gf and i were looking to indulge in a proper lunch before leaving for our flight back to philly. so after checking out at caesars palace, we stopped by bobby flay's mesa grill. while the original nyc restaurant is now closed (he's got bar americain and the recently opened gato now), in vegas, the iron chef is still able to showcase the southwestern flavors and flair he's known for.\n\nlocated a stone's throw away from the opulent omnia nightclub, mesa grill is sleekly designed with southwest elements and colors. \n\nbread service\n\nbread service started us off with a nice variety of freshly baked sourdough, cranberry walnut, and a great blue and sweet corn muffin with a bit of jalapeno. nice.\n\ngoat cheese queso fundido [$16]\nrajas, blistered serrano vinaigrette, blue corn tortilla strips\n\nwe had the goat cheese queso fundido, which was gorgeously creamy. it had some nice heat from the blistered serrano vinaigrette, which was accented by the roasted red and green chiles. the cilantro added a nicely fresh herbaceouness to each bite. the crispy blue corn tortilla strips were a great vessel to scoop up all the deliciousness.\n\ntiger shrimp & <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> [$18]\ncorn, cilantro sauce\n\neasily one of the best tamale's i've had, the creamy richness of the roasted garlic and sweet corn sauce on point. the tiger shrimp was supple, yet had good snap and the corn masa within was luxurious and not at all dry. the cilantro sprig helped to brighten up each bite. \n\nspicy chicken & <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> [$18]\npoached eggs, green chile hollandaise\n\nthe gf went with the spicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> for her main. there was a great lusciousness to each bite, with some texture from the sweet potato and the moist chicken. the green chile hollandaise had a bit of heat to it, though very slight. the poached egg brought each bite over the top. \n\ncornmeal crusted chile relleno [$18]\nroasted eggplant, manchego cheese, sweet red pepper sauce, balsamic vinegar\n\nmy cornmeal crusted chile relleno offered great texture from the cornmeal crust, which cracked open to reveal a creamy manchego malenge with well-roasted eggplant. the green and red sauces emblematic of bobby flay were on display here and not just for show. along with the sweet notes from the balsamic, these sauces helped to providing some acidic balance to each bite. \n\noverall, mesa grill was spot on in terms of execution and taste. i wouldn't hesitate to recommend stopping by, especially if you're looking for a glimpse into the flavors that are the foundation of iron chef bobby flay.", 
            "mesa grill, what a fabulous environment located in busy caesars palace. it's was busy but reservations got us right in no problem. server was great and they all help each other so your drink never sees the bottom of glass. \n\nmy wife started off with a bowl of their famous <mark>Fresh Tomato Soup</mark>, i can't stand tomatoes but this was like a cooked salsa. it was surprisingly tasty. i ordered the roasted corn chowder which was offered for a limited time and let me tell you it was out of this world. next up was their famous <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, i almost licked the plate clean.\n\nfor our entrees, my wife went with the chicken & black bean quesadillas. those were crazy good. i went with their famous spice rubbed pork tenderloin, it did not disappoint. cooked perfect with a spicy bbq sauce drizzled over it. i've had it before but tonight's was amazing. i highly recommend the side of corn & jalape\\u00f1o that might just be the best thing in their menu.", 
            "dining at mesa grill was a split experience. we loved the food - we were initially served with a bread bowl which was really fresh and warm. we ordered <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> as our appetizer - which was the best dish of the evening. for the main course we ordered sixteen spice chicken and ancho chili. chicken was nice and moist but nothing spectacular; it came with mashed potatoes which is a whole other story - simply delicious. chili was amazing - the crust and the sauce were probably the best parts of the dish.\n\nservice in general was ok - glasses were filled with water regularly - we were checked on to see how our food was and such but.... it was my friends birthday and we asked the hostess to bring out a cake as a surprise towards the end (i was obviously going to pay for it). guess what - nothing! was really disappointed by such carelessness from such a big establishment especially when we went there only to celebrate someone's birthday! not sure we'll return after our experience.", 
            "being a huge fan of the food network, i knew i had to hit up bobby flay's restaurant since i was staying at caesars palace. caesar palace has tons of options but we decided to dine here for the night. \n\ni started with <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> with cilantro sauce. this thing was amazing. one of the best tamales i have ever eaten in my life. all the flavors sync up and its the best. its more on a pricey side from your $2 tamales but its life changing. \n\ni also ordered the steak but i thought it was okay. the roasted corn was pretty good and the double baked potatoes. \n\nall in all, i got to cross it off my list of restaurant i been wanting to try. service was really good too.", 
            "i want to be upfront and let everyone know i'm probably a little biased with this review. i watch a lot of food porn (food network) and bobby flay is king. \n\nwent to mesa grill at 945pm for a late dinner. thought the waiters may be ready to go home but that wasn't the case at all. we had great service the entire meal. \n\nwe stared with 2 <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>. 1 wasn't enough. \n\ni had the ribeye (sauces on the side). best sw steak i've had. my wife got the coffee rubbed filet also deadly. \n\noverall this was a great culinary experience and i'll be back.", 
            "went here for brunch with the fam bam. the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> was out of this world. the shrimp were very well seasoned, the tamale filling was slightly sweet and had corn for a nice texture contrast. as much as it pains me to give it a 5 star since bobby flay isn't my favorite person this restaurant definitely deserves it for the food, ambience and excellent service we got. price point is expected for being a signature restaurant.", 
            "can't stop raving about this place!  lots of things looked good, but i was told i specifically needed to try the steak.  ribeye was sold out (couple hrs before they closed on a monday night), so i got the ny strip steak.  the seasoning and the sear on the steak were just right, cooked to medium rare, and served with a circle comprised of 3 sauces.  one of the sauces had a little kick but lended a complexity to the flavor.  it was unlike any steak i've ever had before.  if you want a steak but possibly something different, i would highly recommend this place.  i could tasty salty and spicy among other things.\n\nny strip steak = 5/5\nshrimp & <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> appetizer = 5/5 (big enough to share w/ a friend)\nroasted corn side = 5/5 (couldn't begin to finish all of it, share a side w/ a friend)\ncomplimentary bread and butter = 5/5 (several kinds of bread)\nshell-off lobster = 4/5 (i tried my friend's entree and didn't have my own, so this is based on 1 bite really)\nservice = 5/5\n\nwith no microwave at my hotel, i made a point to finish the steak at the expense of leaving some of the other stuff behind.", 
            "i've eaten here twice in the last 3 days. i really enjoyed the food. the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> were amazing! i loved the rabbit and the lobster out of the shell. there drinks are good too. service was decent. i would definitely go back!", 
            "mesa grill at caesars palace in viva las vegas will make your toes curl! from 1 to 10, it's an 11! the service is impeccable and each dish will want you yearning for one last bite. great wine selection, tequilas and fantastic margaritas. be careful those margaritas will sneak up on you quickly. lobster tacos, rough cut tuna nachos, <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, coffee rubbed filet and pork dishes are all can't miss. order a bunch and share as you don't want to miss any of these. bobby flay hits the mark and should be on anyone's list for culinary delight while in las vegas.", 
            "this review is based on a visit 04/21/2015 for lunch right at open (11am).  \n\nseated immediately without reservation, which was great.  server provided recommendations without needing to be asked.  constant water refills when only partially empty.  great service overall.\n\nitems ordered:\n- blue corn pancake w/ duck bbq -- this is my wife's absolute favorite item here, and it was ok but definitely not as good as in the past.  this alone is one of the primary reasons we keep coming back, so that was disappointing.\n- tiger shrimp w/ <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> -- this was good, although there could have been more of it.  it's an appetizer though, so that's kinda the norm.\n- entree - shrimp tacos w/ avocado, tomatillo, mango sauces, citrus cilantro slaw.  this was a suggestion from the waiter.  just average, nothing great.    would not order this again.\n- entree - yucatan chicken skewers -- horribly disappointing. 3 tiny pieces of chicken with peanut chile aioli, with 2 tiny dried up tortillas.  i couldn't believe it was so bad.\n\nseating is very close quarters, to the point that it's uncomfortable trying to have a conversation.  you are literally in the conversations of people next to you, and while that may be an attractive feature of a family-style restaurant, it's not appropriate in this location.  definite minus for that.\n\nmesa grill has always been one of our \"must-go\" stops on previous trips.  we've been there twice before this visit, but both visits were for dinner.   this is the first time that the food was not stellar, and that's the only reason this is a 3-star review and not a 2.  price is not an issue, because it's pretty standard for vegas strip places and the food was always great previously and worth every penny.  we *might* go back next time we visit, but it's definitely off the \"i can't leave vegas without going\" list.",

            "[this review is for the brunch menu.]\n\nmesa - this restaurant has been staring me in the eye for ages and i finally got to take it on with great results.  \n\nthe menu is a southern tex-mex style and lots of style indeed.  dishes are flavorful and fairly bold in their interpretations of classic dishes you may be used to.  one of the early delights is the included bread basket with a lot of tasty choices.  my personal favorite was the blueberry scone and another really interesting bread concoction (not sure if it was a zucchini bread?)  my table ordered a variety of dishes from there (they also have a fairly robust wine list and margarita list as well along with a full bar menu) that ranged from <mark>Barbecued Lamb Cobb Salad</mark> to amazing looking waffles.  from the dishes i tried, i surprisingly loved the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> the most.  the presentation was not only very well done but the flavors of both the tamale and the well-spiced tiger shrimp hit the spot.   \n\nmy only small complaints were that some of the dishes didn't seem as strong as the others.  the house margarita (i believe called the patrida) was a little more hit-or-miss - not as sweet but not as flavorful as other margaritas i've had either.  the <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> also was a little more on the not-so-sure side.  i liked the presentation but the dish came out a little colder than expected and the <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> wasn't as flavorful.  perhaps an off day for the dish?  \n\nservice was excellent for sure (friendly, fun and keeping tabs on us regularly) and brunch on a saturday was surprisingly not that busy.  the decor has a fun fire theme throughout the entire restaurant that goes from the ceilings to the lighting - i really dug the theme.  \n\nall-in-all, mesa is a fantastic restaurant stop and the brunch doesn't burn the wallet either.  a worthy check out.",

            "when i heard bobby flay owned this joint, i knew i had to try.... i watch iron chef religiously and i believe it caused my expectations to be alittle too high. \n\nbread basket: (yes, i consider this a course) disappointing. i like my bread warm and fresh from the oven. these offerings were too cold to enjoy. \n\nappetizers: got the <mark>Baby Romaine Salad</mark>, gala apple salad, and the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>. i could have skipped all these dishes and saved more room for dessert. the tamale was good, but the flavors didn't have me singing to the high heavens... and the salads left much to be desired. the <mark>Baby Romaine Salad</mark> lacked dressing and the croutons were way too soggy. the apple salad was mostly just chopped apple so it got too filling. \n\nmain course: definitely get the lamb chops or the <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark>. both were perfectly cooked and i licked my plates clean. delish!! however, skip the collard greens. they weren't worth the stomach room. but the table next to ours were raving about the brussels sprouts, so i wish i gave those a try. \n\ndessert: you can not leave the mesa grill without trying the sticky toffee pudding. when i took my first bite the clouds parted, angels were singing, and all the stars aligned. this dessert will go down in the books! yum, yum! \n\nbottom line: it was a good date night. more misses than hits for me. will i return? maybe if i'm craving some sticky toffee pudding.", 
            "i didn't really know much about bobby flay before eating at mesa grill, but left his restaurant with a very high opinion of him. he's not a \"celebrity chef\" with a tv personality but mediocre culinary skills - he's the real deal. first, the service was impeccable. we were greeted and seated immediately by the hostess and every need we could have had was anticipated and catered to by our waiter and sommellier. second, the setting was very warm and open (this is the type of place where one is made to feel welcome whether he is wearing jeans or a three piece suit). third, and most important, the food was delicious. between my friend and i, we had the <mark>Baby Romaine Salad</mark>, coffee rubbed filet mignon (to die for), new mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin, mashed potatoes with green chile queso sauce (another favorite), fresh <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, and toasted coconut layer cake. every bit of the meal was delicious and i truly couldn't have asked for a better dining experience. while this restaurant is a little pricey, it is definitely worth the money and i promise you will leave very satisfied.", 
            "my husband and i went to mesa grill for dinner last weekend. besides the bartender who gave me major attitude for asking for sugar free redbull (after pouring 2 guys' to-go cups of beer into rocks glasses for them, i didn't think my request was such a big deal) our experience was great.\nmmmm cactus pear margarita. \nthe bread basket was really yummy, i actually couldn't stop eating it!!\nfor starters, i had the sweet potato soup. oh my god. my husband had the tacos and he had food envy for sure. tacos were definitely delicious but tiny!! 3 of them could be eaten in 6 bites or less. the soup was absolutely incredible with the maple cream and marcona almonds...highly recommend.\nwe shared the <mark>Baby Romaine Salad</mark>, very good and not overdressed. yummy cheese crisp in the middle. \ni had the filet mignon for dinner, perfectly medium rare and very very yummy. spicy chipotle coating, which was not overpowering.\nhusband had the pork tenderloin - then it was my turn for food envy - wow. extremely delicious, the sauce was to die for.\ncoconut cake for dessert, skip it. it was totally dry and tasteless. i was very sad because i love coconut cake. eh.\nwould definitely go back!\nas an fyi, most of the recipes that the restaurant uses are in bobby flay's cookbook...i'll be picking that up soon so i can make that soup. mmmmm. i'm still dreaming about it.", 
            "i had dinner this evening with my family at the mesa grill, celebrity chef bobby flay's restaurant at  caesar's palace in las vegas. i had made reservations on open table prior to coming to town, but was running late because the traffic on las vegas boulevard was pretty bad. after i pulled into the coliseum valet (which is free, by the way), i told the attendant that i was running late. he pointed out to me where the restaurant is located (it was my first time) and told me that he would call the restaurant to let them know that i was coming. much appreciated! \n\nit was an early dinner reservation, even though i was late, and the restaurant was about half full when we arrived. by the time dinner ended, however, it seemed like the whole restaurant was full. \n\nwe had lamb porterhouse chops served with two sauces (preserved serrano sauce and mint chimichurri) and a blue <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, coffee rubbed filet mignon with roasted corn, black angus new york steak strip with mashed potatoes, and <mark>Baby Romaine Salad</mark> with roasted garlic dressing and hominy croutons (how unique). every single entree was cooked perfectly, and each bite was delicious from beginning to end. \n\nthe service at the restaurant was top-notch. we were promptly seated when we arrived (we had reservations), our orders were taken quickly, and our food was delivered to our table within 10 minutes of ordering. our waitress brenda was wonderful, and all of our servers were very attentive. as we left the restaurant, we were greeted by at least half a dozen staff members. \n\nthe food was bit pricey, but well worth the culinary experience. my family and i don't come to vegas often, but i felt that since we were here, we might as well indulge a bit and enjoy ourselves--we certainly did that at mesa grill.", 
            "our lunch was 16 <mark>Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad</mark>, <mark>Green Chile Cheeseburger</mark>, <mark>Baby Romaine Salad</mark> and goat cheese queso. thumbs up on all the dishes. one drawback for vegetarians is that they couldn't separate the chicken from the chicken & black bean quesadilla, because they said it was pre-mixed.  peaceful interior, not infused with casino music.", 
            "mesa grill is one of my favorites when i go to vegas.  they have awesome food and the servers there are also awesome.  they take the time to go over specials and explain what items on the menu tastes like (on the night i went, it  was super busy). \n\ndrinks:\n\nthe servers were raving about their margaritas, but i opted to get a dessert wine and got the weinlaubenhof kracher 08 ($16 per glass), which was very sweet, so if you're into that, must try!\n\nappetizers:\n\nblue corn lobster taco ($20). i basically like corn, so getting this taco was a given. \n\n<mark>Baby Romaine Salad</mark> ($13), there is nothing that stands out about this salad and tasted generic, so you can save yourself 13 dollars and order something else. \n\nentrees:\n\ntheir 22 oz bone in chipotle glazed rib eye ($48) was spot on.  since it was a large piece of meat,  i opted for well done,  but slightly pink.  this turned out to be amazing. the meat was so soft and tender and it held in the juices and flavor very well. also, to top it off the red and green chile sauce pairs perfectly with the slightly smoked taste of the meat. \n\nmango tuna steak ($38) is a fun little twist to your average steak. it had fun flavors like peppercorn, and pine nuts, cous cous to top off your steak. can't go wrong with a little twist if executed right. \n\ndesserts:\n\nbrown butter carrot cake ($11) the cream cheese was so soft and it came with caramelized apples. it wasn't too sweet, but just enough to fulfill a dessert craving.\n\nchurros ($11) come topped with cinnamon sugar and chocolate/coconut caramel dipping sauces. the texture of the churro did taste a little hard, but unsure if it was just that day or that's the nature of how the churro is made.", 
            "can we just appreciate the perfection that is the tiger prawn tamale? \n\nfor 2 of us, got the tiger prawn tamale to start and a <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> and <mark>Baby Romaine Salad</mark> as entrees. \n\nas good as the <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> was (imagine a bbq tex mex eggs benedict), we kept wishing we just got more of the tiger prawn tamale. the tamale is very moist and fluffy with a good amount of sweet corn kernels for texture and the prawns were perfectly cooked in a creamy, but not heavy, sauce. \n\nthe hash was quite delicious, but eating half of the dish was sufficient as the bbq spicy sauce + sweet potatoes is a bit too sweet and overwhelming for a brunch dish. salad was a good balance to the hash with fresh lettuce and good dressing.\n\n5 stars for that tamale that haunts my dreams.", 
            "sad to say that this was not an enjoyable dinner. we tried many items, and neither the service nor most of the items were even average.\nfirst, there are at least 20 people working in the front of the restaurant, and not once did any of them smile ever. i watched the entire staff and they seemed distant at best.\nok so first the food. ordered nine dishes and only was was any good. blue <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, chile releno, and cauliflower gratin all underflavored. the sweet potato casserole was marginal.\nthe <mark>Baby Romaine Salad</mark> was described to have <mark>Spicy Chorizo Sausage</mark>. only one dime sized slice appeared on the plate.\nthe lobster tacos were fantastic, although a very small portion for almost 20 bucks.\nwe arrived 20 minutes early for our reservation and the manager was reluctant to seat us even though the place was half empty. he originally said we'd have to wait until closer to the reservation time.\ni came here 2 years ago and had a great dinner. (see prior review.) not sure what happened but it looks like the place is more touristy.\nsad to have had this experience.", 
            "i had lunch here the other day and it was so good we went back for dinner tonight. dinner was even better! service is top notch and the food was amazing. for lunch we had <mark>Baby Romaine Salad</mark> with chorizo and homily croutons, <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, and the best burger ever. for dinner we had salmon, <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark>, incredible pork tenderloin and cauliflower gratin. both times we sat at the bar and the service was great. every time i travel to vegas i go to mesa grill. highly recommend."

            "i was excited to eat here, due to all the hype of the restaurant.  as i had saturday brunch here, reservations were no problem.  the food is tasty. i admit.  i had the <mark>Smoked Salmon Quesadilla</mark>, with salmon roe for appetizers and <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> with jalapenos and ham.  my only complaint was that they couldn't make my eggs with all egg whites or egg substitute, as the waiter said that the chef would not do it. i would assume that they would try to accommodate with my request, but they didn't. i guess customer satisfaction is not a top priority here.", 
            "after being told that if everyone in our party didnt show up for our reservation, we would be charged $50/person penalty (wtf!!), we all showed up on time to find the place half empty (for saturday brunch).  they should have been kissing the floor we walked for our business...jeez.\n\nanyways, onto the pros:\n- white peach margarita: not too sweet, but still very tasty.  nice and tart\n- bread basket: the best bread basket i've ever had.  complete with blue corn muffins, blueberry <mark>Coffee</mark>, jalapeno cheddar scones, tequila scones, and some other really yummy scone thing.  they gave us plenty of each so everyone in my group had a taste of everything.\n- egg chilaquiles: i think i misunderstood what these are supposed to be, but regardless, the dish was amazing!  think <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> on top of corn tostadas which were layered with white cheddar.  everything was covered in this delicious green sauce.  the sauce was soo flavorful, i couldnt stop eating even though i was wayy to full from the bread basket and appetizer.\n\ncons:\n- goat cheese fundido:  well, not a con cause it was gooood. but nothing special.  \n- i had seen this mushroom quesadilla appetizer on their lunch menu online, but since we were there for brunch, they only had these other <mark>Smoked Salmon Quesadilla</mark>.  i asked them if they could make me a mushroom one, and they refused saying that the ingredients wouldnt have been prepared.  maybe i'm naive about these things, but um it was 12:30...and they had all the quesadilla fixings put together for brunch anway...just add the mushrooms!!  i'm paying enough to deserve a little more flexibility.  again, shows you how puffed up they are.\n\nall in all, the bread basket and the chilaquiles make up for not giving me a mushroom quesadilla.", 
            "i love this place! things i'm in love with here.... <mark>Smoked Salmon Quesadilla</mark>, ahi tuna nachos, and the salad with goat cheese in it. as a native texan, i'm pretty picky about margaritas and the ones here more than pass the test... no nasty slushies here folks. oh, and have to throw in that lunch is pretty reasonably priced for gourmet dining. lunch for 2 will throw you back $50, but it's definitely $50 well spent!", 
            "maybe brunch isn't the best way to sample flay's menu, because i left thoroughly unimpressed. my party split the crispy bacon and <mark>Smoked Salmon Quesadilla</mark>, both of which were incredibly ordinary. the waiter (more on him in a bit) strongly recommended the spicy chicken + <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>, which i would only recommend if you like eating baby food. while the presentation and flavors were all there, the hash was more of a mash and when you combine that with really tender chicken, you get mush. the creamy grits were a winner, but i really regret pairing that with the mushy chicken/hash. a little bit of textural contrast may have made this good. well, at least i left full.\n\ngood service might have made this a better experience, but the waiter was too much of a salesman. i'm not sure i've ever had a waiter try to push certain dishes so hard, it seemed as if he wanted to order our meals for us. from this single sampling, i'd say that mesa grill does not live up to the bobby flay hype.", 
            "my fiance and i went for sunday brunch and had a fabulous meal. we both loved our <mark>Smoked Salmon Quesadilla</mark> appetizer. my fiance had the chilequiles while i had the chicken & <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> (think southwestern eggs benedict). they were ab-fab, as were the <mark>Spicy Mango - Glazed Bacon</mark> and chorizo we ordered as sides; the bacon, in particular is insanely delicious. \n\nthe restaurant was smaller than expected, but the decor is lovely. our seats afforded us a view of the open kitchen as well as the casino floor, so we could people watch as well as watch food being prepared. \n\nplease note, if you are looking for taco bell, on the border, etc. look elsewhere, that isn't the kind of food served here.", 
            "this review is based just on the weekend brunch.\nfor me, this was one of those spots where it was really good the first time but was ehhhhh the next time. \n\nfood: plenty of great choices on bobby flay's brunch menu. the food has high-end chef written all over it.. small servings, high-priced, but amazing flavor.\nas you are seated, you are given a basket of different breads and muffins that are super tasty and different.\nthe yelp popular <mark>Smoked Salmon Quesadilla</mark> is fantastic. at first glance, it looks like a simple dish that's bound to disappoint but no, this is some quality smoked salmon on top of a well-grilled quesadilla. \nthe chilaquiles is okay.. nothing special and was kind of cold. \nthe <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> was pretty good. loved the hollandaise sauce on it.\n\nambiance: a colorful, classy restaurant with a wide-open space and views of the casino on one side and the kitchen staff doing their art on the other. located in front of the giant sportsbook/pokerroom area of caesars, this is a pretty restaurant with lots of appeal just from the outside. a good place for a social brunch whether you're with your significant or with a group of friends. \n\nservice: servers are very professional and friendly. they come by our table frequently to check on us. the food takes a lonnnngggg time to be served. i don't know if it's because they take their time to cook the food perfectly but the restaurant wasn't crazy busy and it was a bit of a wait.\n\ntips: if you're here for brunch, you have to try the <mark>Smoked Salmon Quesadilla</mark>. come earlier for brunch because the restaurant tends to get very busy during the peak of lunch.", 
            "this place is a family favorite for us, especially for brunch! we have tried pretty much everything on the menu with few disappointments. prices are very reasonable for being on the strip. <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark> is a must; i probably go through a whole pitcher :p \nfor shared appetizer we like the rough cut tuna nachos (basically a poke), queso fundido, and for something different the <mark>Smoked Salmon Quesadilla</mark>.  bread basket is a treat with both sweet and savory muffins, scones, biscuits, and bread. for entrees we usually stick to hot dishes - <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>, chilequiles, salmon. grits and the bacon are favorite sides. i'd say skip the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> (cold deli style), and the salads unless that's what you are in the mood for. steak and eggs is a make your own taco dish which is huge, more than enough for one person. salmon is another great treat! also note that you can only get the churros at dinner time for dessert."

            "overall, i was disappointed by this iron chef america restaurant.  \n\njust so everyone has full information, i do not like bobby flay.  on iron chef he is so cocky, and i bet you nine times out of ten, his dishes will consist of the secret ingredient plus some blended sauce made of tomatillos and habaneros.  but, i have also watched his throwdown show, and people seem to like his food.  and the guy looks like he can grill up some mean meat.  so i was excited to try his restaurant.         \n\non to the review:\n\nmy friend made the reservation for six people and they took her credit card down because if you're late or miss the reservation, they will charge you $50 per person!  needless to say, we were on time.\n\nbread basket:  the free bread basket they bring you at the start of the meal was really good.  it is an assortment of muffins, coffee cake, and breads.  i must say that the jalapeno cheddar bread was damn good.     \n\nappetizers:  the rough cut tuna nachos were good, but small portions.  7 tiny chips to be exact.  i know because after each of us only took one chip, there was only one left on the plate.  the fish was fresh and tasty, but the sauce may have been a little bit too sweet for me.  the bacon and <mark>Crispy Bacon  Hash Brown Quesadilla</mark> was nothing special.\n\nentrees:  i though bobby flay, have to get a meat dish, right?  so my friend and i both ordered the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark>.  i wouldn't order it again.  the sandwich was dry and just didn't do anything for me.  very little pork for such thick bread.  french fries were good with a nice little spice to them.  the steak tartar was good, the best entree in my opinion.  the spicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> was just weird tasting.  i did not like it all, but maybe that's just my tastes.  the egg and steak dish was bleh....steak, eggs, tortilla, salsa, sour cream, and guacamole, it wasn't baaad per se, just not great.  my other friend ordered the spicy egg dish which i did not try because i don't particularly care for goat cheese, however, the ham that came with it was pretty good, but not spectacular.  \n\ndessert:  we got the chocolate cake, which was good, but i've had way better at other places.  nothing transcendent here.  \n\neveryone in my group felt the same way about the food...disappointing.  i wouldn't return back there to eat.  our waiter was really good, and the decor is nice inside.  (but isn't the decor nice in all vegas hotel restaurants?)  i would give it 2 1/2 if we could give 1/2s.  my advice:  skip it (at least for brunch).", 
            "this place is not that unreasonably priced compared to some of the other big name restaurants in vegas, we had a brunch there and the average entree ran between 10-20 bucks. i had the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> with goat cheese, jalapeno, and chives with apricot glazed ham and buttermilk biscuit. it was some of the best <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> i've ever had. we also shared the goat cheese queso and the egg and <mark>Crispy Bacon  Hash Brown Quesadilla</mark>. yummmmmmmmm. excellent brunch spot and you really could tell bobby flay had a hand in the whole menu.", 
            "i had brunch here on a weekend (they only serve the lunch menu m-f). \n\nmaybe my experience wasn't so great because my options were limited- but overall- this place was a huge disappointment. \n\ni ordered the <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark>- nothing too special about it. \n\nwe had the goat cheese appetizer that everyone is always raving about and it was nothing more than melted goat cheese with some peppers in it which tasted average. it was so rich we only ate about 25% of it. \n\nmy husband ordered a breakfast enchilada and i ordered the bacon and <mark>Crispy Bacon  Hash Brown Quesadilla</mark> (off the appetizer side of the menu). in both items, the tortilla was too hard, undercooked, and heavy tasting. my husband's food tasted no different than normal breakfast food (just eggs and chorizo inside). mine was disgusting- too much goat cheese grilled on the top, not enough bacon inside (hardly any) and the hash brown with the tortillas didn't taste right at all (bad combination but i thought it might taste ok). \n\nmy experience has been that all of the newer places in vegas have tasted great- because they are still establishing themselves. the other places that have been around for a while no longer care to maintain themselves and have been mediocre to disappointing. the only exception to that has been nobu.\n\ni wish we would have gone to mon ami gabi or one of the high end buffets at bellagio or the wynn instead- it would have cost the same and no doubt tasted better!", 
            "i have been a fan of bobby flay since catching him on \"iron chef\" and \n\"throwdown\" but never really thought i would eat in his restaurant. my \nboyfriend really wanted to go because he said that a friend told him that the burgers were amazing. i'm not a fan of burgers but i did find items on the menu that i would enjoy. we walked in for saturday brunch and had an amazing server. she was very sweet and informative. we decided to order the salmon and tuna tartares for an appetizer. it was incredible. the flavors worked perfect together and had just a little bit of spice. \n\nfor entrees, my boyfriend ordered the buffalo burger with south-west\nfrench fries and i ordered the bacon and <mark>Crispy Bacon  Hash Brown Quesadilla</mark> that \ncame with an egg and salsa on top. he enjoyed his burger and i loved\nmy entree. i don't have any complaints. anything that combines bacon,\nhash browns, and eggs is wonderful to me. \n\ni would also recommend ordering a cactus pear margarita. i've never\nhad anything like it before. i also wanted to try the peach margarita, but\ndidn't want to spend the extra money. the restaurant is a bit on the pricey side but that's to be expected of a restaurant owned by one of \nthe food network's most popular chefs. \n\ni would def go back next time i'm in vegas.", 
            "bobby flay, you did me good. \n\ni was excited to try mesa grill and hoping to get a glimpse of bobby flay. i went with my bf, friend and her bf on a sunday for brunch. we walked in and were quickly greeted by two hostess with bright colored shirts and black suits on. the place was very colorful with one wall with a rainbow of agua de fresca jugs. we sat in the middle area, where the boys could still see the games going on on the other side of the glass wall in the sports bet area. our waiter was nice yet cocky like bobby flay, which almost rubbed me the wrong way. after a heavy night of drinking, i wasn't in the mood for any more alcohol, even though the bellini sounded good! i ordered the cactus pear ice tea ($4). the ice tea had a southern tea feel, slightly flowery. i believe it comes with some simple syrup that you could put in it, but i think it tastes better without it. \n\nbf: do you have any regular ice tea? \nwaiter: no \n=( \n\nwe were brought a basket of 4 different kinds of bread. jalapeno muffin, regular corn bread, jalapeno scone and coffee cake. the jalapeno muffin was a perfectly buttery, light, and flakey and had tiny bright green flakes of jalapenos so it had a kick of heat, but not too hot where it burned your mouth. the regular corn bread had specks of red and green chile flakes, and perfectly baked where it was still moist. the scone had a hint of sweet taste with some dried raisins and cranberries. the coffee cake wasn't too sweet, where you really needed to drink it with coffee. \n\nas per suggestion by the waiter, we ordered the appetizer crispy bacon + <mark>Crispy Bacon  Hash Brown Quesadilla</mark> with fried egg and spicy tomato salsa. this was so good. the tortilla tasted homemade, where it was light and fluffy and not chewy. the bacon gave it the saltyness and the hashbrown a slight crisp. all together with the fried egg and salsa on top... yum \n\n\nthe waiter suggested the <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> with spicy black bean sauce and roasted jalapeno crema as the perfect dish to display bobby flays style of balancing sweet and savory so i wanted to get it. i was instructed to make sure to eat the salmon with the white sauce. the salmon was perfectly cooked where it was flaky and just fell apart while still being moist. the sauces were so bright and the colors were vibrant. it had a nice fresh salsa on top. all together it was nice. i had expected a bit more of fire in bobby flays dish, but it was just enough that you could appreciate all the flavors. \n\n<mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> (green onion, jalapeno, goat cheese) apricot-mustard glazed ham+ buttermilk biscuits. wow! you'd think \"what, its just <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark>\" but the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> were delicious! i swear i love goat cheese. it was creamy and salty and hearty. the ham was sweet and salty and makes your mouth water. the biscuits were a bit spicy like it had a bunch of black pepper in it and buttery at the same time. great dish! \n\nyou could get a side of creamy grits or homestyle fries with the egg dishes. wow these grits were so freakin good. i think they had goat cheese in them as well. so creamy and tasty. \n\nmy friend and her bf both got the scrambled egg enchilada. they said it was good. \n\noverall i was very pleased with mesa grill. his dishes werent as spicy as i had expected, as hes always bringing in the heat, but everything had a nice balance of heat that you could still taste the flavors of the dishes. yeah bobby!", 
            "i still think chef bobby flay is a total d bag but his food is so damn good!  \n\nafter a long flight into vegas our first stop was to go to the mesa grill for lunch.  this was our first meal of the day and we were starving.  we had a short wait of about 15 minutes but had a drink while we waited.  our server greeted right away and his assistant brought us water and assortment of bread.  first of all the bread was really good.  there was a combination of mini bite size jalapeno cheese biscuit, blue corn and yellow corn bread (the best corn bread i've ever had) and two fruit type of pastry bars.  \n\nfor the appetizers we had the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> and a <mark>Crispy Bacon  Hash Brown Quesadilla</mark> topped with a over easy egg.  both were outstanding.  my wife had the chillaquilles and i had the burger.  both entrees were delicious and so flavorful.  \n\nservice was on par and the atmosphere was great.  highly recommend checking out mesa grill!", 
            ":o)!!!!\n\nbobby flay.... you son of a bitch...... here i am, thinking that you're some asshole that's famous based on your looks and cockiness.  boy was i wrong.  you made me eat my words and boy were those words delicious!\n\nladies and gentleman.... this man knows how to cook!  i walked in here thinking that it was all hype, but the four of us were highly impressed with all our dishes and bread basket.\n\nthe food:\nbread basket - there was a good mixture of sweet and savory breads.  i should have taken notes but some of the stand outs were the coffee cake, corn bread, and what we named the jalapeno cheese \"popper\", so basically all the breads they were offering.\n\ncrispy bacon + <mark>Crispy Bacon  Hash Brown Quesadilla</mark> (fried egg + spicy tomato salsa) - the cheese was nice and melty with the perfect crunch of bacon to go along with each bite.\n\nspicy chicken + <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> (poached eggs + green chile hollandaise) - i just about died tasting this dish.  the sweet potato was a nice twist that was added to a normally savory eggs benedict dish.  every bite i stole from my friend just made me melt with happiness.  so do yourself a favor and succumb to the understanding that this dish is highly recommended for a reason.\n\n<mark>Blue Corn Buttermilk Waffle</mark> (blackberry bourbon syrup + vanilla creme fraiche) - ohhhh my gosh!!!!!!  i love waffles, but my god... i love these waffles.  the vanilla creme......*drool*.... just about slapped me across the face.  one bite of this waffle made me bow down in shame and made me realize that bobby flay is the shit!  \n\n\nmark my words, i will be back to try out the dinner service and hopefully that meal will be amazing and leave the same lasting impression, if not, better one than my spectacular brunch.", 
            "mesa grill gets 3.5 stars in my book.\n\n3 of us came here for brunch on a saturday around 12pm and was told that there'd be a 10 minute wait.  i said to my friend -- there's a table right there, why do we have to wait? 10 minutes later, lo and behold -- which table do they give us? the one that has been empty this whole time.  maybe they just wanted to make it seem crowded with their lounge full of people waiting for a table.\n\nservice:\nservice was slow but decent.  it took a long time to get water refills but we did get everything that we asked for.  the 3 of us drank a ton of mimosas and quickly got really rowdy.  the server didn't seem to mind.\n\nfood:\n<mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>:\nwe shared the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> and it was the best thing that i ate at mesa grill.  the sauce was spot on, spicy and tangy and the prawns were cooked to perfection.  i believe the dish came with 4 prawns.\n\ncrispy bacon + <mark>Crispy Bacon  Hash Brown Quesadilla</mark>\ni wish i would have enjoyed this dish as it sounded super appetizing on the menu.  however, it was just ok in my opinion.  the bacon really wasn't crispy and the quesadilla was on the dry side.\n\n<mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark>\nthe eggs in this dish were prepared well.  it was decent, but nothing to write home about.\n\ngrits\nsurprisingly, the grits was one of the most flavorful items that came to the table.  we joked that we don't even know why we ordered grits but in the end we enjoyed it.\n\ni probably won't be returning to mesa grill since there are plenty of restaurants in vegas.  however, i would recommend it to someone who was looking for tex-mex with signature flavors that tends to be on the spicy-tangy side.  lunch was expensive but i think the prices are fair when compared to hotel cafes.\n\np.s. they have a delicious chocolate tequila on their dessert menu!", 
            "my awesome friend took me here for my birthday brunch...i absolutely enjoyed the company of my friend, but the food left a bad taste in my mouth.\n\n-crispy bacon and <mark>Crispy Bacon  Hash Brown Quesadilla</mark>-it tasted burnt so i scraped a thick layer of cheese off my quesadilla and there was the reason why..so black.  i asked the waiter if this is how the quesadilla suppose to look like and he replied \"yes...it comes out toasty.\"  i asked, \"by toasty you mean burnt?  seriously?\"  his answer was \"yes.\"  i should have send that pile of charcoal back to the kitchen.  \n-tiger shrimp & <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>-i was looking forward to this dish.  however, major disappointment.   the tamale was dry and not much of it either.  flavor was just not there for me. \n-spicy chicken & <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>: this came with your choice of creamy grits or <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark>.  i was super excited to get a taste of home with the creamy grits.  it came out and i was like what the f is this cream of wheat looking bowl???  eek...i do not like it whatsover.  the spicy chicken & sweet potato was different but was decent to consume.\n\nservice may be good, but the server that attended us that day is one lazy person.  shame shame.",

            "stopped by at the bar for a quick bite before gambling, mesa didn't disappoint again (i had been there a few years ago when last in town).  \n\nservice was very quick, my wife and i had the cactus margarita to begin, was yummy.  we then had this brunch <mark>Crispy Bacon  Hash Brown Quesadilla</mark> that came quickly with a fried egg on top.  it was sooooo good.    we finished by splitting a burger that came with really good seasoned fries.   you could tell they were double fried because they were so crispy and good.",

            "oh vegas, you did me dirty.\n\nbut not you, mesa grill!  i have a little unrequited love crush on bobby flay, so i dragged my hungover group over to mesa grill so i could finally see what his food was all about. definitely worth the trek in the heat.\n\ni ordered the <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark>-- i wouldn't say this was worth it.  i thought it was going to be an extra special, spectacular <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark>.  to be honest, while it was quite refreshing, it tasted like a normal <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark> to me, aka, not worth $4. \n\nthe starting bread basket was excellent! i enjoyed all the different breads-- it ranged from jalapeno corn bread, to a sweet dessert bread.  munching on this made me almost too full to eat my main dish, the spicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>.\n\nthis dish was so rich!  i could only have one piece (it comes with two) but i enjoyed the spiciness paired with the sweetness of the <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>.  i only wish the outside was crunchier-- i think that would've added to the texture and made the dish perfect.  i'm not sure i would get this next time, just because it was quite rich and maybe a little heavy. \n\ni want that bread now. sigh.",

            "i love watching food network and always enjoy bobby flay's shows.  but the food reviews here are so mixed, i was a bit hesitating to spend my money even for lunch at mesa grill in vegas.  my sister and i were too tired to find a better place, we decided to try our first bobby flay food.\n\nwe were there for sunday brunch around noon after christmas and we're seated right away.  our server was not bad but for some reason he had this weird energy and we didn't feel completely relaxed around him.  \n\nwe wanted to have their fruit juice but we're told they were all out.  all three juices (orange, grapefruit and carrot/orange)!  that surprised me because as a restaurant by a very well known chef at this very popular hotel, i would expect them to have a decent inventory skill.  we're very disappointed and ordered <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark> instead.  it wasn't bad but nothing special about it. \n\nthe warm bread basket had three different baked goodies.  the first one on top was almost like a soft chewy cookie with raisins and nuts.  i don't think it goes with any of their main dishes but as itself, it was very yummy and i wished i had that one after my lunch as a dessert.  i can't describe the second mini soft pretzel-ish thingy but i can say they were good.  and the bottom in the basket was a cornbread which was made with half yellow and half blue corn and had some corn, bell peppers and some chili pepper slices in it.  it was delicious.  our waiter just dropped the basket off on our table but at the end of our brunch, i saw a different waiter at other table was explaining what they were to his guests.  the ladies at our next table were chatting pretty loud so i couldn't hear a thing but wished our waiter did the same for us. \n\ni ordered their <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> and my sister ordered the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark>.  my salmon was very thick but cooked perfectly and was very moist.  the honey glaze and the black bean sauce were delicious and my sister loved her sandwich too.  i had a bite and the pork was very tender and although we both agreed the fries which came with the sandwich were little salty side, but still tasty.  was it cheap?  no, but whew, we didn't think we've wasted our money...\n\ni don't think we can afford their dinner anytime soon after spending too much money in vegas this time but we were very pleased with their brunch.", 
            "me and the hubs were hungover and starving, but pushed thru that cuz its the vegas son!!. ha ha. reservations are horrendous. we sat at the bar after the waitress informed us they will serve the full menu at the bar. awesome!! two seats later were at the bar immediately waited on with a smile i might add. the <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark> is premium. love that. the bread is deli-sh!! jalapeno cheddar omg. we had the sweet potato soup and the shrimp and <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>. yummers. we split the green chile chapinno. very good needed lemon and was a little on the salty side. drinks are expensive but we ordered premium te-killya and they have a heavy hand so it all works out. the portions are large enough and i would go back to try other items on the menu. overall i would say the service is premium. def. a must try when you do the vagas. holllaaaa.", 
            "2nd time here and it was even better then the first. \nstarted with the goat cheese queso fundito which is always amazing and was treated to their amazing bread basket. blue corn muffins and jalapeno corn bread are both delicious. \ntheir roasted corn soup was truly decadent. liquid corn bread.\nentree was the cornmeal chile relleno which i had last time and this was even better (the only vegetarian entree) stuffed with roasted eggplant and manchego cheese on top of a delicious red pepper sauce. \nfinished with the pear buttermilk upside down cake that tasted like christmas, and the deep dish banana cream pie which is exactly as it sounds. both perfect desserts. \noh and about 5 glasses of their <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark>.", 
            "let me preface this review by saying i have been waiting to try this place out for awhile. i'm already a fan of bobby flay who seems to be on everything on food network nowadays. the stars and reviews built up my excitement...and then i heard from friends of friends that it sucked. i was a little scared that it really would suck and i'd curse bobby flay with every ounce of my being (like when i tried to come here on my last trip and they closed early to redo the floors).\n\nbetter half and i arrived here for brunch over memorial day weekend. we had our reservations about how much i'd like the place seeing as how i die if i lick a hot cheeto. lots of things say spicy this...spicy that..spicy everything. in my head, i tell myself to toughen up and just try it...then i wimped out and went with a <mark>Blue Corn Buttermilk Waffle</mark>. i ordered a <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark> along with it since i was a bit curious. boyfriend ordered <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> sans goat cheese. the waiter gave him a bit of grief over it..saying he would check with the chef if that was allowed..asking if he didn't like it or if he was allergic...yada yada. \n\nour plates came out and the waffle is the size of my face. actually, bigger. it comes with vanilla creme fraiche and blackberry bourbon syrup. i'm not a fan of blackberries but this was divine! all the flavors melded together wonderfully. it wasn't overly sweet and the waffle had a distinct flavor. i tried (and failed) to finish the whole thing but only ate 3/4s of it. they prepared the eggs to bf's liking, without cheese, and he said it was delicious! i looked over at his plate and it was quite green from the onions and pleeenty of jalapeno. i didn't even attempt a bite. the tea was quite refreshing. it had a light flavor that contrasts how bitter tea can get. no need for sweetener here.\n\noverall a pleasant experience. it didn't disappoint and i don't have to curse bobby flay every time i see him on food network. a nice change for brunch with its southwestern flare. it was definitely worth the wait!", 
            "we went here for lunch with my daughter and my 10 year old  grandson. my daughter is a huge fan of bobby flay and really wanted to eat here while vacationing in las vegas.  okay, so we get there and are greeted with friendly staff and were seated right away.  looking over the menu we realize it's not exactly kid-friendly. (our mistake for not checking ahead of time). i also notice it's a bit priciey but we are on a budget so we forgo the appetizers..she and i both order lunch on the lower end of the menu. i order the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> and she ordered the new mexican sp<mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark> sandwich.  trying to decide what to order for her son, the waiter suggested a sirloin steak that was not on the menu.  so we order the sirloin.  (my daughter does ask how much it was but i guess he didn't hear her and she didn't repeat herself. ) my daughter also wanted one of bobby flay's signed cookbooks so we added that to our order.  i get the check and almost fall out of my chair!  the steak for my 10 year old grandson was about $48.00 and no, bobby flay didn't cook it himself.  (i would pay extra for that and eat it myself) \n\nok, so i pay the bill and ditch the book. i was upset that the waiter didn't mention that the steak was as much as it was.  he knew it was for a kid! i took it out on his tip.  i really think he should have said something.  \n\nfood was good, actually, food was fantastic but soooo not happy with waiter.", 
            "bob flay's food is so good its worth leaving your husband ari gold for!\n\ni had the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, salmon, and <mark>Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad</mark> and <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark>! all excellent!", 
            "bobby flay really knows how to do some great stuff with corn!  no sooner had we landed in the firey furnace of hell (aka vegas) then we dashed into caesar's and were promptly seated at a spacious table at the mesa grill.  the complimentary bread basket is like your own private bakery chock full of muffins and rolls and bread sticks and bread...made of different textures and colors of corn and whole grains. i loved the blue corn muffins so much that i ate my husband's and my brothers-in-law's and was tempted to creep my fingers over to the next table and swipe theirs too!\n\nmy husband ordered <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark> which arrived with a tiny glass decanter of simple syrup with which to sweeten it--but don't think they limited your selection to the simple syrup---they also offered all sorts of natural sugars and artificial sweeteners!  i go to nice places on occasion but i can't think of the last time i was so impressed with small details!   i felt like some kind of hillbilly!\n\ni ordered the fresh fish of the day which was tasty although i don't really remember it as much as the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> my husband ordered.  i can hardly wait to go back to vegas to have another one of those for myself!  one of my brothers-in-law ordered the <mark>Blue Corn Buttermilk Waffle</mark> with blackberry bourbon syrup and vanilla creme fraiche.  i have to say that it was delicious, but it was fourteen dollars, and compared to the other entrees we had at our table with meat and fresh seafood was comparatively priced--therefore overpriced.  i mean a waffle.  for fourteen bucks.  my other brother-in-law ordered the chilaquiles.  which were also very flavorful and complex.  \n\ni had never had blue corn before so i bought some bob's red mill blue cornmeal on amazon and have begun to experiment.  not quite ready for a bobby flay throwdown, however.", 
            "\"f***ing bobby flay!\" so says ari gold from the last season of entourage. yup, why's the grill master have to have food so good that i keep coming back every time i'm in town? i didn't realize till recently that after all these visits to mesa, i've never written a review. \n\nhere are some brunch items i've tried:\nany of the quesadillas they have on the menu. i had the crispy bacon and <mark>Crispy Bacon  Hash Brown Quesadilla</mark>. \nspicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> - good portions and a nice southwest twist on the regular corned beef hash.\n<mark>Mesa Burger</mark> - a sign of a good burger for me is one that needs no condiments, is juicy, and has a soft bun. this burger has it.\ni'm a sucker for pastries so their brunch bread basket is sooo delicious. the mini fresh scones were the best!\nthe <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark> was really refreshing as well and not too sweet.\nbased on my last waiter's suggestion, i'll have to try the steak and eggs next time.\n\nhere are my thoughts on dinner items i've tried:\ncremini mushroom quesadilla - i order this every time!\n<mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> - heard great things about it but was only ok.\nnew mexican spiced rubbed pork tenderloin - a very solid choice with just the right amount of heat. pork is very tender.\nfire roasted veal chop - this is my fav!\ni still need to try the bone-in ribeye at some point.\n\nyou can ask for a side of their special chipolte sauce. it's great for dipping with the quesadillas or even your fries. i finish my dinner off usually with the deep dish banana cream pie. never disappoints and guarantees that i end my dinner on a high note.\n\nstaff and service are always top notch. there's a side room that can be reserved for larger parties. beverages are constantly refilled. margaritas are tasty, but a bit on the pricier side. food is always solid. portions are just right. price is not unreasonable. i'm always satisfied.\n\nreservations are recommended.", 
            "review is for spring 2012 restaurant week dinner:\n\ni've been waiting awhile to try bobby flay's mesa grill and restaurant week seemed like the time to do it.  the appetizer and main course are on the regular menu.  dessert is not listed on their website menu so this was a good sampler of the real thing at mesa grill.\n\non being seated, i was given the regular menu, a wine and cocktail menu, and the restaurant week menu.  my server, rodil, was great with ordering and everything thereafter.  i ordered an <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark> and it was brought quickly followed by bread basket with a nice selection--two slices of jalape\\u00f1o bread with a nice kick, a corn muffin, and two slices of raisin bread.  accompanying the bread was softened butter.  i also tried the corn muffin.  it was good but a little dry.  the best thing about the muffin was the number of corn bits baked into it.  still the jalape\\u00f1o bread was my favorite.\n\nfor the first course, i ordered the blue corn pancake.  it was filled with duck and had a habanero chile-star anise sauce.  rodil had alerted me that this wasn't spicy, but for a starter, i didn't care.\n\nthe second course was flay's signature dish, new mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin with a bourbon-ancho chile sauce and a sweet potato tamal which had a round of crushed pecan butter placed into the sweet potato/corn mixture to add liquid.  the pork was tender and cooked perfectly.  the spices rubbed on the pork gave it some great flavor and zing, and the ancho chile sauce was excellent--dark, rich, and very flavorful.  rodil noticed that i was almost snorting the sauce and he asked if i wanted more, the pusher.  he brought a small round dish with extra ancho sauce.  i dipped my tenderloin in the sauce with abandon and joy!  the tamal was superb.  what an interesting twist on the common tamal.\n\nmy choice for dessert was chocolate bread pudding with toasted bourbon marshmallow squares and graham cracker crisps on top.  the chocolate was semi-sweet and this was a fine ending to the meal.  it wasn't as sweet as most desserts and it complimented the flavors from the pork.\n\ni had the best seat in the house in my mind.  i was near the back of the restaurant seated along a railing where i could watch the chefs do their work.  i had a good view of the grill where the steaks were cooked, and i could see into the salad/dessert preparation area.  right near me was the staging area where two people oversaw the distribution of food.  when an order came in, they each got a copy and they both checked to see things were correct.  the person working on the outside nearest me wiped the dishes to remove any stray food so presentation was perfect.\n\ni enjoyed the meal.  i was not hurried but things moved along at a good pace.  all the staff was efficient and pleasant.  this was a great meal to kick off the spring 2012 restaurant week and i will be back!", 
            "the food was excellent. but the wait staff could use a brush up on service skills. our waiter forgot my <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark> and i had to ask another server for it. he was more than happy to get it but our waiter was no where to be found. green chili burger and swordfish club were excellent.", 
            "my buddy and i were looking for lunch and chose mesa over gordon ramsey burger. we were not disappointed. the service was great. all servers answered all of our questions and catered to our requests (ie. sauce on the side) with a smile. both the agave margarita and the ice tea were great. being from texas i expected a bigger margarita, but it was very good. the <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark> is very good texans.\n     free bread basket 2 different breads and a blue corn muffin. that was an unexpected bonus.\n     for entrees we ordered a <mark>Green Chile Cheeseburger</mark> and a regular burger, both with fries. perfect medium, great buns, well seasoned, juicy. these burgers were big enough that no dessert was needed.\n     if you are looking to try out an \"iron chef's\" restaurant, at a good price, you cant go wrong here @ lunch.", 
            "i don't even know where to begin with this place. it's just amazing. the food and the service -- just great! if you want to do good food without gorging yourself at a vegas buffet, consider going to mesa grill.\n\nyou start with a \"bread\" basket that consists of muffins, corn bread, scones, and various baked goodies. they'll even give you another basket if you ask!\n\nnext come the entre\\u00e9s. and wow, are they deceivingly small. my girlfriend and i ordered from the brunch menu. she got the scrambled egg chilaquiles and i got the spicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>. both dishes looked small, but man when we finished them we had to be rolled out of the restaurant! i liked the chilaquiles over the chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>. the texture of the chilaquiles was unlike the traditional mexican version that allows some of the chips to soften as it sits in the serving dish. this version was built on large tortilla chips/tostadas with layers of cheese, sauce, and eggs. it had a wonderful crunch that complimented the soft cheese, egg and sauce.\n\nalso, i highly recommend the cactus-<mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark>. delicious!!", 
            "not a bad brunch. the <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark> was tasty and quite refreshing. the goat cheese queso fundido was amazing! my wife can't take a lot of spice, so we got the blistered serrano vinaigrette on the side, which proved to be a wise call, though it was tasty. \n\nthe main dishes just weren't quite as successful, though. my wife got the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> chilaqules which were supposed to have a tomatillo sauce. i make my own tomatillo sauce all the time, and this wasn't one. it was made from hatch chilies or something similar. she didn't really enjoy it. \n\ni got the <mark>Green Chile Cheeseburger</mark> and wasn't terribly impressed. it was just too heavy and was in desperate need of acid or something to brighten it up. the fries, however, were delicious and well seasoned. \n\ni'm sure some other main dishes might be more successful, but the apps, teas, and fries were world class.", 
            "my husband practically runs to get here. \nthe bread basket is free and filled with jalape\\u00f1o poppers, blue corn muffin, chocolate chip scone, and chocolate bites...each time just a little different, depending on the time of year - last time a to-die-for cranberry bar! \nwe started with <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark> ($4.00), and coffee ($4.00) brought promptly out. always love that. \ni had the seasonal soup, a bit pricey at $13.00 but oh so tasty - this time it was sweet potato with a touch of peanuts on the side. then <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark> - romaine (not my favorite kind of lettuce - i prefer kale), black olives, a few bites of cheese, and tomatoes ($13.00). my husband had the chiliquiles ($16) eggs, tortilla, jalape\\u00f1o and cheese. spicy but not not enough to make you sweat. \nthey will bring you more bread, of any kind if you ask ...don't files up because his food is so tasty...i never make it to dessert! next time!!!", 
            "i went as a party of 3 for lunch. they did not allow hats in the dining area but they are allowed at the small bar. highly recommend the roasted corn soup for an appetizer.  it was amazingly delicious and what you come to expect from bobby flay with his spicy flair. just the right amount of heat, zest, and lightness.  \n\nfor an entr\\u00e9e,  i chose the \"new mexican sp<mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark> sandwich\". this was sadly underwhelming.  thin slices of pork and not crazy pork flavor.\n\ndessert, we shared a nice big piece of a coconut cake. i'm not a big coconut type of person but this dessert was amazing. great deep and rich flavors.", 
            "i didn't think i would enjoy this restaurant (i'm not a big bobby flay's fan), but i was surprised by the food.  it was quite good and the price was reasonable for lunch.  the bread basket was good, and i would recommend getting the <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark> (unlimited refill).", 
            "omg this had to be one of the best meals we had while visiting vegas! every thing was exceptional from beginning to start... for our lunch we ordered pretty much everything on the menu... standouts would have to be the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> and the pan roasted shrimp with the rice! it was sublime... also the french fries that came with the burger were awesome! perfectly fried and crispy... i'm forgetting about the queso fundido! it has goat cheese so it deterred the table a bit but i read it was a must so we did and it was super delicious! to drink everyone has a cactus pear margarita which was my favorite from last time and i had a <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark>... which was good and i like the fact they give you a simple syrup type thing as a sweetener... just look at my pictures... they speak 1000 words right?! with all the many different restaurants it's easy to miss but you shouldn't!!", 
            "one of the best places i have ever been to for upscale food.\ni am a big fan of bobby flay.   i have been dying to get to vegas to check out\nmesa grill.  it took us three nights to get there due to being in vegas for new years, but i digress.\nthe ambiance is stunning.  the chef location is like  the command center of great ship.  right in the middle for everyone to bear witness to.  the chefs cooking are like a well oiled machine, all the bf rubs are all right there, the food is cooked in unison.  \n\nthe waiter were all very pleasant and super helpful with our little ones too. \nthey were on top of everything. clearing the table when plates were empty, and adding water to the cups when they were still half full.\n\nthe pre-food.  they brought out a few different kinds of bread and muffins.  the jalapeno bread was delicious, the raisin and walnut was magnificent and the muffins were all soft and buttery.\n \ni had the <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark> which was super delicious!\n\nmy wife had the veal which melted off the bone and was so succulent my mouth is still watering for it.\n\nthis is the funny part, i was never a fan of beef or meats. however,  i ordered the new york strip steak.  cooked to perfection, the dry rub was superb and the small amount of sauce that came with it, i savored every little bit.  \n\nthe desert as a chocolate cake plated with some ice cream drizzled with chocolate sauce and rice crispies..\n\nthe cost is out there but every once in a while it's good to splurge on something this good.\n\nthanks bobby!",

            "i needed to visit mesa grill again after eating dinner here last year. this time i brought my girlfriend and we decided to try mesa grill for brunch. wow! the food, service and selections were great. there are about 6 brunch appetizers and 12-15 entrees available with a couple menu items not on the menu that the server will tell you about. \n\nwe ordered the cactus infused <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark> to drink (non-alcoholic). i ordered the spicy chicken with <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> and southwest potatoes. this dish is spicy but not overly spicy and has a great hollandaise sauce made with green chiles over poached eggs! 10/10 \n\nmy girlfriend ordered the <mark>Blue Corn Buttermilk Waffle</mark> with creme fraiche and blackberry sauce. she also ordered a side of their <mark>Spicy Mango - Glazed Bacon</mark>. she loved both of these and i had to try them as well :) the waffle was light, crisp and sweet and the bacon was crispy and thick. 10/10 \n\nmy dish was $18, the waffle was $14 and side of bacon was $5. the meal was about $48 with the drinks and tax not including tip. another great dining experience at mesa grill - great job mr. flay, your restaurant did not disappoint. i'm a huge fan of bobby's cooking style and find him to be a great food personality. try this restaurant for great service and top quality food at caesars.", 
            "hands down one of the best places to eat on the strip!! i little pricey than your typical buffet options on the strip. however the flavor are amazing the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> was my favorite along with the <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark>.", 
            "this place is a family favorite for us, especially for brunch! we have tried pretty much everything on the menu with few disappointments. prices are very reasonable for being on the strip. <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark> is a must; i probably go through a whole pitcher :p \nfor shared appetizer we like the rough cut tuna nachos (basically a poke), queso fundido, and for something different the <mark>Smoked Salmon Quesadilla</mark>.  bread basket is a treat with both sweet and savory muffins, scones, biscuits, and bread. for entrees we usually stick to hot dishes - <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>, chilequiles, salmon. grits and the bacon are favorite sides. i'd say skip the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> (cold deli style), and the salads unless that's what you are in the mood for. steak and eggs is a make your own taco dish which is huge, more than enough for one person. salmon is another great treat! also note that you can only get the churros at dinner time for dessert."

            "i had brunch here with 7 other friends. the order was as follows (best to worst, 1-6): \n\nbread assortment (complimentary)\nthere were about four different kinds. a couple of them were a little spicy with jalapeno, very good overall. \n\n(3) queso fundido $12\na light goat cheese fondue with bits of peppers served with blue tortilla chips. i've had this one before at the nyc location and it's consistently good.\n\n(1) spicy chicken + <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> $18\ngreat breakfast dish. it came with with poached eggs and a green chile hollandaise sauce.\n\n(1) <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> chiliquiles with roasted tomatillo sauce\nwhite cheddar cheese + creme fraiche $14\nanother great dish. it came with one of the same sauces as the chicken dish, but it was a solid sauce.\ni had no clue what chiliquiles were, so here's the wikipedia for your reference:\n\nchilaquiles is a traditional mexican dish consisting of fried or dried tortilla chips, bathed in green or red salsa or mole and broiled or grilled with a cheese topping. sometimes chicken strips are mixed into the sauce, or the dish can be served with a fried egg on top or a strip of meat alongside.\n\nthey are most commonly eaten at breakfast time, served alongside with fried or <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> or a mexican style grilled beef. moreover, chilaquiles are often lauded as a cure for the common hangover.\n\nunlike nachos, which are served as a crispy snack, chilaquiles are a main dish and are not served until the tortilla chips are thoroughly soaked and softened by the salsa. this makes them a popular recipe for stale chips or those with a bad taste as the other flavors mask the chips'.\n\n(5) <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> $16\nthe most memorable part of this dish was the price. the fries were pretty good; crispy outside, seasoned well. but, nothing special about the burger.\n\n(6) <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> with grilled red onion, arugula, and\nancho-chile mayonnaise $15\ni thought this was the worst of the dishes. the beef was tender, but it lacked flavor, was too thin, was initially served cold and the bread was too thick for the sandwich. the waiter said the previous bakery burned down and they were testing new bread. the ancho mayo was good, but the flavor was overpowered by the 2 lbs. of bread.\n\n(4) grilled mahi mahi with roasted pineapple-cascabel chile sauce and caramelized pineapple-green onion salsa $24\ni was hung over, which is the only way i could why i order this dish. the sauce was good and the fish seemed to be lightly scented with honey. the texture was a little dry. overall, not worth $24. the waiter said it was the best thing on the menu, maybe he meant the priciest thing on the menu.\n\nmy friend got a <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark>. i'm not a fan of tomato juice or blood for that matter, but it looked of pretty good quality. \n\nservice\nvery slow. starting with the water, to the other drinks, to the bread, to the starter, and ending with the entrees. they were consistent with it, at least. and still kind of pissed that he recommended the mahi mahi.\n\nso, what did we learn? for brunch, stick to the br and stray from the unch. based on my experience in nyc, you may want to try dinner also and stick to red meat.", 
            "i am from texas, and living in so cal, so i can definitely appreciate good southwestern cooking.  i can appreciate bobby flay's style and influences.\n\nwent for brunch on a saturday morning.  started out the right way with a <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark> which was really good, although i would have preferred a touch less, just a touch less horseradish.  next time i'll probably get a \"rita\" although i wouldn't mind if i had another <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark>.  took a few minutes to get seated but we didn't have reservations so can't complain too much.\n\ni had the ranch style eggs on a tostada and ancho chile sauce....really delicious.  i was going to get the spicy chicken with <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>, but i wanted something more simple.  it was a much larger portion that i had planned and i almost didn't finish, but i couldn't leave any on my plate, that would have been wrong and not in the true \"food cripple\" style.  maybe i wouldn't have been so stuffed if i hadn't been devouring the treats in the bread basket.  i won't reiterate what was said by lindley k., except for...damn that stuff was good.  read that post about the bread.\n\nmy girlfriend had the crab cakes for an entree and was very content.  sat near the kitchen and could see what the cooks were placing up in the window, and yes, the burger looked really good.  might have to try that next time.  \n\nthe waiter was attentive, courteous, and knowledgeable.  \n\nif staying at caesar's, you need to eat here, and you need to consider it if you are staying somewhere else.", 
            "bobby flay is da man!  i love his shows and his food. \n\nthis was my second time at mesa grill for brunch and with his southwestern flare you can't go wrong.  almost everything has a little spice to it. my favorite dishes were the spicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> with poached eggs and green chile hollandaise and the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> with green onion, jalapeno, goat cheese apricot -mustard glazed ham and buttermilk biscuits. \n\nthe drinks are great too definitely try the <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark> and the fresh squeezed juices. \n\nhaving reservations really helped since we got seated right away and there was a pretty long wait. \n\ni haven't tried dinner here; i have heard dinner is just so-so. besides there are too many restaurants in this city i want to try!", 
            "after eating at bobby flay's mesa grill in ceasar's palace, i'm pretty sure i would allow flay to \"throwdown\" on me anytime he wants. his food a seriously sexy and  unforgettable \"explosion\" of flavors in my mouth again and again. woowee! it's getting hot in here, and it's not just because of his masterful use of spices. but let's move onto the food.\n\ni went to vegas this past weekend, and was excited to find that the people i went to didn't want to just go to the plethora of buffets that vegas has to offer. instead, our group ventured into the culinary adventures that vegas had to offer, and our first stop was mesa grill.\n\nthree things about me:\n1) i love spicy foods\n2) i typically do not like <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark>'s (in fact, i detest them)\n3) i never get red meat past medium. (pink is where its at)\n\nwe ordered our drinks first, i ordered the margarita (which was just ok, but when i asked for extra tequila, the server hooked a sister up!) my other fellow food goers both ordered <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark>. i tried a sip, and i swear i was in spicy tomato heaven. it was the best <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark> i've ever had, and i actually regretted not ordering one for myself. score 1 for bobby flay!\n\nnext, our server set down a bounty of delicious baked goods. (good thing because we were starving) now usually, the bread is usually just ok and filler food til the meal comes. the basket alone could have made up a meal, and i would have been perfectly content. (just goes to show you how serious they take food) the assortment came with jalepeno corn muffins and biscuits, cranberry scones, blueberry coffee cake, and the best part was that they gave us three of each because there were three of us! now that's dedication!\n\nnext, the three of us ordered the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark>, scrambled egg enchilada, and the spicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> with poached eggs. \n\nmy burger came with fries dusted with a southwestern seasoning (ancho chili powder, and probably some cayenne). the fries were delectably spicy and the burger was cooked medium (with the perfect pink center) score 2 more points for flay.  the burger was huge accompanied by tasty grilled onions, swiss cheese, and a side of horseradish mustard. i could have stopped here, and flay would have exceeded my expectations, but he was definitely not through with me yet. \n\nnext the scrambled egg enchiladas. <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> with chorizo and goat cheese rolled in tortillas, and assembled on top of three different sauces. the great thing i loved about this was that it was not drenched with sauce like your typical enchilada. instead, there were three intricate sauces (all sure to stimulate your taste buds), that went well with the delicate eggs. scrumptious!\n\ni was perfectly satisfied, but flay insisted \"to keep on going\" and make the experience \"last a little longer.\"  i had to try the spicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>. i was unsure about the dish- thought the sweet potatoes might have been overkill. however, i took a bite, and i was in food heaven. it was everything you want in a meal. well balanced flavors, perfectly seasoned, and not too heavy.  i was so full, but i couldn't stop eating. i wanted more. i needed more. it was the perfect climatic end to a delicious meal. \n\nas rhett s. said, if you go to vegas and have not made it to mesa, you havent really experienced vegas at all.  i would drive 4 hours just to try it again!", 
            "i love the persona that is bobby flay, so i had high expectations going into mesa grill.\n\nthe bread basket with the variety of carbs - corn muffins, some type of raisin bread and jalapeno bread paired well with my <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark>.\n\nfor starters, we had the <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark> (named after his daughter) and the black bean soup.  the black bean soup was amazing.  it was perfectly spiced and delicious.\n\ni had the jerk chicken taquitos.  i was disappointed that they were not rolled tortillas stuffed with jamaican jerk flavored chicken and cabbage slaw.  it turned out to be a half chicken served on the side of a mini puffy tortilla topped with slaw.\n\nmy partner in food had the smoked chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> topped with poached eggs.  it was a nice mix of flavors and textures.  i wish that i had ordered that instead.\n\nthe dessert was not very memorable.  we ate there a few days ago and neither one of us can remember what we had.\n\nthe server that we had was either new or really didn't care because he didnt describe anything in detail and i felt like we were bothering him when we needed anything.\n\nif bobby had been there cooking, i'm sure that everything would have been totally better.  since he wasn't.. everything was just okay.", 
            "maybe it's because i was here for brunch and the menu selection wasn't very good.  \n\ni had the spicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> with poached eggs.  i thought it was kinda mushy and not really a \"hash\", and too sweet for my taste.  gobs of tabasco didn't help much either.  i also had some of my cousin's egg scramble tortilla thing, which was ok as well.  nothing to really rave about.  but the cheesy grits were soooooo good.  had i known how good they were, i would've gave up on my entree and just ate the whole little bowl of grits.\n\ni did like the goat cheese fondue with tortilla chips.  and my <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark> was tasty and spicy, just the way i like it.  but overall?  i expected more from a bobby flay restaurant.  maybe i'll go back to try dinner.", 
            "simply my favorite restaurant in las vegas and definitely on my top 3 list.  bobby flay is amazing!  i have been to mesa grill a handful of times; twice for brunch and three times for dinner. it's awesome everytime. you need to like favor and a lil spicy because everything is very well spiced.  here are some recommedations:\nbrunch - \n*the best thing on the brunch menu is their spicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> with poached eggs.  it's goooie!\n*<mark>Mesa Burger</mark> is tasty but nothing extraordinary\n*<mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark> are made just right with a little extra kick\n\ndinner - so many excellent choices\n*red and black pepper encrusted filet mignon cooked perfectly\n*new mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin the spiciest thing on the menu, pretty spicy but i couldn't stop eating it. yum!\n*grilled lamb porterhouse chop best lamb chops ever and so perfect with cranberry/jalapeno sauce.\n\ndessert:\nthey don't disappoint.  we had the sampler and all of it was good.\n\nso if you get a chance to go there try it, it's all worth it.", 
            "we went here with good friends last weekend. we laughed when we were sat because 5:15 was the latest we could get a table reservation until 10:00 and for a while we were the only ones. i didn't have a drink- one friend had the house margarita and didn't say anything about it, and another had a <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark> which she raved about during and after the meal. the bread basket was excellent- good variety and all very tasty. \n\nfor main courses i was the only one who didn't have a 5 star meal. husband had the chicken which was great, and came with very creamy chive mashed potatoes. one friend got the special which was short ribs which he liked a lot, and his fiance got the lamb chops. this seriously was enough meat for 4 people. a very good amount of food. \n\ni got the duck and it was probably three stars. my first few bites were quite gamey, but after that died down i realized that the spice crust on the outside of the duck was very cumin heavy. i don't like cumin, and  as the description of the dish is \"southwestern spiced duck\" i really didn't think it would be full of cumin. no one else's spice-rubbed, southwestern dishes had cumin at all. very odd.  also, the tamale which was supposed to have both goat cheese, which i love, and thyme butter, tasted like neither and was a bit dry. however, the flavor problem i had is not the restaurants fault except for description, so i can't really fault them for that. also everyone else's food was so good that i just picked something not good for me.\n\nthe service was very good- i drink at least 1-2 liters of water at a meal and they kept up! when we left at 6:15 i couldn't believe what we saw: crowded restaurant, crowded waiting area, people eating at the lounge-area with plates on their laps. it was very crazy! make sure to get a reservation early, order anything but the duck and you'll be fine!", 
            "we (4) went for friday lunch with no reservation on the weekend of super bowl and only had to wait 5 minutes for a table.\n\nterrific service from our waiter who explained the highlights of the menu without talking down to us. \n\nfrom the margaritas and mojitos to the queso to the entrees everything was delicious and very flavorful. two of us had the huge <mark>Mesa Burger</mark>, one had the shrimp tacos and  i had the chicken & <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>.  \n\nas a matter of fact, it was so good that sunday my husband and i went back for brunch.  we were up a bit early (10:30am) and there weren't many places open for brunch (which we thought was odd) but in checking around we found mesa grill was open and had a brunch menu (rather than just the usual lunch fare that many restaurants serve).\n\nwe had the bacon & hash brown quesedilla topped with a fried egg (the bacon was smokey and wonderful) and the egg sirloin tortilla which is essentially fajitas with eggs & steak (and nice spicy garnishes).  the bread bowl mix was toward sweet breads (as one would expect) and they were all delicious.  and one of the best <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark> i've ever had.  \n\ni usually think most celebrity chef restaurants are forgettable and we'd planned just to stop for a drink and maybe an appetizer..., but this one was good enough to visit twice in one weekend.  i'll definitely be back!", 
            "went here for brunch and it was amazing!\n\nservice- 6 stars!\ngoat cheese fundido- 5 stars\ncreamy grits- 11 million stars and a squeal of excellence! \n\ni don't know how the dinner is but the brunch is affordable, tasty, and cheesy.  now, who can argue with that?!\n\n***don't get the <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark>.  it's nasty (-_-) but it's okay cause i got my creamy grits to wash it down.", 
            "wow, to get a 5th star from me on a 2nd visit means it's pretty good! i can be on the picky side.  what i am trying to understand is how the casino cafes can get away with charging more than bobby flay for a burger that doesn't even come close to what you get at mesa grill.  if you look at the guides, mesa grill is listed as semi pricey - well in comparison to the mediocre food at many of the casino restaurants, this should be listed as inexpensive!  a burger costs $16 and it's worth every penny for the way the cheese is perfectly melted into the meat and the onions are caramelized to perfection.  fries are seasoned really well too.  \n\nthe <mark>Barbecued Lamb Cobb Salad</mark> was delicious and not gamey.  they know how to make a pretty good <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark> - but not as good as old ebbitt grill in dc - bobby ... go check it out and you'll see what i mean! \n\nservice is always great.  thanks for another delicious meal.", 
            "was pretty good and had some signature bobby flay heat on all the dishes. the <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark> was awesome. overall though compared to all the other lv fine dining i've experienced, i wouldn't rate this as high as other places and fell below what i expected from mr. flay. it was good but not wow.", 
            "we showed up here for a late brunch around 2pm on sunday.  \nafter a long, hard night of drinking the night before, we had some hair of the dog in the form of a <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark> & a cucumber-strawberry cocktail.  both drinks were well-loved and lightened the mood.\n\nthe service was very friendly & the food was excellent.  you must try the tiger shrimp (the tamale it comes with is divine).  the grits are possibly the best thing on the menu.  despite how pedestrian grits may sound, their texture is perfect and they are mixed with some delicious cheese.  umami!  order them.\n\none bone to pick with the place:  they don't like to make substitutions because of the way they run their kitchen.  i was able to get the poached eggs w/ green chile hollandaise a la carte, but the waiter told us that it's a rarity for them to do so.\n\ni would absolutely come back, but it might be for brunch again since it's so much cheaper than the dinner menu.", 
            "*3.5*\n\n(this review is for lunch only)\n\nso, my fiancee and i had just dined at bradley ogden the evening before; act two, enter bobby flay...\n\nno wait, we were seated right away.  nice.  our server was a chippery asian fella.  he was very informative and full of energy.  he also almost put his hand on my fiancee's shoulder when he first walked up to our table but quickly diverted said stranger hand just in the nick of time.  smart move buddy!\n\nthey brought out a little bread basket w/ some goodies.  yum.  probably the best part of the meal.  jalapeno biscuits, crumb cake, and some other pastries that got me excited about the entree's to come.\n\nfirst we had our \"grapefruit mimosas\" we ordered off the menu.  they were quite tasty but at $12.50 a pop, i should have gotten a <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark> or something.\n\ni had the burger.  i got it medium well bc our server said their \"medium\" was more on the medium rare side.  well, as i bit into the burger, parts of the patty were well done while some parts were sorta pink, i guess.  eh, it was still pretty tasty.  the pickled vidalia onion was a nice touch.  i'm a huge fan of mustard but i think i would have liked a more sweeter, tangy-er sauce to balance out the pungent, sharp cheddar on top.\n\nthe fries were ok, a little too cooked for my taste.  they had a nice cajun spice sprinkled over them that wasn't overpowering.\n\nmy fiancee had the salmon.  the description sounded better than it tasted.  i was expecting an explosion of sweet, spice, savory, etc., etc., especially from mr. flay.  but the fish, albeit fresh and cooked properly, wasn't very flavorful.  oh well.\n\nw/ tax and tip the lunch came out to a little over $80.  not sure if we'll be back.",

            "mesa has been a regular visit for awhile on our annual guys trip.  something exciting about dining at the restaurant of an iron chef. i just drool at the dishes those guys put together on the show.  my fantasy job is to be a judge on that show.  \n\nfor brunch, their spicy egg dishes are perfect, especially with a <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark> - though we will also get the <mark>Blue Corn Buttermilk Waffle</mark> to share.  for dinner, the porterhouse is a fabulous cut of meat but way too much for a mere mortal to finish.  recommend sharing the beef and trying other dishes.  \n\nwhat i enjoy is also the ambiance/vibe.  amazing what a good designer can do w/ a piece of space right next to the sports book.",

            "we had a 7:30 reservation, but they were a little backed up, so we sat in bar area and had a pre dinner cocktail. i ordered a gimme a lemonade, which was probably meant to be equal parts <mark>Marrakesh Mint Green Tea</mark> vodka and lemonade, but was mostly vodka.  nothing wrong with a strong drink, especially when shelling out 12 bucks for it, but i don't think it was worthy of being a featured cocktail. should have gone with the black widow mojito. \n\nwe were seated after 10 or 15 minutes.  there were 5 of us total, and we each ordered appetizers. the sea scallop ceviche and the blue corn pancake were standouts. the pancake was wrapped around tender bbq duck  and drizzled with a habanero-chile anise sauce. amazing.  the ceviche was so good i literally had to stop myself from slurrping it up like campbell's chicken noodle. sometimes sharing is no fun.  also noteworthy was the beet salad. \n\ni ordered the new mexican spice ruibbed pork tenderloin, with bourbon ancho chile sauce and a sweet potato tamale. it was a huge portion, cooked to a perfect medium temp.  it was delicious, but i kept pilfering from my friend's fire roasted veal chop, so i could not finish.  i also tried the 16 spice duck, which was as good as the blue corn app.  \n\nmesa offers a fairly decent wine selection. the 2006 ken wright abbot claim pinot noir  recommended the wine steward worked with every entree.  our service was very good, and the only reason i am not giving 5 stars is that i felt that the dessert menu left something to be desired.   after dinner we headed straight to payard for dessert.", 
            "i agree with most people here that mesa grill is good. our group of 6 came here for dinner and left quite happily and satisfied. \nof all our dishes though, i highly recommend the tiger shrimp blue <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> for appetizer and grilled mahi mahi. the creaminess of the tamale and the sweet/ sour/ slightly spicy pineapple sauce drizzled on the fish will definitely send you to heaven!\none disappointment was our drinks. 2 of us ordered \"gimme a lemonade\" (<mark>Marrakesh Mint Green Tea</mark> vodka + lemonade). it was very bitter and we could not taste any sour-ness of lemonade. it tasted like water down vodka. but maybe it's supposed to be this way?\ni give mesa grill 4 out of 5 because it didn't impress us with as much punch as some other places we tried in the next few days.",

            "this mesa grill does not live up to the one in ny city. i've eaten here in two occasions: dinner and brunch, and was very disappointed both times. almost all the dishes i had here were drawn with sauces, i think the sauce should enhance the dish not over powering it. the only dish i would recommend is the spicy chicken+ <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> on their brunch menu@ $16.50(with avocado, tomato, maytag blue cheese + buttermilk serrano dressing), the dish was very nicely presented and was also hearty and filling. the other good thing here is their complimentary mini blue corn breads.\n\ni sincerely feel that the chefs at this location should step up to the plate, and really refine their dishes and cooking skills, inorder to meet the standard of the one in nyc.", 
            "i had brunch here with 7 other friends. the order was as follows (best to worst, 1-6): \n\nbread assortment (complimentary)\nthere were about four different kinds. a couple of them were a little spicy with jalapeno, very good overall. \n\n(3) queso fundido $12\na light goat cheese fondue with bits of peppers served with blue tortilla chips. i've had this one before at the nyc location and it's consistently good.\n\n(1) spicy chicken + <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> $18\ngreat breakfast dish. it came with with poached eggs and a green chile hollandaise sauce.\n\n(1) <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> chiliquiles with roasted tomatillo sauce\nwhite cheddar cheese + creme fraiche $14\nanother great dish. it came with one of the same sauces as the chicken dish, but it was a solid sauce.\ni had no clue what chiliquiles were, so here's the wikipedia for your reference:\n\nchilaquiles is a traditional mexican dish consisting of fried or dried tortilla chips, bathed in green or red salsa or mole and broiled or grilled with a cheese topping. sometimes chicken strips are mixed into the sauce, or the dish can be served with a fried egg on top or a strip of meat alongside.\n\nthey are most commonly eaten at breakfast time, served alongside with fried or <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> or a mexican style grilled beef. moreover, chilaquiles are often lauded as a cure for the common hangover.\n\nunlike nachos, which are served as a crispy snack, chilaquiles are a main dish and are not served until the tortilla chips are thoroughly soaked and softened by the salsa. this makes them a popular recipe for stale chips or those with a bad taste as the other flavors mask the chips'.\n\n(5) <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> $16\nthe most memorable part of this dish was the price. the fries were pretty good; crispy outside, seasoned well. but, nothing special about the burger.\n\n(6) <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> with grilled red onion, arugula, and\nancho-chile mayonnaise $15\ni thought this was the worst of the dishes. the beef was tender, but it lacked flavor, was too thin, was initially served cold and the bread was too thick for the sandwich. the waiter said the previous bakery burned down and they were testing new bread. the ancho mayo was good, but the flavor was overpowered by the 2 lbs. of bread.\n\n(4) grilled mahi mahi with roasted pineapple-cascabel chile sauce and caramelized pineapple-green onion salsa $24\ni was hung over, which is the only way i could why i order this dish. the sauce was good and the fish seemed to be lightly scented with honey. the texture was a little dry. overall, not worth $24. the waiter said it was the best thing on the menu, maybe he meant the priciest thing on the menu.\n\nmy friend got a <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark>. i'm not a fan of tomato juice or blood for that matter, but it looked of pretty good quality. \n\nservice\nvery slow. starting with the water, to the other drinks, to the bread, to the starter, and ending with the entrees. they were consistent with it, at least. and still kind of pissed that he recommended the mahi mahi.\n\nso, what did we learn? for brunch, stick to the br and stray from the unch. based on my experience in nyc, you may want to try dinner also and stick to red meat.",

(but isn't the decor nice in all vegas hotel restaurants?)  i would give it 2 1/2 if we could give 1/2s.  my advice:  skip it (at least for brunch).", 
            "at the mesa las vegas---yummyyyyyy! \na good chunk of change.\nthe waiters were very nice and extremely informative. my goodness, as he was describing it i could feel the drool dropping from my mouth. \nwe ate lunch here with 10 people, so i got to sample a little of everyones plate\nstart off with great bread..cranberry bread? and corn bread, very unique and free! yay!\nentrees: \nspicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>-it has two poached eggs on top and itss delicious! kind of on the breakfast side and its an explosion of flavor in your mouth. little chicken chunks and sweet potatoes. great sauce, but you could only eat so much, it was really overpowering.\ngrilled mahi- mahi with pinapples - dry!!! dont reccommend \n<mark>Mesa Burger</mark> -- huge reg. burger.. try the garlic mayo\nsteak sandwhich-- juicy yummy reccommend!\n\ndessert: my birthday cake :)\nwarm chocolate cake--- cake was richh, macroon was delicious(i love macroons), ice cream complemented the cake extremely well and the presentation was beautiful! only good if you're sharing\n\noverall...good experience worth a try, but not the most amazing thing i've tried.", 
            "wifey is big fan of celebrity chefs.  especially dorky lookin' red-headed dweebs with a thick \"new yawk\" accent.  i warned her not to fall prey to the celebrity mind-meld, but she would not listen.  like any dutiful mindless star-gazer, wifey did some cursory research and discovered that mesa grill has become one of the most popular restaurants in new york.  even worse, this rapidly spreading mcdonald's-like chain restaurant has spawned another hell-child in las vegas...  caesar's palace, no less.  oh how i mourn for america's diners!\nstar-struck wifey soon made a reservation to this culinary monstrisity hoping to see chef flay and his blindingly pasty complexion.  \n\nspicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> with poached egg... not exactly an earth-shattering combination.  the mahi mahi didn't whet our whistle either.  don't think that i'm just slaggin' on chef flay's cooking because i'm biased.  after tasting his southwest fusion style, wifey wasn't exactly star-struck anymore.\n\nsorry mr. flay, but your pale as a ghost white complexion and \"aw-shucks\" dimpled-face couldn't save this meal.  only the service saved this review from the dreaded yelp 2-star kiss o' death.", 
            "i rate restaurants on four things: the food i eat, the way i am treated, how comfortable the environment is while i'm eating, and how much all of this costs.  this means i don't eat at a restaurant because a celebrity is associated with it, and therefore any feelings i may have - positive or otherwise - in regard to said celebrity, don't mess with my meal. good food is a serious business.  it should never be adulterated with bile. \n\nthe food\nafter consulting with the waiter, i ordered a cocktail... a cactus pear margarita, a blue corn pancake appetizer, and the spicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>.  \n\nthe cactus pear margarita (herradura silver tequila, cactus pear syrup and lime juice) had a strong background flavor of grapefruit, which was not to my taste.  the replacement drink was a white peach margarita (white peach puree, herradura silver tequila, lime juice).  it was exquisite.  a perfect balance of flavors.  not too sweet.  not too sour.  not excessively fruity.  \n\nmeanwhile i had the bread basket to explore. it included three breads; a jalapeno cornbread muffin, a slice of nutty whole wheat, and a few wedges of light as air foccacia.  okay... the muffin was actually the highlight of my entire day.  maybe several days.  crumbly, salty sweet, just spicy enough to be interesting.  i immediately wanted a dozen more, and my appetizer hadn't even arrived.  later i sampled the whole wheat - which was somewhat pedestrian after the muffin, and the foccacia - another delicious surprise.  i could have dined on bread alone and gone away full and happy.  but more was to come.  \n\nthe blue corn pancake is just that, a blue corn pancake filled with barbecued duck, topped with at least three sauces, including the habanero chile and star anise listed on the menu.  the blend of flavors was powerful, exotic, and extremely rich.  people who cannot or don't care for spicy foods should avoid this dish.  the heat of the smoky sweet barbecued duck was balanced with the mild blue corn, then kicked again into high gear with the sauces.  wow!\n\nthe spicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> was... well, interesting.  topped with a poached egg the combination was relatively mild.  the consistency of the whole dish was soft, almost deceptively so, because the sauces drizzled over the dish were quite spicy. i ate half and brought the rest of it home to los angeles to eat later.  it was actually better tasting when i heated it up the next day.  \n\nsince i was taking leftovers home, i went ahead and ordered a dessert.  the waiter and i spent some time talking about what would travel well, eventually settling on the smoked vanilla & toasted walnut flan.  actually, it was a coffee flavored flan with a smoky vanilla caramel top and some candied walnuts on the side. i may sound more blase than i feel, but the description on the dessert menu just did not do it justice.  even after being hauled onto a plane and stuck in a refrigerator for a day, the flan was creamy, subtly flavored, and absolutely splendid. \n\nin fact, the whole meal was a five star experience.  it takes a truly superb kitchen to create the effortless complexity of flavor and presentation i got at mesa.\n\nthe service\ni had my luggage with me when i came into the restaurant and the greeter immediately offered to put it aside in a private locked closet. although she didn't give me a claim ticket, she did recognize me when i left.  i did wonder how that all works when the restaurant is particularly busy.\n\nas you can tell already, i take up a waiter's time.  i expect them to be knowledgeable about the menu, familiar with the dishes, and to have an opinion (their favorites).  i did not order the waiter's favorites, but any really good waiter appreciates fine food and will have at least one dish on the menu that they rave about.  great restaurants hire great waiters.  mesa grill gets five stars here as well.  not only did i have a great waiter, i had two, plus a busboy who might as well have been a third, and a personable bartender who brought me my second drink ... and stood there waiting to make sure i was happy with it. \n\nmind you, i was there at 1:30 in the afternoon on a monday.  so most people should not expect to get quite this level of attention, but i have no doubt that these guys are steller even at the most hectic of times. i really put them to the test at the end. i asked to have the hash and a couple of those amazing muffins packed along with the flan.  then i had them repack it so that i could fit it into my carry on bag.  no fuss.  no looks.  just whatever help i seemed to need.  (many thanks joel, dario & adam!) \n\ni would write a longer review, but i have run out of room.  let me just say that the environment was excellent (quiet, light enough to see, but not too bright, and the bathroom was clean), and the bill, including tip was under $75.  for this level of restaurant, that's dirt cheap.", 
            "i am from texas, and living in so cal, so i can definitely appreciate good southwestern cooking.  i can appreciate bobby flay's style and influences.\n\nwent for brunch on a saturday morning.  started out the right way with a <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark> which was really good, although i would have preferred a touch less, just a touch less horseradish.  next time i'll probably get a \"rita\" although i wouldn't mind if i had another <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark>.  took a few minutes to get seated but we didn't have reservations so can't complain too much.\n\ni had the ranch style eggs on a tostada and ancho chile sauce....really delicious.  i was going to get the spicy chicken with <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>, but i wanted something more simple.  it was a much larger portion that i had planned and i almost didn't finish, but i couldn't leave any on my plate, that would have been wrong and not in the true \"food cripple\" style.  maybe i wouldn't have been so stuffed if i hadn't been devouring the treats in the bread basket.  i won't reiterate what was said by lindley k., except for...damn that stuff was good.  read that post about the bread.\n\nmy girlfriend had the crab cakes for an entree and was very content.  sat near the kitchen and could see what the cooks were placing up in the window, and yes, the burger looked really good.  might have to try that next time.  \n\nthe waiter was attentive, courteous, and knowledgeable.  \n\nif staying at caesar's, you need to eat here, and you need to consider it if you are staying somewhere else.", 
            "i used to love this place, we always stopped in for lunch and it was great, but the service has really gone down hill.  we had reservations for a 1:30 lunch on satruday, when we called in, the person on the phone failled to mention that they were not serving any lunch or dinner entree's.. only breakfast.  ok, fine, we'll make the best of it, it is afteralll bobby flay's place, i'm sure breakfast will be great....wrong.  it was inedible!  i has the <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> with poached eggs and spicy hollandaise.  the hash was like no hash i've ever had before it was more like a puree.  it was mushy and wet and the sauce was, for a lack of a better word, yucky.  to top it all off the server didn't check on us once.  when he came to clear away my barely touched plate, he didn't even ask why it only had 2 bites taken out of it.  so many other things went wrong, but i won't go into it.    we did however go back for dinner the next day (fingers crossed) and it was back to it's old self.  you must get the yucatan chicken tacos (we ended up ordering 3 servings) and the sweet corn tameles with shrimp and the the special was crab and avacado something.. it was really good too and the service was much better.  a 1 point one day and 5 the next, so it's gets a 3. moral of the review, don't go for breakfast/brunch here.", 
            "i've never been to a restaurant before where i'd actually be willing to pay for its complimentary bread, not that they charged. yes, their complimentary bread was that good - the cornbread, the scones... everything in that basket - and they give free refills.\n\nthe waitress was sweet and friendly. for brunch, she recommended the raw tuna nachos (aka tuna tartar) dish which was delicious, though a bit pricey. their sea bass was good, but my favorite was the spicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>. it was like an eggs benedict, minus the muffin, plus spicy chicken and hash. it's nothing you'd find at your typical mexican breakfast joint.\n\njonasapproved!", 
            "i stopped in to caesar's palace for a quick lunch on a recent trip to lv and found celebrity chef bobby flay's mesa grill to be a pretty decent spot to grab a bite.  i had the spicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> and could only complain about the lack of crispy crustiness that usually makes hash so delightful.  as far as the flavor was concerned it was really very enjoyable.  a deft balance of sweet and savory and heat that went very nicely with the blue and yellow corn jalapeno muffin from the bread basket that comes with every meal.  the hash is appropriately plated with two perfectly poached eggs sitting on top of the hash, contributing their yolky goodness to the enterprise.\n\na hornitos margarita rounded out the meal and while it might have been slightly heavy on the sweet and sour it was otherwise sufficiently slurp-worthy.  it packed the requisite punch and precipitated a boozy smile on my face as i and my arched eyebrow stumbled out into caesar's 24-hour nonstop cabaret of madcap money-letting bacchanalia. \n\nres ipsa loquitor, indeed.", 
            "first off, i love the decor and the mix of music.  i tried to get our server to give me their play list.  apparently, bobby flay as some music company in nyc that compiles the mix and puts it into an ipod and ships it to each of his restaurants regularly.  hmm, how do i intercept that shipment .... \n\nas for the food.  i've been here both for dinner and sunday brunch.  the food was good, but maybe i'm just not the texmex kinda gal.  the brunch basket was really yummy, i wanted to take that with me.  the grits were also really good.  actually, if i had just the bread basket and the grits i would have been just fine.  the goat cheese queso fundido was also fabulous.  just make sure you don't let it cool down too much before you dive in.  i was really hung over, so the cactus pear ice tea with the liquid sugar was my poison of choice.  the spicy chicken + <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> was good, but i don't see me craving it.  same with my dinner selection on a previous visit.  i ordered the new mexican spice rubber pork tenderloin, it was good, but not very memorable.", 
            "bobby flay is da man!  i love his shows and his food. \n\nthis was my second time at mesa grill for brunch and with his southwestern flare you can't go wrong.  almost everything has a little spice to it. my favorite dishes were the spicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> with poached eggs and green chile hollandaise and the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> with green onion, jalapeno, goat cheese apricot -mustard glazed ham and buttermilk biscuits. \n\nthe drinks are great too definitely try the <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark> and the fresh squeezed juices. \n\nhaving reservations really helped since we got seated right away and there was a pretty long wait. \n\ni haven't tried dinner here; i have heard dinner is just so-so. besides there are too many restaurants in this city i want to try!", 
            "after eating at bobby flay's mesa grill in ceasar's palace, i'm pretty sure i would allow flay to \"throwdown\" on me anytime he wants. his food a seriously sexy and  unforgettable \"explosion\" of flavors in my mouth again and again. woowee! it's getting hot in here, and it's not just because of his masterful use of spices. but let's move onto the food.\n\ni went to vegas this past weekend, and was excited to find that the people i went to didn't want to just go to the plethora of buffets that vegas has to offer. instead, our group ventured into the culinary adventures that vegas had to offer, and our first stop was mesa grill.\n\nthree things about me:\n1) i love spicy foods\n2) i typically do not like <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark>'s (in fact, i detest them)\n3) i never get red meat past medium. (pink is where its at)\n\nwe ordered our drinks first, i ordered the margarita (which was just ok, but when i asked for extra tequila, the server hooked a sister up!) my other fellow food goers both ordered <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark>. i tried a sip, and i swear i was in spicy tomato heaven. it was the best <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark> i've ever had, and i actually regretted not ordering one for myself. score 1 for bobby flay!\n\nnext, our server set down a bounty of delicious baked goods. (good thing because we were starving) now usually, the bread is usually just ok and filler food til the meal comes. the basket alone could have made up a meal, and i would have been perfectly content. (just goes to show you how serious they take food) the assortment came with jalepeno corn muffins and biscuits, cranberry scones, blueberry coffee cake, and the best part was that they gave us three of each because there were three of us! now that's dedication!\n\nnext, the three of us ordered the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark>, scrambled egg enchilada, and the spicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> with poached eggs. \n\nmy burger came with fries dusted with a southwestern seasoning (ancho chili powder, and probably some cayenne). the fries were delectably spicy and the burger was cooked medium (with the perfect pink center) score 2 more points for flay.  the burger was huge accompanied by tasty grilled onions, swiss cheese, and a side of horseradish mustard. i could have stopped here, and flay would have exceeded my expectations, but he was definitely not through with me yet. \n\nnext the scrambled egg enchiladas. <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> with chorizo and goat cheese rolled in tortillas, and assembled on top of three different sauces. the great thing i loved about this was that it was not drenched with sauce like your typical enchilada. instead, there were three intricate sauces (all sure to stimulate your taste buds), that went well with the delicate eggs. scrumptious!\n\ni was perfectly satisfied, but flay insisted \"to keep on going\" and make the experience \"last a little longer.\"  i had to try the spicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>. i was unsure about the dish- thought the sweet potatoes might have been overkill. however, i took a bite, and i was in food heaven. it was everything you want in a meal. well balanced flavors, perfectly seasoned, and not too heavy.  i was so full, but i couldn't stop eating. i wanted more. i needed more. it was the perfect climatic end to a delicious meal. \n\nas rhett s. said, if you go to vegas and have not made it to mesa, you havent really experienced vegas at all.  i would drive 4 hours just to try it again!",

            "i love the persona that is bobby flay, so i had high expectations going into mesa grill.\n\nthe bread basket with the variety of carbs - corn muffins, some type of raisin bread and jalapeno bread paired well with my <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark>.\n\nfor starters, we had the <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark> (named after his daughter) and the black bean soup.  the black bean soup was amazing.  it was perfectly spiced and delicious.\n\ni had the jerk chicken taquitos.  i was disappointed that they were not rolled tortillas stuffed with jamaican jerk flavored chicken and cabbage slaw.  it turned out to be a half chicken served on the side of a mini puffy tortilla topped with slaw.\n\nmy partner in food had the smoked chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> topped with poached eggs.  it was a nice mix of flavors and textures.  i wish that i had ordered that instead.\n\nthe dessert was not very memorable.  we ate there a few days ago and neither one of us can remember what we had.\n\nthe server that we had was either new or really didn't care because he didnt describe anything in detail and i felt like we were bothering him when we needed anything.\n\nif bobby had been there cooking, i'm sure that everything would have been totally better.  since he wasn't.. everything was just okay.",

            "first let me start off by saying there are two different types of celebrity chefs. there is the chefs that are famous for cooking amazing dishes and have a reputation for running a great restaurant like the chef i work for in atlanta, kevin rathbun,  and then there are the chefs who are famous for being all over tv like emeril and bobby flay. so when i arrived at mesa grill i had low expectations but when i left my respect for the much hated/loved bobby flay grew to a whole new level. \n\ni went for lunch and was seated right away. i started off with there famous margarita and it was by far the best margarita that i have had. they bring you a basket of warm bread which has a very delicous corn bread muffin. i ordered the tiger shrimp and <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> with a corn and cilantro cream sauce as my appetizer but it could easily be ordered as a entree because it was very feeling. it had a good amount and good size pieces of shrimp that were cooked perfectly. the tamale has a nice simi sweet corn taste to it with a touch of garlic that adds a nice aroma to the dish and the corn and cilantro sauce just made the dish perfect. this is the type of dish that will keep me coming back to mesa grill in the future. in fact i came back the next day just to have this dish again it was that good. for my entree i ordered the spicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> with poached eggs in a green chile hollandaise sauce. this dish made my taste buds go wild. all the flavors just paired so well together and had the perfect amount of kick to it! \n\noverall this was a great and memorable meal and is now one of my favorites. service was perfect thoughout the meal and everybody seemed very friendly. compared to most of las vegas restaurants, the price is very affordable for those who are on a budget. can't wait to return!",

            "this is probably the 2nd most visited restaurant i have been to in las vegas. 1st being oyster bar at palace station. i have introduced most of my friends to this restaurant and they have all loved it. however, having visited this restaurant 5 times, i have noticed that is has gone down in quality, taste, and execution. \n\nmy first and second visits was unbelievable. we ordered all his signature dishes: <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>, <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, queso fundido, tuna tartare, chilequiles, and those wonderful margaritas. every single one of those dishes were well thought out and quite tasty. i understood why bobby flay is who he is and why his food made him so famous. \n\nthen my last three visits. the hash was over doused in green chile holladaise, the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> was overcooked (even medium would've been ok, but please don't give me medium well), and the <mark>Barbecued Lamb Cobb Salad</mark> had no flavor. i was wondering to myself \"what happened?\"\n\ni think that bobby flay has been to the restaurant less, so food quality control is probably not where it should be. hopefully, the restaurant sees that they're going down (they just lost their michelin star this year) and tries to pick it back up. \n\n\n*** at least their corn muffins are still tasty ***", 
            "the restaurant is stunning, and the food is delish - though if i go back i might stick to appetizers. i sampled the goat cheese fundido and the blue corn pancake with duck; these two were easily the best items brought to the table. my lunch entree, a sweet potato and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> topped with poached eggs, was just a little too much for me - too many intermingling flavors and spices (and i love spicy, flavorful food!). my companions' entrees were in a similar vein - it was all just a little overdone. next time, it'll be apps for sure - as well as seconds on the amazing blue corn muffins. weirdly, mesa grill also had some of the best coffee i've had in a long time....or maybe it just tasted good for my post-new year's hangover?", 
            "i'm not a huge bobby flay fan but the combination of perusing the forum shops, hunger pangs, spago not being opened for lunch yet, and our 11:00am rum buzz made us take a chance on brunch at mesa grill.\n\ni can only describe the decor of this place as \"southwestern kitsch\" because of the festive colors, clear plastic wheelbarrows (yup), and wooden accents. it's an interesting setting, but not really my style. the menu was--surprise--southwest, but with hints of new flavors, such as the <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> with spicy black bean sauce or spicy chicken with <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>. vlad ordered the latter and i ordered the <mark>Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad</mark> (no goat cheese, vinaigrette on the side). \n\nafter taking our orders, the table bread arrived, which imo really was the highlight. the basket came with jalapeno cornbread, dried fruit scones, and blue corn muffins. . . rather than your average bread that looks and feels like it's been sitting out all day. vlad and i really enjoyed the blue corn muffins - they were both sweet and savory all in the same bite. while we waiting for our mains, i looked over at the table next to me only to see the most gigantic burger ever. the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> does not mess around! it looks like you literally have to dislocate your jaw in order to take one bite. luckily the lady who ordered it cut it in half and shared with her man. in retrospect, maybe i shouldn't have been closely observing these poor patrons like they were lab rats? whatevs, it's vegas. \n\nvlad was pleased with his dish, while mine was a bit bland. after taking out the goat cheese and vinaigrette, there really is nothing to that salad but chicken and spinach. actually, the chicken was atop a mini blue corn tortilla, but that's about it. i had to pull off the \"sixteen spice\" fat from each chicken strip, which i believe was intentionally included for \"flavor\". once the fat was taken off, they were just season-less chicken strips. i think the waiter felt sorry for my substituted dish and brought out 3 vinaigrettes for me to add variety. it helped a little. the green onion one was the best tasting.  \n\noverall, i'd come here again for the festive table bread but will definitely order something else. perhaps the roasted pumpkin soup with smoked chiles and pomegranate crema?",

            "the \"desert outpost\" of iron chef bobby flay's acclaimed ny restaurant, say no more, i'm sold!\n\nthis is just an all-around good restaurant. good food with perfect portions, excellent service, all amid a modern and trendy southwestern-inspired atmosphere.\n\ni ordered the bargain-priced prix-fixe lunch: the popular blue corn pancake with barbecued duck and habanero chile star anise sauce as an appetizer, buffalo burger and fries for the entree, and chef's choice for dessert -- three pastry cream puffs with a light vanilla gelato. i also sampled some of the garlic shrimp and <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> as well as the spicy chicken with <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>.\n\nevery dish was really quite good, no disappointments whatsoever. each dish was very tasty, flavorful and often had a nice little kick to it as the spices were plentiful -- many dishes having a blend of chiles, spices or peppers, but not an overpowering amount, and added extra depth to the taste of the food.", 
            "this place is good so quit your whining about how expensive it is for tex mex.  its not tex mex or southwest its its on thing.  it is a solid restaurant in caesars where you don't have to get dressed up and they still treat you like you are the most important person in the restaurant.  i love how the service is top shelf.  we have been here 4 times and everytime the waiters deserved their tips.  food is fantastic too!\n\nthis past trip we ate here for lunch.  they now have a $29 price fixed menu but we ordered off or the regular menu.  we started with the bbq duck blue corn pancake.  so awesome!  i could have ate this as my meal.  next i had the chile relleno and my husband had poached eggs over pork and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>.  both were amazing.  no skimping on spice.  everything was sooo good that i would have licked the plates.  we also had deserts.  the strawberry and gooseberry shortcake was recommended to us and we were glad to have tried it.  i though it was going to be lame but i was wrong.  it had the perfect amount of saltiness and tartness.  we also had the chocolate cornbread pudding.  definitely not a favorite.  really bizarre with a strange after taste.  not bad but just not my thing.  we will definitely return on our next trip.", 
            "maybe brunch isn't the best way to sample flay's menu, because i left thoroughly unimpressed. my party split the crispy bacon and <mark>Smoked Salmon Quesadilla</mark>, both of which were incredibly ordinary. the waiter (more on him in a bit) strongly recommended the spicy chicken + <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>, which i would only recommend if you like eating baby food. while the presentation and flavors were all there, the hash was more of a mash and when you combine that with really tender chicken, you get mush. the creamy grits were a winner, but i really regret pairing that with the mushy chicken/hash. a little bit of textural contrast may have made this good. well, at least i left full.\n\ngood service might have made this a better experience, but the waiter was too much of a salesman. i'm not sure i've ever had a waiter try to push certain dishes so hard, it seemed as if he wanted to order our meals for us. from this single sampling, i'd say that mesa grill does not live up to the bobby flay hype.", 
            "if it weren't for the terrible service....you'd be at 4.5 stars mesa grill.\n\nyes, i'm talking about you john j.  we stopped in last saturday for their brunch menu and i all of us were astonished at how lacking the service was. \n\nbut let me talk about the good eats first...\ntwo of us ordered the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark>, which was excellent. one medium/one medium rare, both of which were grilled spot on.\ntwo of us ordered the <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>, which was another good choice and an interesting combination of flavors.  the grits that were served with it were some of the best i've ever had. our burgers were served with fries, which while weren't bad, paled in comparison to the duck fat fries we had the night before at stripsteak.\n\nthe extras: they provide a complimentary assorted breads basket, which is well down and was scarfed down by us quickly.  three of us tried different margaritas, which were excellent. \n\nwhy service was terrible...very slow, we had to wave down servers on more than one occasion (if we were taken care of, why would we ever have to do this?!), one person, who had just ordered a diet pepsi, was out of drink for a while until we had to flag someone down for a refill. at $4 a soda we expect a refill.  our server actually started talking once before ever getting to our table (couldn't hear him) and started walking away while i was talking to him. kinda rude buddy. especially if you're serving at a restaurant of this caliber. \n\nthe total, for the four of us, excluding tip was $122.15", 
            "popular spot for good reason. i have now eaten there twice over a 3 year span once for lunch, once for dinner. both times i was impressed with the flavors. not too much, but definitely different. bobby flay is an iron chef for a good reason. i feel he could make any dish great (as witnessed on throwdown program) so whenever the menu veers off course, i recommend trying that dish. for me it was the <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> with poached eggs and green tomatillo salsa. i thought the tamales were the best app, but i also tried the shrimp, queso, and duck. my brothers split a steak sandwich and burger and seemed to like the steak but love the burger. everything tasted good at mesa grill.", 
            "i loved mesa grill. i am not a big fan of southwestern food, and a majority of the menu was stuff i wouldnt get, which was why i gave it 4 stars, and also because i was forced to choose from the brunch menu, even though i saw things on the lunch menu that i liked (we went on a sunday around noon) but i ended up getting a <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark>, which was amazing. very flavorful. my girlfriend got a <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> with some hollandaise sauce. she absolutely loved her dish, i did as well. the decor is pretty neat, with colored paneling around the restaurant. i would go here again absolutely.", 
            "i have to say, we were a tad disappointed with our saturday brunch at mesa grill -- and we really didn't want to be.\n\nthe host staff was able to get us in without a reservation within 15 minutes -- so kudos to them, even tho' caesars' was rocking with the saints - cards playoff game.  we were seated & greeted by our waiter in a timely manner, who did a nice job, overall.  he gave us the time to peruse the brunch menu & ask a few questions -- he, too, made a few suggestions -- the mesa grill margarita & mesa grill burger.\n\nhubby ordered a mg margarita (loved it!) -- i stuck with water for brunch.  then service slowed down,  i guess the kitchen was backed up, and our waiter was relatively attentive (until \"bill\" time -- when they all seem to disappear).\n\nwe ordered the tenderloin tartar for an appetizer -- great flavors -- capers & a nice amount of acid with a creamy caper aoili on top, with grilled bread as a side.  nice flavors -- hit the spot -- set a high standard.\n\nwe also received the typical breadbasket with some hits & some misses -- the blue corn muffins were so dry they were almost inedible, but the blueberry crumble bar was divine & the little corn muffins with fresh jalapenos were delicious.  the cranberry & fruit/nuts muffin was ok.\n\nour entrees, however, were not up to par.  hubby got the mg burger, ordered medium with a pink center.  flavors were good, bread was nice, tomatoes were fresh; but, even though the burger was pink in the middle, it was incredibly dry -- almost inedible.  not sure why?  pulled off grill to sit & wait during the rush?\n\ni ordered the spicy chicken with <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> w/ poached eggs and green chile hollandaise.  the eggs & hollandaise were great -- would order again if i could have them on some other starch.  the chicken-<mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> was incredibly sweet -- not enough savory or heat to offset the sweetness.  it was way, way beyond the average sweetness of a baked sweet potato -- not sure what was added to make it so sweet.  i ended up eating the eggs, etc. off of the hash & leaving the rest.\n\nthen, it was time to leave -- and our ever-attentive waiter disappeared.  we ended up doing the \"leave the credit card on the table\" trick to get his attention, so we didn't even look at the bill before he took our credit card -- but, we were just happy to have him swipe the card & get going.\n\nthe tendeloin tartar was all chef flay can be, but the signature mg burger was so far short of our expectations and. i'm sure, of chef flay's expectations, that i would have to believe the burger was a fluke.  the chicken-<mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> needs reworking as far as i'm concerned.  not enough heat or flavor profile to offset the sweet.  \n\ngo back?  probably not -- las vegas has enough other wonderful restaurants that i'm not inclined to start repeating until we've gone through most of the other ones.  it's a shame -- i do like chef flay's cooking, even though i like to joke about the plethora of chipotles.\n\nchef flay -- please look into these comments -- i realize you have restaurants all over the country -- but when your line cooks can't get your signature burger right -- you have to wonder.  i truly hate to give you 3 stars, i had hoped it would be an out-of-the-ballpark 5 star brunch; but with high expectations and the high standards that i'm sure you set for your kitchen staff, i was more than slightly disappointed in the quality and character of the food we received.", 
            "bobby flay is abnormally egotistical and incredibly unlikable on tv at times, but his cooking--no complaints there. i've fallen in love with tex-mex, new american, whatever it is... it's freakin' fantastic.\n\nbrunch was nothing short of solid. we began with the rough cut tuna \"nachos\" (think ahi poke with tortilla chips). the mango-habanero hot sauce was absolutely to-die-for--sweet and spicy, it complemented the fresh tuna perfectly. \n\nnext we had the spicy chicken + <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> and the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark>. the hash was beautiful, flavorful, wonderful, especially with the green chile hollandaise sauce. the burger was huge and smoky, and the <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark> addictive. i love how all the dishes had a kick to them. foodgasm!\n\none of my favorite meals in vegas. bobby needs to open a restaurant in sf--i am willing to deal with his ego silence.",

            "i must confess that the main reason i came to mesa grill (out of all the restaurants in las vegas) is because i have a cowboy brush on bobby flay. despite most negative opinions of celebrity chefs, i think many of them can cook well. personally, i enjoyed dining at mesa grill. \n\nmy friend and i came on a sunday afternoon for brunch. we were both impressed by their staff's cordial and professional service. there was a complimentary bread basket which i was very impressed with and a wide selection of water, yes water, to chose from. so service receives 5 stars. based on the number of parties i saw in the restaurant, reservations are probably not necessary for lunch or brunch. but it might be otherwise for dinner.\n\nwe started off with chef flay's famous tiger shrimp and <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>. i think this appetizer was definitely true to flay's southwestern stile and is a must try. the shrimp was cooked perfectly, tender and sweet; <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> was fresh and fluffy and the his signature sauces were extremely flavorful. each bite has a familiar spice kick.\n\nthen, we ordered the bbq <mark>Barbecued Lamb Cobb Salad</mark> and the eggs + aged strip loin tortilla. the <mark>Barbecued Lamb Cobb Salad</mark> and lamb were divine! i loved the buttermilk dressing, so good!  the tortilla dish was on the mediocre side and made me wish i ordered the spicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> (which has been on the menu for the last 8? years) however, i was mainly looking for a steak for lunch so it satisfied for cravings. honestly, i could have gone without the egg and myriad of relishes (very beautifully plated) because the strip loin was cooked really well (medium rare, which i think is how all good meat should be cooked). it was incredibly tender and melts in your mouth. i will definitely have to come back for dinner to try his mexican spiced pork tenderloin.\n\nalso, i loved the complimentary bread basket. the waiter describes what each bread piece is and each was delicious on its own. :)",

            "i had a good dining experience here at mesa, which makes me more confident that bobby flay is actually legit in those throwdowns :)\n\nif you get the opportunity to come, the tamales (corn and shrimp) and his margaritas (if you like alcohol) are the two musts. both were really good. i usually don't like tamales (no offense, maybe i've only had bad ones) because they are always so dry, but this one was moist and full of flavor. the corn was the perfect accompaniment too. as for the margarita, you can custom-create your own from their list of tequilas or choose a concocted mix. i had the white peach margarita which was fantastic.\n\nwe had the chicken with <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> and the steak and egg. the first is very unique and very bobby. it's a little spicy, and it is basically two huge mounds of chicken and hash mixed together. very creative. the steak and egg was more traditional; you pretty much just make your own fajitas from guacamole, sour cream, egg, peppers, etc. also good (although not spectacular) because of the fresh ingredients. \n\nservice was slow, although our server apologized because it was really busy. i would return, but not before i try other places on the strip.", 
            "as a celebratory lunch for being alive after a near death experience by crazy valet driver in front of the mirage, we decided to have bobby flay grace us with his delicious tex-mex creations. living it up in true vegas style, margaritas were in order. ultimate = a simple original favorite. white peach = excellent and refreshing. pear = way too strong, and why was it hot pink? everything about this place is vividly bold and colorful. the contemporary decor, the presentation of each dish, and even the drinks. \n\nbobby's famous blue corn pancake w/ bbq'd duck is a must have. the habanero chili and star anise sauce add a savory sweet kick to each bite. the duck was well cooked and tender, and although a mess to eat, no scraps were left behind. chorizo quesadilla w/ fried egg was also a delicious starter. oozing yolk blended with habanero sauce and grated parmesan over a crisp crust never tasted so heavenly.\n\nwith my heart set on the spicy chicken & <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> w/ poached eggs, i wasn't sure what to expect, but i knew it would be good. two whopping mounds of poached eggs ridiculously drenched in green hollandaise and habanero sauce (notice the pattern?) set before my eyes as i wiped a little bit of drool off my face. i can't recall any other time i've experience such explosive flavors all at once. this dish is a bit on the heavy side, so don't hesitate loosening up a notch on the ol' belt loop. the jumbo lump crab cake isn't on the regular menu, but we were lucky enough to catch a taste of it off the lunch prix fixe. complemented by a blanket of corn relish and pablano vinaigrette, it would be a shame not to permanently include this on the menu. typically, crab cakes are made small in size, but this one was considerably well portioned. definitely one of my more meatier crab cakes i've ever seen. ended the meal with a dark chocolate creme brulee and pineapple upside down cake w/ caramelized rum, which were both a delightful treat.\n\nprices are reasonable, but tend to add up quickly. but hey, it's vegas after all. planning to check out the dinner menu on my next visit to try the pork tenderloin everyone's been raving about.", 
            "***review is for brunch only\n\nto get it out of the way...i'm not the biggest bobby flay fan.  on tv, he can come off as obnoxious, arrogant, and cocky.  however, the guy shows up on a bunch of different shows, which makes me wonder...is it just a persona he puts up?  i mean, he must be a decent guy to get himself on so many spots on the food network, right?  if it is just an act though, it works; his brash personality actually made me want to try his cooking even more, just so i could see if he's as good as his reputation suggests.  and being that the mesa in ny was his first restaurant, my friends and i figured this would the perfect chance to check out his cooking.  \n\nunfortunately, we couldn't squeeze mesa in for dinner, so we had to settle for fitting it in for brunch instead.  when our party of ten checked in with the hostess, we were seated promptly, where the wait staff was quick to start serving our table.  our waiter was helpful with menu suggestions, and was pretty good at describing and explaining the different components of each plate.  in fact, when it was all said and done, i ended up going with one of his suggestions - the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> chilaquiles along with the rough cut tuna nachos that a few of my friends wanted to split.\n\n- the rough cut tuna nachos - served with a mango & habanero hot sauce and avocado crema...terrific.  the tuna is similar to hawaiian poke, but with southwestern flavors instead.  in a way, with the crema, it's reminiscent of a guacamole salsa, but better.  much better.  too bad there aren't any places around here that serve it the same way.\n\n- <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> chilaquiles - served with a roasted tomatillo sauce, white cheddar cheese, and creme fraiche.  presentation wise, all of the colors on the plate really made it stand out (blue corn tortilla, orange sauce, white cheddar, green seasoning), but the execution is what really made the dish.  with three layers of crispy tortilla, it had a nice crunch, which worked well with the richness.  the combination of flavors were fantastic.  if anything, i wish there was more of a kick with the sauce, but it tasted great as is.\n\nin addition, i also got a chance to try my friend's spicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>, but i thought my entree was better.  although i did like the spiciness and flavor, i would have like a little contrast in the texture.  along with our meal, they also served a basket of bread, all with some southwestern twists.  they were all decent, but my favorite of the bunch was the jalapeno bread.  \n\nin the end, i'll give flay his due...the guy can offer up a pretty good brunch menu.  the ones that i tried were great, though i know a few of my friends were not as enthralled with their orders (hence the four stars).  none of them said the dishes were bad though, so maybe it was just a case of hopeful expectations not being met.  reviews on here are pretty high for dinner as well, so i'd be interested in checking that out next time.  at least now, i have another reason to go back to vegas...not that i really needed another one anyways.",

            "spring restaurant week 2013:\n\nday 5: \n\nmesa grill is known for a handful of dishes and usually restaurant week tends to be the showcase for their best items. i have eaten here a few times in the past couple of years. each time i have had a great experience. the must try items are the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, the rough cut tuna nachos, crab cakes, <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>, the chile rellenos, and their desserts.\n\nthere is a reason why mesa wins every year when it comes to the most money raised for our local food bank. they put out a well balanced menu that gives the guest the biggest bang for their buck. the portion sizes are scaled back, but leaves you feeling full. i started with the rough cut tuna nachos for my appetizer. it is served like tuna poki. the fish is sashimi grade and served raw. tosses with chipotle puree, cilantro, capers, and placed on top of a mango habanero puree and avocado crema. the blue corn and tortilla chips are the only utensils you need to scoop up all of this deliciousness. \n\ni got the crab cakes last year when they ran this special which lead me to order the green chile burger this time around. the meat tends to lose it's form and crumbles easily. i ended up using a fork and knife halfway through. the bechamel cheese sauce is delicious. paired with the pickled onions and pablano peppers gave it a range of depth. if given the choice again, i would have gone with the crab cakes. \n\nthe desserts changes ever day depending on what the chef chooses. we got the deep dish banana cream pie. the frangelico cream only gives hints of the alcohol. the surprise comes from the contrast in textures. the dense custard differs from the soft cream which compliments the bananas and praline disk on top. i am a huge fan of bobby flay's desserts. the sticky toffee pudding is not a traditional version, but it is so good. i also like the strawberry shortcake. pastry changes their offerings seasonally, so keep an eye out for these dishes.",

            "this place is a family favorite for us, especially for brunch! we have tried pretty much everything on the menu with few disappointments. prices are very reasonable for being on the strip. <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark> is a must; i probably go through a whole pitcher :p \nfor shared appetizer we like the rough cut tuna nachos (basically a poke), queso fundido, and for something different the <mark>Smoked Salmon Quesadilla</mark>.  bread basket is a treat with both sweet and savory muffins, scones, biscuits, and bread. for entrees we usually stick to hot dishes - <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>, chilequiles, salmon. grits and the bacon are favorite sides. i'd say skip the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> (cold deli style), and the salads unless that's what you are in the mood for. steak and eggs is a make your own taco dish which is huge, more than enough for one person. salmon is another great treat! also note that you can only get the churros at dinner time for dessert.", 
            "amazing. unlike any mexican i've had before. stopped in for a quick lunch in caesar's, and was amazed by the variety of the menu. my partner had the tuna tartare nachos, and i had the spicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> with poached eggs and green chile hollandaise. \n\nboth were delicious, beautifully plated, and arrived quickly. was impressed enough to splurge on dessert, and took the server's recommendation for the deconstructed banana cream pie. \n\nobviously, tequilas and margaritas are a specialty, but its worth noting that the beer and whiskey selections available are obviously well curated to go with the restaurant's flavor profile and high quality."

            "went here for brunch. we had raw tuna nachos for appetizers - it was delicious! think sashimi with a tex-mex flair, flavor, and just a hint of spiciness. i got the <mark>Ranch Style Eggs Tostada</mark>. perfectly cooked eggs! so delicious and great presentation. i think next time i might want to share and entree or skip the appetizers cuz the bread basket they bring is outta this world! the bread basket is filled with like 5 different kinds of breads and muffins. corn muffins, cranberry muffins, normal bread, jalapeno cheese poppers! carb heaven!\n\nthe decor is very glamorous and trendy. service is attentive. there was a 10 minute wait on a sunday around 11am. not bad at all. you can always go to the bar to wait =p", 
            "this is a place in vegas that lives up to the hype of the name behind it without being *too* ridiculous.  given the bobby flay tag readily coupled with the mention of this place, i was sure it would be all press and no substance.\n\ni would recommend this place for brunch.  yeah, you'll probably be looking at roughly $30 for two people not including drinks, extras or tip but i think the atmosphere and food make up for the price.  they bring you a nice array of baked goods as the \"bread\" while you wait.  all of the egg entrees are served with grits or <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark>.  i ordered the scrambled egg enchiladas (eggs, chorizo, goat cheese) and they were delicious, paired with an interesting mix of sauce to provide enough spiciness to give the dish some authenticity.  my dining partner had the <mark>Ranch Style Eggs Tostada</mark> which was surprisingly large and equally as tasty.  the grits were a little heavy but so tasty that i couldn't avoid eating them.\n\nprobably the only knock is that the drinks are kind of expensive (11.2oz bottle of chimay blue = $12) and our waitress seemed a little condescending when we told her we didn't want appetizers.  otherwise the service was actually quite good with the waiters being right on top of refilling waters and coffee.\n\ngiven the prices you pay in vegas, i think you could do a lot worse on price and food quality, making mesa a pretty solid choice for any meal.", 
            "for a latin restaurant owned by an irish dude, this is legit. i went there for brunch on sunday and highly recommend making reservations because the place can get pretty full. \n\nservice was prompt, we had drinks and menus and a run down of the best things to order within 2 minutes of being seated. you start out with various baked savory/sweet pastries while waiting for the food. the chilaquiles were really good and i was glad that they didn't skimp on portion size. my friend got the <mark>Ranch Style Eggs Tostada</mark> which was ok but the sauce was surprisingly sweet, almost too sweet. the drinks (mango&<mark>Carrot / Mango Juice</mark> and the blood mary) were a nice compliment to the meals, i'd probably order both of them again. \n\nthis is a great place that's more on the casual-upscale side compared to other restaurants on the strip and the food is worth going back for, especially because the service was so quick (we finished a full meal in 1 hour)! one quick tip: their napkins are super linty, don't put them on your clothes!", 
            "i am a huge fan of bobby flay so i thought i would love this place. i went here for brunch and i was right, i loved it. in my group of 5 we all had the <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark> which was good. how can you go wrong right? \n\napps: goat cheese\"queso fundido\", <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark> (2), smoked salmon + di l l quesadilla, sweet potato soup. the goat cheese fundido was the best out of all the app choices, but all still good.\n\nentree:  <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark>, <mark>Ranch Style Eggs Tostada</mark>, <mark>Blue Corn Buttermilk Waffle</mark>, <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> (2). my favorite was the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark>, holy smokes, i can taste them now. everyone loved their entrees and demolished the food.\n\nbe sure to make a reservation for any meal you plan on eating here. oh and p.s. the bread basket is oh so good. you will be wanting more.",

            "i was excited to eat here, due to all the hype of the restaurant.  as i had saturday brunch here, reservations were no problem.  the food is tasty. i admit.  i had the <mark>Smoked Salmon Quesadilla</mark>, with salmon roe for appetizers and <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> with jalapenos and ham.  my only complaint was that they couldn't make my eggs with all egg whites or egg substitute, as the waiter said that the chef would not do it. i would assume that they would try to accommodate with my request, but they didn't. i guess customer satisfaction is not a top priority here.", 
            "i had brunch here with 7 other friends. the order was as follows (best to worst, 1-6): \n\nbread assortment (complimentary)\nthere were about four different kinds. a couple of them were a little spicy with jalapeno, very good overall. \n\n(3) queso fundido $12\na light goat cheese fondue with bits of peppers served with blue tortilla chips. i've had this one before at the nyc location and it's consistently good.\n\n(1) spicy chicken + <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> $18\ngreat breakfast dish. it came with with poached eggs and a green chile hollandaise sauce.\n\n(1) <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> chiliquiles with roasted tomatillo sauce\nwhite cheddar cheese + creme fraiche $14\nanother great dish. it came with one of the same sauces as the chicken dish, but it was a solid sauce.\ni had no clue what chiliquiles were, so here's the wikipedia for your reference:\n\nchilaquiles is a traditional mexican dish consisting of fried or dried tortilla chips, bathed in green or red salsa or mole and broiled or grilled with a cheese topping. sometimes chicken strips are mixed into the sauce, or the dish can be served with a fried egg on top or a strip of meat alongside.\n\nthey are most commonly eaten at breakfast time, served alongside with fried or <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> or a mexican style grilled beef. moreover, chilaquiles are often lauded as a cure for the common hangover.\n\nunlike nachos, which are served as a crispy snack, chilaquiles are a main dish and are not served until the tortilla chips are thoroughly soaked and softened by the salsa. this makes them a popular recipe for stale chips or those with a bad taste as the other flavors mask the chips'.\n\n(5) <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> $16\nthe most memorable part of this dish was the price. the fries were pretty good; crispy outside, seasoned well. but, nothing special about the burger.\n\n(6) <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> with grilled red onion, arugula, and\nancho-chile mayonnaise $15\ni thought this was the worst of the dishes. the beef was tender, but it lacked flavor, was too thin, was initially served cold and the bread was too thick for the sandwich. the waiter said the previous bakery burned down and they were testing new bread. the ancho mayo was good, but the flavor was overpowered by the 2 lbs. of bread.\n\n(4) grilled mahi mahi with roasted pineapple-cascabel chile sauce and caramelized pineapple-green onion salsa $24\ni was hung over, which is the only way i could why i order this dish. the sauce was good and the fish seemed to be lightly scented with honey. the texture was a little dry. overall, not worth $24. the waiter said it was the best thing on the menu, maybe he meant the priciest thing on the menu.\n\nmy friend got a <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark>. i'm not a fan of tomato juice or blood for that matter, but it looked of pretty good quality. \n\nservice\nvery slow. starting with the water, to the other drinks, to the bread, to the starter, and ending with the entrees. they were consistent with it, at least. and still kind of pissed that he recommended the mahi mahi.\n\nso, what did we learn? for brunch, stick to the br and stray from the unch. based on my experience in nyc, you may want to try dinner also and stick to red meat.", 
            "caveat - this review is for brunch only.  we were pleased to see that we gained some comps at ceasar's and headed over to mesa grill for some free brunch.  the decor is modern and bright with primary colors decorating the bar and more subtle hues throughout the dining room.  our waitress was prompt in every way.  she brought us the delicious bread basket, which included a piece of mesa grill's cinammon roll, some jalapeno biscuits, and yellow and blue cornbread muffins.  \n\nmy hubby and i ordered the same dish - the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark>.  the fluffy eggs came mixed with jalapenos, goat cheese, and green onions, and were topped with apricot glazed ham.  they were served with two wonderful buttermilk biscuits.  the goat cheese and jalapenos combined for the perfect explosion of flavor without either flavor overwhelming the dish.  i am not usually a ham person, but this ham was top notch.  i think we will add mesa grill's brunch to our regular stops when we are in lv.  it was really that good.", 
            "after being told that if everyone in our party didnt show up for our reservation, we would be charged $50/person penalty (wtf!!), we all showed up on time to find the place half empty (for saturday brunch).  they should have been kissing the floor we walked for our business...jeez.\n\nanyways, onto the pros:\n- white peach margarita: not too sweet, but still very tasty.  nice and tart\n- bread basket: the best bread basket i've ever had.  complete with blue corn muffins, blueberry <mark>Coffee</mark>, jalapeno cheddar scones, tequila scones, and some other really yummy scone thing.  they gave us plenty of each so everyone in my group had a taste of everything.\n- egg chilaquiles: i think i misunderstood what these are supposed to be, but regardless, the dish was amazing!  think <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> on top of corn tostadas which were layered with white cheddar.  everything was covered in this delicious green sauce.  the sauce was soo flavorful, i couldnt stop eating even though i was wayy to full from the bread basket and appetizer.\n\ncons:\n- goat cheese fundido:  well, not a con cause it was gooood. but nothing special.  \n- i had seen this mushroom quesadilla appetizer on their lunch menu online, but since we were there for brunch, they only had these other <mark>Smoked Salmon Quesadilla</mark>.  i asked them if they could make me a mushroom one, and they refused saying that the ingredients wouldnt have been prepared.  maybe i'm naive about these things, but um it was 12:30...and they had all the quesadilla fixings put together for brunch anway...just add the mushrooms!!  i'm paying enough to deserve a little more flexibility.  again, shows you how puffed up they are.\n\nall in all, the bread basket and the chilaquiles make up for not giving me a mushroom quesadilla.", 
            "this place is not that unreasonably priced compared to some of the other big name restaurants in vegas, we had a brunch there and the average entree ran between 10-20 bucks. i had the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> with goat cheese, jalapeno, and chives with apricot glazed ham and buttermilk biscuit. it was some of the best <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> i've ever had. we also shared the goat cheese queso and the egg and <mark>Crispy Bacon  Hash Brown Quesadilla</mark>. yummmmmmmmm. excellent brunch spot and you really could tell bobby flay had a hand in the whole menu.",

(good thing because we were starving) now usually, the bread is usually just ok and filler food til the meal comes. the basket alone could have made up a meal, and i would have been perfectly content. (just goes to show you how serious they take food) the assortment came with jalepeno corn muffins and biscuits, cranberry scones, blueberry coffee cake, and the best part was that they gave us three of each because there were three of us! now that's dedication!\n\nnext, the three of us ordered the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark>, scrambled egg enchilada, and the spicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> with poached eggs. \n\nmy burger came with fries dusted with a southwestern seasoning (ancho chili powder, and probably some cayenne). the fries were delectably spicy and the burger was cooked medium (with the perfect pink center) score 2 more points for flay.  the burger was huge accompanied by tasty grilled onions, swiss cheese, and a side of horseradish mustard. i could have stopped here, and flay would have exceeded my expectations, but he was definitely not through with me yet. \n\nnext the scrambled egg enchiladas. <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> with chorizo and goat cheese rolled in tortillas, and assembled on top of three different sauces. the great thing i loved about this was that it was not drenched with sauce like your typical enchilada. instead, there were three intricate sauces (all sure to stimulate your taste buds), that went well with the delicate eggs. scrumptious!\n\ni was perfectly satisfied, but flay insisted \"to keep on going\" and make the experience \"last a little longer.\"  i had to try the spicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>. i was unsure about the dish- thought the sweet potatoes might have been overkill. however, i took a bite, and i was in food heaven. it was everything you want in a meal. well balanced flavors, perfectly seasoned, and not too heavy.  i was so full, but i couldn't stop eating. i wanted more. i needed more. it was the perfect climatic end to a delicious meal. \n\nas rhett s. said, if you go to vegas and have not made it to mesa, you havent really experienced vegas at all.  i would drive 4 hours just to try it again!",

            "we decided to try mesa grill for lunch. it was a sunday so we had the brunch menu. it was a little disappointing since i would have preferred the lunch menu. the brunch menu is mostly several variations on <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark>. it did not have any of the tamales that bobby flay is know for. we had to wait a little bit for a table since we had a large group and they had to push some tables together for us. the place has a nice feel with an open kitchen, although the set up made it a little hard to see the kitchen. the guy at the grill seemed to like that we were paying attention to him and kept looking up and smiling at us. in fact, everyone at the restaurant was friendly. the service was really good. at one point, one of the bussers dropped a fork and all three employees in the area went over to pick it up.\n\ni went with their version of steak and eggs. actually half our group had that and the other half had the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark>. one person had scrambled egg enchiladas. the steak and eggs and burgers were a decent sized portion and we felt pretty full after, however i think my friend that got the enchiladas was a little disappointed as it cost as much as the burger, but you only got two small enchiladas.  you do get a basket of delicious bread with your meal.\n\ni'd like to try mesa grill again, but next time for lunch or dinner. a few notes: the dress code is relaxed in the day. there were several people in tshirt and shorts, myself included. however, they won't let you wear a hat. the table next to us had a very young child with them who was a picky eater and they were happy to make something special for him.", 
            "ate here for brunch at around 130pm and lemme tell u, the food, service, and atmosphere was awesome!  first off we got seated and when we got our water my auntie had a water bottle and the waiter even asked us if she wanted him to pour her water for her. now that's what i call service.  they even changed our knives and forks after eating our appetizer while even setting our knives and plates in the right positions.  as for the food the complimentary bread basket with jalapeno cheddar biscuits, scones, blue corn muffins, and blueberry coffee cake was all way delish.  for the entree omg it was so good, it was a bacon potato quesadilla and it was so delish and i don't even really like bacon but it was goooood.  for our entrees we all loved what we got i got the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> with ham biscuits and grits and the eggs were the most fluffy soft eggs i've ever had in my life.  eating the grits for the first time so good.  my aunite got the green chile cilequilles (sp) and it was really good.  my uncle got the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> with pepper fries and he like it, my other uncle got this make ur own steak sandwich with eggs and the works with <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark> and he also liked it.  overall we all really loved this place and agreed that it was the best meal we had!",

            "this review is for the brunch menu.\n\ni adore chef bobby flay. love watching him on iron chef, i follow his tweets and he has awesome burger tips. \n\nok, if you're expecting to see some thomas keller or michael mina action here, don't be fooled, you ain't gonna get it here. if you want a fine dining experience, go to a keller, mina or ogden establishment.\n\nwith that being said, the price point for brunch was spot on (below payard's) and the food looked and tasted good. loved the bread basket! my fav: the jalapeno biscuits. \n\ninquiry: what's the difference between <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark> and regular <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark>? both looked the same and i wasn't sure if i even got it.\n\nbobby's version of <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> chilaquiles is amazing. i recommend it. overall, brunch was solid. if you can't get into payard's, mesa grill is another good option.",

            "its tough to review mesa because during our last trip to vegas we went to both bouchon and mesa, and comparatively bouchon should be in the upper stratosphere fantastic compared to mesa - but i think our group found some of mesa''s brunch offerings to exceed bouchon. which is almost crazy to say.\n\nwe arrived, no reservations, with a group of 8 people and were seated in groups of 4 right next to each other. no drinks for us, but ordered the queso fundido to start - goat cheese and bell peppers melted in a cast iron skillet with blue corn tortilla chips - excellent.\n\nordered up the <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> with poached eggs, the chilaquiles, spicy srambled eggs, and egg enchiladas. before we get to the main food, lets talk about the baked basket you get.\n\nthis is hands down the best baked goods basket i've ever had in my life (even the fact that it was free). first off, the jalapeno cornbread was like eating small atom bombs good with sweet cream butter. there was a veggie corn muffin which i can't even describe and some sort of blueberry coffee bar which basically was so good i didn't even get to try more than a morsel before it was snapped up. no joke, i could have just ordered two more baked baskets and been very happy. did i mention it was free?\n\non to the main attractions: i ordered the spicy chicken sweet potato with poached egg and green chili hollandaise. seriously, this was the most unexpected dish i have ever had. the chicken and sweet potato is fused into a sort of loose biscuit with a perfectly runny poached egg, and served with a spicy (but good) hollandaise. i couldn't stop eating it. seriously, i'd say this is one of the most original and delicious plays on eggs benedict i've ever had. go for it.\n\nthe egg enchilada was a bit underwhelming and dry, and sort of sparse for the dish - luckily we had plenty of other food. the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark>, were exactly as they sound - <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark>, but very delicious. and finally the chilaquiles, which from my mexican friend who ordered it, were very authentic, crispy, and delicious. our other table ordered more of the same, with one person ordering the slider-style burgers, and stating that it was the best burger she ever had (she is in fact, vegetarian). \n\ngot out under $30 a person, with quick service, delicious food, beautiful american-style clean sophistication to the dishes, and a seriously seriously full and satisfied tummy. definitely a must-do.", 
            "ok, we admit it... we have a ridiculous foodie crush on chef bobby flay!  we have been to almost every restaurant he has, including completing the trifecta of mesa grills... new york, vegas (at caesar's palace across from pure) and the bahamas (at the cove, at the atlantis in paradise island).  mesa offers lunch and dinner, as well as brunch on saturdays and sundays. the food is spicy, inventive and excellent!\n\nfor dinner, start off with the shrimp and <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, the blue corn pancake with bbq duck and the <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark> (with chick peas, olives and tortillas).  famous for southwestern cuisine and grilling, be ready for some spicy meat!  the new mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin with a sweet potato tamale and crushed pecan butter.... damn! the grilled lamb porterhouse chops with red chile, lime and rosemary, with green corn pudding.... whew... sexy!  blue corn soft shell crabs with bacon, green onion and chile vinegar... i could go on and on.\n\nif you can make it for brunch... please do!  i think it may be better than dinner.  first off, a ridiculously amazing bread basket- my favorite is the spicy, corn muffins with pieces of corn in it and swirls of spice.  for your entree, definitely have the spicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> with poached eggs and green chile hollandaise.  i can not even explain how good this is.  sort of like a <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> benedict with chicken and sweet potato <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark>.  some one always orders the eggs and aged sirloin tortilla with roasted peppers and avocado relish... and loves it!  it is simple, but delish... think make your own tacos with steak and eggs.\n\nno matter what meal you eat, the tequila cocktails are the perfect accompaniment.    hands down, the cactus pear margarita wins it!  watch out boys... its pink!\n\nthe scene- always full... full of foodies!  lively!  \n\nfood and drinks- 5: mind blowing and life changing.  \n\ntip worthy- 5: the new yorker 25-30%.  excellent service... 3 to 4 servers at a time... one water, one bread, busy boy and waiter... without being the least bit stuffy.\n\ncoordinates- 4: neighborhood- centrally located! \n\nrestaurant return rate- green light!  between the three mesa's, we have had at least 10 meals.  we bring everyone we know when there is one close by.  \n\nthis review written by angela.",

            "mesa grill gets 3.5 stars in my book.\n\n3 of us came here for brunch on a saturday around 12pm and was told that there'd be a 10 minute wait.  i said to my friend -- there's a table right there, why do we have to wait? 10 minutes later, lo and behold -- which table do they give us? the one that has been empty this whole time.  maybe they just wanted to make it seem crowded with their lounge full of people waiting for a table.\n\nservice:\nservice was slow but decent.  it took a long time to get water refills but we did get everything that we asked for.  the 3 of us drank a ton of mimosas and quickly got really rowdy.  the server didn't seem to mind.\n\nfood:\n<mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>:\nwe shared the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> and it was the best thing that i ate at mesa grill.  the sauce was spot on, spicy and tangy and the prawns were cooked to perfection.  i believe the dish came with 4 prawns.\n\ncrispy bacon + <mark>Crispy Bacon  Hash Brown Quesadilla</mark>\ni wish i would have enjoyed this dish as it sounded super appetizing on the menu.  however, it was just ok in my opinion.  the bacon really wasn't crispy and the quesadilla was on the dry side.\n\n<mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark>\nthe eggs in this dish were prepared well.  it was decent, but nothing to write home about.\n\ngrits\nsurprisingly, the grits was one of the most flavorful items that came to the table.  we joked that we don't even know why we ordered grits but in the end we enjoyed it.\n\ni probably won't be returning to mesa grill since there are plenty of restaurants in vegas.  however, i would recommend it to someone who was looking for tex-mex with signature flavors that tends to be on the spicy-tangy side.  lunch was expensive but i think the prices are fair when compared to hotel cafes.\n\np.s. they have a delicious chocolate tequila on their dessert menu!", 
            "you know, i've always been conflicted about trying this place. on one hand, bobby flay has annoyed me ever since he offended morimoto on iron chef. on the other hand, i really like southwestern style food, and he's supposedly good at coming up with versions of it. \n\nso there we were, my boyfriend and i, in vegas a little earlier than expected because we made most of the drive ahead of time to avoid a snowstorm. in fact, we were here in time for lunch (instead of just to st. george). we couldn't decide what to do with our extra meal, so we moseyed into caesar's and were greeted by the mesa grill. we were curious, so we went in. \n\nit was saturday afternoon, and therefore brunch time, so my boyfriend started with a mimosa. however, i couldn't resist our waiter's suggestion of one of the margaritas. i can't remember what they called it, but it was as smooth as he said it was supposed to be. i don't usually like margaritas, but i was down with this. \n\nfor our entrees, alan got the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> and i got the <mark>Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad</mark>. both were very good. the chicken in the salad was perfectly seasoned, and the dressing and goat cheese complimented it nicely. the eggs also had a good amount of goat cheese, and the combination of spices gave a great unique flavor. the ham the accompanied the dish was probably the highlight, though. \n\nservice was pretty slow, but our waiter was very nice when he did come by. prices were high, but it's vegas. \n\ni guess i'll forgive bobby flay for his iron chef ills for now (it's been long enough, right?), and i'll even go as far to say that i'd love to try this place for dinner sometime.", 
            "***review is for brunch only\n\nto get it out of the way...i'm not the biggest bobby flay fan.  on tv, he can come off as obnoxious, arrogant, and cocky.  however, the guy shows up on a bunch of different shows, which makes me wonder...is it just a persona he puts up?  i mean, he must be a decent guy to get himself on so many spots on the food network, right?  if it is just an act though, it works; his brash personality actually made me want to try his cooking even more, just so i could see if he's as good as his reputation suggests.  and being that the mesa in ny was his first restaurant, my friends and i figured this would the perfect chance to check out his cooking.  \n\nunfortunately, we couldn't squeeze mesa in for dinner, so we had to settle for fitting it in for brunch instead.  when our party of ten checked in with the hostess, we were seated promptly, where the wait staff was quick to start serving our table.  our waiter was helpful with menu suggestions, and was pretty good at describing and explaining the different components of each plate.  in fact, when it was all said and done, i ended up going with one of his suggestions - the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> chilaquiles along with the rough cut tuna nachos that a few of my friends wanted to split.\n\n- the rough cut tuna nachos - served with a mango & habanero hot sauce and avocado crema...terrific.  the tuna is similar to hawaiian poke, but with southwestern flavors instead.  in a way, with the crema, it's reminiscent of a guacamole salsa, but better.  much better.  too bad there aren't any places around here that serve it the same way.\n\n- <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> chilaquiles - served with a roasted tomatillo sauce, white cheddar cheese, and creme fraiche.  presentation wise, all of the colors on the plate really made it stand out (blue corn tortilla, orange sauce, white cheddar, green seasoning), but the execution is what really made the dish.  with three layers of crispy tortilla, it had a nice crunch, which worked well with the richness.  the combination of flavors were fantastic.  if anything, i wish there was more of a kick with the sauce, but it tasted great as is.\n\nin addition, i also got a chance to try my friend's spicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>, but i thought my entree was better.  although i did like the spiciness and flavor, i would have like a little contrast in the texture.  along with our meal, they also served a basket of bread, all with some southwestern twists.  they were all decent, but my favorite of the bunch was the jalapeno bread.  \n\nin the end, i'll give flay his due...the guy can offer up a pretty good brunch menu.  the ones that i tried were great, though i know a few of my friends were not as enthralled with their orders (hence the four stars).  none of them said the dishes were bad though, so maybe it was just a case of hopeful expectations not being met.  reviews on here are pretty high for dinner as well, so i'd be interested in checking that out next time.  at least now, i have another reason to go back to vegas...not that i really needed another one anyways.",

            "whenever i'm in vegas i just have to say that there are few times i'm able to wake up early enough to go anywhere for breakfast or lunch, especially on a sunday. but i will make an exception for this restaurant. hopefully that speaks volumes. \n\nthis restaurant (owned by bobby flay) is located on the casino floor of caesar's palace. it's easy to miss unless you're really looking for it. i feel like this restaurant is underrated and can be easily overshadowed by the many restaurants that caesar's palace offers. \n\none of the main reasons why i come here is the breakfast/brunch menu. i seriously cannot get enough of their smoked salmon and dill quesadilla. it has the perfect amount of smoked salmon and cheese and the creme fraiche is delicious. their tiger shrimp and <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> is fantastic as well as their wild striped bass and <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark>. i would definitely like to try the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> chilaquiles (a somewhat new discovery from my mexican friends) and the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark>. as if you couldn't already tell i'm a sucker for spicy foods...as well as smoked salmon. i was also told that the <mark>Blue Corn Buttermilk Waffle</mark> is to die for as well. \n\ni honestly haven't had anything that doesn't taste good at this restaurant. the service is prompt and attentive, the drinks are great, and the food is fantastic. i haven't had a complaint yet. try this place out and you won't be disappointed! good job, bobby flay!", 
            "we were planning to go for dinner but couldn't get a reservation until after 9pm so we decided to go ahead try it out for lunch. we were seated quickly and our waiter greeted us very warmly! \n\nwe started off with some delicious margaritas and were given a nice little basket of mixed breads. my favorite was the blueberry <mark>Coffee</mark>! i could really go for a lifetime supply of it. i am not a big fan of <mark>Coffee</mark> as well. when the waiter was describing each type of bread, i kind of dismissed the <mark>Coffee</mark> until i tried it! \n\nthe atmosphere was great. we ordered the goat cheese \"queso fundido\" as an appetizer which i highly recommend. then we decided to order the rough cut tuna \"nachos\" and <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> for our entrees. the tuna \"nachos\" are a pretty small portion and i probably wouldn't order them again. the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> had jalape\\u00f1o and goat cheese apricot but it was a bit too cheesy for me. i think it's because we had the fundido for appetizer. if you love cheese, you'll be very happy!\n\nwe found something inedible in our potatoes and our waiter quickly took it away and replaced it. then, the chef offered us a dessert on the house. we couldn't have been more pleased. we decided on the toasted coconut layered cake and it was amazing!!! we were so happy that they offered us a dessert to make up for the mistake. we ordered the best item on the menu! if you go there, be sure to have the toasted coconut layered cake. you will not regret it.\n\noverall, i had a great experience here. i would try other items next time and thought the service was wonderful! we will definitely be back.", 
            "i finally made it into mesa grill this weekend. my friend was always raving about their food and margaritas, so i was very excited to finally get to try it for myself. my boyfriend and i stopped by for brunch and we were pleasantly surprised. they brought out a bread basket while we waited for our appetizer. the bread was delicious! there were tiny jalapeno biscuits, cornbread, blueberry cake and a raisin scone. everything was perfect. the bread was warm and very fresh. i could seriously eat like 10 of those jalapeno biscuits!  \n\nwe ordered the goat cheese queso fundido as our appetizer. so good! the cheese was topped with red and green peppers. they served it with some light and crispy blue corn chips. i'm already craving this again...\n\nfor my entree i ordered the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> chilaquiles. they were pretty good, but very different from the chilaquiles i'm used to eating. the tomatillo salsa was good, but my favorite part was the side of <mark>House Ground Hominy Grits</mark>. they were very flavorful!\n\nmy boyfriend ordered the spicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>. it was so good! if you like sweet potatoes, you will love this dish. it was the perfect balance of sweet and spicy. \n\nwe didn't save room for dessert, so we will have to go back one of these days to give that a try. mesa grill is a place i can certainly see myself visiting again. i have to try their white peach margarita, after all!", 
            "my friend and i decided to come here because another restaurant we couldn't enter because we were not 21 and for the fact that its bobby flay's restaurant. thank goodness we came here because it was awesome! we came here for brunch and the staff all greeted us with warm smiles and immediately we were seated. we came in around brunch time so we had the brunch menu. i ordered the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> and my friend ordered the <mark>Blue Corn Buttermilk Waffle</mark> but before all this came an assortment of bread. all of the breads were warm, soft, and delicious! both entrees  were outstanding. the ham egg and biscuits in the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> were phenomenal and the waffle was crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside, and the portions and prices were extremely good. the waiters and waitresses were also awesome and always refilled water and bread without us asking. it was definitely worth the 40 dollars we paid for such good food. i will definitely be back the next time i'm in vegas and this place does not disappoint!", 
            "this place is more 3.5 stars. like most yelpers wish i had the option to do 1/2 stars. anyway the spouse and i went for brunch when we were in vegas and staying at ceasars. we were seated immediately which was nice but about 6 inches from the table next to us which was dumb. the servers were attentive (a welcome change from the servers at gordon ramseys nearby pub). i got the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> with potatoes. it was ok. my husband got the breakfast quesadilla which was also good. nothing amazing for either of us and a bit pricey at around $17 a pop. the best thing about this place was the bread basket filled with amazing bread, muffins etc (some sweet, some savory and some spicy). i wish they offered their regular lunch menu on the weekends. i wasn't looking for brunch on a saturday but didn't realize no lunch menu until i'd already been seated.", 
            "i am a huge fan of bobby flay so i thought i would love this place. i went here for brunch and i was right, i loved it. in my group of 5 we all had the <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark> which was good. how can you go wrong right? \n\napps: goat cheese\"queso fundido\", <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark> (2), smoked salmon + di l l quesadilla, sweet potato soup. the goat cheese fundido was the best out of all the app choices, but all still good.\n\nentree:  <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark>, <mark>Ranch Style Eggs Tostada</mark>, <mark>Blue Corn Buttermilk Waffle</mark>, <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> (2). my favorite was the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark>, holy smokes, i can taste them now. everyone loved their entrees and demolished the food.\n\nbe sure to make a reservation for any meal you plan on eating here. oh and p.s. the bread basket is oh so good. you will be wanting more.", 
            "bacchanal line was too long! but this was a great back-up. you get served some complimentary carbs to start--coffee cakes, jalapeno bread, blue cornbread, etc. the fresh-squeezed <mark>Fresh Orange Juice</mark> was delightful. blue corn-crusted halibut was simple and great. clean taste with a bit of a kick. capers and grape tomatoes in the sauce. mmm... the boy ordered goat cheese and jalapeno <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> with honey ham. the ham was very juicy and soft.\n\nthe entire meal, all my bf and i could say is \"that's interesting.\" such an interesting mix of flavors all around, which i guess is expected of this kind of restaurant. the service was great. i think the brunch menu is rather simple, so in reality i'm giving 3.5 stars (rounding up because it was a pleasant meal all around) but i'd definitely like to try their lunch and/or dinner menu, which is probably more of an experience.", 
            "went for sunday brunch has <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>  they were the best the bread basket was delicious  blueberry coffee cake mini scones jalape\\u00f1o corn muffins and mini raisin scone  also had <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>  also the strip steak with <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> my favorite was the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> yum", 
            "this is the first time i have ever dined in a bobby flay restaurant and went there with a party of 8 for brunch.  sum it up in 1 word:  incredible.\n\ni ordered the <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark>, perfection.  probably the best <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark> i have ever had, it was perfect and not overpowering.  \n\ni ordered the goat cheese queso fundido.  the queso fundido was so good, but i did notice the chips were stale, not crunchy at all, so that was a bit disappointing.  i was going to mention it, but the other people at my table devoured the queso fundido without the chips, so i just left it as is.  we also ordered the burrata and grilled radiccho and that was perfect.\n\nfor entrees the table had different ones so we could all taste.  i ordered the blue corn crusted halibut and it was so delicate and the flavors were so wonderful, i loved it.  i also tasted the <mark>Ranch Style Eggs Tostada</mark> and <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> which were also delish with the cheesy grits.\n\ni asked the waiter to help me select a dessert and he suggested the sticky toffee pudding, which i was not too convinced.  he said i would not be disappointed and he was right.  it was the crowned jewel of my meal.  it was so perfect and amazing.\n\nall in all a fantastic meal.  bravo.  i have been a fan of bobby flay since that food network show he had where he cooked for a group of friends and he had a female side kick, this was maybe about 20 years ago.  i waited a long time to eat at one of his restaurants and it did not disappoint.  it was really and incredible experience.", 
            "i recently had brunch at mesa grill, with three girlfriends (four moms with college age kids).  we had a reservation for 11:30 and arrived a bit early, no problem we were seated early at a lovely table.  now, we knew the food was going to be great...but what struck me most was the attention to detail and the impeccable service.   for example, one of my friends does not like ice in her water, the server noticed and every time her glass was refilled they used a pitcher of water with no ice.  we all shared the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> as an appetizer, we were each brought a nice plate and after we finished, we all received clean silverware.  another item, some of the party sitting next to us were wearing black pants and the server switched out their white linen napkins for black ones.  now you may not think that is such a big deal until you get up from the table with white lint sticking to your black pants.\n\nas for the food, everything we ordered was perfectly prepared, flavorful and beautiful.  the shrimp,tamale is not to be missed, the shrimp was perfectly cooked, moist with a nice snap to it.  i had the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> served with apricot glazed ham.  the eggs were fluffy, the goat cheese tart and let's not even talk about how good the ham was.\n\ni was impressed both with the quality of the food and the quality of the service.  my view is that you can have a great meal, but if the service is sub par, the entire dining experience is diminished.  but if get the combo of great food and great service,you have the recipe for a meal to be remembered for a very long tome.", 
            "as big fans of bobby flay, mesa grill has been on our food bucket list forever. and his food did not disappoint!\n\nmargaritas - i can understand why mesa grill is famous for these. we tried the classic margarita and the cactus pear margarita. the classic was delicious with a good balance of flavors. the cactus pear was sweeter and while it started well, i was over the sweetness by the end.\n\nblue corn lobster tacos - talk about a flavor explosion... these were amazing! definitely try these.\n\ngrilled lamb porterhouse chops - tender, succulent lamb chops that were grilled to perfection. the mint chimichurri sauce was delicious. it came with a plantain tamale which sounded better than it tasted (again, my aversion to things too sweet).\n\n22oz bone-in rib-eye - big, bold, yummy...\n\nroasted brussels sprouts - i know, i know, it's just brussels sprouts. but you haven't had these brussels sprouts. you must get these.\n\nfor dessert we had the churros dusted with cinnamon sugar and star anise. the star anise was subtle and gave the churros an interesting scent and flavor. it was served with a dark chocolate and a coconut dulce de leche dipping sauce, the latter of which we could have licked out of the bowl. a great way to end the night.\n\nas for dinner service, it left a little to be desired. technically everything was executed fine. it's the little details like, the tables that flanked us were seated after us and offered dark napkins due to the customer's dark clothing. my husband and i were also in dark clothing but were not offered dark napkins, so i fussed with white lint on my black shirt the rest of the evening. and the server was effusive in his recommendations and menu explanations to both tables flanking us but didn't offer anything to us. it was weird and an example of how much better everything could have been.\n\nmotivated by the exceptional food, we came back for brunch and had the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> - perfect balance of spice, creaminess, sweet, salty, tangy. the service was great this time and it was an awesome way to start the day.", 
            "not a bad brunch. the <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark> was tasty and quite refreshing. the goat cheese queso fundido was amazing! my wife can't take a lot of spice, so we got the blistered serrano vinaigrette on the side, which proved to be a wise call, though it was tasty. \n\nthe main dishes just weren't quite as successful, though. my wife got the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> chilaqules which were supposed to have a tomatillo sauce. i make my own tomatillo sauce all the time, and this wasn't one. it was made from hatch chilies or something similar. she didn't really enjoy it. \n\ni got the <mark>Green Chile Cheeseburger</mark> and wasn't terribly impressed. it was just too heavy and was in desperate need of acid or something to brighten it up. the fries, however, were delicious and well seasoned. \n\ni'm sure some other main dishes might be more successful, but the apps, teas, and fries were world class.", 
            "made a reservation for brunch on a girl's trip to vegas and was very excited to see what mr. flay had to offer. grabbed a drink at the bar while we waited for the rest of our party. <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark> was good but simple and average, i think my expectations may have been a little high on that one. i also had the house margarita which was below average at best - it was so forward on triple sec i couldn't even finish it.\n\nwe sit down, waiter comes, he was very nice throughout. we order and i tell him i would like the chilaquiles but not with <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark>. he tells me that i can't change the eggs in that dish or any other dish on the menu in fact. since poached eggs are pretty much the kings of brunch, i was a bit surprised by this. he went on to explain that the dishes are prepared and put together specifically and changing the eggs would change the dish so they don't do it. show of hands - who actually prefers <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark>? people who are scared of runny yolks, sure, but people who actually enjoy eating eggs - i would venture a guess never order them scrambled.\n\nso i order the steak and eggs because it is the only way i can get none <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark>. my friends order as well, a bread basket is brought and it is as delicious as everyone said. then the waiting begins.\n\nwe waited at least 25 minutes for our food. we waited so long that one in our party had to leave early to go to the airport. they gave us a small percentage off for the waiting. \n\nall in all the food was just average. my eggs were luke warm by the time we got our food and although the steak was good overall it wasn't anything special. nothing that anyone got was really stood out.\n\nmaybe the limited, inflexible brunch menu hindered our experience but overall between that and the long wait for a restaurant that wasn't even full my experience at mesa grill fell far short of my high expectations.", 
            "first of i do know bobby flay does not chef/cook here. however, i had the pleasure of eating here recently and have to say it was excellent from finish to start. we came for weekend brunch and found the service, food quality and ambiance to be great. the appetizer of tuna nachos consisted of really good quality fish and was robust in flavor. the bread basket ( complimentary) was amazing from scones to cornbread. have never been to a restaurant with such an amazing bread basket. add to that the final courses of <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> & <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> with biscuits and the restaurant hit a home run. margaritas were also tasty and unique ( pear cactus marg?! wow!)....lastly service was great with staff who followed up consistently and were friendly. highly recommend for anyone coming to vegas!", 
            "yeay for putting a twist on mexican/southern food. \nand for not having long lines and instant seating.\nand having mango-<mark>Carrot / Mango Juice</mark> on your menu, bobby flay.\n\nwe originally intended to have breakfast at the buffet at caesar's palace. but none of us wanted to wait for 45 mins to be able to eat. and definitely not when we were hungover.\n\ninstant seating meant we could order coffee and juices pronto.\nthe coffee was decent. and with multiple refills.\nthe mango-<mark>Carrot / Mango Juice</mark> cured my hangover. and my friend & i loved it so much, we ended up ordering 2 servings each!\n\nour server was very sweet. answered any question we had. and placed our orders pretty quick. the bread basket was very delicious. an eclectic blend of savory & sweet. the corn bread was yummaaaaaaay. and the chocolate brownie was melt-in-your-mouth yummy.\nbetween the 4 of us, we sampled a few dishes on their brunch menu:\n\ngoat cheese \"fundido\" - while the dish does contain goat cheese, there's a strong flavor of other cheeses as well. manchego being prominent. the corn chips that come with are fresh too. beware, the dish is very rich, just as any other dish at mesa.\n\nspicy chicken w/ <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> - this is an offshoot of your eggs benedict. it's literally eggs benedict on top of a very uniquely made <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> brown. very well presented. and equally tasty.\n\n<mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> - this one had no chance. the husband inhaled it. \n\n<mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> chilaquiles - this is a very rich dish with creme fraiche. i couldn't finish it and neither could my girl friend. it probably is the best in town. the potatoes that come with are so yummy. get those, skip the grits.\n\nnow, if you have cholesterol issues or are trying to lose a few lbs, mesa is not the place for you. while the food is tasty, it's also very buttery/cheesy/oily. you might end up with heartburn, and give them one star less in the process.\n\nservice was nice and on top of their job. price was reasonable given that it's las vegas & bobby flay's place.\n\ni'll go back... maybe after i drop a few lbs...", 
            "we were told that we should give this place a shot for brunch upon our arrival at caesar's palace so we did.  we were very interested in the twist it had in breakfast/brunch foods so we were sat down and given a chance to look through the menu and they had some different items.  i even took a chance to look at yelp to see what some of these inventions were.  we ended up ordering the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> and the <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>.  both were really good and we enjoyed our meals. would recommend.", 
            "i \"liked\" the food... not \"loved,\" like i was expecting since its bobby flay, but the food seemed pretty standard for the upscale mexican/southwestern restaurants you see out there.  i got the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark>... it was good, but i think i could get that at a lot of similar brunch places.  the <mark>Blue Corn Buttermilk Waffle</mark> my sister got was unique and i think she enjoyed it.  our table left happy, but i think we would try another brunch place next time... somewhere that would exceed our expectations instead of just barely meeting them.",

            "as the previous person posted, what more can really be said about this restaurant. i just came back from vegas this morning and a truly truly horrible experience.  i only went out there for a concert and the concert and this restaurant were the best parts of my trip.  i went in here accidentally, meaning, i had no clue it was bobby flay's restaurant. i was hungry and caesars palace was a across from where i was staying and all the restaurants in my hotel were packed and had lines, i walked right in with no waiting. (i will assume now that since its bobby's place this place can get crowded so i feel the need to note this was a sunday about 11:45am) once inside caesars palace, i went to the first restaurant i saw, which was this one.  i realized mid-meal it was his restaurant when the waiter at the table next to me was explaining to the recently seated couple that \"mr flay likes a little spice so beware all of our dishes have a little kick\" (they were an older couple). i know i'm slow after he said that, that's when i realized why they had his cookbooks in the front. :)  (but like i said had a horrible trip so i wasn't even looking for things like this) anyway onto the food.\n\nfood: fantastic.  i went on sunday and i got the eggs and <mark>Eggs  Aged Striploin Tortilla</mark> (fancy name for steak and eggs) and  it was yummy.  it came with all this spices of sorts (well they werent spices). i am not really sure how to describe it, more like the consistency of salsa's but they werent salsa's, at any rate it was really good mix with the eggs.  i had a side of <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark> which were a little burnt but oh well.  the steak was very good, very flavored, moist and tender. overall very good. had a cappuccino too, also very good. i wish i had tried the crabcake's but i knew i wasnt going to eat all that. waiters were awesome, just the right amount of attentiveness. (i personally hate when waiters/waitresses, come back every 5 minutes, is everything ok is everything ok...sheesh can i enjoy my meal?) \n\nanyway like i said, i had a horrible experience in vegas and this and the concert i went to see were the best parts about my trip, very glad i blessed up on this place.\n\np.s.  take notice, i have never eaten in a celebrity chef's restaurant and noticed that there were no salt and pepper shakers on any table.  ha just a fun tidbit, i thought that was funny and very interesting, almost as if the chef is subtly saying \"you will not mess up my dish with your spices\"", 
            "i've been watching bobby flay for years (ever since his horrific overall clad days on grillin' and chillin' on the old school food network) so it was about time for me to try his food.  bobby toes a fine line for me between being a cocky jerk and being 100% awesome, but i was excited to try his food nonetheless.  \n\nwe went for a boozy brunch on saturday morning and i thought it was a quality (if not slightly expensive) pick.  i had just finished scarfing down an almond croissant in the hotel room so i opted to go slightly lighter on the brunch ordering with the famed shrimp and <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>.  while it was good, i was a little disappointed that it wasn't packing more flavor.  i know that the description didn't scream spicy, but it's a bobby flay restaurant - i guess i was expecting a kick somewhere.  the tamale was among the best i've had, though i wished the shrimp would have been grilled instead of poached or whatever they were - i think that would have really bolstered the flavor profile a bit and may have made me not miss the spice.    \n\ntwo of my galpals split the eggs and <mark>Eggs  Aged Striploin Tortilla</mark> - that was out of this world.  luckily for me, my friends like to share.  the steak was perfectly cooked medium rare and i loved the combo with the grilled peppers and onions.  don't miss this one.  \n\neveryone else had the cactus pear margarita and i ordered the <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark>.  while it was spicy enough for my liking, it wasn't my favorite <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark>.  it was mostly spice and not enough tomato flavor.  the margaritas were awesome though - i had orderer's remorse with that one.  \n\ntruth be told, this review is probably closer to 3.5 stars than 4 stars but i'm giving bobby the benefit of the doubt here.", 
            "let's just say we had high expectations and were seriously let down. i've heard the dinner there is great but we decided to go on a sunday for lunch. unfortunately the menu posted at the door was very misleading. both a brunch and lunch menu were posted. so we assumed both were being offered. since the lunch menu looked very appetizing we decided to stay and enjoy. \n\nhowever, once we were sat it was revealed to us that mesa grill was only serving brunch (it was 2:00 pm) and would not offer us lunch. what?!?! no exceptions! since they would not budge on this rule we found it to be very rude. especially since we were willing to pay. needless to say we were very disappointed, 3:00 pm was only 40 minutes away for them to serve lunch. \n\nthe only good thing out of the meal were the margarita peach and pear cactus drinks and goat cheese queso fundido dip (though the chips were very stale). on top of everything else i selected the blue corn crusted halibut only to be told later that they were totally out of the fish. they must have had a slamming breakfast to be totally out. i ended up ordering the eggs + <mark>Eggs  Aged Striploin Tortilla</mark>, thinking it would be just as good. i was wrong, the order came out very cold with very little taste. i couldn't hardly eat 1/2 of my dish and honestly the only plate that was halfway appetizing out of the 3 of us at our table was the <mark>Barbecued Lamb Cobb Salad</mark>, which you could barely screw up since it was a salad.\n\ni must say bobby flay - if this was my restaurant i would pay special attention to menu times being offered for lunch & brunch as well as food being offered on the menu versus what's being delivered out of the kitchen. the chefs were not on their \"a\" game and the food was not what we expected. honestly i would have had better quality at the breakfast buffet at the casino."

            ":o)!!!!\n\nbobby flay.... you son of a bitch...... here i am, thinking that you're some asshole that's famous based on your looks and cockiness.  boy was i wrong.  you made me eat my words and boy were those words delicious!\n\nladies and gentleman.... this man knows how to cook!  i walked in here thinking that it was all hype, but the four of us were highly impressed with all our dishes and bread basket.\n\nthe food:\nbread basket - there was a good mixture of sweet and savory breads.  i should have taken notes but some of the stand outs were the coffee cake, corn bread, and what we named the jalapeno cheese \"popper\", so basically all the breads they were offering.\n\ncrispy bacon + <mark>Crispy Bacon  Hash Brown Quesadilla</mark> (fried egg + spicy tomato salsa) - the cheese was nice and melty with the perfect crunch of bacon to go along with each bite.\n\nspicy chicken + <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> (poached eggs + green chile hollandaise) - i just about died tasting this dish.  the sweet potato was a nice twist that was added to a normally savory eggs benedict dish.  every bite i stole from my friend just made me melt with happiness.  so do yourself a favor and succumb to the understanding that this dish is highly recommended for a reason.\n\n<mark>Blue Corn Buttermilk Waffle</mark> (blackberry bourbon syrup + vanilla creme fraiche) - ohhhh my gosh!!!!!!  i love waffles, but my god... i love these waffles.  the vanilla creme......*drool*.... just about slapped me across the face.  one bite of this waffle made me bow down in shame and made me realize that bobby flay is the shit!  \n\n\nmark my words, i will be back to try out the dinner service and hopefully that meal will be amazing and leave the same lasting impression, if not, better one than my spectacular brunch.", 
            "mesa has been a regular visit for awhile on our annual guys trip.  something exciting about dining at the restaurant of an iron chef. i just drool at the dishes those guys put together on the show.  my fantasy job is to be a judge on that show.  \n\nfor brunch, their spicy egg dishes are perfect, especially with a <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark> - though we will also get the <mark>Blue Corn Buttermilk Waffle</mark> to share.  for dinner, the porterhouse is a fabulous cut of meat but way too much for a mere mortal to finish.  recommend sharing the beef and trying other dishes.  \n\nwhat i enjoy is also the ambiance/vibe.  amazing what a good designer can do w/ a piece of space right next to the sports book.", 
            "let me preface this review by saying i have been waiting to try this place out for awhile. i'm already a fan of bobby flay who seems to be on everything on food network nowadays. the stars and reviews built up my excitement...and then i heard from friends of friends that it sucked. i was a little scared that it really would suck and i'd curse bobby flay with every ounce of my being (like when i tried to come here on my last trip and they closed early to redo the floors).\n\nbetter half and i arrived here for brunch over memorial day weekend. we had our reservations about how much i'd like the place seeing as how i die if i lick a hot cheeto. lots of things say spicy this...spicy that..spicy everything. in my head, i tell myself to toughen up and just try it...then i wimped out and went with a <mark>Blue Corn Buttermilk Waffle</mark>. i ordered a <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark> along with it since i was a bit curious. boyfriend ordered <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> sans goat cheese. the waiter gave him a bit of grief over it..saying he would check with the chef if that was allowed..asking if he didn't like it or if he was allergic...yada yada. \n\nour plates came out and the waffle is the size of my face. actually, bigger. it comes with vanilla creme fraiche and blackberry bourbon syrup. i'm not a fan of blackberries but this was divine! all the flavors melded together wonderfully. it wasn't overly sweet and the waffle had a distinct flavor. i tried (and failed) to finish the whole thing but only ate 3/4s of it. they prepared the eggs to bf's liking, without cheese, and he said it was delicious! i looked over at his plate and it was quite green from the onions and pleeenty of jalapeno. i didn't even attempt a bite. the tea was quite refreshing. it had a light flavor that contrasts how bitter tea can get. no need for sweetener here.\n\noverall a pleasant experience. it didn't disappoint and i don't have to curse bobby flay every time i see him on food network. a nice change for brunch with its southwestern flare. it was definitely worth the wait!", 
            "had brunch at mesa when we arrived for this past memorial day weekend. all in all it was a good experience. i was a little disappointed with the food but i ordered the tuna nachos and it wasn't as fresh as i expected. i should of gone with the <mark>Blue Corn Buttermilk Waffle</mark> with bourbon maple syrup. it was my second choice but should have been my 1st. my fiance and friends all had the kobe burger and loved them. i will say that i did have one of the best margaritas ever and i forgot what it was called. it was awesome though. i would go back just for it.", 
            "this place is really good! i went there there for brunch. i had a carrot and <mark>Carrot / Mango Juice</mark> which was really good. i also had the <mark>Blue Corn Buttermilk Waffle</mark> which was different but good... it was sweet. <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark> were okay, a little chewy/hard. another side they had was grits, i don't even like grits and i thought they were good.", 
            "bobby flay really knows how to do some great stuff with corn!  no sooner had we landed in the firey furnace of hell (aka vegas) then we dashed into caesar's and were promptly seated at a spacious table at the mesa grill.  the complimentary bread basket is like your own private bakery chock full of muffins and rolls and bread sticks and bread...made of different textures and colors of corn and whole grains. i loved the blue corn muffins so much that i ate my husband's and my brothers-in-law's and was tempted to creep my fingers over to the next table and swipe theirs too!\n\nmy husband ordered <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark> which arrived with a tiny glass decanter of simple syrup with which to sweeten it--but don't think they limited your selection to the simple syrup---they also offered all sorts of natural sugars and artificial sweeteners!  i go to nice places on occasion but i can't think of the last time i was so impressed with small details!   i felt like some kind of hillbilly!\n\ni ordered the fresh fish of the day which was tasty although i don't really remember it as much as the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> my husband ordered.  i can hardly wait to go back to vegas to have another one of those for myself!  one of my brothers-in-law ordered the <mark>Blue Corn Buttermilk Waffle</mark> with blackberry bourbon syrup and vanilla creme fraiche.  i have to say that it was delicious, but it was fourteen dollars, and compared to the other entrees we had at our table with meat and fresh seafood was comparatively priced--therefore overpriced.  i mean a waffle.  for fourteen bucks.  my other brother-in-law ordered the chilaquiles.  which were also very flavorful and complex.  \n\ni had never had blue corn before so i bought some bob's red mill blue cornmeal on amazon and have begun to experiment.  not quite ready for a bobby flay throwdown, however.", 
            "whenever i'm in vegas i just have to say that there are few times i'm able to wake up early enough to go anywhere for breakfast or lunch, especially on a sunday. but i will make an exception for this restaurant. hopefully that speaks volumes. \n\nthis restaurant (owned by bobby flay) is located on the casino floor of caesar's palace. it's easy to miss unless you're really looking for it. i feel like this restaurant is underrated and can be easily overshadowed by the many restaurants that caesar's palace offers. \n\none of the main reasons why i come here is the breakfast/brunch menu. i seriously cannot get enough of their smoked salmon and dill quesadilla. it has the perfect amount of smoked salmon and cheese and the creme fraiche is delicious. their tiger shrimp and <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> is fantastic as well as their wild striped bass and <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark>. i would definitely like to try the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> chilaquiles (a somewhat new discovery from my mexican friends) and the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark>. as if you couldn't already tell i'm a sucker for spicy foods...as well as smoked salmon. i was also told that the <mark>Blue Corn Buttermilk Waffle</mark> is to die for as well. \n\ni honestly haven't had anything that doesn't taste good at this restaurant. the service is prompt and attentive, the drinks are great, and the food is fantastic. i haven't had a complaint yet. try this place out and you won't be disappointed! good job, bobby flay!", 
            "mesa grill\n\nmesa grill was day two on picky e.'s culinary tour. it was bobby flay all the way--there was a <mark>Blue Corn Buttermilk Waffle</mark>, a tamale, and plenty of cilantro everything on the menu (and if watch iron chef america, you know he always does a <mark>Blue Corn Buttermilk Waffle</mark>, a tamale, and his \"signature\" sauces). \n\ni have to say that i was sold--i would highly recommend mesa grill. i had the salad that is a riff on a caesar--it has a mexican soft and salty cheese instead of parmesan and has these absolutely wonderful riffs on croutons. in fact, the fake croutons are what made the dish for me. if i could have just had a big pile of those, i would have been a very happy camper. i would eat this salad at every meal if i had the chance.\n\nsince it was technically brunch, i had the spicy chicken and hash. it was okay, but not spectacular--the eggs were a little underdone for me and there was a lot of cilantro in the hash (too much in my mind). but, i tasted the steak and eggs that my lunch companion ordered and the steak was amazing. i only wished i had ordered that. so, learn from my mistakes: order the steak and eggs.\n\nthe breads that came with the meal where tasty--a corn/blueberry muffin, a cranberry/raisin scone, and a coffee cake; the scone was definitely the best.\n\norder the salad. order the steak. thank me. and, remember, picky e never recommends a salad unless its unbelievably good.", 
            "my friend and i decided to come here because another restaurant we couldn't enter because we were not 21 and for the fact that its bobby flay's restaurant. thank goodness we came here because it was awesome! we came here for brunch and the staff all greeted us with warm smiles and immediately we were seated. we came in around brunch time so we had the brunch menu. i ordered the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> and my friend ordered the <mark>Blue Corn Buttermilk Waffle</mark> but before all this came an assortment of bread. all of the breads were warm, soft, and delicious! both entrees  were outstanding. the ham egg and biscuits in the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> were phenomenal and the waffle was crisp on the outside and chewy on the inside, and the portions and prices were extremely good. the waiters and waitresses were also awesome and always refilled water and bread without us asking. it was definitely worth the 40 dollars we paid for such good food. i will definitely be back the next time i'm in vegas and this place does not disappoint!", 
            "i am a huge fan of bobby flay so i thought i would love this place. i went here for brunch and i was right, i loved it. in my group of 5 we all had the <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark> which was good. how can you go wrong right? \n\napps: goat cheese\"queso fundido\", <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark> (2), smoked salmon + di l l quesadilla, sweet potato soup. the goat cheese fundido was the best out of all the app choices, but all still good.\n\nentree:  <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark>, <mark>Ranch Style Eggs Tostada</mark>, <mark>Blue Corn Buttermilk Waffle</mark>, <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> (2). my favorite was the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark>, holy smokes, i can taste them now. everyone loved their entrees and demolished the food.\n\nbe sure to make a reservation for any meal you plan on eating here. oh and p.s. the bread basket is oh so good. you will be wanting more.", 
            "we had the shrimp tacos and the <mark>Blue Corn Buttermilk Waffle</mark> with bbq duck. the duck is without a doubt one of the best duck dishes i have ever had, the meat was so tender and the bbq sauce was superb, shrimp tacos were ok and the sauces for the tacos excellent+ try the habanero and the green sauce", 
            "went for brunch and got the <mark>Blue Corn Buttermilk Waffle</mark> with the <mark>Spicy Mango - Glazed Bacon</mark>...yum! great wait staff, nice mellow atmosphere and good food!", 
            "i love you bobby flay!\n\nnever had brunch this sexy and sophisticated! what a great place to dine when you don't want to wait for hours to get inside the bacchanal buffet or if you're simply looking for a great restaurant in vegas.\n\nlove the american southwest inspired interior. it's bright and colorful, but not obnoxious and has a non intimidating fine dining feel. food was amazing and very memorable. we came on a saturday brunch, and they serve traditional american brunch fare with a south-western twist. \n\nwe had\n-complimentary pastries -blue corn bread, mini jalapeno biscuits, coffee cake with butter on the side. everything was yummy!\n-<mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> $18- everyone's fav so i had to get it. 4 pieces of tiger shrimp on a bed of housemade tamale with roasted garlic cream sauce on top. it was was mix of a bit sweet from the tamale and savory from the shrimp and garlic sauce. amazing. get it! \n-<mark>Blue Corn Buttermilk Waffle</mark> $14 - crispy on the outside, light and soft on the inside. the bluecorn gave it a nutty flavor to the waffle. it's different and i liked it. it also had had enough black berry syrup that's not too sweet and the creme fraiche on top to cuts the sweetness. so good!\n<mark>Spicy Mango - Glazed Bacon</mark> $4.50- recommended by our server. 2 thick strip of their house cured bacon with mango glaze on top. wow! never thought of mango with bacon and it's delicious! \n-<mark>Mesa Burger</mark> $18- perfectly cooked beef patty, double cheddar and grille onion. so simple yet delicious. it came with <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark> (french fries with chili powder) and horseradish mustard dip. get it!\n\nservice was great. our server was very nice and attentive. the table next to us was actually very rude to our server, but he remained professional and killed them with kindness. i also asked if bobby ever comes to visit and he said about 3x a year since he is a very busy man.", 
            "i \"liked\" the food... not \"loved,\" like i was expecting since its bobby flay, but the food seemed pretty standard for the upscale mexican/southwestern restaurants you see out there.  i got the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark>... it was good, but i think i could get that at a lot of similar brunch places.  the <mark>Blue Corn Buttermilk Waffle</mark> my sister got was unique and i think she enjoyed it.  our table left happy, but i think we would try another brunch place next time... somewhere that would exceed our expectations instead of just barely meeting them.", 
            "i needed to visit mesa grill again after eating dinner here last year. this time i brought my girlfriend and we decided to try mesa grill for brunch. wow! the food, service and selections were great. there are about 6 brunch appetizers and 12-15 entrees available with a couple menu items not on the menu that the server will tell you about. \n\nwe ordered the cactus infused <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark> to drink (non-alcoholic). i ordered the spicy chicken with <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> and southwest potatoes. this dish is spicy but not overly spicy and has a great hollandaise sauce made with green chiles over poached eggs! 10/10 \n\nmy girlfriend ordered the <mark>Blue Corn Buttermilk Waffle</mark> with creme fraiche and blackberry sauce. she also ordered a side of their <mark>Spicy Mango - Glazed Bacon</mark>. she loved both of these and i had to try them as well :) the waffle was light, crisp and sweet and the bacon was crispy and thick. 10/10 \n\nmy dish was $18, the waffle was $14 and side of bacon was $5. the meal was about $48 with the drinks and tax not including tip. another great dining experience at mesa grill - great job mr. flay, your restaurant did not disappoint. i'm a huge fan of bobby's cooking style and find him to be a great food personality. try this restaurant for great service and top quality food at caesars.", 
            "wife and i ate here last saturday for brunch around 11am. no waiting.\nvery spacious place with tons of seating, but sectioned off to not feel as big. more of a cozy feel....for vegas. \n\nservice was attentive, but not intrusive, just right. water always filled. no long wait for ordering, service, cleaning, or bill. \n\nbread basket was full of very moist and warm biscuits, muffins, bread. the jalapeno muffins were a perfect little mouthful!\nwe had the queso fundido which was delicious, cheesy, velvety. a nice start.\n\n<mark>Blue Corn Buttermilk Waffle</mark> was flavorful, warm, with a crispy exterior. bourbon sauce was good. i usually ask for maple syrup. but this waffle and sauce was so sweet none was needed.\n\n<mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> were cooked well with a nice flavor profile, but not near spicy enough to have \"spicy\" in the name. change the name and it is a 9. but i expected more spice from a sw type cooking.\n\na tip i would give is to put a hot margarita on the menu. this is sw after all.\n\noverall we really liked mesa, and will be back again."

            "as food network fans, we wanted to check this place out. the set up of the restaurant is really well done. it's spacious and inviting. we were sat up at the top in the back of the restaurant where we could see everything which was very nice. ordered the tiger shrimp +<mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> as our appetizer. while it was incredibly good, it is small for the price. the entrees though... oh the entrees! i had the <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> (mouth watering delectible!), my husband had the coffee spice rubbed rotisserie filet mignon (he still talks about it and the sauce!) and my friend had the much loved new mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin (out of this world!) best part was since she was newly pregnant, i got the chance to eat what was left on her plate, yes, even after eating my entire meal! we finished off with dessert which i believe was a flourless chocolate cake. decadent!!! and i must add that the service was extraordinary. another friend was trying to mess with the waiter by asking him to bring him bottles of beer that had a specific date stamped on them and the server happily accomodated his insane requests! in between this craziness, he checked on us frequently and the plates were removed quickly & easily. i plan to always eat here whenever i'm in the area!", 
            "bobby flay is my dream chef. \nthat ginger snap can make anything and everything look so amazingly good. \ni love his tex-mex twist and wham bam thank you ma'am attitude. he makes everything look so easy -- yet, his creativity offers dishes you would never dare attempt to make! \nwe were in vegas last weekend and stopped by for lunch. \nthe decor is bright and colorful...the lighting is slightly dim providing an elegant vibe. \nthere was a bunch of us and we could not wait to savor a dish on the menu. \ni ordered the <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark>, jeff ordered pineapple glazed mahi-mahi (which was to die for!), liz ordered the most amazing and interesting dish; chilaquiles with eggs and tomatillo creme sauce. \noh my gawd! i have never had chilaquiles that good. \n\nthe bread they served was heavenly. jalapeno laced corn bread and tiny jalapeno bread bites. man!!! \n\ni also had a <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark>...\n\nmy meal was pretty damn good and i expected it to be pretty damn good. \n\nbig ups to bf! great restaurant, great food, great man.", 
            "i've been to mesa grill three or four times whenever i visit las vegas.  i really like their summer menu.  i loved their roasted corn soup, smoked chicken & black bean quesadilla, and the dish that has rabbit meat in it ( i forgot what it called).  i think that the <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> was just average.   so, if you have a chance to dine there, don't order the salmon dish.  \n\noverall, the ambiance is nice, the price is on a higher side, and the waiter is helpful and attentive.", 
            "i am not a big fan of tex mex food but mesa grill reflects the creativity in bobby flay which i guess, makes bobby flays food different from the norm.  i have to admit, even though im not a big fan of bobby flay himself, his use of big flavors and for some reason vibrant colors with his southwestern flare does indeed comfirm his bold and cocky style.  mesa grill did not dissapoint, but anyways, ill jus cut to the chase, this is what i tasted\n\ngoat cheese queso fundido- probably not so good if you dont like the taste of heavy nutty cheeses, very strong goat cheese flavor\nraw tuna nachos- famous dish, the mango and avocado sauce is a good combo\npork loin sandwhich- the ancho chile mayo is spicy, actually not so bad, pretty tasty, the arugula and chiabatta bread complements it well, its served cold but for some reason, i think it would taste better hot\n<mark>Mesa Burger</mark>- a decent burger, served with seasoned fries\nspicy chicken sweet potatoe hash- probably the best taste, sweet potatoes with eggs and hollandaise, did not taste as heavy as i thought, notbad\n<mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> and the new york strip- not great, not bad, nothing very special, or i guess wats special was the bbq sauces they use for the meats, didnt really ruin the flavors of the meats\nanother thing was i heard mesa is famous for their breads, i was lookin for to the famous corn bread, but it was dry and it was cold, it seemed like it always broke apart and didnt hold together well, but the little jalopeno biscuits were good\n\n3.5 stars", 
            "couldn't have asked for anything more from our experience at mesa grill - we went for a long, luxurious lunch and everything was great, from the food to the service to the atmosphere. \n\nthe service was friendly and helpful and the atmosphere was very cool and funky with a southwestern flair.  the food was just what we hoped for: bold flavors in the southwestern family with little \"wow\" touches.  celebrity chef restaurants get some flack since the standards are so high and everyone likes to poke holes in them, but i have to say that we had a fantastic meal. \n\nwe started with the smoked chicken and black bean quesadilla, which was the best quesadilla we've ever had (sorry reviewer jen y!).  the quesadilla itself is quite tasty with a great cheesy, smoky filling, but the toasted garlic creme fraiche was amazing.  even better were the little slivers of fried garlic.  they were crispy and awesome.  i'd love to have a bowlful of those - you'd have bad breath for about a month, but it would be worth it!\n\nfor our entrees, i had <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> and my wife had the yucatan chicken tacos.  the salmon was perfectly cooked with a wonderfully sweet-spicy-smoky glaze, and the sauces that came along with it were simply divine. one order of fried garlic chips and jalapeno  crema, please!  the yucatan chicken tacos were also delicious with a fantastic, with the roasted peanut barbecue sauce being a pleasant diversion from the usual barbecue sauce flavors.  \n\nfor dessert, i highly suggest the sampling plate so you don't have to make up your mind.  all three on the plate were excellent, but the warm chocolate cake was my favorite.",

            "i'm not a huge bobby flay fan but the combination of perusing the forum shops, hunger pangs, spago not being opened for lunch yet, and our 11:00am rum buzz made us take a chance on brunch at mesa grill.\n\ni can only describe the decor of this place as \"southwestern kitsch\" because of the festive colors, clear plastic wheelbarrows (yup), and wooden accents. it's an interesting setting, but not really my style. the menu was--surprise--southwest, but with hints of new flavors, such as the <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> with spicy black bean sauce or spicy chicken with <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>. vlad ordered the latter and i ordered the <mark>Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad</mark> (no goat cheese, vinaigrette on the side). \n\nafter taking our orders, the table bread arrived, which imo really was the highlight. the basket came with jalapeno cornbread, dried fruit scones, and blue corn muffins. . . rather than your average bread that looks and feels like it's been sitting out all day. vlad and i really enjoyed the blue corn muffins - they were both sweet and savory all in the same bite. while we waiting for our mains, i looked over at the table next to me only to see the most gigantic burger ever. the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> does not mess around! it looks like you literally have to dislocate your jaw in order to take one bite. luckily the lady who ordered it cut it in half and shared with her man. in retrospect, maybe i shouldn't have been closely observing these poor patrons like they were lab rats? whatevs, it's vegas. \n\nvlad was pleased with his dish, while mine was a bit bland. after taking out the goat cheese and vinaigrette, there really is nothing to that salad but chicken and spinach. actually, the chicken was atop a mini blue corn tortilla, but that's about it. i had to pull off the \"sixteen spice\" fat from each chicken strip, which i believe was intentionally included for \"flavor\". once the fat was taken off, they were just season-less chicken strips. i think the waiter felt sorry for my substituted dish and brought out 3 vinaigrettes for me to add variety. it helped a little. the green onion one was the best tasting.  \n\noverall, i'd come here again for the festive table bread but will definitely order something else. perhaps the roasted pumpkin soup with smoked chiles and pomegranate crema?", 
            "bobby flay...the hopes i had for mesa...what hopes indeed.  despite one of my friends disdain for bobby flay's personality as it appears on television, i was able to convince her and two others to join me for lunch at mesa by promising an incredible meal.  unfortunately mesa didn't deliver that incredible meal, so i failed to follow through with my promise.\n\npossibly the most disappointing was the bbq duck crepes.  on paper it sounds marvelous, but it actually tastes like an ar-b-q sandwich from arby's -- honestly indiscernible.  there were more failures however.  while glazing things with miso has recently become popular, mesa would not be a reason for this, as their miso<mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> was absolutely terrible.  it has an odor reminiscent of ammonia, and a flavor that nearly matched.\n\nwe continued with our gastronomical hopes of grandeur but were continuously let down.  some items were so forgettable, that i've actually forgotten all the different dishes we ate.  one dish in particular comes to mind as probably the second most disappointing of the meal; the sweet potato and duck hash.  appealing in name, but the final product does not deliver.  the texture of the sweet potato was closer to baby food than to that of a hash, and the duck's flavor was smothered by the remnants of sweet potato suffocating my taste buds.\n\noverpriced hype.\n\nbobby flay, i challenge you to a throwdown.", 
            "i took some of my visiting teenage cousins here yesterday. it was cute to see them in awe of the place. i guess even in illinois, they've heard of bobby flay. ;) they couldn't wait to text their friends back home that they were eating at his restaurant... and what do all three order? the double cheddar cheeseburger. god love them. \n\nsince it was a sunday, they served brunch. i was a little disappointed because i was hoping to order my favorite duck tamale with habenero sauce, but it wasn't meant to be. instead, i opted for the ancho-chili citrus <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> with black bean sauce over sauteed spinach. \n\nlet me tell you guys, when that entree was served... i felt like an judge on iron chef. i wanted to tell bobby that the salmon reminded me the mountains that surrounds vegas valley and the different, beautiful colors, lime green, hot orange, black and white swirls was a like a desert sunset painting. my first taste was like a dream...and soon that lovely painting on my plate was gone!", 
            "this is now my favorite restaurant in vegas!\n\nbeen here once a few years ago and loved the 16 spiced chicken then.  back last night and the food was just as awesome.....mesa grill gets it right!\n\nfor once, a restaurant where the portions are equal to the $35-$50 entree prices, but more importantly, the quality, flavor, and execution far surpasses it.  \n\nbrilliant:\n-bread/muffin basket.  says volumes about a restaurant when they put so  much care in their nibbles.  my fav of the 4 different bread types was the blue corn muffin.  dab of butter and you're done.\n<mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark>.  spiced and cooked to a perfect medium rare as requested.  served on top of a yummy black bean puree.\n-roasted corn.  a side order of corn niblets baked in a cheesy/creamy/spicy sauce.  not too heavy, but a great accompaniment.\n\nf-ing awesome:\n-chipotle glazed rib eye steak.  wow  wow  wow.  best steak preparation i've had in a long time if ever.  slightly charred and crispy on the outside and juicy and tender inside.  the glaze was not spicy at all, just light, smokey, and a tad sweet.  sooo worth the $48 bucks.  as good as the salmon was, i stopped short of finishing it just so that i could have more rib eye.\n\nservice was never under foot and timed well.  can't wait to come back!", 
            "this place is phenomenal. it was my favorite meal in my entire trip to vegas. its not cheap, but the food is well worth it. i ordered the pre-fixe menu with green pea and green chile soup, grilled scallops, and vanilla ice cream with protiferoles. my bf had the blue corn pancake and ancho chili<mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark>. amazing. everything was great. the serrano ham gave it a little kick, but even without it, its still delicious. the scallops were grilled and served on top of tortilla chips and guac. two scallops for the lunch portion. the blue corn pancake with duck was so good, with a little asian influence. the salmon was awesome. probably the best salmon we have ever had. great balance of savory and sweet. i'm not a huge fan of protiferoles because they taste so stale to me. the dessert is nothing to write home about. but who cares!! everything else makes up for it.\n\nthe atmosphere is fun and lively, but still able to maintain intimate atmosphere. the portions were perfect for lunch and we also ordered margaritas. i had a virgin white pear margarita and my bf ordered their organic margarita, which he said was good, but not great. service was excellent, except for one detail. maybe i'm spoiled, but in a restaurant like mesa grill, i expect the servers to always clean up your crumbs before each meal served. we made reservations for lunch, but from what i noticed, you don't need to. we did come on a weekday though.\n\ni'd love to come here again for dinner next time!", 
            "maybe i had too high of expectations since it is bobby flay's, but i have to say, i wasn't that impressed.  not even sure if we will ever go back.  we had the green pea and green chili soup, which was really good, but everything else was not remarkable.  we had the wild mushroom quesadilla, but that was no big deal.  my wife's quesadilla is way better.  i had the spicy tuna and salmon tartares.  without the sauce that was drizzled on the plate, there wasn't much taste to them.  it came with plantains, which was cool and the sauce wasn't bad.  \n\nfor entrees, my wife asked if the ancho chili<mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> was spicy.  the waiter said no and that the soup was spicier.  he had it backwards.  she said it was good, but wouldn't tell people to go here just to get it.  i had the new mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin at the suggestion of the waiter.  again, without the sauce, there wasn't really any taste.  the pork was tender though.  the bbq sauce it came with reminded me of everett and jones in oakland, but i like their sauce better.  \n\nservice was great though.  they were very attentive and did everything we asked.  one flaw is that when we called in, we weren't sure if there were going to be 2 or 4 of us.  we told the reservationist, which probably worked for the casino, and he said, just make it for 4, and call back and adjust it to 2 if things changed.  when we called back to let them know, they told us that we would have to move our reservations to an hour earlier or later since we changed the reservation.  huh?  i know that it isn't great for the restaurant, but we thought we were doing them a favor.  never had that problem before.  we should have showed up and played dumb when the other couple didn't show up.  \n\nanyway, wish our experience was better.", 
            "we went here on a friday night, and hands down was the best service i have ever had, anywhere. maybe it is because i am used to dining in far-less quality, digs, however the service was exceptional. three of us ladies out for the night. after some advice from our neighboring diners, we started with the queso fundido (or something like that) and i could not stop eating it. it was so delicious and it was the perfect thing to start with. i ordered the corn-meal chile relleno and my friends had the chicken and black bean quesadilla and the <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> (delicious, but a few bones :( as good as the main entrees were, and they were great, the side dishes were the main attraction. the roasted corn with chile and cotija cheese was literally the reason why i will come back. the chorizo tamale was to die for as well. since we were on a girls night, we also ordered the pinot noir which from the advice of our server, was a perfect accompaniment to our meal. \n\noverall, this restaurant lives up to its name, and i will not only return every time i am back in vegas, but i have recommended it to so many.  keep up the exceptional work.", 
            "went to mesa grill for a sunday brunch after a long weekend of partying... \n\nloved:\n-architecture and decor\n-tequila selection (chinako mmm)\n-margaritas\n-our service\n-the bread basket\n-our appetizers (smoked salmon and dill quesadilla *favorite*, goat cheese queso fundido)\n-my fiance's entree (<mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark>)\n\ndisliked:\n-my entree (aged-<mark>Eggs  Aged Striploin Tortilla</mark>)\n\nwe will be back to have dinner here next time we are in vegas.  the only thing that was less than stellar was my entree.  i think i chose the most basic item on the menu and was not impressed.  however, the drinks and appetizers alone would have been more than enough food and i was still very pleased with our meal!", 
            "i've been to mesa grill in caesars palace several times for dinner and i admit i'm clearly infatuated with bobby flay's style of cooking even if he is an ass.  the atmosphere is comfortable, the dress casual, and the place has been hopping every time i've been.  i definitely recommend making reservations a couple days in advance if you want to eat at a reasonable time, but if you don't, there is a bar in the waiting area where you can have a few tasty mesa grill margaritas.\n\nthe service was very good the times i've been and i think i found the best waitress i've ever had here.  not only was she very responsive and knowledgeable with the menu, she told us what was \"just alright\" and was genuinely friendly.  i'm talking about someone who will sit down next to you and engage you a bit, instead of just feigning interest and listlessly read through the specials.\n\nin short, the food here is a flavor explosion in your mouth.  for starters, i recommend the very rich goat cheese queso fundido and the flavorful yucatan chicken tacos even though the portion sizes are small for the price.  a selection of complimentary breads comes with the meal and they are quite unique.  use caution with the blue corn cake muffin, though, because it's very crumbly and likely to end up all over you if you aren't careful.  \n\nfor the entr\\u00e9e, i can't rave enough about the new mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin.  i've never had pork that cuts like butter and rests in the perfect amount of spicy goodness.  other contenders are the coffee rubbed filet mignon and the chipotle glazed rib-eye.  for side dishes, don't pass up the roasted corn or chorizo-goat cheese tamale.  salmon is usually my favorite dish, but the <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> was just alright.\n\nthe last time i was there i couldn't find the dessert i had the time before.  when i asked about it they told me that they had a new pastry chef.  i decided to try the pineapple buttermilk upside down cake from the new dessert menu and it was divine.  i don't need the menu anymore; this is an automatic order.\n\nso, why 4 stars instead of 5?  first, the reservations; when you call ahead you have to give them your credit card number so they can charge you $50 a head in the event that you don't show up without cancelling before 3pm the same day.  that seems ridiculous to me considering that they would have no problem filling the seats with walk ups.  second, the food is pricey for the quantity.  i know its vegas, but a little bigger portion for the appetizers wouldn't hurt them too much.  finally, if you come with a big party they stick you in a not so attractive back room on a large folding table covered with a cloth.  aside from being a bit tacky, it makes you feel isolated from the bustling atmosphere in the main dining room.  while none of these are show stoppers, it was enough to dock them a star.\n\ni'll be back to try the rest of the menu.", 
            "my brother really wanted to go here so a bunch of us went. we didn't make reservations in advance, so we walked up to see if we could get a table. the wait was about 45 minutes. that was pretty good considering it was a saturday night at caesar's palace. they have comfy couches in the waiting area btw.\n\nfinally it was our turn. we sat down in this pretty, modernly decorated restaurant. our waitress was really nice and attentive to our needs. i was in a fish mood so i ordered the <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark>. it honestly wasn't that good, but my cousins and brother got some awesome plates! the new mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin: awesome! and grilled lamb porterhouse chops: delicious! definitely try those. for dessert we shared the pineapple buttermilk upside cake. really good.  (see my pictures!)\n\ni wouldn't mind coming here again :) pricey but delicious.", 
            "the only word to describe this place= awesome. i thoroughly enjoyed my meal at mesa! we were there during restaurant week, and they had a $30 tasting menu that was out-of-this-world. the service was great too, the waitress explained everything about the dishes and made some wonderful recommendations. i ended up trying the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> to start, the <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> as my main dish, and they had the chef's choice dessert as blueberry profiteroles with fresh whipped cream. so good. i think the tamale was my favorite. the portions were huge too, definitely not what i expected (i figured they'd be small due to the price not being too high and the tasting menu moniker). those at our table who didn't get the tasting menu also enjoyed their meals. oh yeah, and if you go definitely get a margarita. i don't even normally like margaritas all that much, but theirs are awesome. i had their signature marg, the partida margarita, uses partida tequila (100% blue agave tequila), organic agave and fresh squeezed lime juice. this drink is totally worth the $16 price point. if i'm going to drink, it needs to be good. this was awesome. in short, go to mesa, enjoy a meal and definitely have a margarita. i tried a few sips of other varieties of the margs and they were all great too (though mine was the best!) highly recommended! wish there was one in san diego :)", 
            "bobby flay, you did me good. \n\ni was excited to try mesa grill and hoping to get a glimpse of bobby flay. i went with my bf, friend and her bf on a sunday for brunch. we walked in and were quickly greeted by two hostess with bright colored shirts and black suits on. the place was very colorful with one wall with a rainbow of agua de fresca jugs. we sat in the middle area, where the boys could still see the games going on on the other side of the glass wall in the sports bet area. our waiter was nice yet cocky like bobby flay, which almost rubbed me the wrong way. after a heavy night of drinking, i wasn't in the mood for any more alcohol, even though the bellini sounded good! i ordered the cactus pear ice tea ($4). the ice tea had a southern tea feel, slightly flowery. i believe it comes with some simple syrup that you could put in it, but i think it tastes better without it. \n\nbf: do you have any regular ice tea? \nwaiter: no \n=( \n\nwe were brought a basket of 4 different kinds of bread. jalapeno muffin, regular corn bread, jalapeno scone and coffee cake. the jalapeno muffin was a perfectly buttery, light, and flakey and had tiny bright green flakes of jalapenos so it had a kick of heat, but not too hot where it burned your mouth. the regular corn bread had specks of red and green chile flakes, and perfectly baked where it was still moist. the scone had a hint of sweet taste with some dried raisins and cranberries. the coffee cake wasn't too sweet, where you really needed to drink it with coffee. \n\nas per suggestion by the waiter, we ordered the appetizer crispy bacon + <mark>Crispy Bacon  Hash Brown Quesadilla</mark> with fried egg and spicy tomato salsa. this was so good. the tortilla tasted homemade, where it was light and fluffy and not chewy. the bacon gave it the saltyness and the hashbrown a slight crisp. all together with the fried egg and salsa on top... yum \n\n\nthe waiter suggested the <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> with spicy black bean sauce and roasted jalapeno crema as the perfect dish to display bobby flays style of balancing sweet and savory so i wanted to get it. i was instructed to make sure to eat the salmon with the white sauce. the salmon was perfectly cooked where it was flaky and just fell apart while still being moist. the sauces were so bright and the colors were vibrant. it had a nice fresh salsa on top. all together it was nice. i had expected a bit more of fire in bobby flays dish, but it was just enough that you could appreciate all the flavors. \n\n<mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> (green onion, jalapeno, goat cheese) apricot-mustard glazed ham+ buttermilk biscuits. wow! you'd think \"what, its just <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark>\" but the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> were delicious! i swear i love goat cheese. it was creamy and salty and hearty. the ham was sweet and salty and makes your mouth water. the biscuits were a bit spicy like it had a bunch of black pepper in it and buttery at the same time. great dish! \n\nyou could get a side of creamy grits or homestyle fries with the egg dishes. wow these grits were so freakin good. i think they had goat cheese in them as well. so creamy and tasty. \n\nmy friend and her bf both got the scrambled egg enchilada. they said it was good. \n\noverall i was very pleased with mesa grill. his dishes werent as spicy as i had expected, as hes always bringing in the heat, but everything had a nice balance of heat that you could still taste the flavors of the dishes. yeah bobby!", 
            "i was already scoping out places to eat at while at the san diego airport prior to our flight & remembered mesa grill.  i couldn't wait to get into vegas & go have lunch here.  ok, i thought, let's see what you got bobby flay....\n\nfirst of all, to my disappointment, only the brunch menu was available (at 1pm? really?).  ok, it's vegas i guess.  \n\nfirst they bring you a bread basket w/ a nice assortment...poppyseed blueberry muffin, cornbread w/ jalapeno, a crumbcake, etc.  great while you are waiting for your appetizers/entrees.\n\ni ordered the <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> with spicy black bean sauce and roasted jalapeno crema...this was really good.  the flavors came together really well.  \n\nthe bf had the cuban sandwich w/ adobo fries.  the fries were really good.  the sandwich was ok.\n\ni was basically disappointed b/c i expected better.  i would have preferred to come here for lunch or dinner...much more choices.  also pricey.  we were also warned that all of the dishes were \"spicy\" b/c that is bobby flay's style, but it wasn't spicy at all.  some spice would have been nice  :-)  i would give this place another try....for dinner.", 
            "i loved mesa grill. i am not a big fan of southwestern food, and a majority of the menu was stuff i wouldnt get, which was why i gave it 4 stars, and also because i was forced to choose from the brunch menu, even though i saw things on the lunch menu that i liked (we went on a sunday around noon) but i ended up getting a <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark>, which was amazing. very flavorful. my girlfriend got a <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> with some hollandaise sauce. she absolutely loved her dish, i did as well. the decor is pretty neat, with colored paneling around the restaurant. i would go here again absolutely.", 
            "there were so many delicious sounded options on the menu but thanks to  yelp i tried the new mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin  and it was seriously some of the best pork tenderloin i've ever had.  the portions are very pretty good for the price you pay.  i also got to tried my friends sixteen spiced crusted chicken and the <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> and the chicken was very juicy and tasty.  usually i avoid chicken dishes because i'm afraid they're dry, but this was very good.\n\nfor appetizers we had the tiger shrimp and <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> and the blue corn pancake with bbq'd duck (both recommended by our server).  i wish i could have another bite of the duck again, it was fantastic.  very juicy, and flavorful.\n\ncan't wait to go back and try more dishes!", 
            "every time i walked by mesa grill, i thought about trying it.  i finally made it here last sunday.  the restaurant is big and modern.  because it was sunday at 11:30am, we were told brunch was served.  \n\nthe brunch menu was kind of limited  (http://www.mesagrill.com/lasvegas/pdf/mesalvbrunch.01.08.10.pdf).  we decided on the following:\n\n1)  <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> with creamed corn (not on the above menu) - $16. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xzbupxdya0zttu3azqtqhg?select=bzdgak4kyiolojnnm9giia) this was quite good.  i'm not a fan of tamale but i enjoyed the creamed corn and the shrimps (total of 4!).  \n\n2)  <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> in spicy black bean sauce + roasted jalapeno crema - $22. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xzbupxdya0zttu3azqtqhg?select=zzxiymivp3o1osnjdf4hfg) i ordered it well done.  the salmon was very tender with good flavor.  however it must have sat on the counter for awhile b/c it was barely lukewarm!  \n\n3)  <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> grilled red onion, arugula ancho-chile mayonnaise + <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark> - $16. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xzbupxdya0zttu3azqtqhg?select=qq6qbo2cmswdd7l9owudaw) this was the biggest disappointment of the meal.  my fiance gave it 1 star.  enough said.  \n\nservice was spotty.  at first it was really good, but then it just went down hill.  like i said earlier, our food must have sat on the kitchen counter for awhile b/c my salmon was barely lukewarm and my fiance's sandwich (the pork tenderloin) was cold and hard!  our <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark> were getting refilled until we were done eating.  then they took the plates away and didn't bother asking if we would like another refill.  c'mon, even if we're done, we might still like some more ice tea!\n\ni thought the quality and service didn't measure up to my expectation and the prices.  3 stars is all it gets.", 
            "my boyfriend heard about this place and wanted to try it out. we made reservations for dinner, and i'm glad we did because the restaurant was packed when we arrived. \n\nfirst came out the bread and butter. there were three different kinds, one for the each of us, including jalapeno cheese bread, cornbread, and raisin bread. it was a nice change from the usual, plain bread options.\n\nfor our entrees, i ordered the <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> with roasted jalapeno crema, and my boyfriend had the new mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin with bourbon-ancho chile sauce and a sweet potato tamale. i asked for my salmon to be cooked medium well, and for the pork tenderloin, the server recommended having it cooked medium, and my boyfriend agreed. \n\ni'm not big on seafood, but the salmon was amazing! it was light and moist, and the accompanying sauces were delicious. i ate it up! my boyfriend enjoyed the pork tenderloin. i had a bite, and it was incredibly tender. the tamale with crushed pecan butter was a nice side dish, but it was a little dry. we also shared a side of roasted corn with grilled cactus, lime, and cotija cheese. it was very creamy, but it was tasty and enough for the both of us.\n\nwe took a look at the dessert menu, and we wanted to try a chocolate and fruit dessert, but we were told that they were out, so apparently, it's a popular one. i can't find it on the current online menu. none of the other dessert options appealed to us, and we were full, so we skipped it.\n\nservice was excellent. one of our servers accidentally dropped a piece of ice in our corn side dish, and before i realized what happened, he brought out another one for us at no extra charge. the atmosphere was nice, but the tables were a little too close together. prices are expensive, but i think it was worth it.", 
            "i've eaten here a few times now - mainly for brunch.\ni love the <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark>!!!   talk about a party in your mouth!  bobby does a great job at layering the different flavors into some amazing combination!  that's true artistry folks!!!\n\ni love the bread basket too!  i have to be careful to not fill up on the ample variety of goodies - its hard because they are all so tasty and they will glady bring you more.  \n\nthe service and quality has been very consistent.  thanks for not disappointing bobby!!!", 
            "my wife and i heard many good things about mesa grill, so we decided to give it a try.  we went in around noon for lunch on a thursday and the restaurant was pretty empty.  the waiter promptly told us the specials and asked if we know who bobby flay is.  it seems like they are trained to talk about the iron chef.\n\nwe ordered the shrimp + <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> for appetizer, <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark>, and green chile burger for entrees.\n\nsince bobby flay is known for his sauces, the tamale came with a very creamy garlic sauce that complements the entire dish.  for the salmon, it came with a light black bean, bbq, and honey sauce.  also, it is topped with fresh green salsa that refreshes the palate with every bite.  my wife stated that it was the best salmon she's ever had.  the green chile burger is also very interesting.  the sour component that usually comes from ketchup is replaced with green chile instead.  the patty is also very tasty and moist.\n\noverall, we really enjoy the food and the service at mesa grill.  we will definitely visit it again when we come back to las vegas.", 
            "i love watching food network and always enjoy bobby flay's shows.  but the food reviews here are so mixed, i was a bit hesitating to spend my money even for lunch at mesa grill in vegas.  my sister and i were too tired to find a better place, we decided to try our first bobby flay food.\n\nwe were there for sunday brunch around noon after christmas and we're seated right away.  our server was not bad but for some reason he had this weird energy and we didn't feel completely relaxed around him.  \n\nwe wanted to have their fruit juice but we're told they were all out.  all three juices (orange, grapefruit and carrot/orange)!  that surprised me because as a restaurant by a very well known chef at this very popular hotel, i would expect them to have a decent inventory skill.  we're very disappointed and ordered <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark> instead.  it wasn't bad but nothing special about it. \n\nthe warm bread basket had three different baked goodies.  the first one on top was almost like a soft chewy cookie with raisins and nuts.  i don't think it goes with any of their main dishes but as itself, it was very yummy and i wished i had that one after my lunch as a dessert.  i can't describe the second mini soft pretzel-ish thingy but i can say they were good.  and the bottom in the basket was a cornbread which was made with half yellow and half blue corn and had some corn, bell peppers and some chili pepper slices in it.  it was delicious.  our waiter just dropped the basket off on our table but at the end of our brunch, i saw a different waiter at other table was explaining what they were to his guests.  the ladies at our next table were chatting pretty loud so i couldn't hear a thing but wished our waiter did the same for us. \n\ni ordered their <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> and my sister ordered the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark>.  my salmon was very thick but cooked perfectly and was very moist.  the honey glaze and the black bean sauce were delicious and my sister loved her sandwich too.  i had a bite and the pork was very tender and although we both agreed the fries which came with the sandwich were little salty side, but still tasty.  was it cheap?  no, but whew, we didn't think we've wasted our money...\n\ni don't think we can afford their dinner anytime soon after spending too much money in vegas this time but we were very pleased with their brunch.", 
            "after thinking about the good food from mesa grill for a month, i finally had a chance to go back to las vegas.  needless to say, i opted for mesa grill again.  \n\nagain, we were there for lunch so we can avoid the crowd and the wait.  we were promptly seated and our waiter, john, even offered to snap a few pictures inside the kitchen for us.  that was really nice of him since we were very interested in what is like behind the scenes.\n\nmy wife ordered the <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> again and it was even better than the first time.  i went for the prix fixe menu items and ordered the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> and the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark>.   the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> is still my favor and the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> is very unique. \n\ntips:\n- for lunch, there's always the prix fixe menu.  you'll get to choose one of five appetizers and one of three entrees, plus dessert!  this will save you a bit of money.\n\n- the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> is meant to be a room temperature sandwich, so if you like hot sandwiches, this is not what you want to order.",

            "finally made it here after years of wanting to try out a place by a celebrity chef. the menu was smaller than expected, but diverse enough for my liking. \n\nmy typical process is to inform the waiter that this is my first visit and i would like to know what are the best/signature dishes. some times i get the typical, \"everything is great\" response. so i follow up with my next question, \"when my friends back home find out i went to mesa grill, what is the one dish they're going to ask, did you have the xxxx?\" with that in mind... we ordered the following\n\nappetizer:\ntiger shrimp with <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> \n\nentrees:\n<mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> \nnew mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin with sweet potato tamale\n\nsides:\nroasted corn with chipotle aioli\nmashed potatoes with green chili queso sauce\n\nall outstanding",

            "when i heard bobby flay owned this joint, i knew i had to try.... i watch iron chef religiously and i believe it caused my expectations to be alittle too high. \n\nbread basket: (yes, i consider this a course) disappointing. i like my bread warm and fresh from the oven. these offerings were too cold to enjoy. \n\nappetizers: got the <mark>Baby Romaine Salad</mark>, gala apple salad, and the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>. i could have skipped all these dishes and saved more room for dessert. the tamale was good, but the flavors didn't have me singing to the high heavens... and the salads left much to be desired. the <mark>Baby Romaine Salad</mark> lacked dressing and the croutons were way too soggy. the apple salad was mostly just chopped apple so it got too filling. \n\nmain course: definitely get the lamb chops or the <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark>. both were perfectly cooked and i licked my plates clean. delish!! however, skip the collard greens. they weren't worth the stomach room. but the table next to ours were raving about the brussels sprouts, so i wish i gave those a try. \n\ndessert: you can not leave the mesa grill without trying the sticky toffee pudding. when i took my first bite the clouds parted, angels were singing, and all the stars aligned. this dessert will go down in the books! yum, yum! \n\nbottom line: it was a good date night. more misses than hits for me. will i return? maybe if i'm craving some sticky toffee pudding.",

            "1st visit \npros:\n1: <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> - is nothing short of incredible. \n2: new mexican spiced rub pork tenderloin - the reviews are true, i'm not a pork fan but i would gladly order this again. they gave me a knife to cut it...i didn't need it. perfectly cooked. \n3: <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> - again, believe the reviews. it's as good as everyone says and the positive reviews are earned. \n4: brussel sprouts w/ roasted pecans: never had anything like it, loved it. \n5: toffee pudding - omg! definitely one order to share, it looks small but it packs a delicious punch. \n6: coconut cake - just writing this and thinking of it made me crave it again. \n7: service - once seated it reset my definition of how it's done.\n8: wine: we let the staff pick...they listened and their choices just sent our experience from good to over the top great. \n9: gala apple salad - don't let the goat cheese scare you away from this wonderful appetizer. \n\ncons: \ndecor: i expected so much better. the colored dots on the glass were stickers. the multicolored glass containers above the bar...looked like cheap plastic up close. \nattention to detail: chipped plates. seriously. in a restaurant like mesa this was unacceptable. \nservice: the staff at the front counter seemed a bit clueless and lost. complete opposite experience of the over the top service we had once we were seated. \nspace: looks like harrah's / caesar's palace is trying to extract maximum revenue per square foot with tables that are very tightly spaced. if anyone in your party is claustrophobic or more than average sized, this will not be a positive experience for them. \n<mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> - kind of a letdown, but fortunately the other menu items more than offset this slightly bland disappointment. \n\npricing: bring ben and make sure he's got a twin when you pay and tip appropriately. and we won't even discuss the tab if you really explore the bar. \nwould we go back? in a heartbeat. if i didn't have so many cons i'd give that 5th star, but 4 will have to suffice. \n\none other thing: caesars's valet parking was \"full\" but explaining we were late for our reservations and a generous tip took care of the parking. needless to say we tipped them again on the way out because they the valet staff took great care of us.", 
            "whenever i'm in vegas i just have to say that there are few times i'm able to wake up early enough to go anywhere for breakfast or lunch, especially on a sunday. but i will make an exception for this restaurant. hopefully that speaks volumes. \n\nthis restaurant (owned by bobby flay) is located on the casino floor of caesar's palace. it's easy to miss unless you're really looking for it. i feel like this restaurant is underrated and can be easily overshadowed by the many restaurants that caesar's palace offers. \n\none of the main reasons why i come here is the breakfast/brunch menu. i seriously cannot get enough of their smoked salmon and dill quesadilla. it has the perfect amount of smoked salmon and cheese and the creme fraiche is delicious. their tiger shrimp and <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> is fantastic as well as their wild striped bass and <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark>. i would definitely like to try the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> chilaquiles (a somewhat new discovery from my mexican friends) and the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark>. as if you couldn't already tell i'm a sucker for spicy foods...as well as smoked salmon. i was also told that the <mark>Blue Corn Buttermilk Waffle</mark> is to die for as well. \n\ni honestly haven't had anything that doesn't taste good at this restaurant. the service is prompt and attentive, the drinks are great, and the food is fantastic. i haven't had a complaint yet. try this place out and you won't be disappointed! good job, bobby flay!",

            "my husband and i went for lunch last week while we were on vacation. the food was amazing. he had the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> and spicy fries and i had the <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark>. we were both more than happy with our meals, and also the price as it was lunch. our server michael was extremely knowledgable and gave us recommendations and informed us to the chefs ideal temperatures for both of our meals. i was very jealous of tables around us with the goat cheese fundido which also looked incredible. i overheard michael explaining what was in it and he was very knowledgeable and helpful. i would definitely eat here again next time i'm in vegas, but next time i will get a margarita!", 
            "mesa honestly blew my expectations out of the water. usually celebrity chefs disappoint. not in the case of mr. flay and his great staff. service gets 5 stars. food was amazing. if you are there for lunch i highly recommend the shrimp tacos and the <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark>. thanks bobby and staff!", 
            "bobby flay's mesa grill is an fresh take on southwestern cuisine.  hand crafted margaritas are featured on the drink menu, and the dinner menu is built on a foundation of corn and chili spiced proteins.\n\nwe wanted something with tequila in it asap, and were happy with the margarita and basket of house bread and blue corn muffin that arrived.\n\nwe started with the blue corn lobster tacos. fresh, light, and delicate in texture, the two bite tacos were tasty though perhaps missing their lobster flavor.\n\nfor entrees we tried the ancho chili<mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> which i asked for medium-rare, and the new mexican spiced rubbed pork tenderloin, served medium, with sweet potato tamale.  the salmon was super tender and moist, but unexpectedly mild in flavored, we couldn't really taste the glaze.  the pork tenderloin was incredibly tender and juicy and we used the tamale to sop up the sauces.\n\nthe entrees come ala carte so you'll want to get some sides, we tried the roasted corn and collard greens.  the roasted corn is a superstar.  sweet summer corn is roasted, but still crunchy, creamy and spiced from the aioli, brightened with lime and cilantro, and sprinkled with salty, tangy cotija cheese.  the collared greens were pretty standard, but made us feel like we ate our vegetables.\n\noverall we liked mesa grill.  the food was well prepared and service was attentive and helpful.  this would be a great place to eat and drink with friends.", 
            "this was my first visit to a bobby flay restaurant and boy did i love it.  first off everyone was super friendly and had smiles on their faces.  i liked watching the chefs in action cooking our food that was like free entertainment.  i had the pumpkin soup sorry can't recall the exact name it was smokey and creamy.  the only thing i did not like about it was that it was kind of on the sweet side but that's just me and my palate. it looked beautiful and they didn't skimp either.  i loved loved loved the <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> it was cooked perfect nice and flaky.  my hubby had the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> and all he could say was wow this is really good.  we also tried the goat fundio which was the perfect balance of goat and another cheese.  goat cheese for me can be a bit overpowering so they got the balance just right. my one and only complaint was that our table was just too small to fit all our food and drinks. hehe i can't wait to go back and try other things.  i was looking at the table next to us and they ordered the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> those smelled delicious. yes my husband is embarrassed of me when i look at other people's food but i can't help it.",

            "first of i do know bobby flay does not chef/cook here. however, i had the pleasure of eating here recently and have to say it was excellent from finish to start. we came for weekend brunch and found the service, food quality and ambiance to be great. the appetizer of tuna nachos consisted of really good quality fish and was robust in flavor. the bread basket ( complimentary) was amazing from scones to cornbread. have never been to a restaurant with such an amazing bread basket. add to that the final courses of <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> & <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> with biscuits and the restaurant hit a home run. margaritas were also tasty and unique ( pear cactus marg?! wow!)....lastly service was great with staff who followed up consistently and were friendly. highly recommend for anyone coming to vegas!", 
            "this was my first time frequenting a bobby flay establishment, and i wasn't disappointed. the service was impeccable, it got the point where it was borderline creepy how on-point the entire waiting staff was. all i can say is, the nice guy charged with watching my water glass better get a raise asap because he redefined the term \"attentive.\" \n\ndue to several factors (okay fine, one factor: vegas taking more money than expected), i ended up dismissing the many delectable looking meat entrees and ordered the <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark>. and holy mother of food, was it sublime. \n\non a more minor note, the bread is also a gamechanger. it might not be the gaudiest or most hyped restaurant on the strip (or caesers for that matter), but mesa grill is a top-notch option for anyone looking for a quality fine dining experience.", 
            "sat at the bar on a sunday night. margarita was very good.  be sure to add grand marnier;) i wasn't too hungry so i just ordered the <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark>.   omg sooooooooo good. cooked perfectly medium rare and bursting with flavor.  i originally said no to the house bread basket but the couple next to be insisted i get it.  good advice.  its an assortment of different breads, but the one the stuck out the most to me was the blue corn muffin.\n\nall in all i was impressed. service was prompt and the price reasonable considering the name and location of this place.", 
            "i was in las vegas for a conference and brought two of my students to mesa grill for dinner. throughout dinner the wait staff were super - very attentive, prompt with our order, and helpful. service is very important and the waiters can make or break a restuarant - in our case they totally made our night enjoyable. \n\nnow moving to our meals. we ordered 2 <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> which were exquisite and i am a huge tamale fan so i know a good tamale when i taste it!!! i would definitely recommend the tamales. we also ordered as our main dishes - a tuna steak, the <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark>, and the spice rubbed pork tenderloin. each dish was prepared to perfection. i had the pork tenderloin and i would go back to mesa grill to have this again any day. it's easy to see why bobby flay is a celebrity chef and although he did not prepare the meal personally he has great chefs preparing meals for his guests.\n\ni know that some folks complain about the small portion sizes at a place like mesa grill, but all i have to say is, if you want a lot of food go to a place that has a buffet that's why they exist; however, i'll continue to go to mesa grill for a great meal experience.", 
            "me and my husband had dinner here at the time of opening, which was 5 pm. we arrived about 10 minutes early and had cocktails. i had a refreshing lime citrus martini while waiting and a couple minute prior to service, we were seated. \n\nfor appetizers, we ordered the delicious <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> which had a beautiful balance of flavored. for dinner i had the <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> that was delicious but i have had salmon taste a bite better than what i had. there was not enough seasoning and the salmon was slightly over cooked. \n\nmy husband had the grilled porterhouse lamb chops which he absolutely could not hush about. he just had so many good things to say about it from the sauce to the accompaniment dish of plantain tamale. he had said that if he were to visit again, this would be the meal on his mind without hesitation. \n\nwe finished off with the crushed blueberry line tart which was a little to tart for my taste. i like subtle and balanced flavors so probably would have enjoyed it with maybe a bit of coconut milk. :)", 
            "my friend and her younger sis wanted to go to bacchanal. they were at capacity and one of the hostesses told the group ahead of us that they were not taking any more people. did we just get rejected at the buffet? lol. truth be told, i was a bit relieved since i didn't want to eat at a buffet that night. since we were already at caesar's palace and we had plans to go to xs that night, we ended up at mesa grill. we got seated immediately by the nice, smiling hostess. i'm surprised they let me in because i looked like a bum that day with my jean shorts and bright tank top.\n\nwe started off with an assortment of bread-jalapeno, jalapeno corn muffin, a nutty bread, and sourdough? i didn't taste all the bread so my bread descriptions suck. of course, i need an adult beverage so i ordered duvel, a golden ale. i love my belgian beers! it was restaurant week at the time so my friend and her sis ordered something from the rw menu. nothing really caught my eye on the rw menu so i decided to get the <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> (cooked medium). we shared the tuna nachos with mango, habanero hot sauce, & avocado crema for an appetizer. wow, get the tuna nachos!\n\nmy friend and her sister ordered the <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark>, grilled berkshire pork porterhouse chop, sixteen spiced chicken, tres leches cake, and the salted caramel chocolate pudding. my salmon was cooked perfectly with the slight crispiness and flakiness on the outside and slightly under cooked and tender in the middle. it's exactly the way i prefer my salmon. the bold southwestern flavor combination had a slight kick and all the flavors of black beans, tomatillos, and roasted jalapeno crema blended well together. not only did it taste amazing, the bold, vibrant colors were so pretty to look at. i had a bite of everything. every single thing was delicious! to end the meal, the salted caramel chocolate pudding put a smile on my face. it was so decadent and not overly sweet. i wanted to lick the bowl but that wouldn't look right in public so i didn't. \n\nour server joel was professional, friendly, courteous, and even noticed my friend spilled some sticky sugar water on her purse and wiped if off for her. we all didn't notice. i didn't pay too much attention to the decor. it just looks like any fancy restaurant on the strip. i did notice most people were dressed so i felt slightly uncomfortable there with my casual attire. if i had known i was coming here, i would have dressed up!\n\nmesa grill is a prime example of what a celebrity chef's restaurant on the strip should be - world class service from all employees as well as a fancy, clean atmosphere to enjoy your delicious, pricey vegas meal!",

            "mesa grill is definitely a restaurant you need to experience in las vegas. this bobby flay restaurant is located inside of caesars palace. the restaurant seating is an open spaced floor plan and has  a nice warm southwestern feel. we came here during restaurant week so  i was hesitant on how long the wait would be. to my surprise we got seated right away! instantly i was pleased as i am not a very patient person when it comes to waiting for a seat. \n\nmy first dish i tried was the new mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin with a bourbon and ancho chile sauce and a sweet potato tamale with crushed pecan butter. all i can say is heaven. it was amazing. i am always nervous to try pork dishes as it is my favorite type of meat and i hold it to a very high standard. this was the best pork dish i have ever had. tender, juicy and the mix of spices took me on a wild tasty ride! \n\nthe next dish i tried was the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> with corn in a cilantro sauce. oh my goodness. i was blown away! the mix of the sweet corn, butter and cilantro sauce was paired so nicely with the shrimp that i ate the whole thing! i couldn't put the fork down it was just too delicious.  the shrimp was huge and the portion of this dish was perfect! i would have never paired shrimp with corn before but am looking forward to finding a way to make this recipe at home.\n\nanother dish i recommend is the <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> with spicy black bean sauce and roasted jalape\\u00f1o crema. i was hesitant to order something with black bean sauce as i have never heard of anything like that before. i am glad i took the jump and tried something new! i was totally impressed with the flavors from the jalape\\u00f1o crema, the salmon and the black bean sauce.\n\ni had such a great experience my first time at mesa grill that i have been back numerous times since. when you visit las vegas make sure to make mesa grill a priority on your \"to do\" list. you will not be disappointed, i guarantee it!\n\nsee my full review here: http://corkedandporked.com/2015/03/23/bobby-flays-las-vegas-restaurant-mesa-grill/"

            "drool. now i know what the food channel tastes like. \n\nthis place was pricey but definitely a great eat!!!!! the duck something was oooober. seriously. the spice was just right!! i had a great time eating here and trying out the foods and so did my friends. if you get a chance i saw go for it. shoot for a lunch hour it seemed a lot less busy.\n\nalso this place isn't very vegetarian friendly they had a few veggie only dishes but they were not willing to make a <mark>Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad</mark> without the chicken. the waitress informed us that all the meals were set and no accommodations were made. that's the only down side.", 
            "i would give this a 3.5 but no halvies. i only went for lunch so i can't rate if it's a 5-er without it.  we (as always if there is a we that means husband and i) went mainly because it's a bobby flay restaurant so that swayed us. also- with so many choices of good places, the menu looked good. \nit was an early lunch because we were starvino and just got off the plan a few hours before. \nso we had the wild mushroom quesadilla as a starter. as a disclaimer, i think anything with truffle oil tastes good. i also love mushrooms. it was really good- i like the crunch to the  quesadilla and the hummus on a quesadilla was new to me and beats the questionable tomato salsa with the salmonella scare.\nso-how do you review eating a salad? it's pretty much greens and meat right?  i had the  16 <mark>Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad</mark>. the rub on the chicken was pretty flavorful and i've only started ordering chicken at restaurants (personal reasons but sometimes i think eating chicken at restaurants is a waste- but hey it's salad).  overall it's a good salad and goat cheese is probably my favorite cheese.\nmy husband had the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> which was really tender. the fries had a kick to it.\nto digress (or not) bobby flay is all about simple food with lots of flavoring. the husband summed it up that you can either go totally wrong with all the spices or it works.  i think it works for him.\nyes- we start drinking once we hit the ground in vegas. i had a special drink of the day a watermelon margarita...really refreshing and not watered down. there is enough water in the watermelon! husband is a mojito and wished for more mojitos. the glassware is super cute.\ni think they gave us 3 kinds of breads, memorable was the spicy jalepeno corn muffin. i watched a bobby flay showdown episode where they had the kentucky browns which he served in his restaurant. i saw it on the menu but thought it would be too heavy for me, so i live in a world of regret. jk\nservice i can't say much for. we were early so we were jocked and they were very nice and attentive. i thought they were good. \nif i were you- i'd try it. if you are waiting in line for pure- maybe one stooge of a friend can sit there while you enjoy a drink and appie and trade off. if i go back for dinner- i'll revise.", 
            "we came here for brunch. for appetizer, my group ordered the spicy tuna and salmon tartare and some kind of quesadilla with chicken and bacon. i enjoyed the quesadilla and although the spicy tuna was fresh, the portion was way too small. for my entree, i ordered the 16 <mark>Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad</mark> ($16). i thought the chicken slices were too bland and not enough kick. for dessert, we ordered the profiteroles with the mexican chocolate sauce. the chocolate sauce had the perfect amount of heat and sweet, unlike the rest of the entrees i've tried. on the plus side, our server was nice, but i don't think i'd eat here again.", 
            "i've tried daniel boulud's brasserie which was very very good.  so my girlfriend and i wanted to try a celebrity chef restaurant, but we couldn't decide who.  while at caesar's we run across the mesa grill and look at the menu, it looks like there are items we would give a shot.  \n\nthe decor is kind of contemporary with bright colors kind of yuppy-ish/tacky like a trendy bar out of sex and the city.  i got the tuna and salmon tatares and my girlfriend got the pumpkin soup for appetizers.  i liked my tatare dish enough although it was kind of bland for the price and the spices were the ingredients that picked it up.  my girlfriend was dissapointed by the pumpkin soup because it tasted a lot like pumpkin pie mix.  \n\nfor the lunch entree, we ordered the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> and the <mark>Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad</mark>.  the burger itself wasn't memorable because...i really can't remember what it tasted like, but i loved dipping the fries into the horseradish sauce that came with the burger.  the salad disappointed my companion; the leaves were whole and were as big as your head and the dressing wasn't that great either.", 
            "i'm not a huge bobby flay fan but the combination of perusing the forum shops, hunger pangs, spago not being opened for lunch yet, and our 11:00am rum buzz made us take a chance on brunch at mesa grill.\n\ni can only describe the decor of this place as \"southwestern kitsch\" because of the festive colors, clear plastic wheelbarrows (yup), and wooden accents. it's an interesting setting, but not really my style. the menu was--surprise--southwest, but with hints of new flavors, such as the <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> with spicy black bean sauce or spicy chicken with <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>. vlad ordered the latter and i ordered the <mark>Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad</mark> (no goat cheese, vinaigrette on the side). \n\nafter taking our orders, the table bread arrived, which imo really was the highlight. the basket came with jalapeno cornbread, dried fruit scones, and blue corn muffins. . . rather than your average bread that looks and feels like it's been sitting out all day. vlad and i really enjoyed the blue corn muffins - they were both sweet and savory all in the same bite. while we waiting for our mains, i looked over at the table next to me only to see the most gigantic burger ever. the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> does not mess around! it looks like you literally have to dislocate your jaw in order to take one bite. luckily the lady who ordered it cut it in half and shared with her man. in retrospect, maybe i shouldn't have been closely observing these poor patrons like they were lab rats? whatevs, it's vegas. \n\nvlad was pleased with his dish, while mine was a bit bland. after taking out the goat cheese and vinaigrette, there really is nothing to that salad but chicken and spinach. actually, the chicken was atop a mini blue corn tortilla, but that's about it. i had to pull off the \"sixteen spice\" fat from each chicken strip, which i believe was intentionally included for \"flavor\". once the fat was taken off, they were just season-less chicken strips. i think the waiter felt sorry for my substituted dish and brought out 3 vinaigrettes for me to add variety. it helped a little. the green onion one was the best tasting.  \n\noverall, i'd come here again for the festive table bread but will definitely order something else. perhaps the roasted pumpkin soup with smoked chiles and pomegranate crema?", 
            "we came here for a quick lunch. i had the <mark>Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad</mark>, and it was a tiny portion. my bf had the pork sandwhich which was better, and we also tried a pumpkin soup. the salmon and tuna tartares were good. i don't think i walked away being a fan of tex mex food.", 
            "i'm mixed on celebrity chefs' restaurants, but thought i'd give bobby flay's mesa grill a try while at a conference recently.  overall, i thought it lived up to much of the reputation that preceeded it.  \n\nthe menu is diverse, and sounds delicious.  i really liked that the lunch menu had both lighter fare and hearty entrees.  the food itself was good.  maybe not a home run, but certainly good.  in particular, the cheese fundido appetizer was quite simple, yet tasty.  my 16 <mark>Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad</mark> was good, but am not sure that it was way ahead of other good lunch salads i've had.\n\nservice was a bit rough at first, but got better as lunch went on.  overall, i was pleased with the experience.  too bad yelp doesn't have a 1/2 star system.  it really deserves 3 1/2 stars, but i'm rounding up if for no other reason than it offered a nice respite from the sound of all the slot machines and cigarette smoke on the casino floor!", 
            "ahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! someone please call bobby flay!! \n\nthe food here was not so great. i've never tried tex-mex food, but from this experience i don't think i will ever try tex-mex again. the restaurant is not at all fancy, but the minute my brother stepped in he was asked to take off his fedora hat. come on, its not a baseball cap!! \n\n***food:\n- they start you off with a basket of bread and this is probably the best thing in the restaurant (sad to say). the jalapeno and the blue berry bread were quite interesting and delicious. \n- i ordered the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> and it was mediocre. i've had better. \n- the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> was not the best. the bread was quite hard so i couldn't enjoy the sandwich.\n- the flavor of the <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> was pretty over-bearing in flavor. \n- the <mark>Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad</mark> was blah. the chicken was dry and nothing was great about it.\n\noverall, mesa grill you have disappointed me and you will definitely not see me again. you would think the restaurant being owned by an iron chief would be good, but i guess not.", 
            "not my favorite meal of the trip to vegas.  we went to mesa grill on a sunday for lunch - they had their brunch menu available, but we were both craving lunch, so that limited the choices.  the decor of the restaurant is nice - kitschy, but nice.  things i didn't like - our table was so close to the next one that the lady at the next table knocked off my silverware when seated.  no big deal, but still.  i guess it was s good thing because we were forced to become the best of friends by the end of service since we were seated so closely that we all shared a conversation (if we wanted to or not!)  i ordered the spiced <mark>Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad</mark> and he had the burger (yes he is boring when it comes to food).  the waiter brought over a basket of misc bread products, the most of which were fine.  one (blue cornbread) was awful.  weird.  the people at the next table asked us if ours was weird too.  lol.  we asked the waiter what was in it, but nothing seemed out of the ordinary from cornbread - so why so icky?  anyway - our service was fine.  the fod so-so.  my <mark>Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad</mark> was way over seasoned.  he liked the burger (so maybe you should go boring).  i paid more than i thought the food warranted and made new friends inadvertently(whose french toast looked awesome by the way).", 
            "the tamale is excellent. love the chicken taco and the salmon. the chicken on the <mark>Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad</mark> is a little bit dry. the service is a +++. our waiter, john g, is so friendly, polite, and funny. he made us feeling that we were really welcomed to mesa.", 
            "you know, i've always been conflicted about trying this place. on one hand, bobby flay has annoyed me ever since he offended morimoto on iron chef. on the other hand, i really like southwestern style food, and he's supposedly good at coming up with versions of it. \n\nso there we were, my boyfriend and i, in vegas a little earlier than expected because we made most of the drive ahead of time to avoid a snowstorm. in fact, we were here in time for lunch (instead of just to st. george). we couldn't decide what to do with our extra meal, so we moseyed into caesar's and were greeted by the mesa grill. we were curious, so we went in. \n\nit was saturday afternoon, and therefore brunch time, so my boyfriend started with a mimosa. however, i couldn't resist our waiter's suggestion of one of the margaritas. i can't remember what they called it, but it was as smooth as he said it was supposed to be. i don't usually like margaritas, but i was down with this. \n\nfor our entrees, alan got the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> and i got the <mark>Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad</mark>. both were very good. the chicken in the salad was perfectly seasoned, and the dressing and goat cheese complimented it nicely. the eggs also had a good amount of goat cheese, and the combination of spices gave a great unique flavor. the ham the accompanied the dish was probably the highlight, though. \n\nservice was pretty slow, but our waiter was very nice when he did come by. prices were high, but it's vegas. \n\ni guess i'll forgive bobby flay for his iron chef ills for now (it's been long enough, right?), and i'll even go as far to say that i'd love to try this place for dinner sometime.", 
            "i was really looking forward to eating here because i'm a big fan of bobby flay. we went for lunch and the brunch menu was being served, with a few lunch dishes. my husband took the shrimp taco special, and i took a grilled <mark>Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad</mark>. we split the plates, so we could have a little of both. \n\ni had a peach margarita - awesome, and my husband had the \"perfect margarita\" - also awesome. \n\nmy salad was so salty. it was lightly dressed with a vinaigrette, but it was sprinkled with sea salt, so when i took a bite, i got salty, crunchy bits - not good. the chicken for the salad was over seasoned, as was the shrimp. the sauces that came with the shrimp were excellent. \n\ni'm bummed because i expected a better meal. luckily the good drinks helped the saltiness go down. but, i won't be eating here again.", 
            "this review is for brunch only. we came here for dinner a year or two ago and it was awesome (we still talk about the spice rubbed pork tenderloin). \n\nso, we had brunch hoping to like it as much as our dinner. no such luck. the breakfast bread basket was average - the variety was exciting but none of the items were actually very good. we shared two average dishes - the tiger shrimp and <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> and the <mark>Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad</mark>. \n\nthe tamale was average and smothered in so much corn. the salad was actually very good a variety of lettuce and lots of chicken, but way overdressed. the dressing hung all over the lettuce the last few bites weren't edible. \n\nthe only thing we really loved was the <mark>Spicy Mango - Glazed Bacon</mark> - it was $3.50 for four slices and was by far my favorite part of the meal. \n\nthe service dropped off after we got our food and we spent too much time waiting for our plates to be cleared, then to get a dessert menu (we declined), then to get the check, and then to have our credit card picked up. ugh. nothing impressive and nothing like what we remembered from our dinner visit to mesa grill.",

            "had lunch here on a saturday afternoon.  had a couple of killer cocktails, and started out sharing the tiger shrimp & <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> - excellent!  my husband had the spicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>, which he loved, and i had the 16-<mark>Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad</mark>, which was really good.  good service, lively atmosphere.", 
            "i ate here for lunch this past saturday alone at the bar.  i had been here in the past and wanted to come again as i had thoroughly enjoyed it every time.\n\nwhenever i was seated i was disappointed to get the brunch menu instead of the normal lunch menu.  that meant no chile relleno that i had picked out earlier.  instead i decided upon the 16 <mark>Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad</mark> with a side of chorizo. the salad was plated beautifully and the first bite of chicken provided my palate with the many spices.  sadly i soon lost those spices in the rest of the salad.  it had a green onion  vinaigrette dressing on top with goat cheese and fancy lettuce.  overall, i really enjoyed the salad.  the chorizo was also good but a bit overcooked.  it started out with a slightly sweet taste before finishing off spicy.\n\nthe bottom line for me is that i will head back here again in the future the next time that i am in vegas.  all of my previous meals here i would have given 5 stars but this time it was only worthy of 4.", 
            "my friend really wanted to try this place, since he's a fan of bobby flay. he got the burger, which he completely devoured, and i got the <mark>Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad</mark> with dressing on the side. it was a really pleasant surprise for them to give us not one, but three dressings! all dressings were delicious, and the veggies were fresh. chicken came with the skin on, but it was very tender and flavorful. i'll definitely be back...it's a great place to eat light and feel healthy, though i'm sure you could order heavy and roll out the door if you wanted...",

            "bobby flay,  you're a fraud.  sorry man,  your tv shows are kinda cool, but after visiting your signature restaurant, i am not impressed at all.\n\nfirst of all, why does a master chef like yourself need to use so much damn salt?  it's cheating.  salt does help bring out the flavor, but using too much of it is like how people use too much msg on chinese food and end  up making it all taste the same.\n\ni had the egg on a tortilla thing.  i don't even recall what it was called.  it was pretty darn salty, but edible.  the flavors weren't all that interesting.  edible.  that's the best word to describe it.\n\nmy wife,  however, had the <mark>Barbecued Lamb Cobb Salad</mark>.  the was so salty,  it was inedible.  so, she sent it back.  asked them \"light salt\".  so, what did they do?  the still dusted the greens with salt.  who puts salt on greens???\n\nthank god i never bought any of his cookbooks.  apparently, the secret ingredient is half a shaker of salt.\n\noh.  sorry.  there was one plus.  i got to sit facing the sportsbook at cesear's which everyone knows is the best sportsbook in town and got to watch the michigan v. msu football game.  go blue!", 
            "this is probably the 2nd most visited restaurant i have been to in las vegas. 1st being oyster bar at palace station. i have introduced most of my friends to this restaurant and they have all loved it. however, having visited this restaurant 5 times, i have noticed that is has gone down in quality, taste, and execution. \n\nmy first and second visits was unbelievable. we ordered all his signature dishes: <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>, <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, queso fundido, tuna tartare, chilequiles, and those wonderful margaritas. every single one of those dishes were well thought out and quite tasty. i understood why bobby flay is who he is and why his food made him so famous. \n\nthen my last three visits. the hash was over doused in green chile holladaise, the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> was overcooked (even medium would've been ok, but please don't give me medium well), and the <mark>Barbecued Lamb Cobb Salad</mark> had no flavor. i was wondering to myself \"what happened?\"\n\ni think that bobby flay has been to the restaurant less, so food quality control is probably not where it should be. hopefully, the restaurant sees that they're going down (they just lost their michelin star this year) and tries to pick it back up. \n\n\n*** at least their corn muffins are still tasty ***", 
            "topic of discussion throughout my lunch: wishing for bobby flay to come out during our meal to stand on his cutlery board, throwing his hands up in the air to 'raise the roof' - just like what he did to piss off all of japan's top chefs on \"iron chef\"...\n\nthe table bread selection is something worth noting: jalapeno bread is a definite winner. this, coming from someone who usually hates hot & spicy dishes!! you can taste that jalapeno flavor and notice that very tiny kick, but i wouldn't consider it spicy at all. the 2nd runner up for bread: blue corn muffin - this was the first to disappear at my table of 6 before we discovered the jalapeno bread.\n\nfor my appetizer, i ordered the spicy tuna & salmon tartares served w/ red & green hot sauces, crispy plantains +blue corn flatbread. who would've thought to serve the fish tartare on plantains?? being spoiled by the blue corn muffin already, i looked forward to the flatbread version - it wasn't a disappointment. ;-) as for the sauces, they were both \"mild\" (fyi: my threshold is \"mild\" to begin with...) at best and gives the tuna/salmon that extra kick when eaten w/ plantains. i never thought spicy tuna & salmon tartare can be this good prepped tex-mex style.....\n\ni gotta hand it to the guy, he sure knows know to make a damn good lamb chop <mark>Barbecued Lamb Cobb Salad</mark>, as this was my main lunch entree. now, i do realize that everyone is a fan of lamb. me? i love dark meat (no pun intended!) and some of that \"game\" taste. the lamb was cooked a little too well for me, i usually prefer my meats prepared medium. fresh greens were nice and crunchy. and they didn't skimp out on the avocado! buttermilk dressing was the perfect amount - not too little and not too much where the dressing would overpower the taste of the dish.\n\nas for dessert, most of us didn't bother since lunch was filling and we had to wait for the rest of our friends to arrive in vegas for dinner that night. next time, i'll have to convince my friends to come back here to check out their dinner menu.",

            "i love being proven wrong about celebrity chef-endorsed restaurants;  carnevino in the venetian put me off making fun of mario batali forever.  his emblazoned name means some tasty meats, let me tell you.   but this restaurant has done nothing for mr. flay's southwestern recipes.  \n\na friend and i had lunch at mesa today, and before i get into the gory details, let me say the wait staff and bus service was very great.  helpful on all sorts of problems;   for instance, there was a bug that crawled out of my friend's salad, stretched its little bug legs, and sat around for a minute while we waved down the help. \n\n  we assumed the bug had been knocked senseless by the over-seasoning of the lamb in the <mark>Barbecued Lamb Cobb Salad</mark>.  and over-seasoning is ridiculous here!   my <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> with <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark> was like being double-teamed by rubs and seasoning salt.  now the tenderloin was tender, but like my friend's lamb, there was no tasting of anything but chilis. \n\n  without like an aioli or some kind of dill yogurt to give your mouth a rest, it all just blends into generic spice tastes.    adding in the heavyness of the dishes such as the recommended goat cheese queso fundido (which was very delicious, but served with generic and easily breaking nachos)  you are left queazy and overfilled.\n\n20 minutes after our meal, on which the salad was comped and we were given free creme brulees (chocolate toffee, so rich and creamy), i began to feel very ill.   i ended up doubled-over in a forums restroom, the final and worst part of it all.\n\ni think of it as a science experiment, and sometimes science produces great things.  sometimes you irradiate yourself.  this was more of the latter.   a lot of nice little things, such as the help and appetizers, but outweighed by a couple unforgivable offenses.   i also don't like a meal so poorly spiced that it causes my body to actually reject it.  \n\nsorry bobby, maybe you should return and retune.", 
            "i've eaten at a few celebrity-owned restaurants that were amazing (carne vino in vegas, cafe atlantico in dc), but mesa was not one of them.  based on my experiences, i have decided that the best way to tell if a celebrity chef's restaurant is going to be any good or not is how much the restaurant relies on the celeb's name rather than the food to get people in the door.\n\nmy friend and i walked into mesa for our last summer lunch together and were immediately assaulted by a shrine to flay behind the hostess stand.  you can buy his books, chutneys, spice rubs, and probably posters in the restaurant.  the atmosphere of the restaurant didn't get much better.  as we were lead to our table, we walked past the open kitchen where the chef manning the grill was cooking burger after burger and piling them up off to one side.  made to order, eh?  the table we were seated at was so close to another couple that i could have bumped the other lady with my elbow if i wasn't careful.  i know mesa isn't an intimate date restaurant or anything, but i felt uncomfortable having the conversation i wanted to have with my friend there.\n\nour waiter had to crawl out of flay's butt to bring us the day's specials.  \"do you know bobby flay?  did you choose mesa because of mr. flay?  do you watch bobby on the food network?\" he simpered as he held the menu upside down in front of us.  his appetizer recommendation was good though.  the queso fundido was yummy.  as were the ($16) margaritas.  i was surprised they were that expensive at lunch time; i could have gotten similar cocktails at many other restaurants for $9-$12.\n\nmy biggest complaint about mesa, and the reason i only give it one star, is the seasoning.  i get that southwestern spice, chilis and rubs are flay's thing, but there's something to be said for subtlety.  i ordered a <mark>Barbecued Lamb Cobb Salad</mark> because i really like lamb and thought that sounded delicious.  too bad i couldn't taste my lamb.  it was cooked perfectly and melt-in-my-mouth tender, but it didn't taste like anything but chili powder.  i love lamb because it tastes good.  why go against that?  about halfway through my salad when i had pretty much decided i had had enough anyway, a little black bug crawled out from under a lettuce leaf and began crawling around the lip of my plate.  he was moving slowly, perhaps dazed by the spices as i was.\n\nwe quickly flagged down a busser (who had been really attentive about our bread, drinks, and water - i think he was my favorite thing about the meal) who brought the plate, still with bug, to our waiter.  he came and apologized, soon the floor manager came to apologize, but she did it in the rudest way i can imagine.  \"why didn't you say anything when i came by earlier?\" she demanded.  \"because a bug hadn't crawled out of my salad yet...\" i replied.  then she went on to explain that in a kitchen their size, things like this are unavoidable.  i get it.  produce gets bugs, my kitchen has a bug in it from time to time, but she shouldn't have admitted that.  the right thing to do is say i'm so sorry and leave it at that.\n\nfunny story, when she had come by and inquired about how we were enjoying the meal earlier, i said \"it's ok,\" which is about how i felt.  she shot me the angriest look and stalked off instead of caring to find out why i wasn't happy.\n\nmy salad was comped, and i got a free creme brulee that was \"ok.\"  maybe the dinner is better, but i will not go back to mesa to find out.", 
            "a-ma-zing! loved everything from the creative decor to the service. oh, did i mention the food! we had the goat cheese queso for an appitizer. i'll never have regular cheese dip again. we were there for lunch and the lunch menu did not disappoint. my husband had bobby flay's famous <mark>Mesa Burger</mark>. he loved it....then he added the horsradish sauce and said the burger was now out of this world. i had the bbq'd <mark>Barbecued Lamb Cobb Salad</mark>. absolutely the best salad i've ever had. the blue cheese crumbles had so much flavor! the lamb....man oh man was awesome. overall...a must for all future trips to vegas!", 
            "wow, to get a 5th star from me on a 2nd visit means it's pretty good! i can be on the picky side.  what i am trying to understand is how the casino cafes can get away with charging more than bobby flay for a burger that doesn't even come close to what you get at mesa grill.  if you look at the guides, mesa grill is listed as semi pricey - well in comparison to the mediocre food at many of the casino restaurants, this should be listed as inexpensive!  a burger costs $16 and it's worth every penny for the way the cheese is perfectly melted into the meat and the onions are caramelized to perfection.  fries are seasoned really well too.  \n\nthe <mark>Barbecued Lamb Cobb Salad</mark> was delicious and not gamey.  they know how to make a pretty good <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark> - but not as good as old ebbitt grill in dc - bobby ... go check it out and you'll see what i mean! \n\nservice is always great.  thanks for another delicious meal.", 
            "i must confess that the main reason i came to mesa grill (out of all the restaurants in las vegas) is because i have a cowboy brush on bobby flay. despite most negative opinions of celebrity chefs, i think many of them can cook well. personally, i enjoyed dining at mesa grill. \n\nmy friend and i came on a sunday afternoon for brunch. we were both impressed by their staff's cordial and professional service. there was a complimentary bread basket which i was very impressed with and a wide selection of water, yes water, to chose from. so service receives 5 stars. based on the number of parties i saw in the restaurant, reservations are probably not necessary for lunch or brunch. but it might be otherwise for dinner.\n\nwe started off with chef flay's famous tiger shrimp and <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>. i think this appetizer was definitely true to flay's southwestern stile and is a must try. the shrimp was cooked perfectly, tender and sweet; <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> was fresh and fluffy and the his signature sauces were extremely flavorful. each bite has a familiar spice kick.\n\nthen, we ordered the bbq <mark>Barbecued Lamb Cobb Salad</mark> and the eggs + aged strip loin tortilla. the <mark>Barbecued Lamb Cobb Salad</mark> and lamb were divine! i loved the buttermilk dressing, so good!  the tortilla dish was on the mediocre side and made me wish i ordered the spicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> (which has been on the menu for the last 8? years) however, i was mainly looking for a steak for lunch so it satisfied for cravings. honestly, i could have gone without the egg and myriad of relishes (very beautifully plated) because the strip loin was cooked really well (medium rare, which i think is how all good meat should be cooked). it was incredibly tender and melts in your mouth. i will definitely have to come back for dinner to try his mexican spiced pork tenderloin.\n\nalso, i loved the complimentary bread basket. the waiter describes what each bread piece is and each was delicious on its own. :)", 
            "really tasty stuff. \nthe best part of the meal was the sweet potato soup, great flavors with an extra kick from drizzled chili oil. we got so much food i can't describe it all. the lamb on the <mark>Barbecued Lamb Cobb Salad</mark> was perfectly cooked and tender, although the salad could have used a little more. burgers are good. i enjoyed my sword fish club but the bread choice was not my favorite. i'll go back to try more of the flavorful menu. <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark> disappointed a little, i was expecting more flavor from them. \n\nmen: you can't wear hats in the dining room fyi", 
            "after my 3rd trip, i have come to the conclusion that your best bet @ mesa is a lunch visit.  we spilit the smoked chicken and black bean quesadilla, browned well. the gala apple and maytag bleu cheese salad. she had the bbq <mark>Barbecued Lamb Cobb Salad</mark>. i had the pork tenderloin pressed sandwich with his <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark>.  everything was awesome.  top notch.", 
            "we were doing some strolling through ceasar's palace on new years and, after some light shopping, started to work up a nice appetite. my boyfriend would probably challenge me on my definition of \"light\" gauging by his lack of jubilance in my shopping endeavors. but this is ceasars palace we're talking about here...a shopper's mecca!! sorry, i digress... now on to the brunch.\n\nmy boyfriend has been to bobby flay's mesa grill ny location and he recommended we try his westcoast counterpart. sometimes him and i depart on our culinary appraising, but in this instance are thoughts and assessments were in full-fledged alliance. \n\nthere was a 30 minute wait, which wasn't too bad considering it was new year's weekend and home of culinary/restaurateur extraordinaire, bobby flay. i was blown away by their saturday brunch (which is served till 3 p.m. on saturdays & sundays). mid-meal, ( i just couldn't wait till the end of brunch) i was already singing -- well, actually texting -- mesa grill praises to a few friends and family.\n\ni went with our server's recommendation and a mesa grill favorite brunch item -- the spicy chicken & <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>. it was unforgettable! the blend of poached eggs, savory grilled chicken, sweet potato cubes, bell peppers, salsa and green chile hollandaise was staggering. pair that with one of their savory bread basket medley items, which is divinity in a basket, and your taste buds will be working full throttle. the fresh-baked jalapeno cornbread muffins, tequila berry scones and raspberry coffee crumb cake squares were delicious! my boyfriend said the scone was the best ever! \n\nmy boyfriend orded the <mark>Barbecued Lamb Cobb Salad</mark> and one of their specialty drinks, a whiskey & champagne concoction. a real rarity for my boyfriend to order a salad but i think he gravitated toward the fusion of barbequed lamb, avocado, blue cheese and bacon & buttermilk dressing. he loved it!\n\nmesa grill is truly worth experiencing if you're in vegas. the swanky southwestern decor and dishes are sensational.  i will sing, text, write and dance mesa grill praises for some time to come. maybe one day i'll try the new york or bahamas location :-)",

            "my husband and i have had lunch here twice.  on our first visit, we were totally annoyed with the waiter who apparently did not want to accept the fact that my husband and i did not want cocktails with our lunch.  he repeatedly asked us about drinks and we repeatedly said, \"no, thank you.\"  we ordered an array of appetizers for lunch which were all quite good.  when they arrived, again he brought up the subject of drinks and suggested a special margarita and said we could split it if we wanted to.  split a drink?  seriously?  we were not being cheap (just the array of appetizers built a pretty hefty tab) and are totally aware that when in vegas you shell out the bucks for what you want and we have no problem with that.  we tried mesa again on a visit last october and were relieved that this time we didn't get the cocktail hard-sell.  we both ordered the <mark>Barbecued Lamb Cobb Salad</mark>.  our waiter felt the need to mention that the lamb wasn't really barbecued but more on the grilled side.  so, why not call it the grilled <mark>Barbecued Lamb Cobb Salad</mark>?  not a deal breaker.  the salad was tasty although a bit mushy due to the guacamole in it.  why not just slice or dice the avocado and keep the salad a nice consistency?  can't say i just can't wait to get back to vegas to go to mesa grill again.  we do say this about meals we have had at todd english and wofgang puck where you get great quality and bang for your big bucks (after all, this is vegas). what i can say about this last experience is, \"bobby, please bring me the rest of my salad!\"  the portion was incredibly small (about a cup full) to have been served in such a large bowl.  the large container only served to make us wonder where the rest of our salad was.  this item needs to be moved to the appetizer section.  if lamb is all that expensive, would it have hurt to at least throw in some extra greens to bulk it up a bit?   the good thing is that all during the rest of our trip, we kept laughing about this salad experience.  bobby, we still love you but we don't love mesa grill!",

            "[this review is for the brunch menu.]\n\nmesa - this restaurant has been staring me in the eye for ages and i finally got to take it on with great results.  \n\nthe menu is a southern tex-mex style and lots of style indeed.  dishes are flavorful and fairly bold in their interpretations of classic dishes you may be used to.  one of the early delights is the included bread basket with a lot of tasty choices.  my personal favorite was the blueberry scone and another really interesting bread concoction (not sure if it was a zucchini bread?)  my table ordered a variety of dishes from there (they also have a fairly robust wine list and margarita list as well along with a full bar menu) that ranged from <mark>Barbecued Lamb Cobb Salad</mark> to amazing looking waffles.  from the dishes i tried, i surprisingly loved the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> the most.  the presentation was not only very well done but the flavors of both the tamale and the well-spiced tiger shrimp hit the spot.   \n\nmy only small complaints were that some of the dishes didn't seem as strong as the others.  the house margarita (i believe called the patrida) was a little more hit-or-miss - not as sweet but not as flavorful as other margaritas i've had either.  the <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> also was a little more on the not-so-sure side.  i liked the presentation but the dish came out a little colder than expected and the <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> wasn't as flavorful.  perhaps an off day for the dish?  \n\nservice was excellent for sure (friendly, fun and keeping tabs on us regularly) and brunch on a saturday was surprisingly not that busy.  the decor has a fun fire theme throughout the entire restaurant that goes from the ceilings to the lighting - i really dug the theme.  \n\nall-in-all, mesa is a fantastic restaurant stop and the brunch doesn't burn the wallet either.  a worthy check out.",

            "i had brunch here with 7 other friends. the order was as follows (best to worst, 1-6): \n\nbread assortment (complimentary)\nthere were about four different kinds. a couple of them were a little spicy with jalapeno, very good overall. \n\n(3) queso fundido $12\na light goat cheese fondue with bits of peppers served with blue tortilla chips. i've had this one before at the nyc location and it's consistently good.\n\n(1) spicy chicken + <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> $18\ngreat breakfast dish. it came with with poached eggs and a green chile hollandaise sauce.\n\n(1) <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> chiliquiles with roasted tomatillo sauce\nwhite cheddar cheese + creme fraiche $14\nanother great dish. it came with one of the same sauces as the chicken dish, but it was a solid sauce.\ni had no clue what chiliquiles were, so here's the wikipedia for your reference:\n\nchilaquiles is a traditional mexican dish consisting of fried or dried tortilla chips, bathed in green or red salsa or mole and broiled or grilled with a cheese topping. sometimes chicken strips are mixed into the sauce, or the dish can be served with a fried egg on top or a strip of meat alongside.\n\nthey are most commonly eaten at breakfast time, served alongside with fried or <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> or a mexican style grilled beef. moreover, chilaquiles are often lauded as a cure for the common hangover.\n\nunlike nachos, which are served as a crispy snack, chilaquiles are a main dish and are not served until the tortilla chips are thoroughly soaked and softened by the salsa. this makes them a popular recipe for stale chips or those with a bad taste as the other flavors mask the chips'.\n\n(5) <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> $16\nthe most memorable part of this dish was the price. the fries were pretty good; crispy outside, seasoned well. but, nothing special about the burger.\n\n(6) <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> with grilled red onion, arugula, and\nancho-chile mayonnaise $15\ni thought this was the worst of the dishes. the beef was tender, but it lacked flavor, was too thin, was initially served cold and the bread was too thick for the sandwich. the waiter said the previous bakery burned down and they were testing new bread. the ancho mayo was good, but the flavor was overpowered by the 2 lbs. of bread.\n\n(4) grilled mahi mahi with roasted pineapple-cascabel chile sauce and caramelized pineapple-green onion salsa $24\ni was hung over, which is the only way i could why i order this dish. the sauce was good and the fish seemed to be lightly scented with honey. the texture was a little dry. overall, not worth $24. the waiter said it was the best thing on the menu, maybe he meant the priciest thing on the menu.\n\nmy friend got a <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark>. i'm not a fan of tomato juice or blood for that matter, but it looked of pretty good quality. \n\nservice\nvery slow. starting with the water, to the other drinks, to the bread, to the starter, and ending with the entrees. they were consistent with it, at least. and still kind of pissed that he recommended the mahi mahi.\n\nso, what did we learn? for brunch, stick to the br and stray from the unch. based on my experience in nyc, you may want to try dinner also and stick to red meat.", 
            "at the mesa las vegas---yummyyyyyy! \na good chunk of change.\nthe waiters were very nice and extremely informative. my goodness, as he was describing it i could feel the drool dropping from my mouth. \nwe ate lunch here with 10 people, so i got to sample a little of everyones plate\nstart off with great bread..cranberry bread? and corn bread, very unique and free! yay!\nentrees: \nspicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>-it has two poached eggs on top and itss delicious! kind of on the breakfast side and its an explosion of flavor in your mouth. little chicken chunks and sweet potatoes. great sauce, but you could only eat so much, it was really overpowering.\ngrilled mahi- mahi with pinapples - dry!!! dont reccommend \n<mark>Mesa Burger</mark> -- huge reg. burger.. try the garlic mayo\nsteak sandwhich-- juicy yummy reccommend!\n\ndessert: my birthday cake :)\nwarm chocolate cake--- cake was richh, macroon was delicious(i love macroons), ice cream complemented the cake extremely well and the presentation was beautiful! only good if you're sharing\n\noverall...good experience worth a try, but not the most amazing thing i've tried.", 
            "omg!!! i had the best burger in the world, no wait, the universe. it was so juicy and beefy!!!!!. the patty is not your typical mass produced mechanically grounded beef. there were chunks of beef that seemed like it was hand chopped. it makes you ask, 'what is in & out'? everytime i see a burger all i could think of was the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark>. alright enough about the burger. all the other dishes were also delicious. tuna tartar, eggs benedict, grits. omg! i almost forgo about the bread basket. the blue cornbread was so buttery and good. the blueberry muffin was so good. ok you get the idea, now go try it!", 
            "the menu here is very innovative.  i wanted to eat everything but i was hung over and i needed a greasy <mark>Mesa Burger</mark>.  the burger was prepared very well but i felt the bun was too big.  after 10-15 minutes it started to get hard and dry.  ok, that didnt sound right but it did.  someone asked for tabasco sauce but they don't have any.  so they waiter brought out a homemade green sauce in replace of the tabasco.  it was fantastic!  i wanted to drink it.  it had the right amount of heat and enhanced my burger.   i felt the food deserved 4 stars but the service is what brought this review down to 3 stars.  the waiter wasn't very friendly.  he was probably hung over or hated his job.  for this type of restaurant with lots of press and hype i would think bobby flay would know how important service needs to be.  i will probably go back and try a different dish next time.", 
            "i am not a big fan of tex mex food but mesa grill reflects the creativity in bobby flay which i guess, makes bobby flays food different from the norm.  i have to admit, even though im not a big fan of bobby flay himself, his use of big flavors and for some reason vibrant colors with his southwestern flare does indeed comfirm his bold and cocky style.  mesa grill did not dissapoint, but anyways, ill jus cut to the chase, this is what i tasted\n\ngoat cheese queso fundido- probably not so good if you dont like the taste of heavy nutty cheeses, very strong goat cheese flavor\nraw tuna nachos- famous dish, the mango and avocado sauce is a good combo\npork loin sandwhich- the ancho chile mayo is spicy, actually not so bad, pretty tasty, the arugula and chiabatta bread complements it well, its served cold but for some reason, i think it would taste better hot\n<mark>Mesa Burger</mark>- a decent burger, served with seasoned fries\nspicy chicken sweet potatoe hash- probably the best taste, sweet potatoes with eggs and hollandaise, did not taste as heavy as i thought, notbad\n<mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> and the new york strip- not great, not bad, nothing very special, or i guess wats special was the bbq sauces they use for the meats, didnt really ruin the flavors of the meats\nanother thing was i heard mesa is famous for their breads, i was lookin for to the famous corn bread, but it was dry and it was cold, it seemed like it always broke apart and didnt hold together well, but the little jalopeno biscuits were good\n\n3.5 stars", 
            "i don't really like bbq.  i don't really like southwest style cooking.  i actually don't really like bobby flay or his cocky attitude either...\n\n...i liked mesa grill.\n\nwhile the location may not do it for some, my buddy and i stopped in here for a quick bite to eat while betting on the nfl games as it is in direct view of the sportsbook at caesars.  \n\nimmediately on being seated we were brought a complimentary bread basket with absolutely amazing jalapeno corn bread, biscuits, and a cheesy garlic bread that was out of this world.  i ordered a diet coke which was repeatedly refilled and we were not charged for despite sitting around bsing for nearly 2 hours while my buddy drank two beers that he noted were well priced.\n\nfor meals, my buddy ordered the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> with double cheddar cheese, grilled vidalia onion, and horseradish mustard on a house roll with southwest fries.....the burger was enormous and per his word \"awesome.\"  i opted for the thick cut ahi tuna nachos with spicy aoili and blue corn tortillas.  while it appears this amazing dish has since been removed from the menu, i still contest it is one of the 3 best forms of raw tuna i've yet to consume.  the portion was large and at only $11 my total bill with tip for 2 baskets of bread, nachos, soda, and 2 hours of hanging out was a mere $15.\n\nwhile this isn't \"5 star\" dining, it is one heck of a deal for high quality food in a nice 'bar' setting when in vegas.  in retrospect i wish i'd have ordered dessert, but with dinner reserves at simon later that evening i didn't want to overindulge.....y'know, after eating the paris buffet for breakfast.", 
            "after eating at bobby flay's mesa grill in ceasar's palace, i'm pretty sure i would allow flay to \"throwdown\" on me anytime he wants. his food a seriously sexy and  unforgettable \"explosion\" of flavors in my mouth again and again. woowee! it's getting hot in here, and it's not just because of his masterful use of spices. but let's move onto the food.\n\ni went to vegas this past weekend, and was excited to find that the people i went to didn't want to just go to the plethora of buffets that vegas has to offer. instead, our group ventured into the culinary adventures that vegas had to offer, and our first stop was mesa grill.\n\nthree things about me:\n1) i love spicy foods\n2) i typically do not like <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark>'s (in fact, i detest them)\n3) i never get red meat past medium. (pink is where its at)\n\nwe ordered our drinks first, i ordered the margarita (which was just ok, but when i asked for extra tequila, the server hooked a sister up!) my other fellow food goers both ordered <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark>. i tried a sip, and i swear i was in spicy tomato heaven. it was the best <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark> i've ever had, and i actually regretted not ordering one for myself. score 1 for bobby flay!\n\nnext, our server set down a bounty of delicious baked goods. (good thing because we were starving) now usually, the bread is usually just ok and filler food til the meal comes. the basket alone could have made up a meal, and i would have been perfectly content. (just goes to show you how serious they take food) the assortment came with jalepeno corn muffins and biscuits, cranberry scones, blueberry coffee cake, and the best part was that they gave us three of each because there were three of us! now that's dedication!\n\nnext, the three of us ordered the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark>, scrambled egg enchilada, and the spicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> with poached eggs. \n\nmy burger came with fries dusted with a southwestern seasoning (ancho chili powder, and probably some cayenne). the fries were delectably spicy and the burger was cooked medium (with the perfect pink center) score 2 more points for flay.  the burger was huge accompanied by tasty grilled onions, swiss cheese, and a side of horseradish mustard. i could have stopped here, and flay would have exceeded my expectations, but he was definitely not through with me yet. \n\nnext the scrambled egg enchiladas. <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> with chorizo and goat cheese rolled in tortillas, and assembled on top of three different sauces. the great thing i loved about this was that it was not drenched with sauce like your typical enchilada. instead, there were three intricate sauces (all sure to stimulate your taste buds), that went well with the delicate eggs. scrumptious!\n\ni was perfectly satisfied, but flay insisted \"to keep on going\" and make the experience \"last a little longer.\"  i had to try the spicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>. i was unsure about the dish- thought the sweet potatoes might have been overkill. however, i took a bite, and i was in food heaven. it was everything you want in a meal. well balanced flavors, perfectly seasoned, and not too heavy.  i was so full, but i couldn't stop eating. i wanted more. i needed more. it was the perfect climatic end to a delicious meal. \n\nas rhett s. said, if you go to vegas and have not made it to mesa, you havent really experienced vegas at all.  i would drive 4 hours just to try it again!", 
            "solid food. not overrated at all.\n\ncoming into mesa grill, i've really felt that bobby flay's such a overrated cook with a freaking ego problem. ever seen bobby flay's throwdown on the food network? annoying is all i can say.\n\nmy perspective has really changed, after dining here for a lunch. his ingredients, his hand in opening this restaurant, he can back up the s*it that he's talking. it's good, solid food. not everything is transcendent brilliant - omg i could die right now - type of food, but a lot of his food has their moments.\n\neven at the beginning, with the breadbasket, the experience starts. extremely good stuff. three different types of bread, all unique and brilliant in its own right. jalapeno bread, raisin walnut bread, and blue/yellow cornbread muffins. the biggest highlight was the muffin - so sweet and slightly buttery for that savory taste. even the crumbs in the breadbasket were subsequently picked out and devoured by myself.\n\ni'm lucky my girlfriend wanted some dishes from the prix fixe, so we were able to mix and match appetizers and entrees. \n\ni ordered a blue corn pancake, filled with duck in star anise sauce, with habanero sauce on top. presentation was brilliant, flavor was excellent as well. the anise sauce tasted almost peking duck like, and had a significantly asian feel to it with the cilantro. however, the dish was distinctly southwestern with the kick of the habanero. very interesting how the dish crossed cultures.\n\nentree was the jamaican jerk chicken from the prix fixe menu, which was vastly unsatisfying and very disappointing. flavor was decent, but you almost expect more from this dish.\n\nmy girlfriend had the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark>, of which i ate half. it was a good burger, but the problem was, it was just a burger, nothing extremely special. i wasn't too impressed. however, i may have been offset in my burger opinions by just eating the daniel boulud burger a meal ago. oh well.\n\ndessert came by with the prix fixe, and it was supposedly a lime sorbet, according to the server. it actually was a guava sorbet. and it has to be one of the best sorbets i've had - ever. that's saying a lot. slightly tart flavor, but good sweetness, and key tasting of the texture of the guava sediment so commonly seen while drinking either guava juice or eating guavas. kept the good pinkish color of the guava as well. a great end to that meal.\n\ndoes mesa really deserve that shiny one michelin floret (star)? i would say yes. but probably not more than that.\n\n4 stars - solid. some misses, but some absolutely brilliant dishes that really made me believe in this myth of bobby flay. he is a good innovator, no doubt about it. definitely worth a visit, just to see for yourself.", 
            "loved it.  the hefty half pound <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> had me at hello:\n\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xzbupxdya0zttu3azqtqhg?select=gshf_l6j5d4pbic2d5ge1g\n\na horseradish mustard came along for the ride and was just spicy enough, went great with the caramelized onions.  a nice cup of smooth coffee had me bright eyed and ready to go and see a show afterwards.  service was quick, careful and friendly.  the atmosphere is light and open and full of people.  not particularly expensive.  come to caesars and hit this place up, you'll be glad you did.  the best vegas celeb chef restaurant,  bobby flay you're the man.", 
            "mesa grill is good, solid food.  the prices are pretty outrageous at dinner, but brunch/lunch are very reasonable. the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> is great. also had the pork tenderloin which was really solid (should have been at $45+).  margaritas are excellent and its a good place to get a primer into tequila options.  i love the bread basket they bring....really really good.", 
            "simply my favorite restaurant in las vegas and definitely on my top 3 list.  bobby flay is amazing!  i have been to mesa grill a handful of times; twice for brunch and three times for dinner. it's awesome everytime. you need to like favor and a lil spicy because everything is very well spiced.  here are some recommedations:\nbrunch - \n*the best thing on the brunch menu is their spicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> with poached eggs.  it's goooie!\n*<mark>Mesa Burger</mark> is tasty but nothing extraordinary\n*<mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark> are made just right with a little extra kick\n\ndinner - so many excellent choices\n*red and black pepper encrusted filet mignon cooked perfectly\n*new mexican spice rubbed pork tenderloin the spiciest thing on the menu, pretty spicy but i couldn't stop eating it. yum!\n*grilled lamb porterhouse chop best lamb chops ever and so perfect with cranberry/jalapeno sauce.\n\ndessert:\nthey don't disappoint.  we had the sampler and all of it was good.\n\nso if you get a chance to go there try it, it's all worth it.", 
            "this is probably the 2nd most visited restaurant i have been to in las vegas. 1st being oyster bar at palace station. i have introduced most of my friends to this restaurant and they have all loved it. however, having visited this restaurant 5 times, i have noticed that is has gone down in quality, taste, and execution. \n\nmy first and second visits was unbelievable. we ordered all his signature dishes: <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>, <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, queso fundido, tuna tartare, chilequiles, and those wonderful margaritas. every single one of those dishes were well thought out and quite tasty. i understood why bobby flay is who he is and why his food made him so famous. \n\nthen my last three visits. the hash was over doused in green chile holladaise, the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> was overcooked (even medium would've been ok, but please don't give me medium well), and the <mark>Barbecued Lamb Cobb Salad</mark> had no flavor. i was wondering to myself \"what happened?\"\n\ni think that bobby flay has been to the restaurant less, so food quality control is probably not where it should be. hopefully, the restaurant sees that they're going down (they just lost their michelin star this year) and tries to pick it back up. \n\n\n*** at least their corn muffins are still tasty ***", 
            "i've tried daniel boulud's brasserie which was very very good.  so my girlfriend and i wanted to try a celebrity chef restaurant, but we couldn't decide who.  while at caesar's we run across the mesa grill and look at the menu, it looks like there are items we would give a shot.  \n\nthe decor is kind of contemporary with bright colors kind of yuppy-ish/tacky like a trendy bar out of sex and the city.  i got the tuna and salmon tatares and my girlfriend got the pumpkin soup for appetizers.  i liked my tatare dish enough although it was kind of bland for the price and the spices were the ingredients that picked it up.  my girlfriend was dissapointed by the pumpkin soup because it tasted a lot like pumpkin pie mix.  \n\nfor the lunch entree, we ordered the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> and the <mark>Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad</mark>.  the burger itself wasn't memorable because...i really can't remember what it tasted like, but i loved dipping the fries into the horseradish sauce that came with the burger.  the salad disappointed my companion; the leaves were whole and were as big as your head and the dressing wasn't that great either.", 
            "i'm not a huge bobby flay fan but the combination of perusing the forum shops, hunger pangs, spago not being opened for lunch yet, and our 11:00am rum buzz made us take a chance on brunch at mesa grill.\n\ni can only describe the decor of this place as \"southwestern kitsch\" because of the festive colors, clear plastic wheelbarrows (yup), and wooden accents. it's an interesting setting, but not really my style. the menu was--surprise--southwest, but with hints of new flavors, such as the <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> with spicy black bean sauce or spicy chicken with <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>. vlad ordered the latter and i ordered the <mark>Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad</mark> (no goat cheese, vinaigrette on the side). \n\nafter taking our orders, the table bread arrived, which imo really was the highlight. the basket came with jalapeno cornbread, dried fruit scones, and blue corn muffins. . . rather than your average bread that looks and feels like it's been sitting out all day. vlad and i really enjoyed the blue corn muffins - they were both sweet and savory all in the same bite. while we waiting for our mains, i looked over at the table next to me only to see the most gigantic burger ever. the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> does not mess around! it looks like you literally have to dislocate your jaw in order to take one bite. luckily the lady who ordered it cut it in half and shared with her man. in retrospect, maybe i shouldn't have been closely observing these poor patrons like they were lab rats? whatevs, it's vegas. \n\nvlad was pleased with his dish, while mine was a bit bland. after taking out the goat cheese and vinaigrette, there really is nothing to that salad but chicken and spinach. actually, the chicken was atop a mini blue corn tortilla, but that's about it. i had to pull off the \"sixteen spice\" fat from each chicken strip, which i believe was intentionally included for \"flavor\". once the fat was taken off, they were just season-less chicken strips. i think the waiter felt sorry for my substituted dish and brought out 3 vinaigrettes for me to add variety. it helped a little. the green onion one was the best tasting.  \n\noverall, i'd come here again for the festive table bread but will definitely order something else. perhaps the roasted pumpkin soup with smoked chiles and pomegranate crema?", 
            "when i went here, i got the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark>:\n\ndouble cheddar cheese \ngrilled vidalia onion + horseradish mustard on a house roll + <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark>\n\nplease don't ask me what any of those words mean. i copied it from their website.\n\nmaybe there are some opinionated foodies out there, but all you need to know was that this burger was damn good. the horseradish mustard gave it a nice kick and it was cooked to a very nice medium rare. this is a nice restaurant to go to with a group - the portions are large enough to pass around.", 
            "we decided to try mesa grill for lunch. it was a sunday so we had the brunch menu. it was a little disappointing since i would have preferred the lunch menu. the brunch menu is mostly several variations on <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark>. it did not have any of the tamales that bobby flay is know for. we had to wait a little bit for a table since we had a large group and they had to push some tables together for us. the place has a nice feel with an open kitchen, although the set up made it a little hard to see the kitchen. the guy at the grill seemed to like that we were paying attention to him and kept looking up and smiling at us. in fact, everyone at the restaurant was friendly. the service was really good. at one point, one of the bussers dropped a fork and all three employees in the area went over to pick it up.\n\ni went with their version of steak and eggs. actually half our group had that and the other half had the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark>. one person had scrambled egg enchiladas. the steak and eggs and burgers were a decent sized portion and we felt pretty full after, however i think my friend that got the enchiladas was a little disappointed as it cost as much as the burger, but you only got two small enchiladas.  you do get a basket of delicious bread with your meal.\n\ni'd like to try mesa grill again, but next time for lunch or dinner. a few notes: the dress code is relaxed in the day. there were several people in tshirt and shorts, myself included. however, they won't let you wear a hat. the table next to us had a very young child with them who was a picky eater and they were happy to make something special for him.", 
            "if it weren't for the terrible service....you'd be at 4.5 stars mesa grill.\n\nyes, i'm talking about you john j.  we stopped in last saturday for their brunch menu and i all of us were astonished at how lacking the service was. \n\nbut let me talk about the good eats first...\ntwo of us ordered the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark>, which was excellent. one medium/one medium rare, both of which were grilled spot on.\ntwo of us ordered the <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>, which was another good choice and an interesting combination of flavors.  the grits that were served with it were some of the best i've ever had. our burgers were served with fries, which while weren't bad, paled in comparison to the duck fat fries we had the night before at stripsteak.\n\nthe extras: they provide a complimentary assorted breads basket, which is well down and was scarfed down by us quickly.  three of us tried different margaritas, which were excellent. \n\nwhy service was terrible...very slow, we had to wave down servers on more than one occasion (if we were taken care of, why would we ever have to do this?!), one person, who had just ordered a diet pepsi, was out of drink for a while until we had to flag someone down for a refill. at $4 a soda we expect a refill.  our server actually started talking once before ever getting to our table (couldn't hear him) and started walking away while i was talking to him. kinda rude buddy. especially if you're serving at a restaurant of this caliber. \n\nthe total, for the four of us, excluding tip was $122.15", 
            "my friends and i stopped for lunch and what a treat.  the wait staff was super.  when my friend ordered <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark>, they actually brought a small container of simple syrup for him to sweeten his tea with.  i had the <mark>Barbecued Lamb Cobb Salad</mark> and it was amazing.  the bbq dry rub had a little kick and the lamb was rare and tender.  my friend had the roast <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark>.  the rub on the pork was fantastic.  my other friend had the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> and said it was great.  alot of people don't like bobby flay but his restaurant in ceaser's was amazing.",

            "this was an omg lunch experience for me.  i have been a fan of bobby flay on the food network for a while now. when my fiance mentioned he had a place in vegas, there was no hesitation on my part to go their for lunch.  i know another reviewer (chris o) had a terrible experience this week but for my fiance and i..it was wonderful.\n\nthe location is in caesar's palace.  the smart thing they did here was enclose the restaurant in glass so those noisey gambling machines do not interfere with your eating.  the wait staff are sharply  dressed in pin strip vests and gray shirts.  our waiter and bus/getting-the-bread-to-the-table guy both were well informed about the specials.  the \"bread guy\" even explained the type of bread we were about to consume.  what other restaurant does that?!  my fiance ordered the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> and i ordered the chicken skewered tacos.  both were absolutely delicious.  what i liked most of the tacos were their portion sizes.  perfect for lunch so would not feel \"stuffed\".  i forgot to mention they had a peach martini.  very tasty and cute.  my fiance said he wished we had taken pictures of our food prior to eating.  we shared plates and the burger was quite juicy and thick.  be careful of the ketchep.  bobby found a way to spice that up too!  the fries were phenomenal.  sorry chris o but i have to totally disagree with you here.\n\nmesa grill is a place you should not avoid.  if you are in town for business and want a place to have a lunch meeting, mesa grill fits the bill.  also a great place for couples.", 
            "surprisingly good for a tourist trap. we popped in for lunch with no reservations and took advantage of a special anniversary special...three courses for $25. considering all the meals we have had in vegas, this was a relative bargain. standouts included <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark>, the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark>, bbq <mark>Barbecued Lamb Cobb Salad</mark>, and steak sandwich. all of these dishes shared bobby flay's signature sensibilities...a bit of heat, a touch of sweetness, maybe a bit of tang, and a mixture of textures. while service was attentive and efficient, we felt somewhat rushed. and while we found lunch to be a bargain at these prices, i don't know if i would feel the same way about these entrees at the much higher dinner prices. nevertheless, mesa grill was a pleasant surprise.", 
            "my aunt wanted to come here so badly on our last trip to vegas. she loves watching bobby flay and eventhough i am not really into his cooking, i wanted to make her happy. the hostesses were very nice because i had to change my reservation time and number of our party about 3 times but they didnt give me a hassle and were most gracious every time. they were the best part of this restaurant. \n\nwe were sat right in front of the main kitchen which was nice to see them grillin and cookin. we were given one small basket of breads, muffins and cakes since it was lunch time. for a party of 9, i didnt think it was enough but we just shared. the jalapeno biscuits were the best item in the basket. \nthe food: one common ingredient throughout....spice!\ni ordered the pumpkin soup which had great flavor, but was spicy with pepper and cumin. good, but too much spice for me. \nmost of us ordered the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> which was, nothing special. it was large but thats it. they serve it with a horseradish mustard which i dont like but pretty much other than that there was a piece of lettuce in it. \nthe fries that come with it were completely overly spiced up. i couldnt even see the fries! gross man, it was like eating a jar of mixed spice. yuck. two others got the salmon and it was just okay. \n\nthen the biggest flop by bobby flay ever. the pineapple upside down cake was so gross i had to force myself to swallow it. im so sorry but pepper does not belong in this dessert. this guys spices everything but not in a good way. we also ordered the chocolate cake dessert and it was not that great. \n\ni wouldnt recommend this restaurant with all the other choices in vegas.", 
            "bobby flay is abnormally egotistical and incredibly unlikable on tv at times, but his cooking--no complaints there. i've fallen in love with tex-mex, new american, whatever it is... it's freakin' fantastic.\n\nbrunch was nothing short of solid. we began with the rough cut tuna \"nachos\" (think ahi poke with tortilla chips). the mango-habanero hot sauce was absolutely to-die-for--sweet and spicy, it complemented the fresh tuna perfectly. \n\nnext we had the spicy chicken + <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> and the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark>. the hash was beautiful, flavorful, wonderful, especially with the green chile hollandaise sauce. the burger was huge and smoky, and the <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark> addictive. i love how all the dishes had a kick to them. foodgasm!\n\none of my favorite meals in vegas. bobby needs to open a restaurant in sf--i am willing to deal with his ego silence.", 
            "we (4) went for friday lunch with no reservation on the weekend of super bowl and only had to wait 5 minutes for a table.\n\nterrific service from our waiter who explained the highlights of the menu without talking down to us. \n\nfrom the margaritas and mojitos to the queso to the entrees everything was delicious and very flavorful. two of us had the huge <mark>Mesa Burger</mark>, one had the shrimp tacos and  i had the chicken & <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>.  \n\nas a matter of fact, it was so good that sunday my husband and i went back for brunch.  we were up a bit early (10:30am) and there weren't many places open for brunch (which we thought was odd) but in checking around we found mesa grill was open and had a brunch menu (rather than just the usual lunch fare that many restaurants serve).\n\nwe had the bacon & hash brown quesedilla topped with a fried egg (the bacon was smokey and wonderful) and the egg sirloin tortilla which is essentially fajitas with eggs & steak (and nice spicy garnishes).  the bread bowl mix was toward sweet breads (as one would expect) and they were all delicious.  and one of the best <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark> i've ever had.  \n\ni usually think most celebrity chef restaurants are forgettable and we'd planned just to stop for a drink and maybe an appetizer..., but this one was good enough to visit twice in one weekend.  i'll definitely be back!", 
            "just like everyone else, i came here cause hey, it's a bobby flay restaurant.  and well, i'm a big fan of iron chef and throwdown.  so i had high expectations and mesa grill did not disappoint.\nfirst of all, our waiter was excellent, although i forgot his name otherwise i would've gave him a shoutout on here.  he gave us some good recommendations and he really knew the menu.  based upon his recommendation we ordered the duck pancake.  i've only had duck at chinese and french restaurants, never at an american restaurant. the duck pancake was wow!  it was in some type of bbq sauce and the flavors just exploded in my mouth!  thank you waiter!\nfor the entree, i ordered the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark>.  i figured bobby flay has a whole book on grilling, so he must make a mean burger!  my burger was succulent, juicy, huge, and oh so flavorful.  this could be one of the best burgers in vegas?!  for $16 it was a deal!!  they are served with <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark>, probably the best seasoned fries i ever had.\nfor dessert, we had the chocolate bread pudding.  i'm a big fan of bread pudding regardless so it was a perfect way to end a perfect meal.  thanks bobby flay for the keeping my taste buds satisfied.", 
            "as a long time fan of food network, could not resist trying bobby flay's place. i was first of all pleased to find that the pricing was actually quite reasonable, lunch for three with tax and tips was about $150 including a super deluxe marguerita. the food was all excellent. i ordered chile rellenos, wife had <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>, which was really good and son had the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> (of course). all excellent, well seasoned, well presented. decor and atmosphere were all very nice, service excellent. the only slightly negative part of the experience was the waiter. he was a bit too opinionated. i do not mind recommendations, but he seemed a bit put out when we did not order what he thought we should. small thing maybe, but it somehow bothered me. still thoroughly enjoyed it, will go back.", 
            "3.5 stars\n\nservice was really good.  the restaurant itself was pretty nice and had a refreshing ambiance to it.  i had the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> which was really good.  my buddy had the enchilada and he said it was really tasty as well, and he's a picky eater. overall, i would definitely go back.\n\np.s. who the hell is bobby flay?", 
            "stumbled upon this place while in vegas, wandering aimlessly through the casino.  we thought \"hmmm...bobby flay?  ok i guess we will check it out.\"  \n\nat the time, we did consider the fact that neither my companion nor myself particularly cared for bobby flay, but we ignored that fact because, hey, he must be famous for a reason...his charm can get him only so far.  perhaps the man can cook.  plus, we were in the mood for mexican-like food.\n\nlesson learned: go with your first instinct.\n\nwe were there for brunch, and my date got a <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> which was small but presented very nicely.  the flavor was just ok and the burger itself was mediocre, but the grilled onion and horseradish mustard on the burger were very tasty.  <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark> were a bit firey and a little on the greasy side, but were an ok complement to an ok burger.\n\ni ordered <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark> and asked the waiter to give me a quick run-down of the veggies in it.  however, when it came, i found out that it had olives, which he failed to mention.  because the olive-flavor was so overpowering (and i dislike olives), i had to send it back.  my date dug into his sandwich, and my replacement salad did not come until he was nearly done the meal.  check minus on service.  \n\ni wouldn't be upset about the delay-time in getting my meal had this been my fault...however when you put something like olives (same goes for mushrooms or onions) in a <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark> and the diner inquires , you should be sure to remember to list the components that have strong or polarizing flavors.  he may have just forgotten but it was not busy at that hour, so i was a bit ticked (and hungry).\n\nside note - the bread basket had some decent items.  the blue corn cornbread muffins were really dry, the jalapeno bites were hit-or-miss on the \"heat\" factor depending on which you ate (perhaps some were mild and others spicy?), and the mini breakfast pastries were very good on sweetness and consistency.  stick to those for your pre-brunch-calorie-consumption.  \n\nthe only redeeming part of the meal were the cocktails.  i had a tequila/fresca cocktail that was light, refreshing, and not too sweet. it was delicious.  my date had a margarita which he claimed to be one of the best he's had...don't know how helpful that is, though, as he's generally not a margarita-guy.\n\noverall, food was mediocre at the high points and awful at the low points, service was spotty, drinks were great.  i would say i expected more from bobby flay, but as i said above, he was just never really my style, so what i really expected was mediocre - and it delivered just that.  expectations met.", 
            "this is the first time that i have been to mesa grill.  i have been to bar americain in new york city so i already somewhat knew to expect at a bobby flay restaurant.  my dinner when i went to bar americain was exceptional and i was expecting the same at mesa grill, but i think that my expectations were a little high.  \n\nwhat we ordered between the two of us:\n- <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>\n- <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark>\n- <mark>Mesa Burger</mark>\n- <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark>\n- buttermilk pineapple upside down cake\n- chocolate chip strawberry shortcake (dessert of the day)\n\npositives....\n- the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> was amazing.  by far my favorite thing that i have had at a bobby flay restaurant.  the shrimp was almost undercooked but was done enough to eat.  the filling of the tamale was sweet and there was an under tone of flay's famous heat in the sauces.  the corn-cilantro cream sauce was perfect to accent the tamale.\n- you could taste the quality of the meat of the burger.  it was exceptional and cooked perfectly.  you can hardly get your mouth around it because it is so large!  \n- the cake itself in the pineapple upside down cake was moist and delicious.\n- as always, the fries and flay's restaurants are great!  we had the <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark> with our meals and then were spicy but good!\n\nnegatives:\n- first off the server was an absolute snob so we got unlucky there.  i would have given this post 4 stars but took one away because of the server.  \n- the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> was served with the meat freezing cold.  i was very surprised by this.  the sandwich would have been much better if the meat wasn't cold.\n- when our server brought flay's \"famous\" bread basket to our table there were only two cold muffins in it that were clearly left from the night before.  one of my favorite parts of my flay meal in the past was the variety of breads in the basket.  the tables around us got a variety like i expected to get.  i attribute this to our sucky server.\n\noverall the meal was a positive one but i don't know if i will be back to mesa grill in the future but i definitely recommend the restaurant to any bobby flay fans that would like to experience his southwestern flavors.", 
            "bobby flay's recipes are flat out delicious, but i'm not sure if the price is worth what you get. the lounge atmosphere was nice (especially after a long day of travel!).\n\nfirst off, i am less than happy about the reservations setup there. my party had reservations for 10 for 12:30 and arrived about 15 minutes early ... but weren't seated until 15 minutes past our reservations. given they had known we were coming for nearly a month, and we'd confirmed the reservations earlier that day, they should have made sure everything was ready. the delay *wasn't* because the tables were all full, incidentally - where we sat was empty and clean and waiting for us when we arrived. i'm also less than happy about the upsell for bottled water - they didn't offer ice water when we seated (just bottled water - sparkling or flat) and implied tap water was not available.\n\nmy party ended up ordering the goat cheese (\"queso fundido\") with rajas and tortilla strips as an appitizer, and getting baskets of bread with a ciobatta, some sort of wheat bread with cranberries in it, and a chile cornbread. the queso fundido which was creamy and a little spicy and very delicious, and i could have happily eaten an entire order by myself. it wasn't as spicy as i had expected it to be, but that's ok, it was perfect with the goat cheese. the ciabatta and the wheat bread were great (i did eat almost the entire basket of that). i liked the chile cornbread, but thought it was really weak in the spice department and it was cold in the middle, like they had baked a bunch and froze them and just reheated it for lunch and got it in long enough that it was all thawed and the outsides were warmish, but the middle was still ice cold.\n\n\nfor entrees, many people ordered the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> (double cheddar, grilled vidalia onion, and horseradish mustard on a house roll with southwest fries). one person ordered the pressed cuban burger (which was a burger with ham, swiss cheese, pickles, dijon mustard, and roasted garlic mayo with adobo fries). i ordered the grilled mahi mahi, which came with a roasted pineapple-cascabel chile sauce and a pineapple-green onion salsa. one person ordered the yucatan chicken tacos (with grilled red onion and a peanut smoked chile bbq sauce), and the person next to me ordered the new mexico-style <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> (with grilled red onion, arugula, ancho-chile mayo, and southwest fries).\n\n\ni quite enjoyed the mahi mahi. the pineapple-chile sauce was spicy enough to give a nice kick to the fish, and the pineapple-onion salsa gave a balancing sweetness. i ended up using some bread to mop up the last of the chile sauce because it was that good (and i was that hungry!). everyone else seemed to quite enjoy their lunches as well.\n\nprice-wise, there was some grumbling at the end that it was a little expensive for what you get. in my opinion, it cost a little more than i thought it was worth, but not so much that i would never return. the service was good (the reservation and water upselling issues aside), the food was excellent.", 
            "everytime  i am in vegas i put the mesa grill on the rotation.  i have been here 5 times and each time was wonderful.  the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> is huge and amazing.  you can't go wrong with any of the seafood dishes.\n\nlove the atmosphere, the service, and the southwestern touch to all of the dishes.  for those that like to drink they have a nice tequilla selection and some fun cocktails.  your in vegas so have a few drinks and gamble a little.  i haven't had brunch so i have no comment about the brunch, but a great place for lunch or dinner.",

            "let me first start off by saying that this was one of the places that i was more excited to visit than any other place because i think bobby flay is a bad ass.  i like watching food network and i bobby flay always tries to bring the heat. bring the flavor.  bobby flay, i would be embarrassed to have my name associated with this restaurant.  we were seated to our table, and our waiter came out to speed read us our menu and his recommendations.  i started with a bloody and when my wife stated that water was all she wanted, the waited ignored her and showed her the drink menu, gave more opinions of what he would have etc etc.  when she reiterated that all she wanted was water, he glared, yes folks, glared and walked away.  so our food came out real fast... too fast... as in yeah we had this made already and just warmed it up a touch.  i don't need my food made from scratch each and every time, i just don't want it to taste like it was made days ago and reheated.  so i had the  <mark>Mesa Burger</mark>. double cheddar cheese. grilled vidalia onion. horseradish mustard.  asked for medium rare/medium.  got medium well/well.  if you are going to ask me how i want it cooked you should try to adhere to that level of \"cookedness\" ;-)  the burger was lack luster from bun to burger to onion to my mouth.  nothing about this burger was good aside from the horseradish mustard, which had a nice kick.  if i wanted a mediocre burger i would go to applebee's or something like that.  at least there i would not be let down with a bad tasting burger, i would expect it.  tiger shrimp and <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> is what my wife had.  oh course i ate some too, sharing is caring.  we agreed that the shrimp was overcooked.  i think that this dish would have been pretty good if the shrimp was not overcooked.  it surely had the potential.  the tamale was great, soft moist flavorful.  no wonder this dish has been on the menu since the opening of the restaurant. so overall this place was a let down.  i was looking for flavor and heat, really did not get any of that here.  i was so rushed through my meal and my waiter was so rude that it made me feel like i was at a fast food restaurant.  it seemed, however just an assumption, that once we declared only one cocktail per our table, hey we drank all day gambling and needed a break, it felt like the waiter saw us as a low profit table, and treated us thus.  really wanted to like this place. ;-(",

            "this restaurant was phenomenal, and i loved the service we got from this restaurant.  a few of us ordered the partida margarita, and it was delicious.  i highly recommend that margarita, and after 2 of those, you will feel good.  we started off with the queso fundido, and it was gone in a few minutes, the dish may or may not have been scraped to complete emptiness.  i ordered the blue <mark>Mesa Burger</mark>, it is big enough to split between 2 people, and their seasoned fries were tasty.  another person at the type ordered the chille burger with some sort of white cheese on it, it was really good.  burgers are huge here and worth every $$$$!  i loved the service, and i will come back when i go back to vegas.",

            "as some people know, i'm not bobby flay's biggest fan. i find him to be an arrogant jerk, something i'm sure he's heard before so i don't particularly feel bad about saying it. we went to mesa grill. \n\ni know he's supposed to be known for his burgers and what not, so i ordered the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark>, which came with seasoned fries. they bring a basket of bread to your table as you sit down, there's raisin bread, jalepeno bread and corn bread. i've been having a corn bread craving for a while and his was jam packed with jalepenos and corn, which is nice, but it lacked that buttery good moistness i'm used to in cornbread. the regular jalepeno bread was yummy. i even tried the raisin bread even though i don't particularly care for raisins, it was good, nothing outstanding. \n\nfinally my burger came. and i was excited. the fries looked well seasoned, only to find out that they're really well seasoned in the middle of the bowl but as you moved outwards it became blander. and there was no salt and pepper on the table, i understand the reasoning that if it's cooked well you don't need salt and pepper. but i kind of needed salt and pepper.  the fries were crisp and had a great crunch. the burger itself was very juicy. cheese, onions, spicy mustard on the side, ketchup also on the side, trying to get the condiments in was a hassle so i ended up dipping smaller pieces. overall, good burger, hearty, filling, comforting. can i get a better one for less than 16$, absolutely. \n\nhowever, i will absolutely give bobby this, that his staff is fantastically trained. our waiter went out of his way to take pictures of our table for us, going up to the rotisserie, taking pictures from the level above us, etc. it was very nice of him, he even offered us a free cappuccino after finding out we're college students (thus probably weren't going to order it anyway because of funds). he took really good care of us throughout our meal. so good job there, bobby but might want to have a look see at your food", 
            "we walked in 15 minutes before the doors opened for lunch on a tuesday and were the only ones there.  by the time we left 90 minutes later, the place was packed and the line wound outside and around the corner.  and with good reason.  \n\nshe started with the sweet potato soup.  it was perfection in a bowl. sweet, creamy without being heavy.  my goat cheese queso fundido with blue corn tortilla strips was cheesy, slightly spicy, with more than enough chips. really tasty.\n\nshe had a <mark>Mesa Burger</mark>, which might be the best burger she ever had.  cooked exactly as ordered (rare),it was thick, juicy and loaded with flavor.  even the bun stood out.\n\nmy cornmeal crusted chile relleno had a delicious crust loaded with great corn flavor.  the pepper itself could have spicier to my taste, but the cheese and sauce inside blended perfectly-a well presented lunchtime treat.\n\nwe both preferred the burger, but not because the chile was bad in any way.  the burger was just that good.\n\nwe'd return.", 
            "i had really been looking forward to eating here and scheduled my birthday lunch here while we were in vegas.\n\nthere were 4 of us and we were seated immediately for our 1pm reservation. i ordered a white peach margarita and it was delicious ($13). my husband got the margarita with the agave nectar in it and liked that as well ($16). i'd been studying the online menu for weeks and knew already that i was going to order the spicy chicken with <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>. \n\nthe bread was really nice. i liked the cheddar and jalapeno best. it was spicy and yummy.\n\nwe ordered the queso fundido to start. it was several cheeses (including goat!) with peppers and blue corn chips. yumola!!!! this was delicious.\n\nour entrees arrived and i cut into my poached egg and was unhappy to see the white was runny and gooey. that's not how a poached egg is supposed to be. a solid white, runny yolk is the norm. the hash was delicious, but some of the sweet potatoes were crunchy, not tender. they were clearly undercooked. my husband got the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> and we were surprised to see it came cold.  i took a bit and did not like it, but he said he did. our 2 other companions enjoyed their <mark>Mesa Burger</mark>.\n\ni sent my dish back and waited about 15 minutes for a new one. a manager brought over the new one and apologized for the mistake. i cut into my poached egg once again and the white was solid - yay!  but the yolk was completely solid too - boo!  why can't this place cook a poached egg correctly? i can do it and i can't cook worth shite.  so, the manager came back to ask how it was and i told him i've been waiting months to come here and i'm pretty unhappy with the way this dish came out. so he said he was sorry once again and said he would remove it from the bill. nice, but not what i wanted for my birthday lunch.\n\neven though it was my birthday, they didn't offer us a gratis dessert. we looked at the menu and nothing really stood out, so we passed.  disappointed overall, but parts of the meal were good enough for 3 stars.",

            "my husband and i were visiting las vegas and i knew my husband would love the food at mesa grill.  we decided to go for lunch since it is a bit pricey.  we arrived around 11:45 on a monday.   i was surprised by how crowded it was already.  we ordered two burgers - the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> for myself, my husband ordered green chile cheese burger ($16 each).  \n\nthen we waited... and waited... and waited.  the waiter apologized for the delay... and we waited some more.  finally we asked to speak to the manager.  by the time the manager came by we had received our food, 55 minutes later - for two burgers.  my husband explained the situation.  the manager was very nice, apologized, and told us there would be no charge for the burgers. \n\nthe food was great.  the fries were absolutely perfect - maybe the best i've ever had.  my only complaint is that the burger was so big i could hardly fit it in my mouth.  we enjoyed the food so much that we took a chance on ordering dessert and hoped it wouldn't take as long as our entrees did.  we ordered the chocolate pretzel tart with \nspicy peanut butter-chocolate swirl ice cream.  it was amazing.  i'm not usually that into spicy food, but somehow the spicy ice cream was the perfect compliment to the tart.  one of the most interesting desserts i've ever had.  \n\nwhen we asked our waiter for the check he told us the meal was on the house - entrees, dessert, drinks, everything - and he hoped we would come back.  we gave him a very nice tip (i don't think the food delay was his fault at all).  to top it off, the manager approached us again on the way out and apologized for the service and he, too, invited us to come back again.\n\nat the time the wait for the food was really, really frustrating, but we were very satisfied with the manner in which the manager and server handled the situation, and the food is delicious.  we'll definitely return again.",

            "dear bobby,\ni have been a very long-time fan of yours and i have long anticipated eating at one of your restaurants. i was thrilled to get the chance to eat at your place in caesar's palace. while i enjoyed very much the cactus pear margarita and the goat cheese queso fundido, i was very disappointed by our server as well as the quality of the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> my husband and i shared. \nlet me start with our server. if his presentation style was anymore negative about what wasn't available on the menu that afternoon, we might have left had we not really wanted to try your food and been as hungry as we were. it's one thing to be out of something but it was the way he said it. \"just so you know and don't get your heart set on it, we are out of the ribs. they aren't that good anyway\" was how it was presented. hmmm. not good. he then described the tuna \"nachos\" as being more tuna tar-tar with a side of tortilla chips and said \"unless you like raw tuna, this isn't for you\". um...ok. you get the point. this guy clearly needed some training. and i won't throw him under the bus and name him here but email me if you want to know more.\nas for the burger. i'll go back to our server....we ordered the burger to share and ordered it medium well. he repeated it back to us, medium well and confirmed we wanted to split the order. when the burger arrived, it was all on one plate. i figured he didn't tell the expediter or just didn't note it on the order. we wait a couple minutes and he finally appears with 2 plates and a knife for us to split the burger ourselves. um...ok. i cut into the burger and it is rare. ok, rare is an understatement. it was raw. blood raw. definitely not medium well like we ordered and he confirmed. so we had to flag down a waiter as ours had conveniently disappeared. he came back and said that we had told him medium rare. um...no we didn't. we never eat anything rare and he had repeated back to us what we wanted which is why i knew he knew what we ordered and just wanted to put it on us. so a new burger came a few minutes later and while that wasn't medium well either, it was a lot better than the raw that we got initially. unfortunately, your chefs feel the need to ridiculously overseason the burgers to the point where you can hardly taste the burger itself. and the fries? ugh. an over-seasoned, over fried mess. there was a coating on the fries that totally took away from the potato flavor of the fries. \nquite honestly, this first visit to one of your restaurants was a huge disappointment. i expect more from someone of your caliber and while you didn't cook any of this yourself, this was a representation of your brand. i don't know if that is fair or not, but i guess if you are going to put yourself in the position of being on a pedestal by being on television, you need to hold those who are running your brand to a higher standard. if this is what your restaurants are putting out, i think that you need to spend less time at food network and more time in your restaurants.  please read my review on holsteins and visit their restaurant to see how to really get things done. \nthanks for reading this and i hope you will take it to heart....even though i figure you'll probably never see this and those who really should see it won't really do anything about it. good luck...",

            "wow!  loved it. tuna nachos. sweet potato soup and <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> made for a wonderful lunch. my wife and i left very happy!!! thanks mesa grill.", 
            "sadly this place only get's 2-stars and here's why.\n\nthe place is beautiful, clean and well staffed. we explained to the hostess that we were in a bit of a time crunch so we couldn't take a leisure lunch. we had a plane to catch and needed food first.\n\nwe were seated promptly after a brief sit in the lovely waiting area.  our waiter greeted us and informed us he was aware we were in a bit of a time crunch.  he asked if we wanted waters and would bring the drink menu for us.\n\nwe got our waters and ordered drinks. i ordered one of their signature margaritas - the waiter explained the different between the (i think) 4 of them.  i choose the one he indicated was the sweetest some sort of cactus.  i found it to be less sweet than expected - but it was very good.  he then took our food order.\n\nthere were three of us and i'll list all our food and comment on those items i tried.\n\n<mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark> - with her own special dressing + crispy tortillas --- 13.  my friend ordered it and she loved it - i also tasted it and it was very good, seemed fresh, and had a bunch of interesting things in it. i loved the dressing.\n\nyucatan chicken skewers - peanut - smoked chile barbecue sauce, flour tortillas, pickled red onion + mint --- 16.  beware - the peanut smoked chile barbecue sauce is very spicy - while i enjoyed it - my friend felt it was just a bit too hot and didn't really come with a \"warning\". she's not a fan of spicy food and avoided dipping her chicken into this. this dish was served with the tiniest flour tortillas.\n\n<mark>Mesa Burger</mark> - double cheddar cheese, grilled vidalia onion + horseradish mustard served with <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark> --- 18.  you like cheese? then you'll love this burger. it was ordered medium well and it came that way. meat was very tasty - but i am not a fan of cheese.  the <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark> were a bit salty.\n\nhot smoked salmon club <mark>Spicy Mango - Glazed Bacon</mark>, avocado, tomato, arugula, chipotle aioli + <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark> --- 18.  this is what i ordered. i love seafood and was excited to try a smoked salmon club.  it came cut in half (thank you!) and was piled high with a cold smoked salmon mixture like the way tuna salad is mixed. you could taste the smoke and it reminded me of alder wood smoked salmon from the pacific northwest. the bacon was thick and cooked to perfection. lots of avocado. basically all the toppings were fresh and yummy and the sandwich oozed out from all angles. i loved the chipotle aoili sauce and actually used it to dip my fries into. i also felt the fries were a bit salty but dipping into the sauce sort of muted the over saltiness.  this sandwich is not a hot sandwich.\n\nhere's the reason mesa grill only get's 2 stars - within an hour after eating my hot smoked salmon club - i became sick ... i was in the cab on the way to the airport when it started to hit me and i was like oh great! i'm about to have to wait in lines and my luck there would be no bathroom for miles!!  i warned my friends and one offered some imodium - which i promptly took without water (yuck)!!  this same friend ate the other half of my sandwich on the way to the airport - so i warned her to be careful.  sure enough while loading onto the plane - she told me she wasn't feeling well either ... so that being said - 2 stars. you made me and my friend sick with your bad salmon!  i subtract a star for each time i had to run to the restroom with salmon revenge!!\n\nthe decor was beautiful and like i said waitstaff was terrific. serving bad salmon is no bueno!", 
            "i ordered the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark>. i think this was the best burger i ever had in my life! definitely going to come back here next time i visit vegas. good job, bobby flay.", 
            "we came here for the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> and that is what we got.\n\nlet me say 1st that beware making a reservation via open table. we did and the cancellation policy states that if you don't cancel by the time they say, you will be charged. well, that time that was associated was the day before! wth?! yup, if we didn't cancel the reservation over 24 hours before we made it, we'd get charged. go figure. warning, you do have to leave a credit card to make a reservation.\n\ni talked with the manager and he said the cancellation policy was not so. well, i showed him i-phone shots of our reservation (which i did not make) and he was astounded. he said he'd look into it.\n\nanyway, without a reservation, we got a table for two immediately, just before a convention let out across the hall and the restaurant flooded with people. beware this point. i don't know how you would check, but if a convention is in residence and a seminar lets out, it's going to be tough to get seated.\n\nso, onto the food. \n\n1st, the margarita. wow!...just wow! outstanding! beautifully done and tasted great. in fact, i could go for one right now! :)\n\nnext, the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> * double cheddar cheese\ngrilled vidalia onion + horseradish mustard served with <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark>. it, too, was great. a definite keeper and something i'd go back for again. the meals around us looked equally delicious (my wife is a particular fan of meal stalking others, afraid she might miss the better dish).\n\nlastly, before we got out meal, we were served with beautifully baked bread and spicy corn muffins. a real treat.\n\nso, the downfall? well, it's extremely noisy since it's open to the casino and you can smell the cigarette smoke lingering.\n\nall in all, a great burger is what we came for and that was what we got....with a bonus superb margarita and bread. yummy!", 
            "i love you bobby flay!\n\nnever had brunch this sexy and sophisticated! what a great place to dine when you don't want to wait for hours to get inside the bacchanal buffet or if you're simply looking for a great restaurant in vegas.\n\nlove the american southwest inspired interior. it's bright and colorful, but not obnoxious and has a non intimidating fine dining feel. food was amazing and very memorable. we came on a saturday brunch, and they serve traditional american brunch fare with a south-western twist. \n\nwe had\n-complimentary pastries -blue corn bread, mini jalapeno biscuits, coffee cake with butter on the side. everything was yummy!\n-<mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> $18- everyone's fav so i had to get it. 4 pieces of tiger shrimp on a bed of housemade tamale with roasted garlic cream sauce on top. it was was mix of a bit sweet from the tamale and savory from the shrimp and garlic sauce. amazing. get it! \n-<mark>Blue Corn Buttermilk Waffle</mark> $14 - crispy on the outside, light and soft on the inside. the bluecorn gave it a nutty flavor to the waffle. it's different and i liked it. it also had had enough black berry syrup that's not too sweet and the creme fraiche on top to cuts the sweetness. so good!\n<mark>Spicy Mango - Glazed Bacon</mark> $4.50- recommended by our server. 2 thick strip of their house cured bacon with mango glaze on top. wow! never thought of mango with bacon and it's delicious! \n-<mark>Mesa Burger</mark> $18- perfectly cooked beef patty, double cheddar and grille onion. so simple yet delicious. it came with <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark> (french fries with chili powder) and horseradish mustard dip. get it!\n\nservice was great. our server was very nice and attentive. the table next to us was actually very rude to our server, but he remained professional and killed them with kindness. i also asked if bobby ever comes to visit and he said about 3x a year since he is a very busy man.", 
            "in vegas with my daughter. she loves bobby flay and had decided to have last meal (lunch).\n\ngood decor, expected simple, but great food. our appetizer, goat cheese \"queso fundido\"  was creative and very good. daughter ordered spicy chicken + <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>. this too was very simple, creative dish as expected with flay perfection. \nwish i had been more adventurous, went with a <mark>Mesa Burger</mark>.\n\nburger was ordered as 'medium'. got served with cold fry's and they replaced it in a timely fashion. very disappointed with the burger...... it was way over cooked, heavy char-grill. now running out of time to leave for airport, did not bother calling server. left it uneaten with couple of bites. told server of my order and he just ignored it with no apology not did he offer to take it off the bill.\n\ntaking it off the check is not an issue, in my opinion, prices are very reasonable. other wise it was a good experience, but the burger and the server's attitude left a sour note.", 
            "the atmosphere here is nice. this place is in the middle of caesars & that itself is a maze to get through (especially after a couple drinks). i have eaten here many times. the first few times many years ago, i fell in love. the cuban pressed burger!!!!! i don't need to say anymore about that other then...it's gone!!\ni have had other dishes, but most recently the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark>. it's really good, very juicy & large enough for a big appetite. even though my favorite burger of all time is no longer available (hasn't been for years) i'll still come here as the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> is very good.\n\nplease bring back the cuban!!!!!", 
            "my wife, friend and i stopped into mesa grill on our way out of vegas after checking out of our hotel.  it's long been on my bucket list and now i was going to finally see what the hype was all about.\n\nwe sat at the bar which was great as the bartenders were extremely friendly and chatted with us the whole time.  it's our feeling that we could get a table with a server that only wants to take our order and drop off food and who might snicker at you if you are trying to split share an entree, or you can sit at the bar with a bartender that doesn't care what you order to eat and they'll chat with you all day.  it's an easy decision ;)\n\nwe ordered the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> (9/10) and the tuna nachos (10/10) and the southwestern salad (9/10).  all were excellent.  we washed it all down with the mesa grill margarita and boy what a nice send-off out of vegas!\n\ncan't wait to come back and try some of the more \"fringe\" entrees ;)", 
            "i can't believe this place was as empty as it was on a saturday afternoon. i'm guessing it gets busier at night, but i have no idea. the food was exceptional, and the service exemplary. \n\ninstead of bread, they bring you a basket of little breads, muffins and pastries. we didn't eat all of them, but got them to give us a doggy bag for late night snacks. \n\nthe <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> was soooooo good i'm still dreaming about the sauces it came with. 5 star dish all the way!\n\nwe also got the tuna \"nachos.\" these aren't really nachos - they give you small tortilla potato chips basically you use to scoop up the raw chunks of tuna and the two sauces it comes with - a habanero sauce that wasn't too spicy and an avocado crema.\n\nalso, we ordered the shrimp tacos. they were delicious - i don't know what bobby flay puts in those sauces (other than copious amounts of butter) but i can't get enough. the tortillas are unlike any i've had before, but they might just be the most perfect tortillas ever - soft and strong so that they don't fall apart. \n\nwill be back for the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> next time i'm in vegas.", 
            "skip the bread basket! the breads are just ok, not worth filling up on. i had the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark>, which beats the one i had at burgr. the bun was amazing! and i want well done meat, which was what i got. daughter had the <mark>Ranch Style Eggs Tostada</mark> and said it was very good. server anna was perfect, as was the rest of the team. they all work together really well.", 
            "decor was nice. be warned if you want to eat at a table as they will ask you to remove any baseball caps. alternative is to eat at the bar however everyone needs to be 21 years old. \n\nwe sat at a table all the way at the back where you can view the sports betting area. these tables are a bit weird though and best avoided ( see picture) as the have a large mound like bit under the table which you end up having to place your feet on. it feels odd and uncomfortable. go for the four legged table instead on the lower level.\n\nwe had spicy peppers cheese dip and blue corn tortillas for started which was excellent! for the main we had medium rare <mark>Mesa Burger</mark>. it was good. caramelized onions, cheese and served with some excellent mustard ( english i think) the fries were great. my brother had the shrimp tacos. he said it was good but it was too pricey for what you get. 6 shrimp, two soft tacos and some salad stuff. tasty but not worth the price. best avoided! would i come back, maybe.  i thought the food was good but did feel it was a bit pricey. it probably deserves 3 1/2 stars.", 
            "4th time eating here. the food never disappoints and is one of the most consistent in las vegas. \n\nthis time, we had the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> and the <mark>Barbecued Lamb Cobb Salad</mark>. both were very tasty. the salad was well balanced. we started with the tuna tartare nachos, which was a knockout. \n\nservice can vary but was very good this time."

            "my buddy and i were looking for lunch and chose mesa over gordon ramsey burger. we were not disappointed. the service was great. all servers answered all of our questions and catered to our requests (ie. sauce on the side) with a smile. both the agave margarita and the ice tea were great. being from texas i expected a bigger margarita, but it was very good. the <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark> is very good texans.\n     free bread basket 2 different breads and a blue corn muffin. that was an unexpected bonus.\n     for entrees we ordered a <mark>Green Chile Cheeseburger</mark> and a regular burger, both with fries. perfect medium, great buns, well seasoned, juicy. these burgers were big enough that no dessert was needed.\n     if you are looking to try out an \"iron chef's\" restaurant, at a good price, you cant go wrong here @ lunch.",

            "not a bad brunch. the <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark> was tasty and quite refreshing. the goat cheese queso fundido was amazing! my wife can't take a lot of spice, so we got the blistered serrano vinaigrette on the side, which proved to be a wise call, though it was tasty. \n\nthe main dishes just weren't quite as successful, though. my wife got the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> chilaqules which were supposed to have a tomatillo sauce. i make my own tomatillo sauce all the time, and this wasn't one. it was made from hatch chilies or something similar. she didn't really enjoy it. \n\ni got the <mark>Green Chile Cheeseburger</mark> and wasn't terribly impressed. it was just too heavy and was in desperate need of acid or something to brighten it up. the fries, however, were delicious and well seasoned. \n\ni'm sure some other main dishes might be more successful, but the apps, teas, and fries were world class.", 
            "our lunch was 16 <mark>Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad</mark>, <mark>Green Chile Cheeseburger</mark>, <mark>Baby Romaine Salad</mark> and goat cheese queso. thumbs up on all the dishes. one drawback for vegetarians is that they couldn't separate the chicken from the chicken & black bean quesadilla, because they said it was pre-mixed.  peaceful interior, not infused with casino music.", 
            "we came here last thursday and this was the best lunch i've had in a while. i was pretty food happy after this visit and maybe a little sleepy too lol. i feel really bad that i forgot our server's name because he was super friendly and definitely not stuffy or high-nosed like some servers at higher end places. \n\npeach magarita:  i don't normally like margaritas because i prefer sweet or citrusy drinks but i really liked this one. it tasted more like a white sangria because there was barely any sourness so i enjoyed it.\n\npan roasted shrimp: this is the one i ordered and it  came with creamy green chile rice and smoked chile butter. the flavor was amazing and shrimp was big. it was also the perfect size since it was on the rich side. i could definitely see myself craving this for a creamy seafood fix.\n\n<mark>Green Chile Cheeseburger</mark>: my boyfriend ordered this one but as usual i tasted it too lol it was a perfect medium rare and was very tender and juicy. it came with a slightly spicy queso sauce, roasted poblanos and pickled red onions. yummm! \n\n<mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark>: these came with the burger and were the best fries i've had in a while. super flavorful and whatever you do, ask for a side of peppered mayo. our server asked if we wanted some so we were like sure, why not. i was expecting well, pepper in mayo lol  but what we got was this tangy zesty sauce and it was soo good that my boyfriend even put it on his burger.\n\nnow let's talk their chocolate cajeta cake with vanilla swirl ice cream and salted chocolate crunch. i am in love. head over heels in love. my boyfriend is rolling his eyes while i'm saying this lol but really. i am warning you though, this is sweet tooth craving to the extreme. it was almost a little too sweet and rich for me after the first few bites but i am the type of person that will choose chocolate over any savory meal any day. soo if you're chocolate monster like i am, go for it!\n\nwe will definitely be back to try dinner and most likely for lunch again as well! a+ for mr.bobby flay.",

            "we had lunch last week. i had the <mark>Green Chile Cheeseburger</mark> which was good but very hard to eat. the cheese kept coming out the sides of the burger with every bite, very messy. the fries were very good. my partner got the southwestern spice chicken skewers. there were 3 skewers per order. the first 2 skewers were fine, the third was raw just under the surface. when we told the waiter he at first said \" we use pink salt so that is probably what this is\", this chicken was raw! once the chef saw the chicken, the manager came to the table and apologized profusely and offered to fire another order which we declined, they did insist on comping the chicken. one of the things i really wanted to do in vegas was to eat at mesa because i have made many of bobby's recipes in the past and love his flavors. i have to say i wasn't wowed and i was very surprised at the chicken. i am definitely going to bar american in nyc to see if the quality is better. i sure hope so."

            "i had brunch here with 7 other friends. the order was as follows (best to worst, 1-6): \n\nbread assortment (complimentary)\nthere were about four different kinds. a couple of them were a little spicy with jalapeno, very good overall. \n\n(3) queso fundido $12\na light goat cheese fondue with bits of peppers served with blue tortilla chips. i've had this one before at the nyc location and it's consistently good.\n\n(1) spicy chicken + <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> $18\ngreat breakfast dish. it came with with poached eggs and a green chile hollandaise sauce.\n\n(1) <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> chiliquiles with roasted tomatillo sauce\nwhite cheddar cheese + creme fraiche $14\nanother great dish. it came with one of the same sauces as the chicken dish, but it was a solid sauce.\ni had no clue what chiliquiles were, so here's the wikipedia for your reference:\n\nchilaquiles is a traditional mexican dish consisting of fried or dried tortilla chips, bathed in green or red salsa or mole and broiled or grilled with a cheese topping. sometimes chicken strips are mixed into the sauce, or the dish can be served with a fried egg on top or a strip of meat alongside.\n\nthey are most commonly eaten at breakfast time, served alongside with fried or <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> or a mexican style grilled beef. moreover, chilaquiles are often lauded as a cure for the common hangover.\n\nunlike nachos, which are served as a crispy snack, chilaquiles are a main dish and are not served until the tortilla chips are thoroughly soaked and softened by the salsa. this makes them a popular recipe for stale chips or those with a bad taste as the other flavors mask the chips'.\n\n(5) <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> $16\nthe most memorable part of this dish was the price. the fries were pretty good; crispy outside, seasoned well. but, nothing special about the burger.\n\n(6) <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> with grilled red onion, arugula, and\nancho-chile mayonnaise $15\ni thought this was the worst of the dishes. the beef was tender, but it lacked flavor, was too thin, was initially served cold and the bread was too thick for the sandwich. the waiter said the previous bakery burned down and they were testing new bread. the ancho mayo was good, but the flavor was overpowered by the 2 lbs. of bread.\n\n(4) grilled mahi mahi with roasted pineapple-cascabel chile sauce and caramelized pineapple-green onion salsa $24\ni was hung over, which is the only way i could why i order this dish. the sauce was good and the fish seemed to be lightly scented with honey. the texture was a little dry. overall, not worth $24. the waiter said it was the best thing on the menu, maybe he meant the priciest thing on the menu.\n\nmy friend got a <mark>Spicy Bloody Mary</mark>. i'm not a fan of tomato juice or blood for that matter, but it looked of pretty good quality. \n\nservice\nvery slow. starting with the water, to the other drinks, to the bread, to the starter, and ending with the entrees. they were consistent with it, at least. and still kind of pissed that he recommended the mahi mahi.\n\nso, what did we learn? for brunch, stick to the br and stray from the unch. based on my experience in nyc, you may want to try dinner also and stick to red meat.", 
            "i'm not the biggest bobby flay fan... not especially on american iron chef but i figured i would give his food a chance after my third time in vegas this summer.\n\nwe couldn't get dinner reservations on our first night so we went there for lunch yesterday.  service was good from the moment we stepped into the restaurant.  it's not such a fancy shmancy restaurant actually.  it's decent... but nothing that'll make you go 'wow!'.  maybe a little dated?  i don't know.... can't put my finger on one specific thing.\n\nwe got a couple of magaritas which were ok... my white peach one was well... peachy and a little like... ummm... cough syrupy lol but i don't think that's the fault of the bartender... \n\nfor appetizers, i got the blue corn pancake with duck (probably my first time ordering duck prepared non-chinese way) and my husband got the rough chopped raw tuna taco.  yes we had to admit, we were impressed!  they said the tuna would be very spicy and while it didn't turn out to be super spicy (we are serious spicy food eating folks) it did have a very nice kick.  my duck was tasty and the combination of the flavors came together very nicely.\n\ni'd initially intended to order the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> but the waitress swayed me to order flay's signature dish the cuban burger sandwich... plus it came with fries so i relented very easily :)  the husband got the spicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> (not spicy at all).  well, they were good but it was kind of disappointing... sort of blah... after the two great appetizers.  both servings were also very big... so make sure you are ready to share :)  if you like thin crispy fries like me, they have good fries here.  not the best (shultzy's seattle) i've had but good.\n\nit was a good experience.  we left happy but decided it was not a place that left us planning to come back soon.  if it was a group of people and suggested this place, we would come back but we wouldn't suggest it.  ...it is a good menu to please a large audience :)\n\nbtw, if you can't get reservations and they offer you to walk-in and try a table at the \"lounge area\"... don't!  it's merely a bunch of low narrow chairs around two low tables... not a place i would have a meal!", 
            "overall, i was disappointed by this iron chef america restaurant.  \n\njust so everyone has full information, i do not like bobby flay.  on iron chef he is so cocky, and i bet you nine times out of ten, his dishes will consist of the secret ingredient plus some blended sauce made of tomatillos and habaneros.  but, i have also watched his throwdown show, and people seem to like his food.  and the guy looks like he can grill up some mean meat.  so i was excited to try his restaurant.         \n\non to the review:\n\nmy friend made the reservation for six people and they took her credit card down because if you're late or miss the reservation, they will charge you $50 per person!  needless to say, we were on time.\n\nbread basket:  the free bread basket they bring you at the start of the meal was really good.  it is an assortment of muffins, coffee cake, and breads.  i must say that the jalapeno cheddar bread was damn good.     \n\nappetizers:  the rough cut tuna nachos were good, but small portions.  7 tiny chips to be exact.  i know because after each of us only took one chip, there was only one left on the plate.  the fish was fresh and tasty, but the sauce may have been a little bit too sweet for me.  the bacon and <mark>Crispy Bacon  Hash Brown Quesadilla</mark> was nothing special.\n\nentrees:  i though bobby flay, have to get a meat dish, right?  so my friend and i both ordered the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark>.  i wouldn't order it again.  the sandwich was dry and just didn't do anything for me.  very little pork for such thick bread.  french fries were good with a nice little spice to them.  the steak tartar was good, the best entree in my opinion.  the spicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> was just weird tasting.  i did not like it all, but maybe that's just my tastes.  the egg and steak dish was bleh....steak, eggs, tortilla, salsa, sour cream, and guacamole, it wasn't baaad per se, just not great.  my other friend ordered the spicy egg dish which i did not try because i don't particularly care for goat cheese, however, the ham that came with it was pretty good, but not spectacular.  \n\ndessert:  we got the chocolate cake, which was good, but i've had way better at other places.  nothing transcendent here.  \n\neveryone in my group felt the same way about the food...disappointing.  i wouldn't return back there to eat.  our waiter was really good, and the decor is nice inside.  (but isn't the decor nice in all vegas hotel restaurants?)  i would give it 2 1/2 if we could give 1/2s.  my advice:  skip it (at least for brunch).", 
            "i was pleasantly surprised with mesa grill, as i did not expect much from this place because i thought it would dissapoint me from all the hype.  however, after eating there for lunch, i have to admit it was one of the best meals i've had in awhile!  i was able to try a lot because i was with a big group of friends.  the ambiance of the place was comforting and the decor was really nice.  \n\nyou can definitely taste the southwestern flare in his food.  their goat cheese, queso fundido appetizer was delicious.  the toasty, subtle taste of the goat cheese did not overpower my palette, which was good.  the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> was delicious, and for $15 it was definitely worth it.  \n\nthe prices here were very reasonable, considering what you got and compared to other restaurants in vegas.  the service was also very good.  i will definitely come back here!", 
            "i would give this a 3.5 but no halvies. i only went for lunch so i can't rate if it's a 5-er without it.  we (as always if there is a we that means husband and i) went mainly because it's a bobby flay restaurant so that swayed us. also- with so many choices of good places, the menu looked good. \nit was an early lunch because we were starvino and just got off the plan a few hours before. \nso we had the wild mushroom quesadilla as a starter. as a disclaimer, i think anything with truffle oil tastes good. i also love mushrooms. it was really good- i like the crunch to the  quesadilla and the hummus on a quesadilla was new to me and beats the questionable tomato salsa with the salmonella scare.\nso-how do you review eating a salad? it's pretty much greens and meat right?  i had the  16 <mark>Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad</mark>. the rub on the chicken was pretty flavorful and i've only started ordering chicken at restaurants (personal reasons but sometimes i think eating chicken at restaurants is a waste- but hey it's salad).  overall it's a good salad and goat cheese is probably my favorite cheese.\nmy husband had the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> which was really tender. the fries had a kick to it.\nto digress (or not) bobby flay is all about simple food with lots of flavoring. the husband summed it up that you can either go totally wrong with all the spices or it works.  i think it works for him.\nyes- we start drinking once we hit the ground in vegas. i had a special drink of the day a watermelon margarita...really refreshing and not watered down. there is enough water in the watermelon! husband is a mojito and wished for more mojitos. the glassware is super cute.\ni think they gave us 3 kinds of breads, memorable was the spicy jalepeno corn muffin. i watched a bobby flay showdown episode where they had the kentucky browns which he served in his restaurant. i saw it on the menu but thought it would be too heavy for me, so i live in a world of regret. jk\nservice i can't say much for. we were early so we were jocked and they were very nice and attentive. i thought they were good. \nif i were you- i'd try it. if you are waiting in line for pure- maybe one stooge of a friend can sit there while you enjoy a drink and appie and trade off. if i go back for dinner- i'll revise.", 
            "went here for lunch in an effort to save a little money.  \n\nstarted with the pear cactus margaritas - i thought they were really good, even though they were $13 each.  \n\nappetizer - blue corn duck.  wow.  so good!\n\ni got the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> with <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark>, and it was fantastic.\n\nmy husband got the grouper.  this is where the star got lost.  not only did they originally bring the wrong thing, but when they finally did bring out the grouper dish, it was suspiciously undercooked in the middle, which unfortunately led to some stomach issues later on for poor hubs :(\n\nthey didn't take it off our bill, or even offer any sort of discount, and hubs had to wait a good 10 minutes for his dish to arrive while i ate my lunch.  bad, bad, bad.\n\nit's tough....i had a great food experience, but i'm knocking off a star because of the grouper incident.", 
            "eh, maybe im a hard critic! but the only thing memorable there was the fact that i knew who bobby flay was before going the restaurant and their <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> was the best i've ever tasted, hands down.\ni was recommended to get fresh fish, so i got their grilled salmon even though it didn't look that interesting. my salmon tasted like cumin; and to me, cumin tastes like bad b.o. my friend's <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> was just whatever...not there is out of the extrodinary besides their <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>! i'll probably give it another chance the next time im in vegas, just cuz it's bobby flay! so why not...as long as i don't have to pay, im good almost anywhere=)",

            "ate here for brunch at around 130pm and lemme tell u, the food, service, and atmosphere was awesome!  first off we got seated and when we got our water my auntie had a water bottle and the waiter even asked us if she wanted him to pour her water for her. now that's what i call service.  they even changed our knives and forks after eating our appetizer while even setting our knives and plates in the right positions.  as for the food the complimentary bread basket with jalapeno cheddar biscuits, scones, blue corn muffins, and blueberry coffee cake was all way delish.  for the entree omg it was so good, it was a bacon potato quesadilla and it was so delish and i don't even really like bacon but it was goooood.  for our entrees we all loved what we got i got the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> with ham biscuits and grits and the eggs were the most fluffy soft eggs i've ever had in my life.  eating the grits for the first time so good.  my aunite got the green chile cilequilles (sp) and it was really good.  my uncle got the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> with pepper fries and he like it, my other uncle got this make ur own steak sandwich with eggs and the works with <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark> and he also liked it.  overall we all really loved this place and agreed that it was the best meal we had!", 
            "first time experience at the mesa grill in caesar's palace. decided to try lunch on a wednesday and thought that it might be a good idea to go in on tuesday and make a reservation. but once we found out that we would be charged $50 per person if our group of four cancelled after 9:00 a.m. on wednesday monring we decided to just take our chances and show up as walk ins. ( i mean really, it's vegas! i won't even be awake until noon so how could i call and cancel before 9:00 a.m.?) don't know if that would work on a weekend, but we did fine walking in at 1:30 on a wednesday.\n\nfirst, the service: wonderful! attentive without being obtrusive. friendly without being overly chummy. obviously a restaurant that puts some time and energy into training the wait staff, which i appreciate. \n\nnext, the food: also wonderful! i had the fixed price lunch menu for $29. you get a choice of one of two appetizers, one of two entrees and the chef's special dessert. price-wise it's like getting dessert for free. for the appetizer i had the blue corn grilled duck pancake which was like a soft taco with shredded duck in the most delicious barbecue sauce i have ever tasted. buffalo burger for the entree - quite good though a little dry. that's the buffalo meat tho' which is very lean. the dessert was warm chocolate cake which was excellent - not overly sweet, just the taste of good chocolate. and they had great coffee!\n\nmy husband had the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark>, which he expected to be hot but was served cold. very tasty though. two young adults with us had the coffee-rub steak sandwich which was very good - tender meat that was easy to eat sandwhich style and french fries with a slightly spicy seasoning.\n\nthe menu has so many interesting sounding dishes that we will certainly be back to try more. i thought the prices were fair for las vegas, particularly on the lunch menu - things are a little pricier at dinner. except for the idea of charging people $50 each for missing a reservation, i thought this was a great restaurant.", 
            "underwhelmed by our experience at the mesa grill today. not sure why they only offer a brunch menu for saturday lunch. so there were like 14 dishes with eggs and about 3 for \"real\" lunch. so we ordered the 16 dollar <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark>. not bad, but be warned that the meat is chilled on a crispy panini type roll. i guess i wish we could have really experienced a better selection to feel the full range of flay, but it wasn't meant to be today. might return, but likely not.",

            "i had high hopes when i stopped by mesa grill for lunch in october of '09.  one would think that, given bobby flay's status as a iron chef, his propensity to whore himself out for food network top billing, and his smattering of establishments around the country that the food would be appropriately awesome.  i wouldn't expect it to be, for example, joel robuchon or thomas keller good---but at least as good as any other celebrity chef restuarant in vegas.\n\nmesa grill, on the day i happened to dine there, was the worst restaurant i'd ever been to.  easily.  i'm talking mcdonald's bad.  perhaps even subway bad.  \n\nthe service was slow and forgetful.  there was plenty of staff to go around so nobody was over-committed with tables.  they were just slow.  and forgetful.  and slow.  i ordered a chicken and blackbean quesadilla for an appetizer.  i followed that with the spicy <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark>.\n\nboth dishes were bland.  very, very boring and bland.  there was no spice.  there was little flavor.  the presentation was tired, the flavors were muted, and the texture of all the food reminded me of fish cooked under a heat-lamp and then microwaved.  my <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> was cooked rare and served cold.  really?  i can understand, perhaps, serving the meat at room temperature but a cold, raw, <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> shouldn't be served to dogs, much less paying guests.\n\nthe decor is nice.  the location is nice.  the drinks are good.  the menu has a nice selection---which serves to trick you into thinking the food is actually tasty, hot, and worth money.  if this restaurant is in any way representative of the bobby flay line of establishments then our dear iron chef needs to spend more time being a chef and less time playing one on tv.  \n\ni would never recommend anyone go here.  trust the food blogs, critics, and professionals who have given mesa grill consistently low marks over the course of its vegas run---it truly is a terrible restaurant and an embarassment to \"spicy\" and \"flavorful\" cuisine everywhere.  shame on you bobby flay.  shame.", 
            "i really liked mesa grill.  yes, i went here because of bobby flay.  no, i don't think he's pretentious (but maybe he is, i've never met him :p).\n\nthey first brought out some breads -- blueberry spice muffin of some sort, jalapeno corn bread, fruit scone, coffee cake.  i was surprised that it wasn't just regular bread and butter but i liked it more!  jalapeno corn bread was a bit bland though so it could use a little something.  the blueberry spice muffin thing was a bit strange.  the coffee cake was pretty good!\n\nto drink, i got the <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark>.  the waiter wasn't hesitant to recommend this one, and i'm really glad i got it.  tastes mainly just like <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark> but has a subtler sweetness from the pear, though i have to admit i didn't taste the \"cactus.\"  they also brought out liquid sugar and knowing how much i love sugary <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark>, this was ideal!  free refills too :).\n\nnext, i got the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> with southwestern mesquite fries.  the pork wasn't pulled pork (don't know why i expected that), but it was juicy and tender (not dry at all) and had a good kick of a spice to it!  bread was grilled panini-style and the sandwich was really good!  the fries were well-seasoned but still needed ketchup.\n\nended with a chocolate corn bread pudding and it tasted pretty good, good amount of spongey-ness to the corn bread pudding and was drenched in some chocolatey sauce, though i have to say i think i tasted a bit of cheesiness to the sauces (like a cheesecake thing) and i didn't like that too much since i don't like cheesecake, but maybe that was just me.\n\ni didn't finish most of my fries and didn't finish half my sandwich and had to force myself to eat the dessert and i was sooo full.  it's pretty pricey for a sandwich and fries ($16) and dessert ($11) but i'm really glad i went.  definitely more affordable for brunch than dinner.",

            "for my #100 review, it will go to none other than the restaurant owned by my celebrity crush, bobby flay! i am a hugeeee fan of bobby flay, and food network, iron chef in particular.  i have always wanted to try his menu and ever since i found out he had a restaurant in las vegas, i been waiting for the next time i went to eat at mesa grill.  well after going to vegas for 4 times and not having the chance to eat at mesa grill, i finally got to go eat lunch at mesa grill this past weekend.\n\ni would have much rather come here for dinner, since it has a wider variety than lunch, but i was still very excited none the less.  everyone in my group got their own lunch entree, and a few of us shared a couple appetizers.  for appetizers, i got to try the blue corn pancake, rough cut tuna nachos, and the spicy beef tenderloin tartare.\n\nblue corn pancake - i loved this appetizer! bobby flay is known for his chili sauces, and it did not disappoint!  the sauce went soo well with the tender duck and soft pancake.  the only bad thing about this dish was that there was not enough of it!\n\nrough cut tuna nachos - i love raw appetizers, tuna and salmon dishes especially. the mango and habanero hot sauce mixture was very different for me, but still good. \n\nspicy beef tenderloin tartae - it said it comes with a green onion potato salad but i have no idea where that was.  it was presented with the tenderloin tartare, a few pieces of toast, and shitake mushrooms.  my first time eating raw beef in a tartare form and i really liked it.  it was good by itself, or piled onto the toasted bread and a piece of the shitake mushroom.\n\nwhile everyone else chose a burger or sandwich, i tried to be different and went along with the mahi mahi with roasted pineapple sauce and, caramalized pineapple, and creamy green chili rice.  i'm terribly sorry to say bobby flay, but this is probably one of the worst dish i have ever ordered.  the mahi mahi was tasteless and very dry, and it did not go well with the rest of the dish.  i enjoyed eating the little pieces of pineapple and the rice more than the main part of the dish.  my friend had said, \"the one person that wanted to go here the most, ordered the worst\" minus 1 star for this dish, or else it would've been a 5 star restaurant to me.\n\nhowever, i was able to try the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> and the pressed cuban burger, both which was amazingly good, especially the pressed cuban burger.  when i first read it on the menu, i was confused because it didn't mention a burger patty, just smoked ham, and i did not want it.  what a big mistake! the smoked ham along the juicy burger and swiss cheese, pickles, and roasted garlic mayonnaise was to die for! probably one of the best burgers i have ever had in my life. the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> was a little simpler tasting, but still very good. the pork was well seasoned and not try like most pork pieces would be.\n\ntwo of my friends ordered from the pri fixe menu that came with a chocolate dessert that we all got to sample.  i'm not sure what it is because it just said \"chef's dessert of the day\" but it reminded me of a chocolate flan with some cookies.  i'm not a big chocolate fan but i really liked this dessert.  it was smooth and creamy and not too sweet.\n\nbesides my disappointment with my own entree, i loved everything else at mesa grill. the food took awhile to come out (i think they were waiting for all the dishes to be finished soo it can be served to all of us at the same time) but the service was good and mesa grill has a very nice atmosphere.  it is a little pricey, but what do you expect from a famous celebrity chef?  it's well worth it in my opinion.  i only wish to be given the chance to travel all around to dine at other bobby flay's restaurants!", 
            "i got the pre-fixe lunch menu for $29. \n\nblue corn pancake with duck was great. duck was flavorful, sauces went well. \n\nmy <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark>: the bread was too thick for the sparse filling. the sauce was spicy and pork soft but the bread tasted like cardboard. i don't know what happened there. the bread they gave us before our meals were great.\n\nthe fries were dry and tasted leathery. \n\nmy bf ordered some <mark>Barbecued Lamb Cobb Salad</mark> with bacon. the salad was okay but nothing exciting. (this was not part of the pre-fixe)\n\nthe dessert was a key lime pie ice cream with two cookies. i guess this was a decent dessert but a little bit plain. \n\ni guess seeing bobby flay on tv made me think that he was creative with food. i guess that's only for tv. wish his persona on tv came out in his restaurants.", 
            "ahhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! someone please call bobby flay!! \n\nthe food here was not so great. i've never tried tex-mex food, but from this experience i don't think i will ever try tex-mex again. the restaurant is not at all fancy, but the minute my brother stepped in he was asked to take off his fedora hat. come on, its not a baseball cap!! \n\n***food:\n- they start you off with a basket of bread and this is probably the best thing in the restaurant (sad to say). the jalapeno and the blue berry bread were quite interesting and delicious. \n- i ordered the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> and it was mediocre. i've had better. \n- the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> was not the best. the bread was quite hard so i couldn't enjoy the sandwich.\n- the flavor of the <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> was pretty over-bearing in flavor. \n- the <mark>Sixteen Spice Chicken Salad</mark> was blah. the chicken was dry and nothing was great about it.\n\noverall, mesa grill you have disappointed me and you will definitely not see me again. you would think the restaurant being owned by an iron chief would be good, but i guess not.", 
            "my one big tip: note that on saturdays and sundays, they only have the brunch menu, and do not serve the lunch menu. worth noting, as i was hoping to get the pork tenderloin, and my wife was hoping to get the pressed cuban burger- neither was available on the brunch menu.\n\nthat being said, holy crap so good. i watch top chef regularly, but i'm not the most adventurous eater out there (don't like seafood, i'm weird like that). so what i liked most about this place is that the food has the quality, taste and presentation you'd expect from a professional, but it's all riffs on food you already know and like.\n\nthe highlight was definitely the breakfast quesadilla- two very crispy tortillas with bacon, cheese, hash browns, chiles and onion goodness, with salsa and an egg on top to crack and let the yolk run over it (not usually my thing, but worked great here). just layer upon layer of flavor and texture.\n\nwith the lunch menu unavailable, i got the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> and my wife got their standard burger. the fries were actually the highlight, very crispy and well seasoned with a unique smokey flavor. my sandwich was very good, but not at the level of the quesadilla (same with my wife's burger).\n\nall this said, i can't wait to come back and get the dishes we were hoping to get from the lunch menu. if you're a steak and potatoes kind of guy but want to try something that looks and tastes more gourmet, this is the place to visit.", 
            "stopped by for lunch before leaving vegas.. no wait.. server was attentive. i had the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark>.. it was amazing.. i can eat that all day everyday.. came with seasoned fries and that was decent as well.", 
            "i love being proven wrong about celebrity chef-endorsed restaurants;  carnevino in the venetian put me off making fun of mario batali forever.  his emblazoned name means some tasty meats, let me tell you.   but this restaurant has done nothing for mr. flay's southwestern recipes.  \n\na friend and i had lunch at mesa today, and before i get into the gory details, let me say the wait staff and bus service was very great.  helpful on all sorts of problems;   for instance, there was a bug that crawled out of my friend's salad, stretched its little bug legs, and sat around for a minute while we waved down the help. \n\n  we assumed the bug had been knocked senseless by the over-seasoning of the lamb in the <mark>Barbecued Lamb Cobb Salad</mark>.  and over-seasoning is ridiculous here!   my <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> with <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark> was like being double-teamed by rubs and seasoning salt.  now the tenderloin was tender, but like my friend's lamb, there was no tasting of anything but chilis. \n\n  without like an aioli or some kind of dill yogurt to give your mouth a rest, it all just blends into generic spice tastes.    adding in the heavyness of the dishes such as the recommended goat cheese queso fundido (which was very delicious, but served with generic and easily breaking nachos)  you are left queazy and overfilled.\n\n20 minutes after our meal, on which the salad was comped and we were given free creme brulees (chocolate toffee, so rich and creamy), i began to feel very ill.   i ended up doubled-over in a forums restroom, the final and worst part of it all.\n\ni think of it as a science experiment, and sometimes science produces great things.  sometimes you irradiate yourself.  this was more of the latter.   a lot of nice little things, such as the help and appetizers, but outweighed by a couple unforgivable offenses.   i also don't like a meal so poorly spiced that it causes my body to actually reject it.  \n\nsorry bobby, maybe you should return and retune.", 
            "pressed cuban sandwich for the win! my friends and i came here on our last day in vegas for some good food. after seeing there were 752 reviews on yelp, 4 stars, we had to try it.\n\n2 things i absolutely loved:\n\npressed cuban sandwich - the patty is thick and so juicy!!!!! it has to be ordered a little pink, so be ready for that. bobby flay's thing is mixing up the spicy with the sweet, and sour. it's a perfect combination. i wasn't expecting to be blown away by southwestern food, but i really was. you also get to dip this delicious cuban sandwich into an aoili dip that makes the sandwich even better.\n\nnot to mention, it comes with canjun fries which you don't even need ketchup for. perfectly fried, crispy, crunchy and soft at the same time.\n\ni also loved the:\nspicy beef tenderloin tartare  (appetizer). it comes with a little potato salad that you can taste the quality in. the beef tartare has capers in it, and has a lot of flavor in it compared to other ones i've had at other places. it's truly delicious. \n\nwe also ordered:\nrough cut tuna nachos - they were spicy, and it was a good portion to be shared amongst 5 people. it had mango sauce in it, i'm allergic to mango so i'm a little biased on this dish.\n\nspicy chicken + <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> - it's basically an eggs benedict, southwest style. my friend ordered it, and it was good, but it gets sickening after a while because of the hollandaise sauce. i wish they served this with some veggies on the side or something, just to balance it out.\n\ngrilled swordfish sandwich - if you really liek the taste of cooked swordfish, then go for it, i wasn't really impressed with this.\n\n<mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> - served cold, but great flavors and the pork is soft. surprisingly, it taste a lot better than it looks. however, it sounds a lot better than it tastes. \n\nthanks mesa grill, we'll be back on our next trip!", 
            "we had been to mesa grill once before a few years back, but for some reason this visit really stood out. the hubby and i flew in to vegas in the morning and were starving around noon and decided to try mesa grill again. i opted for the prix fixe menu while the hubby chose the new mexican spiced pork tenderloin.\ni started with the blue corn pancake which consisted of barbecued duck wrapped in a blue corn pankcake and it was absolutely heavenly. i could have totally ate like 3 of them for lunch alone! then i had the yucatan chicken tacos which were also really delicious. the smoked chile barbeque sauce with the peanuts was divine. \nthe hubby really enjoyed his <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> as well. he said it had a lot of spice and flavor to it. i can definitely say that the french fries that came with his sandwich were some of the best fries that i have ever had. they were perfectly seasoned, not too crispy and not soggy either!  \nthe only reason why this review didn't get 5 stars is because the panna cotta desert didn't really wow me. to be fair, this was the first time i had actually had panna cotta, but i'm pretty sure i won't be getting it again. the texture just wasn't very pleasing to me. so if i could, i would give mesa grill 4.5 stars this time around :)",

            "i love watching food network and always enjoy bobby flay's shows.  but the food reviews here are so mixed, i was a bit hesitating to spend my money even for lunch at mesa grill in vegas.  my sister and i were too tired to find a better place, we decided to try our first bobby flay food.\n\nwe were there for sunday brunch around noon after christmas and we're seated right away.  our server was not bad but for some reason he had this weird energy and we didn't feel completely relaxed around him.  \n\nwe wanted to have their fruit juice but we're told they were all out.  all three juices (orange, grapefruit and carrot/orange)!  that surprised me because as a restaurant by a very well known chef at this very popular hotel, i would expect them to have a decent inventory skill.  we're very disappointed and ordered <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark> instead.  it wasn't bad but nothing special about it. \n\nthe warm bread basket had three different baked goodies.  the first one on top was almost like a soft chewy cookie with raisins and nuts.  i don't think it goes with any of their main dishes but as itself, it was very yummy and i wished i had that one after my lunch as a dessert.  i can't describe the second mini soft pretzel-ish thingy but i can say they were good.  and the bottom in the basket was a cornbread which was made with half yellow and half blue corn and had some corn, bell peppers and some chili pepper slices in it.  it was delicious.  our waiter just dropped the basket off on our table but at the end of our brunch, i saw a different waiter at other table was explaining what they were to his guests.  the ladies at our next table were chatting pretty loud so i couldn't hear a thing but wished our waiter did the same for us. \n\ni ordered their <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> and my sister ordered the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark>.  my salmon was very thick but cooked perfectly and was very moist.  the honey glaze and the black bean sauce were delicious and my sister loved her sandwich too.  i had a bite and the pork was very tender and although we both agreed the fries which came with the sandwich were little salty side, but still tasty.  was it cheap?  no, but whew, we didn't think we've wasted our money...\n\ni don't think we can afford their dinner anytime soon after spending too much money in vegas this time but we were very pleased with their brunch.",

            "in a word, bummer.\n\ni had high hopes but mixed feelings about eating here. i love bobby flay and have always wanted to eat at his restaurants. so when i learned i would be vacationing in vegas, i knew this place was a must but after reading the reviews on yelp, i was skeptical.\n\nand i had every right to be. \n\nwe went in early in the afternoon, around 1:30pm. first of all, when we got to the forum shops/caesars palace we weren't sure where to go. we checked the directory and mesa wasn't on it! so we asked a girl at a gellato stand. she directed us to go all the way down to the bottom of the forum shops. when we made our way there, we still couldn't find it and had a man tell us we had to go all the way back! frusterated, we went outside and walked to the front of caesers, went inside and finally found it. but when we finished and took a left, we walked right into the forum shops where we first started out, right by the gellato stand where we got directions the first time! i don't know if she wasn't educated on the layout or simply was tired of having people ask for directions and sent us on a wild goose chase. either way, it was very frustering.\n\nas for the actual restaurant, we were seated right away. like previous reviews, the seating/tables are very close to each other, i'm sure so they can pack in as many diners as possible. \n\nservice was okay, nothing to write home about. \n\nnow, the food......oh, the food. i ordered the famous <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark>, as i love spicy food and the server told us it was probably the spiciest dish on the menu. um, really? it had almost no spice, and really no flavor whatsoever. the fries were overdone and just not very good. my boyfriend ordered the burger, which was way better than what i ordered and i ended up finishing it for him. he also was not impressed with the fries.\n\nbefore i forget, the bread basket was very disappointing. i was looking forward to the jalapeno bread and it was soggy and not spicy even though i could see the bits of jalapeno in it. the rest of the bread was also meh. \n\noverall, i'm glad i had the experiance but i won't be back to mesa grill. sorry, bobby.",

            "once a year my dad goes on all expense paid trip to vegas. all expense paid means that he eats wherever he wants, and orders whatever he wants. my wife and i were lucky enough to get to go this year and i practically packed a fork and knife in anticipation. \n\nmesa grill was the first restaurant we tried on the trip. i ordered the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> for an appetizer and it absolutely hit the spot. the flavor was extremely bold, and i literally used my spoon to scrape the remaining sauce from the plate. delicious.\n\nfor the main course i decided to try the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> and i absolutely loved the combination on the plate. i love to combine my food, and i recommend putting the fries in the sandwich as you eat. by the way, the pork is served cold and medium rare, which the waiter warns you about in advance. for this reason, i don't understand fellow yelpers complaining that the sandwich was not hot, or undercooked.\n\nmy only small complaint would be i didn't like the corn bread served before the meal.\n\nafter it was all said it done, we ended up going to the mesa grill two out of the three days. this is no small fact considering we could eat wherever we wanted. i now find myself having dreams about that <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark>. loved that sauce.\n\nrecommended.", 
            "very good food at an awesome price.  very creative menu featuring southwestern flavors in your casual menu offerings.  the tuna nachos and mushroom quesadilla were wonderful appetizers.  the chile burger and <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> were exceptional. all in all a wonderful lunch experience.", 
            "i have been a fan of bobby flay for a long time and was really excited to try this place out. i was with two of my friends from australia and wanted to show them a bit of southwest cuisine. coming from arizona, i have very high expectations on southwest food. \n\nwe decided to go for lunch, since reading the review that dinner is busier. the atmosphere was pretty laid back, all the customers where in shorts and flip flops. so it was strange to me that the hostess told one of my friends to remove their hat because they had a strict dress code (uh everyone is in shorts and flip flops???)  i knew exactly what i wanted (from reading yelp reviews) but decided to test the waiter. i asked him what he would recommend. he then proceeded to tell me \"everything\" ...ok seriously, what would you recommend? he then pointed to some fish thing and said \"this looks good\" test failed!!! \n\nmy two australian friends ordered the shrimp and chicken tacos. i decided to order the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark>. the waiter told me that this is a cold sandwich with warm bread. me: \"uh can you throw it in the oven or something\" him: \"no\"- i decided to give it a shot, why not bobby flay should know what he is doing. the waiter was extremely prompt about refilling our waters, maybe a little to eager, every time i took a drink he refilled. \n\nthe bread basket came out and me being a carbholic i was so excited for the bread. i tried the jalapeno one first and thought it was ok. tasted like something i could get at my local grocery store bakery. i then tried the \"famous\" blue corn. it was super fragile i lifted it and it fell apart in my hand. the piece i did get was mushy and looked undercooked. i did not finish the rest. my australian friends took a bite and said it tasted funny. \n\nthe food was so disappointing!! \n\nthe shrimp tacos came out with literally 3 pieces of shrimp and two small tortillas. uh where the heck is the rest of the food! same with the chicken tacos. my two friends ate them in a matter of minutes. my <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> was considerably bigger. but was so weird being that it was cold pulled pork with pieces of fat. pork fat cold is not tasty at all. i will give them this- the mexican fries it came with were tasty- but anyone can throw cilantro on some fries and get the same thing. \n\ni was so disappointed and not to mention my friends were hungry 5 min after we left the restaurant. for being such a big name bobby flay needs to reconnect with the local level cuisine. come to arizona and experience what real southwest cuisine taste like. \n\nif you want mediocre southwest cuisine go to mesa grill - other wise save your money and try a different restaurant. \n\nps i am no longer a fan of bobby flay!!!!!", 
            "really amazing food at caesars palace.  the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> were amazing.  i liked the complimentary bread selection.  amazing!  <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> was smokey and delicious.  check out what else i ate by visiting my blog.\n\nhttp://www.dinedelish.com/2011/07/15/mesa-grill/\n\nthanks,\n\ndine delish", 
            "i was real worried about eating here due to reviews saying the food was bland. it was anything but. we had the blue corn pancake with duck wow. for entrees we had the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> and green chile burger. the pork was incredible, the burger had a lot of flavor but not green chile, this was probably the most tender burger i have ever had.\n\nwe ate here for lunch because of my concern. it was definitely worth going for dinner, we will be back.", 
            "definitely my favorite spot in vegas. my hubby and i have eaten all up and down the strip and mesa is consistently excellent.\n\non our most recent visit, we started with the duck blue corn pancake, which was super yummy. i also love the bread basket that they bring around - i could eat an entire loaf of the jalapeno sourdough. yummmm.\n\nfor lunch i had the shrimp tacos and hubby the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark>.  both were excellent and we were very pleased with our meals. \n\ni also had some fancy (must've been for $16!) margarita that the waiter said was some special drink and something about oprah (i'll try anything that oprah likes!!). while a bit expensive, it really was the best marg i've ever had.\n\ncan't wait to go back again!", 
            "of all the vegas restaurants headed by big-name chefs, bobby flay's mesa probably held my lowest expectations.  imagine my surprise, then, when it turned out to be my favorite meal of the trip.  \n\nthe corn chowder tasted like a bowl of pure sunshine, with just a touch of kick.  also sampled was the blue corn cake with bbq duck, which was like a southwestern interpretation of a pulled <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark>.  and while i love the purity of enjoying a tamale or a chile relleno at a tiny storefront or, even better, in the kitchen of a mexican momma, the way mesa elevates both dishes to fine dining neither cheapens or lessens these dishes.  \n\nonly mild oddity was it seemed the majority of wines offered were french.  for some reason i assumed, considering the cuisine, to see a lot more californian, spanish, and argentinean wines.  i did, however, have a sip of george's margarita.  easily one of the best i've ever tasted.", 
            "this place is worth the hype. i am not sure what goes into their french fries but i am addicted!\n\ni have been here twice and both times i ordered the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark>. the first time i had it, it was so spicy i nearly couldn't eat it. i ordered it again this recent time and the heat was much more mild and the sandwich was pretty good. the cactus pear margarita is amazing, the white peach margarita is a little too sweet for my taste. \n\noverall the ambiance is ok, but the food is amazing. i will say if you have dietary restrictions like i do, check the menu before you come. they only serve brunch saturday and sunday afternoons, not their normal lunch menu.", 
            "went for saturday brunch and only had to wait about 15 minutes.  i think they do take reservations though if you don't want to wait.\n\nthis was probably my favorite meal on this trip to vegas.  they bring this basket with blueberry crumb cake, corn muffins made with blue corn, jalepeno puffs and raisin biscuits.  the coffee was strong and flavorful.  i ordered the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> with jalepenos and i believe creme fraiche on top with a side of ham.  the eggs were so fluffy and soft.  the ham was just a little sweet but was best thing on the plate.  there were more biscuits on this plate maybe buttermilk ones, very tasty.  also got a  choice of grits or fries, i chose the grits.  they were creamy and rich. he got the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> which they press and use cold pork tenderloin, i'm assuming the same tenderloin they may use for the dinner.  it was seasoned with new mexican flavors, spread with a flavored mayo and topped with onions.  it also came fries.  we split each of our entrees to get more variety.\n\na lot of people ordered the burger around us and i must say that looked pretty tasty.  going for brunch still gives you celebrity chef flavors for a lower price tag.", 
            "i had lofty expectations going in to mesa grill and i felt like everything was just \"meh.\" we went in with a party of 5 and got seated rather quickly for a sunday brunch. we had all heard great things about bobby flay's food and we really wanted to try it before we left. i got the signature <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> that bobby flay is known for and it was just sort of bland to me. the shrimp was perfectly cooked but the sauce was \"meh\" and there wasn't enough of it. i really wish there was more kick to it. our table also had the steak and egg which was just okay and my other friend ordered this cold sliced <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> that was actually the favorite of the table. it was very nicely seasoned and what we would have expected for bobby flay's food. also, they give you a nice bread basket at the start of the meal which was really good.\n\nthe service was also medicore (seemed like they wanted to get us out even though there was a bunch of empty seats). all in all, an okay place. i'll have to maybe try it again for dinner.", 
            "i thought the burger was all right and i would visit again, but the restaurant is not a must stop on my vegas trips. the green chile burger was topped with pickled onions, which i didn't understand. while the meat was juicy, it wasn't as flavorful as i had hoped. maybe i caught the chefs on an off day. i prefer a burger from rustic canyon. the pork from the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> was all right and more flavorful than the burger. the seasoned fries were yum and crispy.\n\nnotables: all of the desserts have nuts.", 
            "i love bobby flay so i was excited to come here.\nit was just ok.  i would give it 3.5 if that was an option.\ntwo entrees and two non-alcoholic beverages totaled $50 for lunch.  i had the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> and bf had shrimp tacos.  neither one of us was over the moon, but the service was excellent.  it wasn't horrible, it just wasn't as awesome as i was anticipating.", 
            "we went here for lunch the last time we went to vegas because we knew that bobby flay owns this restaurant.  i had a burger and my husband had a <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> it was really good. oh yeah, bobby flay just so happened to be there when we were eating lunch! will visit again next time we go to vegas and maybe try their dinner.", 
            "restaurant week at mesa grill.\n\nmy husband and i dined here a few years ago. this past week, we opted for the restaurant week lunch menu. we started off with the sweet potato soup and tamale. both were very good. it was a tie for me, but my husband liked the tamale better. the soup was spicy and creamy, i really enjoyed it.\n\nbetween the green chili burger and the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark>, the winner was the tenderloin. it was a little messy but reminded me a little of a ban mi sandwich. the fries accompanying the sandwiches were crispy. and we finished the meal with a key lime sorbet. it was way too tart for me, but a good pallet cleanser.\n\neach time my husband has ordered the black widow mojito. very refreshing, but very expensive. next time we're in vegas, we'll stop by and try dinner.", 
            "in the early days of food network, i held an inexplicable grudge against bobby flay.  his only show at the time was the original grillin and chillin where he was partnered up with a bona fide hick in overalls.  then bobby caused all sorts of hullaballoo by standing on his cutting board.  over time, i slowly began to accept that he really was not so bad as a personality and possibly even good as a chef.  so personality differences aside, i made a brunch reservation for mesa grill on my most recent visit to las vegas.  \n\nthe bread basket made an immediate impact.  it contained two types: a jalapeno cheddar bread and a corn muffin.  the jalapeno cheddar bread was not at all a wallflower.  it packed a really spicy kick from the peppers and a salty crust from the cheese.  the corn bread was soft and airy and could barely be buttered.   \n\nwe ordered two appetizers, one of which was the rough cut tuna nachos.  i was ready to dismiss this altogether because everyone knows rough cut tuna nachos means mexicanafied tuna tartar.  well, yes, but it was such a different and delicious dish that i would not make such lame generalizations again.  the blue corn chips were freshly fried and incredibly crisp.  the tuna was not a dice/mash of tuna odds and ends but beautiful jeweled cubes of red tuna.  it seemed to be the perfect compliment to the cool avocado crema and the spicy mango habanero hot sauce.  when we ordered this our server went out of his way to warn us that the tuna was going to be served raw.  this is vegas after all and how horrifying might it be for someone to expect canned tuna on tortilla chips and get this beautiful thing instead? \n\nthe next appetizer was equally delicious and one that most people rave about.  a moist tamal has been covered with sauteed tiger shrimp and a garlic cream sauce.   it was a nice change of pace to dip the tender shrimp and masa into the velvety sauce.  \n\nfor his entree, john ordered the new mexico <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> grilled red onion, arugula, ancho chili mayo and spicy fries.  this was a perfectly good sandwich but not as memorable as the other things we tried.  the pork was room temperature and i would have much preferred it hot and freshly sliced.  \n\nthe only dish i might not get again was my own.  i grew up eating homemade chile rellenos and this version was little too clean and precise.  the chile was very neatly and uniformly coated in a cornmeal crust and stuffed with manchego and roasted eggplant.  the cornmeal was crisp but too thick and i much prefer queso fresco to the much more pungent taste of the goat's milk manchego. i did however, like the sweet and sour combination of the red pepper and balsamic vinegar sauces. \n\ni must give senor flay some credit.  it was a really good meal and he really has a way with flavors and sauces.  he didn't shy away from authentic ingredients and a good amount of heat.  we easily classified it as one of our better meals of the trip.", 
            "i love bobby flay!  maybe i had too high expectations when i dined at mesa grill.  i was disappointed...the food was good but not what i expected.\nwe went for lunch, restaurant had a 30 minute wait.  we ordered:\nmesa grill margarita. very good\n<mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> with shrimp.  good but not blown away.. \ngreen chile burger....good burger but no spice, could not taste the chile\n<mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark>. bread was a bit burnt,  bland\nfries with both sandwiches...best thing we had,crispy \nwe did not get a bread basket..i feel a bit cheated..by the time i realized no bread we were done eating.  service was okay. but not getting the bread , i have to deduct a star.. i really wanted to be impressed but was disappointed.", 
            "i had really been looking forward to eating here and scheduled my birthday lunch here while we were in vegas.\n\nthere were 4 of us and we were seated immediately for our 1pm reservation. i ordered a white peach margarita and it was delicious ($13). my husband got the margarita with the agave nectar in it and liked that as well ($16). i'd been studying the online menu for weeks and knew already that i was going to order the spicy chicken with <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>. \n\nthe bread was really nice. i liked the cheddar and jalapeno best. it was spicy and yummy.\n\nwe ordered the queso fundido to start. it was several cheeses (including goat!) with peppers and blue corn chips. yumola!!!! this was delicious.\n\nour entrees arrived and i cut into my poached egg and was unhappy to see the white was runny and gooey. that's not how a poached egg is supposed to be. a solid white, runny yolk is the norm. the hash was delicious, but some of the sweet potatoes were crunchy, not tender. they were clearly undercooked. my husband got the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> and we were surprised to see it came cold.  i took a bit and did not like it, but he said he did. our 2 other companions enjoyed their <mark>Mesa Burger</mark>.\n\ni sent my dish back and waited about 15 minutes for a new one. a manager brought over the new one and apologized for the mistake. i cut into my poached egg once again and the white was solid - yay!  but the yolk was completely solid too - boo!  why can't this place cook a poached egg correctly? i can do it and i can't cook worth shite.  so, the manager came back to ask how it was and i told him i've been waiting months to come here and i'm pretty unhappy with the way this dish came out. so he said he was sorry once again and said he would remove it from the bill. nice, but not what i wanted for my birthday lunch.\n\neven though it was my birthday, they didn't offer us a gratis dessert. we looked at the menu and nothing really stood out, so we passed.  disappointed overall, but parts of the meal were good enough for 3 stars.", 
            "before hitting  vegas i read a lot of reviews on the mesa grill.  i could not understand all the complaints about the service... just could not see bobby flay owning a place with low standards.  the service was awesome... from the hostess to the waiter.  i'd expect it to be so... i just had to log a good experience.  the food, by the way, was delicious.  my son and i both had <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> as appetizers, based on michael symon's \"best thing i ever ate in vegas\".  they lived up to the hype.  i really enjoyed the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark>... but not nearly as much as my son loved the smoked shrimp tacos.  he wasn't as excited about coming to mesa grill in the first place, but he raved about these.  so,  yes, this is a pricey place... but it was absolutely worth it for us.  the service could not have been better.",

            "rolled in for a quick lunch today, and i mean quick! the place only had about 10 tables of customers in the large bobby flay owned restaurant.\n\nwe were promptly seated, then greeted by a young man who brought us breads. three kinds to be exact, a jalapeno, a raisin loaf and roasted corn muffins. they were all okay, non blew me away. the jalapeno bread was still a bit warm which was nice. the cocktail menu had 5 signature chef flay inventions that all looked like liquid dreams. seriously yummy concoctions with obvious though and effort. there was an ample wine selection, like 22 pages of vino separated into categories by grape, not region. with that many wines, i often prefer it this way. mesa grill is a true tex mex establishment, and being such they had an entire menu for tequila and margaritas... 22 tequilas broken down into 5 separate categories!! wow, can you say fun with a lime in your mouth?!  \n\ni ordered the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> and it came with a side of fries. the pork was well seasoned and juicy, the baguette crispy and soft and of course there was a ton of sauce that was infused with the smokey heat of ancho chili peppers that flay has built an empire on! oh and the herb spiced fries were quite tasty as well. so why only 3 stars? honestly, it was a-ok, the food excellent and tasty, the service phenomenal, but there just wasn't any atmosphere... that feeling you get when you know you are somewhere special.... would i return, yes! should you, definitely! but, maybe for dinner.",

            "i'm typically wary of celebrity chef restaurants in vegas, but i've been here twice, and my mo is to check the place out during brunch/lunch if you want to get a sampling of the famous food without paying the higher dinner prices. \n\nmesa grill didn't disappoint -- they start you off with a bread basket with various breads and muffins. the jalapeno cornbread was my favorite.\n\nwe got the tuna nachos appetizer, and it was what you typically expect from an ahi tuna tartare. not really anything special there, aside from the fancy-cut chips. they were good, but not mind-blowing. i probably wouldn't get them again next time, and go for a more adventurous app.\n\nthe spicy chicken and <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> was great. it had great depth of flavor and spice -- it also had kind of a vinegar-y kick to it that balanced out the starchy sweetness of the potato. awesome dish.\n\nthe <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> was also a great choice. the pork was perfectly cooked, and the sauce and arugula complemented the tender pork.\n\ngreat meals both times i've been here -- and worth the slightly high price tag to say you've been to one of bobby's restaurants.", 
            "had lunch here last saturday afternoon and the 4 stars are just for the food because the service was terrible...well at least our server was absolutely unattentive and almost completely silent except when he absolutely had to speak to take our order and then it was like pulling teeth...we actually had to ask if we could have a moment of his time to order dessert.  the guest at the table next to us took notice and mentioned it to her server who (to her credit) proceeded to try and make up for the lack of customer service from our own server... that being said, we had the sweet potato soup, <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, new mexico chili rubbed <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark>, deep dish banana cream pie, and toasted coconut cake. all the food was delicious and prepared perfectly.", 
            "this was my first visit to a bobby flay restaurant and boy did i love it.  first off everyone was super friendly and had smiles on their faces.  i liked watching the chefs in action cooking our food that was like free entertainment.  i had the pumpkin soup sorry can't recall the exact name it was smokey and creamy.  the only thing i did not like about it was that it was kind of on the sweet side but that's just me and my palate. it looked beautiful and they didn't skimp either.  i loved loved loved the <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> it was cooked perfect nice and flaky.  my hubby had the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> and all he could say was wow this is really good.  we also tried the goat fundio which was the perfect balance of goat and another cheese.  goat cheese for me can be a bit overpowering so they got the balance just right. my one and only complaint was that our table was just too small to fit all our food and drinks. hehe i can't wait to go back and try other things.  i was looking at the table next to us and they ordered the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> those smelled delicious. yes my husband is embarrassed of me when i look at other people's food but i can't help it.", 
            "sunday brunch was great! my husband had the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark>, which was perfectly balanced in all the flabors. i had the <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>, moderate spice, great brunch dish. we both enjoyed our meals, but noticed other tables were offer the daily special and we weren't and the worng meals weere brought out initially, but quickly fixed... otherwise good service!", 
            "bobby flays place is exactly what'd you'd expect from the southwest flavor king. i ordered the corn tortilla soup and man it was spicy and delicious!  for the main i got the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark>. definitely a must try. you have to come to his place with the expectation that everything will have his signature kick to it. \n\ni came on a tuesday day time and there was still a small wait for lunch. i recommend calling in a reservation if you're dinning in for dinner.",

            "this place is a family favorite for us, especially for brunch! we have tried pretty much everything on the menu with few disappointments. prices are very reasonable for being on the strip. <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark> is a must; i probably go through a whole pitcher :p \nfor shared appetizer we like the rough cut tuna nachos (basically a poke), queso fundido, and for something different the <mark>Smoked Salmon Quesadilla</mark>.  bread basket is a treat with both sweet and savory muffins, scones, biscuits, and bread. for entrees we usually stick to hot dishes - <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark>, chilequiles, salmon. grits and the bacon are favorite sides. i'd say skip the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> (cold deli style), and the salads unless that's what you are in the mood for. steak and eggs is a make your own taco dish which is huge, more than enough for one person. salmon is another great treat! also note that you can only get the churros at dinner time for dessert."

            "hats off to bobby flay, i didn't find it overrated...yeah!:\n\nfood - 4.5  stars\nservice - 4 stars\nperformace/cost - 4.5 stars\n\ni was somewhat reserved from going here initially since i've heard just about hundred times from others (including bobby himself) how quintessentially southwestern delicious the dishes that they offer at this place were.  but i semi-refused to conclude that it was all that before i saw it with my two eyes.\n\nwe walked in a little bit after the normal lunch time (totally the way to go if you want to get some decent service at this busy and exposed venue at caesars) - chilled with some margarita and a basket full of tasty breads (including the jalapeno mini biscuits which are my absolutely favorite).  the margarita was very satisfying - tangy, not to sweet, and just the right zing.  \n\nmy friends ordered the southwestern burger and the <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark> as well as the filet of salmon with the sweet potato cakes.  i ordered the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> prepared southwestern style with the fried tortillas, cheese, and the salsa embedded underneath the eggs (oh heavens...).  i'd have to say that all three were equally tasty and cooked just right.  none of the dishes were greasy, salty, or clashing with each other.  it was southwestern at its best.  i was fearing that it'd be just a fancy version on typical mexican dishes...but their interpretations of the classic southwestern dishes were quite impressive...based on the taste of each of the dishes.\n\ntoo bad we were too full to taste the mexican donuts (i reckon we could have really done it if we wanted to)...but we wanted to empty our stomachs for the wine and dine at bouchon that night so we held our own at that moment.  \n\noverall a very pleasant experience, i'd definitely come back here to eat and also spread the word that it's not an overrated restaurant with the face of a celebrity chef nowhere to be seen.", 
            "ate here for brunch at around 130pm and lemme tell u, the food, service, and atmosphere was awesome!  first off we got seated and when we got our water my auntie had a water bottle and the waiter even asked us if she wanted him to pour her water for her. now that's what i call service.  they even changed our knives and forks after eating our appetizer while even setting our knives and plates in the right positions.  as for the food the complimentary bread basket with jalapeno cheddar biscuits, scones, blue corn muffins, and blueberry coffee cake was all way delish.  for the entree omg it was so good, it was a bacon potato quesadilla and it was so delish and i don't even really like bacon but it was goooood.  for our entrees we all loved what we got i got the <mark>Spicy Scrambled Eggs</mark> with ham biscuits and grits and the eggs were the most fluffy soft eggs i've ever had in my life.  eating the grits for the first time so good.  my aunite got the green chile cilequilles (sp) and it was really good.  my uncle got the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> with pepper fries and he like it, my other uncle got this make ur own steak sandwich with eggs and the works with <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark> and he also liked it.  overall we all really loved this place and agreed that it was the best meal we had!", 
            "as the previous person posted, what more can really be said about this restaurant. i just came back from vegas this morning and a truly truly horrible experience.  i only went out there for a concert and the concert and this restaurant were the best parts of my trip.  i went in here accidentally, meaning, i had no clue it was bobby flay's restaurant. i was hungry and caesars palace was a across from where i was staying and all the restaurants in my hotel were packed and had lines, i walked right in with no waiting. (i will assume now that since its bobby's place this place can get crowded so i feel the need to note this was a sunday about 11:45am) once inside caesars palace, i went to the first restaurant i saw, which was this one.  i realized mid-meal it was his restaurant when the waiter at the table next to me was explaining to the recently seated couple that \"mr flay likes a little spice so beware all of our dishes have a little kick\" (they were an older couple). i know i'm slow after he said that, that's when i realized why they had his cookbooks in the front. :)  (but like i said had a horrible trip so i wasn't even looking for things like this) anyway onto the food.\n\nfood: fantastic.  i went on sunday and i got the eggs and <mark>Eggs  Aged Striploin Tortilla</mark> (fancy name for steak and eggs) and  it was yummy.  it came with all this spices of sorts (well they werent spices). i am not really sure how to describe it, more like the consistency of salsa's but they werent salsa's, at any rate it was really good mix with the eggs.  i had a side of <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark> which were a little burnt but oh well.  the steak was very good, very flavored, moist and tender. overall very good. had a cappuccino too, also very good. i wish i had tried the crabcake's but i knew i wasnt going to eat all that. waiters were awesome, just the right amount of attentiveness. (i personally hate when waiters/waitresses, come back every 5 minutes, is everything ok is everything ok...sheesh can i enjoy my meal?) \n\nanyway like i said, i had a horrible experience in vegas and this and the concert i went to see were the best parts about my trip, very glad i blessed up on this place.\n\np.s.  take notice, i have never eaten in a celebrity chef's restaurant and noticed that there were no salt and pepper shakers on any table.  ha just a fun tidbit, i thought that was funny and very interesting, almost as if the chef is subtly saying \"you will not mess up my dish with your spices\"", 
            "bobby flay is abnormally egotistical and incredibly unlikable on tv at times, but his cooking--no complaints there. i've fallen in love with tex-mex, new american, whatever it is... it's freakin' fantastic.\n\nbrunch was nothing short of solid. we began with the rough cut tuna \"nachos\" (think ahi poke with tortilla chips). the mango-habanero hot sauce was absolutely to-die-for--sweet and spicy, it complemented the fresh tuna perfectly. \n\nnext we had the spicy chicken + <mark>Spicy Chicken  Sweet Potato Hash</mark> and the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark>. the hash was beautiful, flavorful, wonderful, especially with the green chile hollandaise sauce. the burger was huge and smoky, and the <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark> addictive. i love how all the dishes had a kick to them. foodgasm!\n\none of my favorite meals in vegas. bobby needs to open a restaurant in sf--i am willing to deal with his ego silence.", 
            "looks like i'm the minority reviewer with a lower rating here... but it just wasn't anything special (for the price).\n\nwe came here for lunch, so i really do not know about dinner.  here is the rundown:\n\nfirst off... the menu is very limited.  i really expected more of a selection.  points off there.  for the app, we had the queso which was really good.  great mixture of cheeses.  there were not enough of the blue corn chips though.  come on bobby... for another penny or two throw a few more of those on the plate!  for lunch, the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> was very good.  the panini style sandwich was crispy, and the spices were perfect and the pork was tender.  the only real downside was the size... not too much filling the sandwich.  the <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark> that came with it were not very good at all... more points off.  some were soggy and/or oily, and the seasoning was just meh.  points could have been added if a good dipping sauce came with it.  i stole my buddies horseradish mustard to use.\n\nservice was very good overall with a few flaws.  we did not get the basket of bread until half way through our meal, and they were a bit slow on the response when we needed something.  otherwise our waiter did a good job and was attentive.\n\nthe major points off here are for the price.  it simply was not worth the money.  for 2 burgers, 1 <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark>, 1 app and regular drinks... the bill was very close to $100 with tax and tip.  my good was decent with flaws, and the burger was nothing special either (although good).  do yourself a favor...if you want selection and a decent cost, try somewhere else.", 
            "my girls and i tried mesa grill for lunch on a weekend in vegas.  we weren't terribly impressed, especially given the universal love for bobby flay.  we ordered the queso dip as an appetizer, which was the best item we tried.  savory cheese with slivers of marinated jalapeno, scooped with blue corn chips.  that was some good shiznick.  \n\nas for the rest of the items we ordered, it was nothing fabulous.  i had a burger, which was cooked well, but lacked a bit in the seasoning department.  i thought that the <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark> were quite tasty however, but again nothing mind-shattering.  \n\nthe service here was pretty atrocious.  it took approximately 30 minutes after we ordered our food to see our actual entrees--some burgers and sandwiches.  the place wasn't even packed, so i don't believe that there was any excuse for such a delay in service.  on the upside, however, the slow service saved me from throwing away another $5 in a slot machine (i'm no gambler).\n\nmaybe dinner at mesa is better--given how much i think about bobby flay, i'll probably try this place again next time i return to sin city.", 
            "just like everyone else, i came here cause hey, it's a bobby flay restaurant.  and well, i'm a big fan of iron chef and throwdown.  so i had high expectations and mesa grill did not disappoint.\nfirst of all, our waiter was excellent, although i forgot his name otherwise i would've gave him a shoutout on here.  he gave us some good recommendations and he really knew the menu.  based upon his recommendation we ordered the duck pancake.  i've only had duck at chinese and french restaurants, never at an american restaurant. the duck pancake was wow!  it was in some type of bbq sauce and the flavors just exploded in my mouth!  thank you waiter!\nfor the entree, i ordered the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark>.  i figured bobby flay has a whole book on grilling, so he must make a mean burger!  my burger was succulent, juicy, huge, and oh so flavorful.  this could be one of the best burgers in vegas?!  for $16 it was a deal!!  they are served with <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark>, probably the best seasoned fries i ever had.\nfor dessert, we had the chocolate bread pudding.  i'm a big fan of bread pudding regardless so it was a perfect way to end a perfect meal.  thanks bobby flay for the keeping my taste buds satisfied.", 
            "stumbled upon this place while in vegas, wandering aimlessly through the casino.  we thought \"hmmm...bobby flay?  ok i guess we will check it out.\"  \n\nat the time, we did consider the fact that neither my companion nor myself particularly cared for bobby flay, but we ignored that fact because, hey, he must be famous for a reason...his charm can get him only so far.  perhaps the man can cook.  plus, we were in the mood for mexican-like food.\n\nlesson learned: go with your first instinct.\n\nwe were there for brunch, and my date got a <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> which was small but presented very nicely.  the flavor was just ok and the burger itself was mediocre, but the grilled onion and horseradish mustard on the burger were very tasty.  <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark> were a bit firey and a little on the greasy side, but were an ok complement to an ok burger.\n\ni ordered <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark> and asked the waiter to give me a quick run-down of the veggies in it.  however, when it came, i found out that it had olives, which he failed to mention.  because the olive-flavor was so overpowering (and i dislike olives), i had to send it back.  my date dug into his sandwich, and my replacement salad did not come until he was nearly done the meal.  check minus on service.  \n\ni wouldn't be upset about the delay-time in getting my meal had this been my fault...however when you put something like olives (same goes for mushrooms or onions) in a <mark>Sophie's Chopped Salad</mark> and the diner inquires , you should be sure to remember to list the components that have strong or polarizing flavors.  he may have just forgotten but it was not busy at that hour, so i was a bit ticked (and hungry).\n\nside note - the bread basket had some decent items.  the blue corn cornbread muffins were really dry, the jalapeno bites were hit-or-miss on the \"heat\" factor depending on which you ate (perhaps some were mild and others spicy?), and the mini breakfast pastries were very good on sweetness and consistency.  stick to those for your pre-brunch-calorie-consumption.  \n\nthe only redeeming part of the meal were the cocktails.  i had a tequila/fresca cocktail that was light, refreshing, and not too sweet. it was delicious.  my date had a margarita which he claimed to be one of the best he's had...don't know how helpful that is, though, as he's generally not a margarita-guy.\n\noverall, food was mediocre at the high points and awful at the low points, service was spotty, drinks were great.  i would say i expected more from bobby flay, but as i said above, he was just never really my style, so what i really expected was mediocre - and it delivered just that.  expectations met.", 
            "every time i walked by mesa grill, i thought about trying it.  i finally made it here last sunday.  the restaurant is big and modern.  because it was sunday at 11:30am, we were told brunch was served.  \n\nthe brunch menu was kind of limited  (http://www.mesagrill.com/lasvegas/pdf/mesalvbrunch.01.08.10.pdf).  we decided on the following:\n\n1)  <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark> with creamed corn (not on the above menu) - $16. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xzbupxdya0zttu3azqtqhg?select=bzdgak4kyiolojnnm9giia) this was quite good.  i'm not a fan of tamale but i enjoyed the creamed corn and the shrimps (total of 4!).  \n\n2)  <mark>Ancho Chile - Honey Glazed Salmon</mark> in spicy black bean sauce + roasted jalapeno crema - $22. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xzbupxdya0zttu3azqtqhg?select=zzxiymivp3o1osnjdf4hfg) i ordered it well done.  the salmon was very tender with good flavor.  however it must have sat on the counter for awhile b/c it was barely lukewarm!  \n\n3)  <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> grilled red onion, arugula ancho-chile mayonnaise + <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark> - $16. (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/xzbupxdya0zttu3azqtqhg?select=qq6qbo2cmswdd7l9owudaw) this was the biggest disappointment of the meal.  my fiance gave it 1 star.  enough said.  \n\nservice was spotty.  at first it was really good, but then it just went down hill.  like i said earlier, our food must have sat on the kitchen counter for awhile b/c my salmon was barely lukewarm and my fiance's sandwich (the pork tenderloin) was cold and hard!  our <mark>Cactus Pear Iced Tea</mark> were getting refilled until we were done eating.  then they took the plates away and didn't bother asking if we would like another refill.  c'mon, even if we're done, we might still like some more ice tea!\n\ni thought the quality and service didn't measure up to my expectation and the prices.  3 stars is all it gets.",

            "i have a friend who's nemesis is bobby flay.  so i wanted to make sure we ate there.  the bellagio buffet was packed, so i called last minute to make a brunch reservation for 11.  after about an hours wait in the comfy lounge chairs, we were seated.  service was a bit slow throughout our meal, but i was just glad we were able to get a table for so many with such short notice.\n\nthe bread basket was delicious, with bite-size jalapeno cheese cornbread, mini cranberry scones, and coffee cake.  for appetizers, i tried the bacon queso quesadilla w/ fried egg, which was okay, and the <mark>Tiger Shrimp  Roasted Garlic Corn Tamale</mark>, which was awesome.  the sauce, the jumbo shrimp, the tamale... everything was delicious and went well together.  i think i would've just been happy having a larger portion as my main entree.  i felt like a burger and since bobby flay is a burger fan, i figured i'd give the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> a shot.  the burger patty itself was thick and super juicy, but it was a bit bland.  but the horseradish mayo and grilled onions helped.  the <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark> were pretty good, but didn't think they were as addicting as the server mentioned.  i think i'm still thinking about the parmesan truffle fries from a certain steakhouse.\n\nin the end, i was stuffed and enjoyed my meal.  if i were to come back, i think it would definitely be for dinner, since the brunch menu was limited in choices.", 
            "visited for lunch with old friends this past friday - always wanted to try a bobby flay burger, so figured this was the right time!  \n\nthe atmosphere is cool, a little loud, but overall fun - comfy waiting area up front at the bar, and not too long a wait for a table.  the waitstaff was very attentive and helpful with recommendations.  the breadbasket was fun, with the blue/yellow cornbread and jalapeno bread both of which tasted great. \n\ni considered the green chile burger and the <mark>New Mexican Spiced Pork Tenderloin Sandwich</mark>, but settled on the <mark>Mesa Burger</mark> ($16) since it was the signature lunch dish and it was my first time here.  the server asked how much pink i liked in the burger and it came out cooked perfectly.  the horseradish mustard and grilled onions worked well together, and the <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark> were solid, soft and somewhat reminiscent (although not as good as) the fries at five guys.  i tried my friend's chile relleno and that was nicely prepared as well.\n\nall in all i was not disappointed, and would return for sure.  would really like to see his burger joint in la or oc!", 
            "after my 3rd trip, i have come to the conclusion that your best bet @ mesa is a lunch visit.  we spilit the smoked chicken and black bean quesadilla, browned well. the gala apple and maytag bleu cheese salad. she had the bbq <mark>Barbecued Lamb Cobb Salad</mark>. i had the pork tenderloin pressed sandwich with his <mark>Southwestern Home Fries</mark>.  everything was awesome.  top notch.",
