            "when i told my girlfriends that our best bet for breakfast was in imperial palace, they looked at me like i had sprouted a second head. i saw their doubts and thought, \"ohhhhhhh, you just wait....\" i think they now know to never doubt the girl who constantly is checking yelp for recommendations. \ni started my meal off with their hh bloody mary. ooooooh, so good.... nice and spicy with a green bean and pickle garnish. hells yes, pickle. bomb. my friend opted for the blt mary, which came complete with a strip of bacon, a romaine leaf and a small piece of white toast. for reals? yep.\ni had heard about the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with waffles (which my friend got and omgomgomg... yeahhh), but knew myself better than to even attempt and instead got the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> scramble. i seriously love any type of omelet/scramble with chicken, and this was no exception for me. i chose the crispy potatoes... glad i did. the potatoes themselves weren't crispy, but they came with super-crispy bits of the potato skin that had come off in the cooking process. nom nom nom. those three words are actually the perfect description for this place.... so i will leave you yelpers with..... hash house a go-go (yes, even in imperial palace)=nom nom nom.", 
            "went here for breakfast with a friend. this place gets really crowded; expect to wait for a while to get seated (think 20-40 minutes). but we figured we would stick it out.\n\ni got the lox scramble and a tangerine juice, my friend got the hash with <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> and an arnold palmer. it was ok. i tried her chicken and it was good, but not amazing. my lox scramble was good, but i had to dig for the lox, which was frustrating. and without the lox, it really didn't have much flavor. i wasn't impressed with her arnold palmer. my tangerine juice was quite good - probably the best part of the meal.\n\nthe service was good - waiter was attentive and courteous.\n\nwould i come back again? maybe. i wouldn't necessarily steer you away without having tried more of their food, but keep your expectations reasonable.", 
            "if ever i find myself starving in vegas, and by starving i mean ravenous enough to eat a baby elephant, hash house a go go is my favorite place to go. \n\nthe portions here are out of control. it doesn't matter what you order, each order can feed 2-4 people. but despite this, i always like ordering my own entree because that means i'll have leftovers for drunken munchies post-clubbing. \n\na few of my favorite things here: \n-<mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> (under the indiana favorites of the breakfast menu)\n-any of the flavored flapjacks\n-<mark>French Toast</mark>\n-famous sausage (under the indiana favorites of the breakfast menu)\n-<mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> house hash.\n\nif there's a must get for me every time i'm here, it's the kiwi watermelon lemonade. not too sweet, not too tart, not too tangy... just right! and the thick, giant watermelon slice to garnish the drink is the icing on the cake. don't leave hhagg without ordering this!! \n\nyes, this place is not health-conscious or diet friendly. the portions are much too large, the food is super rich and hearty and probably artery clogging...... but cmon folks... live a little!", 
            "not gonna lie, i went here just for the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict because i saw it on man vs. food..... holy cow!!!\n\nthe food was incredible and the service, outstanding. the pieces of <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was huge and delicious! if it was just the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, i would still think it is absolutely amazing. very flavorful. there was fried mozzarella cheese on it... i love fried cheese. they thought of everything! there is some spinach and some tomatoes that compliments the dish very well. the bacon is crunchy and the creamy chipotle sauce on it was outstanding!!\n\ni would say that the only disappointment was that they use scramble eggs instead of poached eggs. my girlfriend had a dish with <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> in it.. not good at all. she didn't even finish it, and didn't even eat it as leftovers afterwards. \n\ngo here... get the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict; you will thank me", 
            "this place is like food for giants, not unlike many places in vegas.  the portions are huge and if you finish it, you are not any average person.  the menu was also huge.  my friend and my boyfriend had a hard time deciding, but we had plenty of time because the place was packed.\n\ni would've rated this higher if i didn't have such a bad experience with what i had.  i had one of the house hashes, which i was not familiar with until it was served to me.  <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark>, garlic, onions, asparagus and rosemary house hash turned out to be that with some crispy potatoes and some fruit and biscuit.  the chicken was amazingly dry and flavorless.  i took the rest home, but i don't know why because i knew i wasn't going to eat it.  i couldn't even salvage it with some seasonings because it was so dry.\n\nmy boyfriend's <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict was good, but still not enough for me to go back for it.  my friend's quesadilla was like a high pancake folded in half, it was pretty hilarious.  he liked his plate too...so i guess i was the only one.  next time, if i ever go again, maybe i'll ask the regulars what they enjoy eating.  still, i'd rather be able to try out the menu and not be afraid it'll either taste great or disgusting.", 
            "this place is amazing!!! so unique and delicious!\n\ni was told about this place by a friend who couldn't stop raving about this place and they were right!! \n\nmy husband had the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> w/ fresh spinach, <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream scrambled eggs. the dish on man vs food. it was so good. the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was so crispy even through it's covered with this really yumm sauce. the bacon and cheese on top of that rich creamy sauce, it was so good. best <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> i ever had.\n\ni was trying to be a bit healthier than my husband so i got the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark>, fresh corn, roasted pepper & mozzarella scrambles. it was so good, i think the corn was the best part, but overall it was <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> of the ingredients.\n\nkiwi watermelon lemonade is amazing!! love the kiwi part :)\n\nalso a warning - the hash house a go go in san diego is the original, but it not nearly as good. the ones in vegas is much better!!!", 
            "way too much hype about this place which is maybe why i was more disappointed than i would have been otherwise.  i ordered the egg scramble with <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> on the side.  it was bland. even after adding an exorbitant amount of salt, it still was just blah.  the potatoes were fine, but oraida at home would have been just as good.\n\nthe people i was with got the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles.  the chicken was very bland, as well.  crispy, but flavorless.  \n\noverall disappointing.\n\nservice was just so-so.  \n\nhash house a no go.", 
            "two days in, this is my favorite thing about vegas.  portion size is an amazing value when sharing (but a waste if you're trying to go it alone w/o \"man vs food\" appetite).  the pancake is the size of a medium size pizza!  not that we ordered one, just an observation of the table next to us where the woman ate a mere 1/8 of the pie, i mean, pancake.  our table split 3 types of hash (salmon, meatloaf and <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark>), which were all tasty, but the real star was the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles.  oh my goodness, that was heaven, even for someone like me who isn't really a <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> kinda gal.  but wow, so juicy and tasty!  and lord, the bacon inside the waffle is pure genius!  i can safely say, i'm going back ... maybe every day that i'm here?", 
            "if you have to read anything in this review, you must heed my advice: order, gamble, steal, and/or whore yourself out to try the brown sugar pancake/flapjack.  gather the crumbs off of another table's leftover pancake if you have to.  nike.  i mean, just do it.\n\ni would have given this review a 5 (the pancake gets a 5) but i did find some draw backs.  the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> hash deserves a 2 as the seasoning was salty and the chicken was dry.  the few benedicts that i have tried are at least a 3 star rating, but their portions in general deserve a 5.  come hungry.", 
            "after reading all of the wonderful reviews for hash house a go go, this was first on our list for las vegas. we were staying at the mgm grand, and it looked like this was about a mile down the strip so we chose to walk. \n\nthe weather was grand, and the walk nice. we stopped along the way to do some shopping and eventually ended up at the restaurant. i had the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark>, garlic, onions, asparagus and rosemary. the portions are large. of the various ingredients, the asparagus was outstanding. the rest was fair.\n\nservice was excellent, although the server seemed a little contrived and over the top. but, she was nice. \n\nwe tried it, they just opened one in chicago, but i think that i was not impressed enough to go out of my way to try the one here. sorry.", 
            "has house a go go makes sin taste so good! \n\nbeing from indianapolis it was quite interesting to see this \"twisted farm food\", which was every bit of delicious. granted, we don't really eat like neanderthals in indy it was perfect. \n\nmy fiance and i both enjoyed the kiwi watermelon lemonades - beautifully made with an even better taste. \n\nhim: my hubby got the rosemary chicken skillet (something like that) which was an absolutely delectable serving of <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark>, fried potatoes, egg and turkey bacon. the chicken was perfectly seasoned with flavorful rosemary and paired with perfectly cooked potatoes, being served in a sizzling hot skilled. my hubby is a cop-out and got scrambled eggs (so you can't really mess that up). \n\nme: i had a \"tractor platter\" with <mark>French Toast</mark> which was perfectly seasoned with egg and cinnamon, and topped with powdered sugar (yum!). the best thing, the <mark>French Toast</mark> wasn't some tiny piece of bread but real texas toast - this was in turn served with delicious crispy shredded hash browns (cooked to perfection), which for some reason no other restaurant can seem to get hash brown crispy. kudos to hash house a go go on that. the final part of my dish was fantastic - a serving of fresh fruit, a banana sliced long, and a couple slices of orange. the banana was a great surprise because, they actually threw it on the grill, which was a taste of perfection. it enhanced the sweetness of the banana without completely caramelizing it. (it was so great that my hubby almost lost his finger because he couldn't stop munching on it)\n\noverall hash house a go go is a definite must while visiting vegas (i absolutely fell in love with this place) - and will certainly be back on my next trip to sin city.", 
            "located in the quad, second floor. it can be a little confusing to get to because of the layout between the hotel and the parking garage but just follow signs and ask the employees. :] \n\nit is much like the hash house in san diego with the exception of the casino/smoke smell. menu and dishes are exactly the same and if you have never been to hash house, just a little warning - the dishes are huge! my bf and i decided to share instead of ordering one each since these dishes are a pretty decent size. we ordered the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> scramble with eggs, mushroom, and bell peppers. got the crispy potatoes and fruit to go with. it was the perfect amount of food for two. :]\n\nfriendly tip: if you're going for brunch, get there early (before 10am) because the lines get extremely long. also, the kitchen cook time took about 40 minutes which the waitress notified us before sitting down.", 
            "a good place to grab brunch/lunch on the strip. the food is pretty good and it's reasonably priced. the portions are huge, so split with a friend. i was here alone, and had to leave a large portion of my <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> hash behind. the stuffed burgers are as monstrous. there can be a bit of a wait, even when there are empty seats. i'm guessing the reason is that the kitchen can only handle so much at a time. in fact, i was seated at a huge booth within 10 min and my section was pretty much empty, but the waiter did warn me that there is a delay in the kitchen.\nwouldn't go out of the way to go to this place, but if you're in the area it's definitely decent", 
            "bomb dot com! i would give 5 stars if it weren't for the rude hostess who was giving us attitude in the beginning. but apart from that, the food and service was amazing. i am obsessed with their kiwi watermelon lemonade!! i also ordered their <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> hash ...the first thing on the top of their menu. delicious! i don't think anything here will be disappointing. the wait is hella long but i guess you can go gamble while you wait (:", 
            "hash house is the definition of over the top! the food is amazing, the portions are insane, and the value is unbeatable. i had one of their \"favorite\" scrambles (<mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark>, corn, mozzarella) and it was fantastic. the crispy potatoes are not to be missed. definitely check out this spot when you are in vegas.", 
            "wow! the first thing that comes to mind when we got our food! but first i must say that this was the number one place on my list to try when i went to las vegas a couple weeks ago. i saw it on the food network and travel channel. apparently there are multiple locations, but we went to the one that was on the vegas strip in the quad.\n\nupon entering the lobby from the escalators the fist thing noticeable are the numerous pictures of celebrities and their autographs along the wall. that being said, it had to good...because we had to justify the 30-45 min. wait for a table! worth it in the end though.\n\nas we sat down, the server was very upbeat and friendly given how busy the restaurant was. in my experience, the tone and vibe of a busy restaurant will reflect through the server. i felt very welcomed and excited to be trying this place out though. the first thing we asked was for recommendations and he gave us the top 3 most popular dishes. out of the six of us, we decided to order all 3 of them plus one! the ones were the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles, <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, big o' chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> and the chorizo house hash. full menus are online, but each dish was super! \n\nmy personal favorite was the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles. this was superb! the sage really was present in the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and was totally different from any other \"chicken & waffles\" i ever had. the taste was really \"upscale\" but very, very good! the other people in our party didn't like the unique taste because of the overwhelming taste of sage...but that was the reason it stood out for me so much. i am not picky and love new foods, especially new tastes that i had never had before. the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was juicy and of course tasted well with the bacon! the everyone loved the waffles! very soft on the inside but nicely crisp on the outside. and it all worked very well with the maple syrup reduction...such a dream! \n\nthe <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> was similar in taste as far as the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> portion, but was different in texture with the biscuit base, chipotle cream and griddled mozzarella. very rich and good.\n\nthe last two were the chorizo house hash and big o' chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>. both were the favorites among the group as a whole. the chorizo was very good, not too salty, which i have come across on numerous occasions having the meat at various restaurants. a bit spicy with the jalape\\u00f1os, but i love spice personally. everyone devoured this dish as well as the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>. the shell/crust of the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> was mouthwatering. that part of the dish was gone in a flash! so flaky and buttery went well with the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> filling and gravy!\n\ni must say these dishes individually are large! just one of them can feed 2-3 normal individuals. and for the price, very worth it! each dish was presently superbly especially the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles. every time that came out of the kitchen to a different table people would be astonished and stare as the towering masterpiece found its home in a new customer.\n\nthis is a super recommendation if you are ever nearby or decide to take a trip to las vegas! go now!", 
            "server was not very considerate and constantly trying to rush us for brunch. i ordered the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark>, peppers, asparagus, and rosemary hash with egg whites and half order of potatoes. alright quality, way too much oil and not much added flavor/spice. portion wasn't what i expected (yes, even though i got 1/2 potatoes). however, my friend got a pancake that was enormous. i tried it and it was very good and cooked perfectly. perhaps i just got a subpar dish for this place or i was expecting more, but overall i was not impressed and would have been more pleased at a waffle house (from georgia).", 
            "i agree with other yelpers that this place is overhyped. i liked the big portions because it allowed us to share, but the flavor was lacking and over powering at the same time. our server was great, but our food was not. my brother and i split the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> hash and man, was the rosemary super strong! i like rosemary, but it tasted almost bitter. the potatoes were nice and crispy and the biscuit was tasty though. the famous chicken and waffles was disappointing. the presentation was awesome and looked promising, but the chicken was tasteless. the waffles were ok. all in all, it was just ok and we waited a long time.", 
            "amazing!! only waited 10 minutes on a thursday morning around 10am.  i had the man vs food chicken breast eggs benedict and husband had <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> hash.  good price, awesome food, awesome service, and huge portions.", 
            "huge portions!!!\n\nlong lines! surprising since it is inside imperial palace, now the quad. service was good.\n\nhouse hash <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> - $12.95 - chicken was a bit dry and under seasoned. veggies were cooked decent. potatoes were crispy but had no flavor. biscuit was fluffy.  \n\nhouse hash <mark>Corned Beef</mark> - $12.95 - beef was good but could have been griddled more crispy. cheese on top was melty. potatoes were crispy but had no flavor. biscuit was fluffy.  \n\n<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles - $14.95 - chicken was nice and crispy. waffles have bacon cooked inside of them which was different and yummy. needs a ton of maple sauce cause it gets to become dry really quick. \n\noverall the food is typical huge brunch dishes that are cooked decently but are bland.", 
            "long wait at 1pm was offset by the fantastic bloody marys! olives were super tasty. once we were seated, we were able to order about 10 minutes later. out came huge portions about 4 times the size of your stomach.  we ordered the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> hash and the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash. we both did not really enjoy the hash, my chicken was fatty and a bit dry. the biscuit was amazing though!  that's all i ate and ordered a side of sausage gravy to go with it. do yourself a favor and order the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, it looked awesome, and get biscuits with gravy!",

            "i am going to start off by saying that the biscuits were nothing short of phenomenal. they were by far the best biscuits i have ever had. the potatoes were up there also. \n\ni really love breakfast, but at the same time feel as though there are only so many ways you can cook an egg. nevertheless, i felt breakfast here exceeded expectations by a mile. my wife had <mark>French Toast</mark> with pecans on top and i almost never taste her food. it was so tasty. i had the farm scramble w/ <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark>, fresh corn, roasted red pepper, & mozzarella (also tasty).\n\nif you are expecting a quiet atmosphere, soothing music, and white table clothes during breakfast (or any other meal because they serve more than just breakfast), you've barked up the wrong tree. if large portions, fun wait staff and filling drinks are your thing, this will more than meet your expectations. it's more expensive than your local denny's (which is up the strip), but it's vegas... would you expect anything else?!\n\nvisit me on my website... antondaniels.com, @1antondaniels on ig", 
            "share share share! \"your eyes are bigger than your stomach\" the portion size is huge and pretty pricy but that's vegas for you. the wait for this place is about 45 minutes. \n\ndrunk and hungry and this place hits the spot. although i felt disgusting and extremely full with a hint of heart burn after, the food is pretty good lol\n\nbe patient though because the food takes a while to come out as well. our server was polite and handle our table very well. \n\nthe <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark>, garlic, onions, asparagus, rosemary dish was good! it came with potatoes, eggs and a biscuit. honestly, this place is really known for their <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles, so suggest getting that instead."

            "i've had a business card from hash house a go go sitting on my desk since my last trip to las vegas. i've been meaning to write a review. i was traveling alone so i pretty much got seated immediately at the bar. kind of odd having a full service bar during breakfast, but this is las vegas after all.\n\ni saw lots of mimosas and bloody mary's going out, but i stuck with coffee and an order of <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash and eggs.\n\nit was a saturday morning and the place was quite busy but there was no problem getting refills on coffee directly from the bartender. breakfast portion was huge and there was plenty of <mark>Corned Beef</mark>, a good portion of eggs, and skillet cooked potatoes. i also got toast on the side. far too much food for my typical morning meal but i wasn't complaining, everything tasted great. my meal wasn't greasy, it wasn't overly heavy, but it certainly was filling.\n\nbartender was obviously busy but she had a great attitude and the place seemed to be humming along quite well on the morning i had breakfast. i don't know that it's worth the walk down the street if you're staying at another hotel, but if you're already in imperial palace and are hungry for grub, this place may just be the ticket.",

            "hungover much?\nhungry much?\nwill eat anything as long as its edible?\n\nif you answered 'yes' to any of the above, this place is the place for you. its a whole lotta food per person and has the hometown favorites - <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, <mark>Corned Beef</mark>, scramblers - pretty much all the comfort foods you could think of. although if you were to eat all of it, you would definitely not be so comfortable! \n\nthe food is, to cut right to the chase, not very good. so if you're looking to just eat because you're hungry and would eat anything so long as its food - then go here. \n\nits a good experience overall too - just go to see how much food a restaurant could possibly give you on one plate. in terms of portions, hash house a go go has surely made quite a feat!", 
            "my new favorite breakfast place.  had the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash, the kids got the waffles with bacon in the middle.  the yummiest part was the espresso with a scoop of ice-cream.  love it here, a good treat once in a while!", 
            "i've been to the san diego branch and couldn't stop raving about it.  so the girls and i were very excited when we found out there was one on the strip = perfect way to recover from all the partying over the weekend.\nhow wrong we were.\n\nincredibly long waits, even after we'd already been seated.  waitress just seemed very harried with the crowd, so we were happy to chill, but really, 30min before we could even place our order was a bit much.\n\nfinally received our food and it was mediocre.  we ordered the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash, chicken and waffles, and <mark>French Toast</mark> with the bananas.  of the 3, the <mark>French Toast</mark> was the only one that was decent, though the sd version was better.  \n\nportions are definitely huge, so probably a good place to go when you're still buzzed (ie impaired taste buds) and have a serious appetite.",

            "farm food with a twist! i like! if this is farm food from indiana, then i'm going to love indiana!\n\ni didn't expect this place to be that good. we ordered the <mark>Corned Beef</mark>, which came with two eggs, roasted potatoes, biscuit, and fruits. the other plate we ordered was the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with maple reductions, two eggs, bacon mash potatoes, biscuit, and fruits. wow! the portions were ridiculously huge! the service was quick and friendly! \n\nthere needs to be a hash house a go go in l.a. or long beach!",

            "i wish there was a hash house in ca because it was so good! my group ordered mostly the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash and the meatloaf hash. i think i was in heaven when i started eating it. the portions were great too. all of us had food leftover to take home. each hash entree also comes with fruits and a biscuit, which i didn't even get to because i was so full from the actual entree. you must go here and eat if you are on the strip! i guess the one bad thing is that the wait for the food was really long but it was so worth it!", 
            "my favorite kind of restaurant is one that takes something familiar and pumps up the flavor profile in a unique way, while still keeping the vibe casual and comfortable. chego in los angeles is my favorite restaurant in the world for this reason, and what it does for korean food, hash house a go go does for breakfast staples.\n\ntake whatever it is you enjoy for breakfast. they have a fresh twist on it that adds lots more flavor, and they give you a gigantic portion too. i got the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash - it came out with larger chunks of quality <mark>Corned Beef</mark> (instead of mushed together scraps), with swiss cheese to make it a combination of the usual breakfast staple with a reuben twist. my wife got the pecan blueberry pancake, and said it was the best pancake she's ever had.\n\nhighest recommendation to go. i find it hard to believe a human being could walk away from here unhappy. one tip though - this location is at the imperial palace, so we went because it was on the strip. but if you have a car, or the means to get off the strip, go to another location if you can. the imperial palace is one of the more crowded, smoky, noisy, run down and depressing hotels you'll visit. the restaurant is still worth the trip if this is your only option (heck, i did it myself), but knowing better next time, i'll make the drive to the other location.", 
            "this is the first hash house a go go that i've ever been to. i've came here march 2009 and was pretty hung over. a mimosa sounded really good so i got one of those, and for my breakfast i chose the chorizo hash. pretty simple decision. i wasn't really in the mood to read the whole menu. -__- i regret doing that. i wish i actually saw the whole menu that day. the food was still great none the less. the biscuit was so good! especially with their homemade compote that's already on the table waiting for you to use. a little tease. \n\nthen i went to the hash house a go go on sahara for the second time. that's another review hmm :)\n\nfor the 3rd time i came back to this one! and i was for sure hungry! hehe. i got the cinnamon roll coffee to start of with. and it was too freakin' good. it had a whole cinnamon stick in it. haha so i broke it in half and gave it to my other friends to put in thier coffees. tee hee. and my friend, a fellow yelper, allen n., and i decided to spit and share the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict and the salmon eggs benedict. both were huge and really delicious. i absolutely love their biscuit. man oh man. my girlfriend got the biscuits and gravy and a <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash. can't go wrong with <mark>Corned Beef</mark> though. haha that gravy though... damn..\n\nit's official, every time i go to las vegas, i'm going to a hash house a go go!", 
            "i'll go ahead and start off my review with this: hash house has gigantic portions at reasonable prices ($12-$15 per entree).\n\nthat being said, i think that's where all the \"hype\" is over here at hash house.  my friends and i decided to come here based on all of the great reviews of the place and waited for over an hour on a friday morning.  i was surprised to see so many people at 10am, but i guess a friday before a long weekend will do that kinda thing.\n\nfood-wise, i went ahead and took the advice of many of my fellow yelpers, and got the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash.  piece of advice for those who don't already know....the hash's are literally gigantic pieces of _____ (whatever meat you may choose) over crispy potatoes/wedges. it is not easily mixable, as the potatoes that are given are also rather large.\n\nthe hash was good in itself, but definitely not what i was expecting.  another one of my friends got the meatloaf hash which did not look too appetizing because they were just pieces of meatloaf chopped up over those crispy potatoes.\n\nthe pancakes looked ridiculously large but i did not try them.\n\noverall, it was an interesting experience to try this place, but i felt that there was maybe a little too much hype surrounding this restaurant.\n\nquick tips:\n\n1) expect to wait (just like any other popular place in lv)\n2) portions are huge so you can easily split one dish among two people.", 
            "after seeing the hash house a go go on the travel channel, i knew that we had to stop there for brunch while we were in vegas. the minute i saw the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> on tv, i knew i had to try them!\n\nthis particular hash house a go go is located inside imperial palace (eek!). it was pretty busy when we walked in, so we expected to wait for a good hour. the hostess quoted our party 45 mins. to an hour, which isn't too bad, unless you're hungover and starving...which we all were. luckily, since there were so many people, some parties decided to leave, which meant that we only had to wait about 20-25 minutes! \n\nwe ordered:\n-<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles\n-<mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>\n-<mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash\n-biscuits and gravy and scrambled eggs\n\nthe <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> were sweet and there were pretty generous slices of bacon inside. i wish i had ordered the waffles with some strawberries on top just to give it a little more sweetness - the syrup just wasn't enough! i didn't taste any of the other dishes, since i was so occupied with attempting to finish mine, but everyone definitely enjoyed their food.\n\nour server did his best with the crowds - it was pretty busy on a saturday afternoon. i didn't expect stellar service anyway, i just wanted to eat. you are definitely in for huge portions and a lot of food so if you're on a budget or aren't too hungry, i'd suggest sharing or you'll end up with some leftovers.", 
            "i had a chance to eat here on my last trip to vegas.  the place was packed on a weekday morning around 10 am, so i had  to wait for half an hour to get seated.   service was fairly prompt, and the food came out in decent amount of time considering how packed the place was.\n\nthe food was decent, but nothing really overwhelmingly good.  i ordered the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash, with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  this place is supposed to be the 'hash house' so i was expecting this to be knocked out of the park.   the food was served very lukewarm.  it wasn't anywhere near being hot.  i was disappointed by this and informed the server.  she offered to bring more <mark>Corned Beef</mark>, which there was no way to refuse.  soon after she brought a full side plate of <mark>Corned Beef</mark> which at least equaled the portion served in the meal.  shortly after that a manager came by to apologize for the initial dissatisfaction with the food.\n\nso at least they made a serious effort to address their cold food, but seriously when i pay 14  bucks for a breakfast entree it should be frigging perfect.",

            "we came here because we were tired and hungry and saw it walking from our room through the casino when we went to wander the strip. i was going to have our group go to grand lux in the venetian which would have been a much better options. but we ended up here instead. \n\nprices are about the same as at grand lux or most other sit down places on the strip at like $13ish for breakfast type items. i got the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash and was surprised when it was shredded corn beef instead of ground which i thought was nice. i got scrambled eggs with them and they were very bland so i wasn't a fan. the potatoes were decent being homestyle fries style with the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> and cheese on top. they give you a biscuit which sucks, hard as a rock and bland and dry, we ended up taking them and threw them at our friend while wandering the strip. everything comes with a stalk of rosemary stuck in it which looks tacky in my opinion, but whatever they think is cool. other than the food being pretty bland, the portions were large and served in cast iron skillets which was cool and nice. our waiter was a d-bag and made the experience even worse. he was never around, and the only time we saw him was when we ordered and when our food came, and when he brought us the check. when he brought us our food, he asked us how everything tasted, which how do we know since we just got the food?!?!  and then we didn't see him again till he brought us the bill\n\ni won't come back. grand lux is far better in taste, class of the restaurant, service, and overall experience", 
            "minus one star for the wait, which is always at least an hour if you come during mealtimes...if you come around 10 am before all the haggard, drunk people wake up, you should be good! \n\nthe portions are freaking ridiculous at first sight, but actually quite manageable if you sift through all the \"fixins\". they just go for vertical height which makes the dish look super huge, but its not that bad! great hangover food, but nothing gourmet. all in all, for the price you pay and the fact that it's on the strip makes it a decently priced option for a meal. \n\nthe chicken and waffles are pretty good, but my favorite is the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash! not of the mushy pancake-looking variety, but the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> is actually in strips and comes with nicely seasoned potatoes and fruit on the side inside a cast iron skillet. i found the portion size to be manageable but not skimpy. i also always order a peach ice tea, but that's just me. everything else on the menu is decently tasty - the skillets, omelets, and the 1-lb burger...\n\njust remember to come with loose pants and patience for the line! and if you really need to, bring the flask for irish coffee in the morning!", 
            "went here on sunday morning, dec. 11th about 9am. we had about a five minute wait as it was really slow in vegas this weekend. normally i would expect to wait much longer at any restaurant or buffet on a sunday for breakfast. \n\nwe shared the corn-beef skillet, a side of bisquits and gravy, the pistachio mocha drink and the caramel all over everything drink. our server/bartender/barista was kye and she handles everything back there no problem. she was also quick to point out that we should save some bisquit for the home-made peach preserves. guess they put something different out all the time. the food was great, the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> was incredible and we had absolutely no questions asked about sharing a meal. \n\nmy experience was very good and i would definately recommend it and go back for seconds.", 
            "finally somewhere in vegas where i can get a bang for my buck. the prices are decent and the portions are huge. when we arrived, we were told the wait was going to be about 45 minutes but only waited 20 which was good news for my tummy. our waiter looked overwhelmed but he was quick and did a great job at trying to keep up with all of his tables. for $60 we got the following:\n\ncoffee - decent\nsome coffee pistachio drink - amazing\na pineapple mimosa - strong and delicious \nsoda - not flat so two thumbs up there\n<mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash skillet which came with a large biscuit and fruit- tiring after awhile\ncrispy cornmeal salmon sandwich - this was plated beautifully with sriracha/mayo sauce  drizzled around the sandwich\na platter of chicken and waffles - ginormous, salty and sweet goodness in every bite\n\nmy only complaint was that the chicken and waffles didn't come with nearly enough syrup. i needs my syrup! i was not only stuffed beyond my skinny jeans but buzzed because my mimosa was super strong so hash house a go go was worth every shiny penny for me!",

            "i have been to all the hhggs in town, and finally got to try the ip location when my folks were in town for the weekend.\n\nwe went on a saturday around noon, so i definitely knew there would be a wait. they quoted us 45 minutes, but it ended up being only about 25, which isn't bad. if you're at any decent breakfast place on the strip on a weekend, you'll have to wait. \n\ni typically enjoy going to the older properties to check them out and get a bargain drink, but with all the construction going on right now, the ip is hell to get in and out, plus the smokiness level is pretty high down in the casino. luckily, hhgg has its own mezzanine-kind of level, which is all smoke-free.\n\nsince i'm with child over here, i didn't order a drink, but i did sample the orange crush (kinda like a mimosa with vodka and a salt rim) and the bloody mary (super spicy and very strong) - i thought they were both great! the bloody mary, especially, reminded me of something i'm definitely looking forward to after the baby is born in may!\n\non to the food. i almost always get something with <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> at hhgg, so this time i went for the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. the chicken was excellent, as always - delicious sage breading, not too heavy, and no bones! they came on top of spinach, tomatoes, scrambled eggs, cheese, and a biscuit, with a kind of creamy chili sauce all over. oh, and underneath, was a huge block of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, probably the equivalent of 2 large potatoes! my one complaint about the dish was that the biscuits were kinda dry and bland. the others in my party got the vanilla waffle, blue cheese burger, and rueben sandwich (which is called the pub crawl). i seriously loved the waffle and the pub crawl. the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> and sauerkraut were so delicious and flavorful, they totally complimented the rye bread, and i usually hate rye bread. i thought the burger was good, but nothing too exciting.\n\nyes, there is too much food! we were all super hungry (and the waffle was only like a half meal, since it comes by itself), and together we ate about 3/4 of everything. no problem - i love leftovers!\n\nprices run from $8 for the waffle to $16 for the eggs benedict, which is all totally reasonable. the drinks are a little high at $14/ea for the specialty drinks, but that's definitely in line with typical strip prices.\n\nonly drawback was the service. while friendly, our server seemed super rushed, and the kitchen took a while to get our food out.", 
            "you know when all your friends and their friends' friends have been to a cool joint and you're the only one that's never been? well such as the case with hash house a go go. my ears were burning for days when my friends were mouthing off about this place....the ginormous portions, the food coma afterwards and how their leftovers would last them for days back home....blah blah blah. \n\nthen they said adam richman from man v food went there. say no more. we are going to hash house a go go.\n\nmy friends warned me that service was non-existent at this place. well luck was on our side because our waiter was pretty attentive during our entire stay. \n\nthe menu was extensive and their breakfast menu in particular was impressive. i never made it past the house hashes. i was really tempted to try the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> (cause it was adam's favorite). my friend ordered it and honestly it didn't look as appetizing.....as my <mark>Corned Beef</mark> house hash (came with crispy potatoes). the verdict for the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> order after the initial taste test was just okay. i personally like my <mark>Corned Beef</mark> minced (not hand shredded). then i had a bite of my other friend's chorizo house hash. let me tell you that is the winner. i would probably order that again my next visit. \n\nthe portions were big but the waiter did warn us all the house hashes were \"normal\" size. the biggest portion i saw was the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>. even that dish i expected to be even more behemouth in size based on what my friends were raving about. sometimes it's better not to hear the hype and you can make your own conclusions. \n\n*i was really angry that they don't have any restrooms in the restaurant. i had to run downstairs back into the casino.", 
            "first off, definitely recommend this restaurant!\nbut i'm telling you, you better be hungry. :)\nmy boyfriend and i went here for the first time last month (for my birthday breakfast). i chose it because of all the hype i heard about it. i was not dissapointed one bit! \nthe food is awesome (some of the best i've ever had eating out) and the service was good, too.\ni was surprised on how huge the portions were! and for the price, such a killer deal. i ordered the biscuits and gravy (which was served over <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and topped with scrambled eggs.) and my boyfriend got the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> skillet. both were to-die-for meals. we also noticed how tasty their eggs were, some of the best we've had. i wish i could go back and try their famous <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles i've heard so much about. \n\nif you are in vegas, this place is a must! seriously, you will be so impressed.",

            "the food was outstanding!  i had the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles.  really good.  the only criticism was that it seems that they used a cheap syrup.  too bad really.  i asked for some syrup to go and they were log cabin containers, which confirmed that it wasn't a top shelf real maple.  the chicken was out of the world, and the bacon in the waffles just nailed it.\n\nmy wife had a <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash and it was just lovely.  they under cooked the over easy eggs, but that is so darned common, i can't give them a hard time about it.  \n\nmenu: 5 stars. off the charts.\n\nambience: 3 stars.  a little rugged and run down, but fits it's in your face style.\n\nservice: 3 stars.  too many mistakes.  they bring your food as it comes up, that means my wife was almost done with her meal by the time i got mine.  the waiter didn't write anything down so when he brought me the wrong dish the first time, it wasn't surprise.   i saw my waiter every 10 minutes.  had to get up and go to the waiter station to ask for water.  to make all this better, they were running their butts off and rectified every mistake quickly and cheerfully.  i feel it is more of a management issue than anything.\n\ni will go back next time in vegas.  i have yet to have a breakfast of this caliber in vegas.", 
            "everyone is really friendly here.  the service was decent even though the restaurant was packed on a weekend morning.  \n\ni can understand the appeal of a restaurant like this, but i just can't say that i enjoyed my meal.  i ordered the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> house hash and was thoroughly disappointed.  it's not a normal <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash in the traditional sense.  there are no crunchy bits as the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> is baked then shredded.  \n\nfor the first time in my life, i wasn't able to finish even a third of my meal.  i took the meal back to my hotel room  hoping to have another stab at it later, but just the thought of trying made me cringe.", 
            "this place is pretty awesome! 3stars because i'm more of a health freak and i wanted some healthier options. overall, the portions are huuge,  i tried the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> sandwich, onions were sweet, the beef was tender and juicy, the bread was lightly buttered, and the cucumber dressing on the salad was creamy and flavorful. perfect complement considering it was 2am in the morning. on a separate visit, i had the salmon omlette which wasn't that great and was more on the fishy side and oily side(it was drenched with olive oil to cook the fish)  overall its a pretty awesome place. \nbtw. the chairs suck .. they've been ruined by fat butts, so you tend to sink into them in an uncomfortable way where your arms are a bit elevated ...

(there were some names that were used in text exchanges, but thats neither here nor there.) \n\nwe were just there in june.   and nostalgically i recall that someone ordered their pancakes...stupid enormous, i had <mark>French Toast</mark> and a side of biscuits and gravy.  did i say side?  more like a huge portion for one.  hubby had <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash and says it was too good to not continue eating.  (i know he over did it because he could barely eat one in and out burger 4 hours later!)  \n\nwe went really early in the morning for breakfast and they were empty.  still, we liked going through the maze that is the quad to go up the escalator to the yumminess that \nawaited us.   given that there are so many awesome places to eat, we didn't eat there again, but its on our list of places to hit up without a doubt!  service was prompt, the place was clean and well maintained, and food was delish!!!  can't wait to go back again.  now.....i heard they have a location in chicago too....hrmm......",

            "had dinner with my four sisters from out of town, on 4/27/14. entrees included the meatloaf, chicken alfredo, chicken skillet, guacamole chicken salad, and a <mark>Corned Beef</mark> reuben. all the meals came luke warm, closer to cold. food was lacking in flavor. i have not heard one positive thing from my sisters about that meal. so i guess you could say it was a night to forget. definitely do not recommend this place for anyone with a discerning palate. also, the food came fast, like it was already plated and then barely warmed up. the waiter then more or less disappeared, had no knowledge of what he was trying to sell us. acted more or less, like he could care less about our dining experience. this was my call since i am the local. so it is my fault for not researching further.", 
            "i'd like to start out by stating i was fairly hung over the day we went to hash house a go go. after a long hard night for my liver, i had to suffer the traditional morning hangover which ended up stretching into the afternoon (at which time we finally began our quest for food to rid this ailment). and even though the hangover symptoms had started to abate by noon, they were still present and included head ache, nausea, and disdain for flashy lights and loud noises. that being said, we  walked in the blaring heat on the strip, navigate through a loud casino, and wait almost an hour to be seated and place an order.\n\ni only complain about the situation i was in so that you can realize how good the food must have been to get me to stop my bitching and give this place 4 stars. the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> sandwich was garnished with rosemary, and the bread was buttered and toasted to perfection. the cheese to meat ratio was spot on as it enhanced the flavor without overpowering it. and the meat. so succulent and savory, my taste-buds went into overdrive trying to keep up. the portions were well aligned with the price as this is no dennys or ihop. the price may be around doubled, but so are the portions and the flavor is increased 3 fold. i could not even fathom finishing, even on an empty stomach with no hangover. this hearty meal was just what i needed and allowed me to recover my strength mentally, physically, and emotionally.\n\nall in all this was a great way to help with a hangover. the only flaws i saw which stopped me from giving the 5 was the long wait and rigorous route needed to find the place in the middle of the casino. i'll recommend this place for a decently, delightful devouring during daddy's drinking day recovery.", 
            "we only had a 10 minute wait.  from all the reviews i was worried,  so glad it was quick.  the portions are ridiculous.... in a good way.  huge,  way too much for most but i loved it.  i got the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash since it's a \"hash house\"  bomb! my wife got the chicken and waffles, huge huge portion and tasted great! i will definitely come back. thanks!", 
            "they refused service due to my pregnancy?!!\n\ni must say i'm really quite sad to write this review as this was once one of my favorite spots on the strip, but i will not be returning.\n\ni was visiting vegas along with a group of 6 people.  i'm currently 10 weeks pregnant with twins, so while they decided to walk to the restaurant, i hopped a cab because i wasn't feeling too well and was in a hurry to get some food in my stomach.  i figured i'd arrive 15 mins early and be able to get a table and get my food order in immediately. \n\nonce i arrived, the place was dead (it was about 9:30 pm), so i asked to be seated at a table for 6.  the hostess informed me that she was unable to seat me without the remainder of my party.  i was quite surprised as the majority of the tables were empty.  i explained that i am pregnant and experiencing morning sickness which worsens as i get hungry, could they please make an exception and seat me.  no, nothing she could do.   \n\nat this time, i started dry heaving.  now there is not a bathroom in this place, you have to go down and through the casino in order to find one, so i grabbed the garbage can from the hostess station and sat down.  i asked the hostess if i could at least get a sprite right now to calm my stomach?  she pointed to the bar and said, yeah, go ahead.   i was shocked that with nothing to do, she didn't even offer to go and retrieve it for me!!!   i rushed back to the bar and ordered my sprite (which they made me pay for at that time, instead of just tacking it onto my dinner bill - kind of unussual...) and sat back down to continue heaving.  \n\nas the dry heaving continued, i asked the hostess if i could put a food order in from the lobby.   no, not until you're seated (but of course they wouldn't seat me).  when the dry heaving continued, i asked her to bring me out a biscuit (they give these out for free with dinner)  which thankfully, she did and i was able to wolf that down and my stomach started to settle.    \n\nshortly after that, my party arrived.  they alerted the hostess, who then spent another 10 minutes readying the table (seriously?!)  and finally sat us.   i immediately ordered some food and asked the waiter to rush it.  while the rest of the group looked over the menu.   while we waited, i began to feel sick again.  i went over and grabbed a small trash can and brought it under our table, just in case because the distance to the bathroom was quite far.   \n\na minute or so after sitting back down, the manager, shawn, walks up to the table \"i'm sympathetic to your situation, but i can't have this here\"   i assumed he meant the trash can, so i said \"ok, maybe you could bring me a bowl just in case?\"   \"no ma'am, i mean you; you need to leave.  i just can't have you in my restaurant, it's disturbing to other patrons\"  my jaw completely dropped - for one thing, there was no one else around us!   for another, i hadn't actually thrown up a single time and hadn't even gagged while seated at the table!!  i was completely confused - \"the rest of your party is welcome to stay, but i'm going to have to have to ask you to leave\"   at this point i felt terrible and burst in to tears begging him to \"please just pack up my food, i need to eat before i faint!  i need to eat!  please!\"  at first he refused, but i think as the tears were flowing, he started to get a little embarrassed.  he went back into the kitchen and brought back a small plate of <mark>Corned Beef</mark>, dropped it at the table and then rushed away.   \n\nas i wolfed down my food between tears, the waiter returned and we asked him to send over another manager as we were pretty horrified with the treatment.    a female manager returned.  she did not apologize for the behavior or the other manager, but did say \"if you'd like to stay, you can stay\"  but honestly at this point, we weren't willing to patronize the place anymore.  \n\nso she brings back the bill.   \"you expect me to pay for this after the way i was treated?!\"   \"well ma'am, you did eat it\"   i should have walked out, but i was very upset and just handed her my credit card - $10 for by biscuit, soda, and a handful of <mark>Corned Beef</mark>.    \n\nwe made a complaint to the hotel manager (the quad) and although she was very nice and understanding, she stated that they did not have an affiliation with the restaurant and there really was nothing that she could do about how they ran their business.  \n\nsadly, i won't ever be returning.  the lack of any empathy from the staff is ridiculous.  with so many wonderful places on the strip and every other experience this trip great customer service, this place won't ever make the cut again.",

            "the portions here are too crazy. they serve giant portions that are surprisingly super flavorful. \n\nit was a pretty long wait but worth the experience. \n\ni came here with my grandma and fiance; fiance had a plain pancake (didn't even need syrup, it was so good just by itself), grandma had the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> & hash, and i had the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and biscuits. \n\nit was all so good.",

            "5 stars for my first visit. 2 stars for my second visit.\n\nwe stayed at the linq so hash house a go go was a convenient breakfast spot. besides, twisted farm food sounded interesting so we decided to give this place a shot. ended up waiting no longer than 45 min for a party of 2 for the first trip. second trip had no wait because it was late at night.\n\nservice: the first time around, service was awesome. our server brought everything to us in a timely manner. however, the second time around, at 3am, service was dead. what made me laugh was the fact that as the server was filling our glass cups and ran out of water, she nonchalantly said \"oh ran out\" and never came back to fill up my water cup. i was so thirsty from the disgusting <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash and dry biscuit. \n\nfood: for breakfast, the food was awesome. i had the gravy biscuit <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> thingy (idr the name) and it was savory and delicious. my girlfriend ordered the flapjack not knowing that it was the size of yao ming. the second time, i had the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash which was my biggest ragret. \n\noverall 3 stars for this place.", 
            "my husband & i thoroughly enjoyed the hash house. while waiting to be sat, we had drinks at the bar. service was great & attentive.  i ordered the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash with scrambled eggs. it was beyond huge & very delicious.  husband ordered the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> & it too was equally huge & tasty.  our only regret is there isn't a hash house in fort worth! we'll return on the next vegas visit.", 
            "this place was highly recommended by a couple of people. the place looked nice and the staff was friendly. they had a pretty decent sized menu and i was debating on a couple of things. i got the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash which was good, and my fianc\\u00e9 had the biscuits and gravy & really liked it. <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> side was that they advertised they had the best bloody mary's and it wasn't good at all. it said it had a fresh tomato pinwheel & bacon, and mine was only served with a green bean, olive, and lemon. and the mix wasn't good either, not very flavorful and  tasted watered down. and i'm sure this would be different if i was going back to my house or something, but the portions were monstrous! i'm one of those people who hates wasting food and there is absolutely no way i would be able to finish any of the plates they had there. i wish they would've told us how extremely big the portions were and we could have split something. and again if i would've been going home i could've taken leftovers, but we were walking the strip so that wasn't an option. since i hate wasting food, we overstuffed a togo box, which shows how much food we both had left, and gave it to a homeless group on the strip asking for food. so just a heads up from the staff to anyone that hasn't eaten there before would be nice.", 
            "the food was decent, the service left a lot to be desired. after a much longer wait to be seated than we were originally told, we order our food. it wasn't until then that we were told the kitchen is running behind and it would be 45 minutes for our food. when we finally got our food, the portions were huge (definitely recommend sharing) and were decent. my scrambled eggs were very dry but the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash and biscuit were very good. not sure if i would dine here again.", 
            "fantastic food!  a bit of a wait, but well worth it. our server was the very cheerful louisa. she made us feel right at home. i had the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash and my bf had the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. both delicious. both huge!  i swear my plate still looked like it had a full meal on it when i was finished!  giant portions of really good food. the strawberry lemonade was yummy too", 
            "i'm sorry, but no. if you look back on any of my reviews, you'll find that it's pretty uncommon for me to go against the yelpy grain probably because i lean towards spots that are already highly rated and they're highly rated for a reason. additionally, i very rarely give 1-star reviews. in this case? it's absolutely warranted, as my experience at hash house a go go was a bad one through and through. \n\nstar 1: how were the service and atmosphere?\n\ni like the 24 hour contemporary diner vibe at hash house a go go, but my service was absolutely dreadful. sure, there were a decent number of people present at 0300 on a sunday morning, but it certainly wasn't overwhelming and hhagg wasn't by any means short staffed. even so, it took a good 10 minutes for our server to notice that we'd been seated, and once our orders were put in, it was 25 minutes gone by until our server stopped by and very obviously realized that someone had gone wrong in the supply chain. he scampered back to the kitchen (literally ran) and roughly ten minutes later, or 35 minutes in total, three of our four orders came out. ten minutes later he stopped by again, only to realize that 25% of our order was still missing. another sprint back to the kitchen and all four of us had our food 55 minutes after putting in our orders. that is absolutely unacceptable by every single metric, and while i may have understood if something were comp'd, the thought clearly didn't even cross anyone's mind. what a mess. no star granted. \n\nstar 2: how were the portions relative to the cost?\n\nthis is the one place where i can't complain. opting for one of my favorite dishes (corn beef hash), i was pleased to have paid only $12.99 at a place that could very easily gouge for more. as you'll see in the picture below, these were pretty hardy portions, and i left not feeling as though i'd been ripped off. star granted. \n\nstars 3 and 4: how was the food?\n\nwhat on earth was this? let's be clear, <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash is finely chopped <mark>Corned Beef</mark> pan cooked in with potatoes and eggs maybe with a bit of cheese to bring everything together. it's a wonderful dish, and one of the great things about it is that it's exceptionally difficult to mess up.\n\nwhat i received instead of <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash, as you can also see in the picture, was a poorly mixed monstrosity. lousy and flavorless \"scrambled\" eggs on the side. a hard and flavorless biscuit next door, and a mound of poorly seasoned potatoes with a clump of shredded and rubbery <mark>Corned Beef</mark> sitting atop it. nothing was mixed together, nothing had good flavor, and all in all this was a colossal disappointment. no stars granted. \n\nstar 5: would you eat here every day if you could?\n\nit's apparent to me based on the other reviews that my experience was an odd one here at hash house a go go, but off day or not, this was one of the poorer dining experiences in recent memory in a town that's chalk full of great dining. i won't be back. no star granted.", 
            "portions were so huge i felt myself getting fatter just watching to food go by. we shared a breakfast <mark>Corned Beef</mark> & hash and it was just ok. i am a quality over quantity kind of person but if you want to eat a lot of food with mediocre flavor then go here!", 
            "service was good, food came out in a decent amount of time. we had a variety at the table. i ordered the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash with eggs over easy, very tasty. portions were large. weird that they offer a chorizo hash but don't have salsa. how do you serve a mexican dish without salsa. the strawberry jam/compote was yummy, not overly sweet to compliment the enormous biscuit. everything was cooked as requested. i was expecting something amazing & got a good meal. i wouldn't wait more than 15 minutes, the place was packed and the wait was long when we left.", 
            "this is a breakfast platter of goodness! i didn't think breakfast can be done different but they are doing it here. long wait, but worth it. i had the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash, different really goooood! then the \"pancake\" singular because all you need is one they are big. i had the banana pancake and it really did not need syrup!", 
            "got this recommendation from the bellhop at mandalay and he was sooooo right. really loved this place. they had an indiana motif which i thought was kinda cool because that's where i'm originally from. our server was really cool, don't remember his name, but he had a ginormous mohawk. he recommended the chicken and waffles, which i got and the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> skillet, which my tita ordered. honestly the portions are wayyyyy too big, but it's vegas, it's what you do. my sister's <mark>Corned Beef</mark> was out of this world. fresh, not canned, potatoes on point, and biscuit soft and buttery. the chicken and waffles were pretty good too. the waffles had strips of bacon cooked into it, and omg. so freaking good. sis and i both decided that this is a must everytime in vegas. oh and make sure you get your \"roadie\" on too.", 
            "this whole ordeal was pretty much heaven in a hand basket. our wait time was estimated at 40 minutes, but was only about 12 minutes. while we waited, we ordered drinks from the bar in the waiting area. be warned- those drinks are all about $2 more than the actual menu prices for them when you are seated.  \n\nwe had 4 dishes between the 5 of us, and that was way too much food. the biscuits and gravy were tasty and included a mashed potato situation that just worked wonders with this meal. the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash plate was not really a hash, but that <mark>Corned Beef</mark> was so good! \n\nthe other two meals we had were some of the more renowned ones. the chicken and waffles were amazing. in fact, the waffles are stuffed with bacon. yes, stuffed. with. bacon. that pretty much automatically made them the best waffles i've ever had. also, the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> was a massive heap of glory and all that is holy. \n\nin the end, we were very pleased. and our waitress was incredibly efficient and attentive.  so yeah, if i come back to vegas, i will definitely be back here.", 
            "soooo i really wanted to go here for breakfast. i drooled over photos on yelp before my trip and bookmarked it.  however, we ended up here in the evening at about 9 pm, so they didn't have their breakfast in full force. they had some, but not anything i was especially interested in. the whole menu is centered on gluttony, and i am a fat kid at heart, so i was in my element. however, i had already eaten 3 donuts that day in addition to a buffet and many many drinks, so i didn't want to go overboard and ended up ordering a chicken breast thing. my bf ordered some kind of <mark>Corned Beef</mark> sandwich. \n\nfood took forever and we were starving. when the food came out, my chicken breasts were on bones (ewwww, i can't handle meat on a bone) so i switched back into gluttony mode and asked if i could order a burger instead. server was very quick to whisk away the boned food and my burger came out fast. it was a full pound lucy stuffed burger with mozzarella and red peppers inside.  sounds amazing, right?! it was just okay. the burger was actually very bland and i had to put a bunch of salt and pepper on it. i got it with a salad to redeem myself a little bit. they also gave me fries too. fries were okay. salad was fine. i did manage to eat almost the whole burger. i would have definitely liked to come back for breakfast and plan to if i am ever back.\n\ntip: there's no cell service, and the wifi sucked.", 
            "wtf!  eating here took 5 years off my life!  i had the eggs and <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash, and the waitress shows up with an iron skillet with 5 lbs worth of food, including biscuit , fruit, etc.   awesome breakfast, love the food and portion size.   would get 5 stars, but minus 1 star for slow service and that long long line in front. ouch.", 
            "i gave it a four because of their portions.  a ****three*** for food. average of three stsrs for me. i ordered the <mark>Corned Beef</mark>. thos eas very yummy, but when i got to the sunny side up eggs, the they tasted like rust. i guess its because the food comes in a cast iron and it was a bit rusted. maybe not good for your health.  as far as the place,  the service was ok. the bathrooms were outside the restaurant. there were no restrooms inside. this was kind of a pain as they were located downstairs away from the restaurant.",

            "wowza!  the portions here are huge and probably could be shared - but i'll bet you won't!  i had the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash and egg breakfast and could not finish it.  i wish we had had a fridge in our room so we could have taken a \"doggy bag\"..  a little bit of a wait, but we had 12 people, so we expected it.  we didn't all sit together and that was okay also.  go.  eat.  enjoy.  you'll be glad you did!", 
            "i tried this place out because of a good recommendation from my brother. \n\n\nthe only thing that was great about this place was that it came in big portions... and... thats pretty much it. \n\ni had the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> in penne pasta. the chicken was pretty much flavorless. i could not taste the sage flavor or even the chicken flavor in this <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>. the penne pasta was just a bland cream sauce that was nothing special. \n\nmy dad had the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash and he said that his food was flavorless. we saw that everyone else was taking their food home because they thought it was good however, we thought... no need to take some flavorless food home. \n\ni would have to say that the only thing that brings this restaurant to 3 stars was their cucumber dressing on one of their salads with the polenta croutons and their honey coated biscuits. that was enough for a meal in my opinion. no need for the entree :)", 
            "i had no choice but to try hash house a go go.  my co-worker highly recommended this place and it had pretty good reviews from my yelp friends.  the family and i arrived at noontime on a saturday where we were met by a long wait. we waited along with the masses in the front of the restaurant listening to the woman call out garbled sounding numbers over their pa system until it seemed close to our turn.  when it seemed close to our turn, i had to go up to the front to ask her what number she just called.  tired of seeing my face, they finally called out my number and sat the family and i in the back corner of the restaurant.\n\nwe sat there perusing the menu.  google hangout messages were sent by my friends who told me that i needed order their <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash and their chicken and waffles.  we were all ready to order.  missing was our waiter.  we kept looking at the wait staff, but, none of them stopped at our table.  we didn't know if we had a waiter or a waitress.  then i saw a nicely dressed man getting drinks for a table that was close to ours, and i heard the table behind me grumbling about the waiter not being there to deliver their check so that they could leave.  we were already seated for 20 minutes.  we needed to go home, back to los angeles.  so, i flagged down the nicely dressed man and asked him about our nonexistent waiter.  after a little bit of chit chat, we gave the nicely dressed man our order.  it wasn't until half an hour later that our waiter finally showed up and introduced himself.  too late...your manager had already taken our order.  \n\nthe food was good.  the portions were big and could have been easily shared by two people.  the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash came on a skillet with lots of cheese, <mark>Corned Beef</mark> on top of potatoes, an egg, and a biscuit.  it was good.  even my daughter who doesn't like to eat meat liked it.  the chicken and waffles was impressive.  the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> came in a tower held in place by a knife. the chicken was flavorful and moist.  it was a winner.\n\nthe nicely dressed man, the manager came back to check on us.  like the tables around us, he gave us a 25% discount.  the waiter finally showed up at the end, perhaps he was expecting some kind of tip.  good food, but, nonexistent waiter.  i might've given them more stars if the waiter showed up.", 
            "pancakes bigger than your head, portions that can serve more than one, staff that are friendly and fun. i love this place! i tasted a bit of everything, by i had the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash which was awesome. i had a feeling that the portions would be hugs, so i passed on the eggs.", 
            "you had me at brunch. hash hash, you did not disappoint!\n\nafter reading several reviews about the long waits, we placed a name down on the waiting list for a group of 7 since reservations are not taken on the weekends. the hostess estimated an hour+ wait, but it was actually half that time. my friends and i went downstairs to the tables and gambled for 30 minutes, then went back to check the wait status. lucky us, there was a table ready when we checked back in!\n\ntime to break down the ratings for the food inducing coma items. warning: the following items listed were shared family style, the servers will remind you their portions are huge and sharing is advised unless your level of hangry is off the charts.\n\n<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> (5/5): the ultimate bomb dot com entree you want for brunch. one of the most popular dishes and we could all see why. gravy + biscuit + chicken, that deadly delicious combo had our tastebuds going.\n\n<mark>Corned Beef</mark> house hash (5/5): one of the best <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hashes i've had. you could taste the strips of <mark>Corned Beef</mark> which was salted to perfection.\n\nbuttermilk flapjack pancakes (5/5): at the end of the day, pancakes are pancakes... the specialty of hash hash pancakes is that its served as one flapjack and measures 14 inches in diameter! you aren't missing on much if you decide to forgo pancakes, but it's a great item to share in large groups.\n\nham, spinach, & cheddar farm scrambles (3.5/5): my least favorite dish, there's nothing special about it. the group wanted an item with eggs since the rest was already carb heavy. can't have brunch without eggs.\n\non top of the food being amazing, it is also super affordable, the amount everyone paid for was roughly around $10/each (unless you ordered special drinks). hash hash definitely belongs to the vegas strip.",

            "this \"twisted farm food\" caf\\u00e9 in the heart of the imperial palace was my breakfast location of choice for way to many early mornings. the urban/farm type decor is different, but well kept and clean. the food here is an experience to say the least. the menu is expansive to say the least with specialties such as <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> which is a 14oz budweiser and a side of bacon! or the blt bloody mary. they are known here for their <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles which are extreme for sure. please see a few of the pictures for the full impact. the service here was spot on, all the staff is younger sort of \"punk rock\" which fits the feel in general, but the food left me a bit confused. i never had the signature giant pancake or the chicken and waffles..but i did try several other items and found the experience to be pretty bi-polar. the home made giant biscuits that are given table side (and come with most any entree) are fun due to their sheer girth (that's right i said girth!)...but one bit left me tasting baking soda and begging for honey, or butter, or jam...or anything to quench my now parched gullet. this went the same for their signature \"hashes\" for breakfast. the \"crispy potatoes\" they are all built upon reminded me of the potatoes found downstairs at the buffet...i had the \"<mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark>\" skillet which was the driest experience laid upon potatoes i could have hoped for...although the skillet meatloaf breakfast was a nice change. the \"stuffed\" burger here are tasty, but beware the horseradish <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. i got these for dinner one night and lugged them back to my room. there was sooo much horseradish on the taters that i literally coughed them right back up. i know i know..sorry for the visual, but i don't want any fellow yelper's getting sucker punched by these taters in the future.\nperhaps i just ordered the wrong items 4 out of 7 meals, but i think if the food completely catches up with the service and hype, then this place is going to be a real vegas draw!",

(remember, we're in vegas)... so hungry. i wanted nothing more but to generously stuff my face. \n\nthe portions are huge! all i could do at first was just stare at the humongous size. well, only for half a second before my mouth began to attack the prey. \n\n1). <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> - stacked with the famous <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>, hot maple caramel reduction and crowned with fried leeks\n2). <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> - <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> w/ fresh spinach, <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs\n3). <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark>, cream cheese and scallions - house hash - tossed with crispy potatoes & topped w/ 2 eggs, served with fruit and biscuit\n\nwhere do i begin. the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was so moist. omg. delicious. the chicken was cooked perfectly and has the right crisp when you bite into it. juicy goodness. the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> was super good and it paired perfectly with the crispy chicken. the waffle was light, crispy, and fluffy! there were huge bacon bits in the waffle ... <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> of salty and sweet was amazing. their homemade maple syrup drizzled on top of it ... mmm. just made it even more amazing. \n\nthe benedict was also good! chipotle cream sauce. yummy. my only complaint was that they put a little too much cream sauce on top. it was a little hard to taste what i was eating since there was just so much sauce all over the dish.\n\nthe house hash salmon was decent! there was a good amount of salmon in the hash. the potatoes were cooked perfect! the scrambled eggs that came with it was nothing amazing.the biscuit was the size of two fists! o_o \n\nwe had a bunch of leftovers for the next day! :d\n\ngreat service. food comes fast!\n\npure comfort food:)", 
            "this place seems like it's packed 24/7 since it's open 24/7. i have a platinum rewards card so we skipped the wait (which looked ridiculous) and were seated in less than 5 min. even though that was speedy, it took about 45min for us to get our food after we ordered.\n\nthe taste of the food was good, which was probably the best part of the meal. it wasn't amazing but it was better than decent. we had the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles, <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, and the <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> scramble. the waffles were okay; i wish they had bacon bits throughout the whole thing instead of bigger pieces of bacon. the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> that came with the benedict were really good. the scramble was a little fishy but still good. \n\ni guess the portion sizes were reasonable/a really good deal for the price, but i feel like it would even be good if the prices were halves and the portions were halved. no one finished or even ate half of their meal, and i was eating with two pretty hungry guys who know how to eat. i feel like we wasted so much food because we took it to go and even though we ate some of it later, it wasn't as good and we didn't finish it. we all also felt really sleepy and tired after. i think it would be good hangover food but we weren't hung over lol\n\nif you eat here, definitely share. one entree will feed 2, maybe 3 people. i have no idea how it would be possible for one person to finish one meal. \n\ni'm not sure if i would come here again. it wasn't a terrible experience but it wasn't the best either. i liked it more than i disliked it.",

            "if this review was based solely on food, i'd give it 5 stars. the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles were delicious. the food was stacked pretty high and the portions are large. i had shared the dish with my boyfriend and we couldn't finish the whole thing. the chicken was juicy, yet crispy on the outside and complimented the waffles quite nicely. we also ordered the hash house with <mark>Fresh Mushroom</mark>, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato and fresh spinach. i think had we ordered any of the hash dishes with meat, it would've been game over.\n\nso here's what made it a 3star place: the location and wait. you think imperial palace is confusing to begin with, but wait until you try looking for this place. it's located on the second floor deep inside the casino. oh, but you can't access it from the casino second floor... it's in its own little vicinity. quite strange. and the wait took a while, around 45 minutes just to get seated. the service was slow and, on top of that, they forgot to put in our order, so we had to wait even longer. also our table was also being swarmed by fruit flies. not sure why, but it made the experience annoying.\n\nwould i ever go back? i think i'll try the other location down the strip.", 
            "my first impression was, \"featured on man vs food...you can see why when you see the huge portions!\"\n\nbreakfast of champions. if you can go to hash house a go go and finish a plate by yourself, consider yourself a champion. the portions are ridiculous! their menu entrees list the typical american breakfast foods with a little twist. their featured item on the menu is the chicken and waffles. i had the <mark>Fresh Mushroom</mark>, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato and fresh spinach hash and it was plenty to share with the boyfriend. the ingredients were very fresh, and it came with a side of a biscuit, an egg, and fruit. it was good, but i still feel like i should have tried their waffle or <mark>French Toast</mark> items because those looked delicious. we opted for the \"healthier\" choice that day because we weren't feeling well, so i'll definitely have to go back and try their token menu items. there was a bit of a wait, but it wasn't horrible, and our waiter did a good job trying to mediate the traffic.\n\nif you want breakfast right away, this isn't the place to go. but if you're down for the wait and willing to try this famous breakfast house then i say go for it.\n\nthe lasting impression? \"going back for some waffles!\"",

            "i was soooo excited to eat here.  i had it on my list and was making sure i was not going to leave vegas without trying it. it was easy to find.  just head straight through the imperial palace until you hit the escalators.  we were are very hungry after a night of drinking and dancing and hoped to not have to wait too long to get seated.  it was pretty busy and also a friday morning.  we were pleasantly surprised to get seated promptly in a nice comfy booth.  i ordered coffee and it came quick enough and was quite delicious.\n\none thing that stuck out in my mind as odd was the waiter told us right off the bat that the kitchen does not have any heat lamps, so the food is served out as soon as it's made. i thought ok, great, that means we will have our food quickly.  eh, not so much.   our food took a bit to come out.  it wasn't excessive but we definitely waited longer on our food than we did to get a seat.\n\ndue to knowing the portion sizes are enormous we decided to split plates.  my dining partner and i chose the <mark>HH Original</mark> benedict.  it comes with bacon, fresh tomato, fresh spinach, and is topped with a roasted red pepper cream as well as two eggs.  additionally it sat on top of a split biscuit with griddled <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. the potatoes reminded me of the potato pancakes my mom would make when i was a kid with leftover <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>-nice and golden browned and quite tasty. that was probably the best thing about the benedict.  the bacon was good too, but hey it's bacon.\n\n now for the not so good, the eggs were underdone and the parts of the white were still clear.  that kind of thing doesn't bother me, but i would prefer my eggs to be cooked correctly.  the thing that was the biggest bummer was that the food was luke warm.  so i guess the no heat lamp thing doesn't necessarily work to their advantage because my food had to have sat back there for a bit before arriving to the table because it was not hot.  also, the fresh tomato and spinach did not bring anything to the table.  had the spinach been slightly sauteed or wilted and seasoned, it could have been a different story.  i think having those put on top of the benny just made it even colder in temp.  also, the whole thing was under-seasoned.  \n\nthe red pepper cream tasted like roasted red pepper bisque that was under-seasoned and cold.  i really do like the concept of having a benedict topped with lighter ingredients and sauce, but it was all cold and under-seasoned and disappointing.  i kept going back to the bacon, egg and crispy <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  i will say that i was able to split this with another person and between the two of us couldn't even finish it.  our bill came to $12 each, and i was very happy, and even though it was underwhelming, it was still worth it for the price.\n\nmy other friends ordered the bananas foster <mark>French Toast</mark>-also huge, as well as the <mark>Fresh Mushroom</mark>, artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomato and fresh spinach hash.  my friend did not like her hash at all.  i tried it and agreed with her that it was completely under-seasoned.  i hate having to add salt at a restaurant.  i think it should come out seasoned correctly.  also the salt shaker had course salt in in that barely came out the holes in the shaker-a huge pet peeve of mine.  the bananas foster was huge but nothing out of this world.  what i did really like though was the split banana topped with sugar and bruleed.  it was so delicious and the banana developed a very creamy texture.  it was served still in the peel, which i thought was pretty cool.\n\noverall, the value is great, and the quality is also good.  i can only base this review on the one visit i made here, and there were definite flaws in the execution of the food.   although the plates are huge, impressive looking, the taste is what matters most, and it unfortunately was lacking.  however, on a whole, due to the value of the food and he fact that one plate can be split between two people, i would like to go back and prove that hash house can really live up to its hype.", 
            "portion control is thrown out the window at hash house, in fact i'm warning you now come hungry. \n\nthis was probably one of our top eats in vegas, not to mention one of the few times we woke up early enough to have breakfast, oh vegas how you screw up schedules so. \n\nsmall wait when we got there, but nothing horrible. the service was right on when we sat down to quickly take our drink order, tangerine mimosa, so delicious, and coffee (this was a must just cause i rose to the morning doesn't mean i'm not dragging). i wish i would have gotten our servers name her hair was super fun, perfect mohawk, and had great suggestions for our game of 20 questions at the hash house! \n\nordered the hash with <mark>Fresh Mushroom</mark>, artichoke hearts, sundried tomatoes, and fresh spinach $12.95. it came with a biscuit and wedge of watermelon, all served in a giant skillet. food was excellent, and i fully stuffed to the brim. \n\nside note: make sure you try the in house apricot jam, my table cleaned it out, sure hope they refilled it for the next customers. \n\nthe hash house is probably the only reason to go to the imperial palace beyond that steer clear of the area, tons of construction going on currently, and its a bit of a pain to navigate the \"entrance\" and park.", 
            "went for breakfast on saturday 5/31. there was definitely a crowd, but reading the reviews on here, we were fine with waiting. they said it would be about a 35 min wait, but it was really maybe 15-20. the menu is great. i wanted to try one of everything. :) i ordered the house hash - <mark>Fresh Mushroom</mark>, artichoke hearts, sun dried tomato and fresh spinach. it was great. so much food. i even ate the biscuit and i don't really eat much bread. the biscuit was crispy on the outside. so good. i definitely recommend this place. the service was great as well. wow, it can be super  busy and you get good service? love it. i have already recommended this place to a friend of mine who  has family in vegas. they will be trying this place out now :) i will be back as well.", 
            "wow what a great place.  ricky is a great resource for this place as a server. a pancake that is as big as an oversize plate and taste to match. steel cut healthy delicious oatmeal and egg whites with spinach and <mark>Fresh Mushroom</mark>. a trendy place to go on the las vegas strip. the portions are out of this world, bring an appetite.", 
            "my friends and i were looking for dinner options, and since we were already staying in the linq hotel, we figured this was a good place to go! when people say the portions are big here, they mean that they are huge. i consider myself to have a pretty big appetite, and i could barely finish my meal. \n\nwe all ordered some type of burger, and i got the <mark>Fresh Mushroom</mark> and swiss. our food took a while to come out, but that may have been because of our larger party. it was worth the wait though, because my burger was delicious! the mushrooms were perfect and the patty was huge and juicy! by the time i finished it, i could barely eat any fries. at least half of my friends had to take their food to-go because they were stuffed! next time i'm here, i might have to consider splitting a dish, haha. prices weren't too bad either, considering we were in vegas. i would definitely recommend this place and might be back in the future myself :)", 
            "whether you come here for brunch or late night drunchies, hash house is sure to leave you stuffed! during vegas' busy seasons, you might find yourself waiting 30+ mins to get a table depending on how big your party is. but trust me, it's worth it! \n\ntheir hashes are delicious & come in huge portions! i always get the <mark>Fresh Mushroom</mark>, artichoke hearts, sundried tomato and fresh spinach hash. the potatoes come diced and crispy seasoned to perfection. the biscuit that comes along with it is whatever's to me, i'm all about the potatoes + eggs. the eggs come scrambled and almost have a buttery flavor to me. they aren't as seasoned as the potatoes but i like that i can add salt + pepper to my liking. \n\nall the food here is hearty and big portioned so it's a great place to eat to prepare for all that drinking. \nif you do visit, be sure to try their bloody mary! it's one of my favorites in vegas, comparable to the one served at guy fieri's. it's not too spicy to enjoy but has just the right amount of kick to it. \n\nprices are what you would expect to pay in vegas, so $$$ but considering you'll most likely leave with leftovers, it's like purchasing two meals for the price of one. service here is always great!"

            "my friend michelle saw this restaurant on man v. food and she wanted to try it. we came here for lunch on the first day we were in vegas. i didn't see this restaurant last time i was in vegas, so i'm guessing it's fairly new. it's in imperial palace on the upper level. my friends and i had to wait for about 15 minutes before getting seated. we were looking over the menu and the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles caught my eye. i was stuck between the chicken and waffles and <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark>. \n\nas we were called in, i saw that other people's portions were huge! the plates were big and the food was also big!  i had to come to a final decision and the winner was chicken and waffles. after seeing one from the table next to us, my friend jenn and i decided to share. good thing we did because we were still unable to finish one plate! the waffles were thick and fluffy and also stuffed with bacon inside! major plus, since i love bacon! the chicken was surrounded with leek and a stick of sage that was pierced into the chicken. the sage was a little too overpowering for me, but it was something different. my friend michelle ordered the strawberry pancakes and it was the biggest pancake i have ever seen! i don't recall her finishing it all because it was so much! \n\nthis place was very good and the service was mediocre. it took a while to get our food but i think it was worth the wait! once again, the portions were huge and the prices were pretty decent compared to other restaurants on the strip.", 
            "hash house a go go...one of the best values on the strip! \n\nspeaking of which, to my surprise there was a hhagg location inthe imperial palace!!! i was pumped when i found out, cause i was staying next store at the flamingo! \n\nso, speaking of the imperial palace, i would never step foot in this place if it wasn't for the hhagg. i didn't know what to expect when i heard the restaurant was in this hotel. \n\nbut........ \n\nboy was i surprised! hhagg was a gem in the hotel. what a awesome job with the restaurant! very pleased. \n\nimportant!!! please read! \nbreakfast from like 830 am-11am was rocking! anywhere from 30min to an hour wait! we stopped back around 11:30/11:45 and we were seated right away and i was able to get breakfast food still (limited menu) \n\ni ended up getting <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> \ntwo eggs w/ bacon sausage or potatoes with 1 hh signature flapjack. make it a waffle or <mark>French Toast</mark> for a buck. $13.95 \name some value!! i will be back again!", 
            "some travelers get their kicks from group tours and antiquing.  i get mine from finding great places to eat breakfast.  i'm not really sure how i began my love affair with artery-clogging hash browns and german chocolate pancakes, but i don't forsee it ending any time soon.  i'm of the opinion that the very best breakfasts weigh down your tummy like a bowling ball made of sausage, which is probably why i had such a blast at hash house-a-go-go.\n\non the recommendation of a friend who used to live in vegas, my girlfriend and i ate at hash house on the second day of our recent vacation.  i ordered eggs mixed with <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark>, sundried tomatoes and (i believe) basil, served with a homemade biscuit and fried <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  i've had <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark> and sundried tomatoes together on pizza but never mixed in eggs.  <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> was every bit as tasty as i'd hoped it would be.  the fried <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> took me back to the pre-microwave days of my childhood, when my mom would reheat the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> she'd made the day before in a pan filled with melted butter.  the biscuit, which was significantly denser than i'd thought it would be, felt like it weighed half a pound.  if i'd eaten it with butter and jelly, i might not have felt very fondly about it.  however, on our table was a small metal tin filled with delicious jellied peaches, which turned out to be the perfect topping for hash house's ridiculously heavy pastries.\n\nhash-house-a-go-go offers friendly service and excellent breakfast food served at reasonable prices.  for me, the best part of my hash house experience was watching my tiny girlfriend try to eat a giant pancake that was at least 18\" in diameter.  she literally begged me to help her finish it but i was halfway to a food coma myself.  you win this round, breakfast!  but i'll be back.  sooner or later, i'm always back for more.", 
            "hash house a go go is a gimmick restaurant and that gimmick is huge portions (pancakes the size of frisbees and gianormous plates of chicken and waffles) and \"twisted farm food.\" i have to say within that gimmick hash house a go go executes excellently.\n\ni stopped by for breakfast on a saturday morning. the wait was pretty long (45 minutes to get seated and another 45 to get our food) but we were given an accurate wait time and warned about the wait for breakfast when seated so i felt okay with the wait.\n\ni ordered <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> with a snickers flapjack. the snickers flapjack is a frisbee sized buttermilk flapjack with pieces of snickers thrown right into the pancake. as the food arrived i could see the little snickers craters throughout the pancake. again, this is a gimmick, a candy bar baked into a pancake, c'mon! but i'll have to say, i thought it was delicious. enough to think i should keep a snickers bar in my pantry for all my pancake adventures.\n\nis this the greatest restaurant of all time? nope, but if you're in for the gimmick of big food that's over the top in its presentation, hash house a go go will definitely deliver. i was also impressed by the bloody mary that my friend ordered that had a strip of bacon in it and was served with a side of toast. truly a brunch appetizer as much as it was a drink.", 
            "so...the wait sucked at this place, but nothing else did...this was awesome!  anyone who has read other reviews i've posted knows i like one meal above all others, breakfast.  though my trips to indiana have led me to believe that there is little redeeming of that state that borders mine to the southeast, but the hash house a go-go may be it's greatest export.  \n\nwe had large group, so i'm sure that didn't help the wait, but the 2.5 hour breakfast we had was absolutely belly bustingly amazing!  our waitress was pretty aware of our wait and did a nice job to make sure our group of 6 was well cared for and not waiting long for things like coffee and other refills.  she was also helpful in ordering.  if it's your first time there, i recommend ordering (or talking someone else at your table into ordering) the chicken farm benedict.  this colossal tower of food was a sight to behold.  i went for <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark>.  \n\nthe tdc was two eggs (over medium), bacon, wheat toast and my choice of pancakes, <mark>French Toast</mark> or waffles.  this would normally be an easy choice (pancakes), but this place isn't your ordinary breakfast joint.  far from the ordinary, the pancakes, <mark>French Toast</mark> and waffles here are the size of a large platter.  and, with flapjacks like blueberry pecan, brown sugar banana, blackberry granola, snickers, butterscotch almond, apple cinnamon, mango coconut, strawberry frosted and granola waffles or banana cinnamon <mark>French Toast</mark>...forget-a-bout-it...this is the real deal.  \n\nmy choice was made slightly easier when i saw brown sugar banana pancakes.  i think that banana pancakes rank up there with precious jewels, gold bullion and other fine items that ought be cherished.  this was a banana pancake on steroids!  it was incredible.  it was soft on the inside, crispy and caramelized on the outside and delicious everywhere.  if i could have finished the one that i ordered, i would've contemplated ordering a second.  it was worth the gut busting pain that was likely to follow.  \n\nseriously, if you're in vegas, and you have the time to wait for a seat, get to this place for breakfast.  book some time before, and after, as you'll need to wait to get in and head back to your hotel for a food coma afterward.  this was a great meal and the perfect start to a 24 hour day in las vegas.", 
            "we went to sahara location in this morning.( andy t, jieun l, oliver, nino and myself) menu has lots of variety.\nyes portion was huge, but taste was so so.\nthe service was good. new trainer did good job. he checked us oftenly and asked refill my coffee from time to time.\ntheir one of drink lomonade mimosa was pretty good.\ni ordered <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark>. i got two eggs and bacons, and waffle. i chose granola waffle and this one was tooooooo chewey.\neven i couldn't cut  well with my knife. so i barely finished 4/1 peice.\ni poured syrup on top of waffle but it dosn't work well.\ni made to go for that leftover waffle.i guess i'm not going to finish left over. it will be more chewey tommorrow.", 
            "omfg.\n\nlike seriously, omfg.\n\ni had to have texted my friend just those four letters at least 5 times because this place was better than i could have imagined.\nthis was seriously one of the best breakfasts i have ever had. ever. \n\nmy boyfriend & i saw this place on one of the tourist channels in the hotel and they mentioned it had been featured on man vs. food. now, we both enjoy watching that show but have never had the opportunity to try one of the places where adam has gorged himself so we knew that we simply had to try this place before we went back home. and in my opinion, it could not have been better.\n\nfirst, i had fairly low expectations for this place because it is in a pretty seedy looking casino on the strip. i mean, i had never even heard of the imperial palace let alone knew that it had such an awesome restaurant hiding inside. also, it was known for having huge portions which typically means to me that the food is going to be just ok.\n\ni was totally wrong.\n\nthe restaurant itself is actually very nice compared to the rest of the casino. it's really spacious and clean, and they play awesome music. also, aside from your average orange juice, they offer tangerine juice. who else does that!? no one, that's who.\nmy boyfriend and i were already loving it just from those two things. \n\nfor breakfast i ordered <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> which i got with two over easy eggs, sausage and the brown sugar banana pancake.\nthat's right. this was no boring old plain whatever pancake with some bananas sliced on top. \nthis was a huge effing pancake with a beautiful crust of brown sugar goodness with at least two whole bananas cooked into the massive cake. omfg.\ndrool. \nthe delicately flavored moist and fluffy cake gently embraced the bananas as they were surrounded by delicious little pockets of crunchy brown sugar. i was a little closer to heaven with each bite. \nthe eggs and sausage were also stellar, perfectly cooked with surprisingly very little grease. i was very impressed.\n\nmy boyfriend chose the man vs. food favorite which was a ridiculous benedict of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and biscuits topped with <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, scrambled eggs, mozzarella cheese and some veggies covered with a chipotle cream sauce. it was huge. definitely the frankenstein's monster of benedicts if i've ever seen it.\nit was also very tasty though. the chicken was delicious, again surprisingly not greasy at all. especially for <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>. the chipotle cream was flavorful with a good amount of heat and all the veggies were super fresh. \n\nthe service was also spectacular. our waitress was super friendly and our food was brought out very promptly, even though she told us that our dishes may not come out at the same time. she told us they don't use heat lamps so they want everything to be served right when it comes out so it gets to you nice and hot. that is fine with me! \nthis place definitely deserves all 5 stars. great service, fantastic ambiance, amazing food and huge portions. \ni will for sure be coming back to this place as soon as i can. \ni would even drive all the way out to vegas again just to come to the hash house, it's that good. next time i have to try the chicken & <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>. \nyes. they have <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>. \nomfg.", 
            "a breakfast lovers dream!!\n\ni had heard of this place before but since the closest location was in san diego i soon forgot about it until someone told me i had to go while i was in vegas. i'm so glad i took that advice!\n\nthe portions are huge. i have a pretty big appetite and was able to split my meal with a friend and was still full as all get out! we shared the <mark>French Toast</mark> <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> which came with eggs and bacon and it was probably one of the best <mark>French Toast</mark> i've ever had! (even better than kimmie's coffee cup and i love their <mark>French Toast</mark>). anywho they dip it in some kind of banana cinnamon cream which is to die for.\n\nmy cousin and her friend split the vanilla waffle combo with potatoes and that was just as yummy. even after my stomach was aching from all of my food i still could not pass up a chance to try that wonderful waffle!\n\nif you're in vegas and looking for some delicious breakfast you have got to go here.. we even made a to go order for breakfast on the way home. it made the drive a little easier :)", 
            "as i am sure is the case with many, my boyfriend and i were made aware of this place through the travel channel's man v. food show.  the host visited the hash house a go go on sahara, and he tried the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict.  my boyfriend was hooked--when we went to las vegas at the end of last month, he insisted upon a visit.\n\nfortunately for us, we discovered that there is a second location in the imperial palace, which was right down the street from where we were staying.  in order to check on the times when certain food is served, my boyfriend repeatedly tried to call them with no answer at least the first two times.  \n\nthe restaurant is easy to find at the back of the casino and up a specifically designed escalator.  there is plenty of room to wait with seating for customers, and we only had to wait for about 15 minutes on a sunday afternoon around 12.  the hostess staff, presumably the same group that ignored our phone calls, were a little unprofessional, preferring to congregate and gossip rather than seat patrons or help in the dining room.  \n\nthe atmosphere in this restaurant is terrible.  the walls were covered in this industrial metal sheeting, which made it look like a warehouse.  it also amplified the noise in the room, which would have been invasive even without this design flaw.  it is clear that this restaurant is designed to make people feel uncomfortable enough to eat and leave as quickly as possible.  clearly this worked as no patrons i observed lingered over their ample meals.\n\nwaitstaff was friendly, but service was a little oblivious.  it took 20 minutes to actually receive a bar drink, and i think we saw our waitress three times during the entire experience.  we also lacked silverware.\n\nthe food was pretty good.  the sizes definitely live up to the hype.  i ordered the chicken salad sandwich, and it was huge.  the bread was the best part--it was homemade and thickly sliced.  the chicken should have been in smaller chunks, though, and it was a little tough, however, <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> of light mayo and tomatos really did add something to the sandwich.  the side salad had clearly been sitting in the fridge a bit too long and should have been discarded rather than served, but the cucumber dressing was a very refreshing accent.  \n\nthe best entree by far was the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict, which did not disappoint.  it was huge, layered with <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, eggs, fried cheese, <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, and topped with chipolte cream sauce.  it was an amazing combination and a huge entree.\n\nthis is definitely worth a visit, but it may not be worth a return.", 
            "this has certainly been my one stop shop for breakfast for many reasons..the staff is always very inviting and the few times i've gone they always seem to be very friendly..it's the genuine touch not the \"let me think you're god so i'll get more money out of you\" sort of way.\n\nthe food has no doubt been amazing and maybe someday i'll come close to even finishing half of the meal..the portions have always been massive, but hey who can complain about that? the wait time has been non existent, but i remembered just to go in early and beat the crowd (it always seems to fill up right as we're paying for the check).\n\ni have tried the snicker pancakes, blueberry white chocolate pancakes, and the truck <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark>. each has been a marvel in itself and cooked to perfection. \n\nfor an over the top breakfast destination look no further, but sharing is probably better if you aren't about wasting food!", 
            "this restaurant is located inside the imperial palace.   based on that fact, i totally didn't expect this place to be as awesome as it turned out to be.  my friends and i only tried this place out because my bf's sister (a major foodie) said that they had a good breakfast selection.  \n\nthe bf and i shared:\n\n- fresh market tomato salad: if you're gonna try a salad, try this one.  what won me over was the griddled crispy parmesan cheese that topped the salad.  it was soo goood.\n\n- ny times <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> tower:  okay, this is seriously something you have to try when coming here.  there's bacon in the waffles.  crispy <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> is so perfectly crispy.  then there's the leek on top?!!  i loved it.  i personally didn't like to combine the two but i also didn't mind eating it side by side.  what can be wrong about <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>??? and there's definitely nothing wrong with waffles.  the two make a very nice couple.\n\ni was also able to try one of my friends':\n\n- stuffed burgers (you get to choose from about 3 different stuffings - he tried mashed potato, bacon, and cheddar cheese): i thought the burger was okay...it was a little bit on the dry side but all in all, i like <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> of flavors in the 1 pounder.  \n\nthe service was decent.  we liked our waiter.  he knew the right times to come by.  i like the atmosphere.  very diner like.  apparently a lot of famous people come here so you can check out their wall of fame, which is pretty cool.\n\n\nthe hotel itself is so sucky but i guess not horrible.  the place reaks and i wouldn't stay here again (was here for the cheap prices haha).  but do come here for this restaurant :)", 
            "presentation is key, and also the key element when i rated this restaurant.\n\nmy friends and i went nearing memorial day weekend. i, of course, suggested this place only because i'm a man vs. food fan and had to try the ever so popular <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> hash house farm benedict. the dish was absolutely massive and the presentation was perfect. <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> of the flavors (tomatoes, cheese, bacon, and egg) was definitely something to \"yelp\" about all on its own - - down to the mash potatoes and the huge, fresh biscuit.  however, i found the chicken itself to be good, but not great [hence a rating of only 4 stars]. as a <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> connoisseur there was absolutely no flavor in the chicken. it definitely had to be combined with the chipotle sauce to be fully enjoyed, but it was not dry. i did eventually add tabasco sauce which heightened the entire dish ten-fold. furthermore, although it was not a man vs. food challenge, you can't eat the entire dish. it's just impossible. if you're able to finish the dish and live to tell about it, i'd be convinced that (1) an additional stomach was surgically added to your digestive system or (2) you're a cow.\n\nthe waiter was extremely nice and very accommodating i must add. i would definitely suggest this place to any vegas visitors/residents that want good food, good portions, and at a seemingly good price. enjoy yourselves and don't forget the tabasco! ;-)", 
            "the best chicken & waffles i've ever had in my life. roscoe's can suck it!\n\ni was guided here by yelp after searching for some nearby breakfast foodstuffs. reviews were solid, and they spoke of portions so huge they were legendary. finding it inside the imperial palace was a little tricky, but a helpful security guard guided us while he told me about how \"you can't go wrong with anything\" in regards to what i should order. we got seated no problem - must have come during a lull. \n\nmy eyes immediately locked on the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles once i was presented with the menu. two succulent fried breasts of chicken placed atop a tower of four <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>, coated in syrup. call a cardiologist because i was ready to risk a heart attack for this meal. \n\nof course, i can't have a big breakfast meal without a suitable beverage. enter the b.l.t. mary, a 20 oz. bloody mary made with bacon-infused vodka, all the usual fixings, and garnished with a strip of bacon, romaine lettuce and a tomato slice. it also came with a single piece of white toast that my gf noted looked like a large melba toast. i opted out of eating it, though. \n\ngood thing, too, because my jaw went slack when she brought out my order. the portion was gargantuan. i quickly dove in. the chicken tasted like something sweet had been added after the deep-frying, making it ridiculously savory in addition to being extremely succulent. the waffles were so chock full of bacon that it was protruding from every seam. <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> of chicken, waffle and syrup was the experience i wanted to have at roscoe's, but never got. the flavors were so good that i drove myself to finish off both breasts and 3 of the waffles entirely. after that, i was certain my stomach was about to explode. \n\nmy gf got the \"basic two eggs with potatoes, bacon and fruit\" for $6.95, but there was nothing basic about it. the plate was huge, and she could barely finish it off. even their most unassuming items are still enough food for two. total out <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> was about $35, and worth every single penny. i'll be making this my go-to breakfast spot in vegas from now on.", 
            "my husband and son love breakfast, so we had to try this place.

            "tried the food here with two other friends, based on an absent friend's testimony, and the store's appearance on man vs. food. although there was no nearly wait time when we arrived around 11:30am, what one would think is near peak hours for a restaurant, the food that arrived was pretty terrible. \n\nordering <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark>, $12.95, i got a fairly large blueberry pecan pancake (flour, eggs, buttermilk cheap carbs) with two eggs and two slices of bacon. one of my friends later pointed out that the pancake alone was $7.95. ripoff combo? i think so. the quality of the pancake was on par with any ihop or instant mix and the blueberries were undoubtedly frozen and few and far in between along with the pecans.\n\nmy other friends ordered the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, $15.95, and a burger, $13.95. the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> being the restaurant's signature dish seemed like it should be the best dish. however, all that arrived was a heaping mound of mash potatoes (very cheap carbohydrates once again) covered by greens and a pair of biscuits with a <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breast steak. the chicken breast was so dry that the fibers were distinctly frazzled after a bite and tough enough to compete with jerky. the burger that came was clearly overcooked and consisted of low-quality ground beef and over-sized buns. \n\nincessant praise for large portions at this restaurant seem misguiding in that only the cheapest components of each dish are liberally given while the main components (the protein and pricier ingredients) are sparse and low quality. too many people are wowed by cheap filler and blind to the poor quality of the cooking here. would definitely not come back. just go to kfc or ihop. i'm not fans of either but both are leagues ahead of this joint.", 
            "once again i found myself eating here and my intuition didn't let me down. i decided to go adventurous and force myself to not get my regular <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> which is certainly salivating, but i was looking to sample something completely different this go 'round. \n\ni found myself leaning towards the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash scramble while my other guests went for the basic breakfast and my wife had <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> in the end. i must say their <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash was actually really good. it was the first that i had devoured which had not caused my insides to be overloaded with a salty after taste. i tip my hat to the hash house for that one and all others should take note that <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash doesn't need to be over salted to be bueno!\n\nthis was a short review, but what can i say? the service has always been top notch, the food is out of this world, and thank goodness when i come to vegas i have found a must see for breakfast time and time again!", 
            "my bf and i walked here after we found out that bb kings charges 10 bucks for their breakfast special of 2 eggs, hash browns and a biscuit. uh yeah, no thanks.\n\nso, it's located on the 2nd floor at the imperial palace. trying to find the hostess stand in this clusterf*ck of people is ridiculous. the stand need to be moved to the entrance to the restaurant, not set back halfway into the lobby. \n\nthe server was nice, but perhaps a little overwhelmed. the one thing that i noticed here is that the servers didn't really help out any table but their own. not much teamwork. for example, i sat with an empty glass of iced tea while the waitress at the next station filled empty glasses for her customers and walked right past our table with a half-full pitcher of tea. nice. \n\ni ordered the blue cheese burger which was okay. the meat was dry and not juicy as i had hoped. it was massive, that's for sure and they brush the top of the bun with butter or oil, which makes it really slippery and hard to handle. my bf had <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> with a blackberry granola pancake. he said that it was average. \n\nmy main complaint here, i think, is the massive amounts of wasted food. seriously, why does every plate need a whole sprig of rosemary? i get the whole presentation thing, but c'mon. i would rather have smaller portions and be charged less, but that's just me.", 
            "can you say hellllooo hang over food! \n\nhash house is inside imperial palace where i was staying for 3 days.  we had the pleasure of going twice.  the first day we had quite a long wait approximately an hour but once i received my food, i understood why.  the special that day was chicken and waffles and they were down to one waffle iron for the whole restaurant.  yikes!\n\nthe setup of this place is pretty typical - nothing fancy but definitely clean and orderly.  the  portions are huge and the prices are surprisingly not a hard hit to your wallet.\n\nfirst things first, bloody mary blt.  it comes with toast, bacon, lettuce, tomato and deliciousness of a perfectly concocted blood mary drink.  it was a beautiful display and the blt was a great appetizer to my hungry/angry aka \"hangry\" tummy.  \n\nlike i said, this day the food was very slow and they brought out our dishes one at a time.  we had four at our table and the first person was finished eating by the time the fourth received their food.  i ordered the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> and eggs.  it was actually <mark>Corned Beef</mark> and not hash - score!  deliciously flavored and hot at arrival.  my boyfriend and our friend ordered the chicken and waffles.  i tried a bite reluctantly and lets just say i do not like <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark>, however, the professional chicken and waffle consumers at my table had rave reviews.  our friend finished his plate so they brought him a signed menu congratulating him.  it is a big feat to clean your plate so they have a fun way of recognizing the big eater! \n\nour 2nd time going to hhagg, there was no wait.  the service was a delightful woman who was fast and extremely polite.  i ordered the chorizo/eggs which was equally delicious as my first trip.  \n\neven if i do not stay at imperial, hash house will be a staple in my vegas breakfasts for each trip!  well done my friends, well done!", 
            "not as good as their flagship out on sahara, but this one's right on the strip, although with the renovation you have to wade thru some dust and scaffolding to get here. the portions were just as monstrously large though, and this time we split 2 dishes among the three of us lightweights, and we left full having not even finished either of them. i'd have picked the chicken and waffles for sure but democracy won out. here we tried the chorizo skillet and <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark>. the chorizo skillet was good, although the one tortilla it comes with is inadequate for the amount of filling it comes with. <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> we upgraded to a banana pancake which was well worth the extra dollar. service was excellent. \n\nthe experience at their standalone restaurant on sahara was better in terms of the atmosphere, the food, and the overall experience, but this was still fine.", 
            "at first look, the pictures of the food that are hanging near the entrance of the restaurant look horrible but the food turned out pretty good. i had the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with waffles. this dish did not meet my expectations. the chicken was bland and there wasn't anything especially good about the tower of <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>. however, <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> with the brown sugar banana flapjack was delicious. the griddled <mark>French Toast</mark> was also great. also the watermelon kiwi drink is a must have.", 
            "it was a sunday morning at 11:30 am and my friends and i had miraculously left our room by check-out time and dragged ourselves down to the 2nd floor of the imperial palace where the hash house lives.  there was a gigantic crowd waiting outside, but we ended up being called to our table within 10 minutes.\n\nwe tried to glance at some other tables on our way in to get an idea of the food...and holy crap the portions are huge.  i recommend splitting if you can...you'll definitely still be full even with half of a meal.  \n\nour table of 3 ordered:  <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> with the griddled <mark>French Toast</mark>, the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash, and the original eggs benedict.  i sampled all of them and everything was amazing.  i supplemented my <mark>French Toast</mark> breakfast with a much needed bloody maria.  this was my first time having the bloody maria, which uses tequila instead of vodka, and it was outstanding.  settled my stomach and removed my hangover successfully!!\n\ni was not even close to finishing my <mark>French Toast</mark>.  there were two inch and a half thick slices that were about 5 inches square.  it was flavorful and served with a grilled banana.  \n\nour service was quick, friendly and attentive - no glasses were left empty and the coffee refills were plentiful.  \n\nonly downside, aside from being in the imperial palace, is that the restaurant has no bathrooms of its own...and so you have to go wander through the casino and use the ones there.", 
            "after our $60 breakfast here i can safely say this place isn't worth the hype!\n\nwhen we arrived at 9:30am there was no wait. when we left, maybe an hour later, there were so many people waiting it had to have been over an hour wait. let me tell you, i would have been pissed if i had waited more than 15 minutes for this breakfast!\n\ndrinks - i ordered a watermelon lemonade and bf ordered a pistachio iced mocha. the drinks were awesome! mine was slightly sour but had enough watermelon flavor that it wasn't too much. his pistachio mocha was sooo good! i was mad that i didn't order it. \n\nfor breakfast both my bf and my bff ordered <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> which is two eggs, bacon or sausage, and a pancake, or you can substitute a waffle or <mark>French Toast</mark> for one extra dollar. bff got the pancake (that thing was bigger than the plate it was served on!!) and bf got the vanilla waffle. \n\ntheir eggs (scrambled) were nice and fluffy, the bacon was alright. his waffle was good, but didn't taste like vanilla, and her pancake she liked, but couldn't even eat half of it.\n\nmy order - okay you know when you read the description for something and then it arrives and you realize you read the description all wrong? this is what happened to me. \n\ni ordered the <mark>HH Original</mark> benedict. eggs benedict - i expect hollandaise and some poached eggs. whatever else happens is fine, but those are the things i need. i read that i would get a biscuit instead of an english muffin and there was mention of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, although i didn't know how that would fit in. i read about the red pepper cream, but i thought that would be along with my hollandaise. i read basted eggs, and i honestly didn't know what that meant. \n\nso i received this massive red mess with sprigs of rosemary and what look like pine needles shooting out the side of my food. i get trying to make a plate look nice, but this was a bit much.\n\nthe taste? eh. the top layers are alright. the basted egg is overcooked, no runny yolk at all, but the sauce was okay and the tomato was fine. the bottom layers though, a dry ass biscuit on top of dry <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. not a good combo. they really have no business calling this any sort of benedict since they strayed away from every traditional benedict characteristic possible, aside from stacking everything on top of each other.\n\nthere are many better places to drop $60 on breakfast at in vegas - this is not one i would revisit. also, apparently there was an episode of man vs food filmed here? that must be their claim to fame because our waiter mentioned it at least 5 times. wow, i am so impressed.", 
            "heard this was a really good place for a heavy big plated breakfast or as one of my friend said \"denny's on steroid\" and usually there's a 3 hour wait because it is always packed. well i was already starving but since i wanted to try this place i decided to try it. luckily when we got there, there was no wait....and we got seated right away...and this was a saturday around lunch time. we all decided to kind of share since the portions were so big...so i ordered the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> which was featured on man vs. food as a favorite food of this restaurant. \n\nmmmmmm it was delicious indeed! the sauce was amazing and <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> of <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, egg, biscuit covered in an amazing gravy sauce was sensational and i probably could have finished the whole thing myself if i wasn't watching out for carb intake....however i totally wiped clean my half of the plate. hehe \n\ndefinitely a good place for very hungry people and for those that love a heavy amazingly delicious breakfast meal.", 
            "i'd been dying to try the san diego location since friends keep posting pictures of these giant fancy plates of food from this place. we walked in about 9 am on a sunday morning. we saw lots of people sitting in the waiting area so we were expecting a wait but luckily the hostess just ushered us in. they have plenty of small tables available for 2- 4 people. guess there were large groups outside. but by the end of the meal, the place was packed, both inside and out. anyways, the first thing the waitress said was that the portions are huge. i already knew that and decided to split a dish with someone. the guys each ordered their own dish and ended up boxing up half of it. hahaha. so i split the house hash with chicken. it was served in a heavy iron skillet along with a biscuit, 2 eggs and fruit. we were starving but it was so much food. the two of us had trouble finishing it. it wasn't that amazing either. the food is just ok. i don't know if i love it or will crave it in the future. it's a little bit greasy. i think their gimmick is just huge portions and i guess their food presentation is pretty good. my friend got the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict (which is a man vs food fav) but man it's like almost a foot high, everything piled on top of each other. looked really good. i only tried a bit of the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and chicken and hollandaise sauce. it was tasty. that dish was like $16 though. everything is about $15 or more but i guess if it feeds you twice, it's ok. hard to have leftovers on vacation though and i'm guessing a lot of people that come here are tourists. oh and the other guy at our table got <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> with a waffle, eggs, sausage, and fruit. the waffle took up like  of the plate and half of the waffle went home with us as well. haha. oh and i have to mention service was horrible. our waitress liked to disappear for long periods of time. she was nice and polite but nowhere to be found. other people brought out our drinks and food. and we had to flag other wait staff to get an extra plate and boxes at the end. man, it would've been a much quicker meal if we had better service.", 
            "i had to go here because it was featured on man vs. food.  i love adam richman to the point that i want my future kid (if i were to have one) to be named after him.  i watch his shows and i constantly watch the reruns on netflix.  dude, i hyperventilated when he friended me on facebook (his personal page!!!).  \n\nfor those of you that know me can vouch that i have a pretty big appetite.  i have the appetite of a 6 foot lumberjack.  heck, i ate more than the boyfriend and his younger brother in a single sitting so... w/ that said, i ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> hash house farm benedict.  the entree: hipotle cream with peppers, scrambled eggs, mozzarella, <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, bacon, tomatoes, spinach, biscuits on top of potatoes.  \n\nthe size of this thing is huge but i cleaned it no problem.\n\nwhat was disappointing though was that although <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> is crazy and unique, it was rather bland and dry.  i hardly ever use ketchup on my breakfast but i had to resort to that since the chicken was extremely dry.  \n\nthe boyfriend got a regular omelet w/ a bloody mary (you get to keep the glass) and the younger brother ordered the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> w/ whipped cream and a glass of milk but our server failed and brought out chocolate milk instead.  \n\nthe food took some time because we were told everything was made from scratch.  the wait was fine since the 3 of us talked and if i recall, both guys were on their phone playing games whilst i looked on.  i was pissed that i had no reception (at&t/iphone) plus i did not want to drain my battery.  \n\nafter devouring about 7,000 calories, i was ready to drink my glass of water and tackle on the macaroons at bouchon bakery and that was exactly what we did... if i continue to eat like this, i must live at the gym but thankfully i don't eat like this daily although i so could.  \n\nthanks to the eating escapades and overloading on diet sodas, i'm not eating meat and have not touched diet soda since monday.  it is only wednesday and i've lost my vegas weight gain and feel pretty darn proud of myself.", 
            "located on the second floor inside the imperial palace casino on the strip.\n\nwe came for an quick bite after catching the human nature show.  our server asked us if it was our first time eating at hash house.  we said yes.  he warned us that portion size was huge.\n\nknowing that, we opted for the \"just grazing\" section of the menu as it was around 9:30pm.\n\nhubby got the bbq pork ribs and i had the fried green tomato stack.  i wished i had taken a picture of my order.  four slices of cornmeal crusted green tomatoes with <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark> and chicken breast meat stuffed in the barrel.  and stacked on top of a huge watermelon wedge.  it was very good.  i enjoyed <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> of tomatoes with the chicken breast meat.\n\nhubby's pork ribs were tangy, tender, and sweet and the meat fell off the bone. sat on top of some red potatoes.  good combo too.\n\nbeverages included homemade lemonade and the kiwi strawberry watermelon which was way too sweet.", 
            "came there to eat some brunch and ordered chicken and waffles and <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark>. both were pretty good, but the restaurant itself was unsanitary. we saw a cock roach on our table and got rid of it as soon as we saw it on the table. we wanted to get our meal compensated, but without any proof, that wasn't possible. so the food was good, but unless they manage to get rid any possible infestations, i will not be going back.", 
            "i was craving breakfast at 100pm so we decided to go to has house a go go at the m resort. we were there last year, and now i remember why we haven't been back since, service was bad! last time we were there, service was sooo slow, this visit wasn't any different. mind you, the place was not packed considering it was a saturday but maybe because of the time. my drink didn't come out right away (i had the tri colored lemonade (watermelon something)) but my husband got his immediately. for the main food, he got the famous <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> (as featured on man vs food) and i just ordered <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark>. i asked to have my eggs \"over medium\" as i hate to have runny whites (that's just me). it took forever for the food to come. the waitress never came back to say what the hold up was. so after what seems like an eternity, the food came. his food is good, but mine, well, i had to ask for new eggs. i told the waitress i wanted it \"over medium\". she gave me a lecture on how over medium means the yolk is still runny, i said i understand but the white part on my eggs were still runny (i showed it to her on the plate; when i cut the eggs, the white part were still liquid and this was practically over easy). she said she'll get me a new one. the waffle, on the other hand was good, except the little tin cup of syrup was placed on the waffle itself. not such a good hygienic practice; how do i know where that thing was before they stuck it on my waffle! when we were done paying, the waitress places the black bill container on our table, no thank you's, nothing! at that time, my husband and i just looked at each other and said, this is the reason why we haven't been back! now, we will never come back, ever! the food may be ok/good, but the service was horrible!",

'13) but oh well. only con was that the service was pretty slow, it took about 1/2 an hour to get our food, but can't really beat $7 each for breakfast ($13.95 for <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> normally).",

            "hash house a go go is definitely a new favorite of mine. we stopped by for dinner before our evening outings. the place was only at 50% capacity,  but for some reason as a table of 7 we were forced to wait 15 minutes. \n\nour server was very cheery and helpful but service overall was quite slow. he would linger for too long when we didn't need him, yet completely disappear when we required something. very annoying. \nservice: d+ (-1 star for that)\n\ni ordered <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark>: two eggs + sausage accompanied by one gigantic pancake. opted for the brown sugar banana flappy for an extra $1. eggs and sausage were nothing special, but that pancake was absolutely insane. 1.5 feet in diameter with at-least two bananas inside! tasty but overall too sweet, and too much of it; like trying to eat bananas foster alone for dinner. i barely ate half of the pancake. \n\nthankfully the girlfriend's [chicken] breast was the perfect savory item to balance my sweets. delicious with yet again very generous portions. i'd be tempted to order this next time. \n\nothers ordered the chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> and meat loaf: only good things to say about them. even the kid's cheeseburger looked decent and large enough to satisfy the average adult. everything was reasonable priced as well. most items were $12-$20. very impressed. \nfood: a-\n\n**tips\n-don't be the fool that fills up on those delectable honey biscuits. \n-if your name isn't takeru kobayashi, you're not going to finish your food. don't try to be a hero, son. \n-not in the mood to devour a small animal? you better split something. \n\ndefinitely a go go for me!", 
            "my husband and i ate here 9/29/13 and boy was it fabulous! i got <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> (eggs.sausage.and <mark>French Toast</mark>!!) yummy! and my hubby i believe got the man vs food favorite but i'm not 100% sure (biscuits. chicken fried steak. chipotle sauce) ...the portions are huge and it was so cheap!! $30 for both ..even ihop costs more! highly recommend this place wish we had one in our hometown.", 
            "i'm never impressed by quantity over quality but i really wanted to like this place. the wait was 90 minutes for breakfast so we went and gambled and returned in 75 minutes $150 richer. score!  so, we're all riding a jackpot high ready for some good food. i was drawn to the benedict menu, while my dining partners had <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and corn beef and cocktails. maybe it was the alcohol -- they loved their food but i was greatly disappointed (drinking coffee).  i had the <mark>HH Original</mark> that was supposed to have tomato cream sauce. i was unpleasantly surprised to receive a plate covered in marinara sauce; eggs, mash, biscuit covered in marinara. the biscuit on it's own-delicious. the mash-yum. <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark>?  an utter failure. where was the cream sauce?  my recommendation, drink heavily or win the price of the meal and you won't care so much.", 
            "talk about breakfast for dinner! after a night out at the club my friends and i headed over to hash house a go go for a late night/early morning meal. i ordered <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark>, two sunny side up eggs, one sausage, and one (extremely large) brown sugar banana flapjack! the pancake was absolutely delicious, it had a slight crispness to it from the brown sugar but it wasn't overly sweet. i was so focused on my pancake i almost forgot my sausage and eggs and even then i only ate about a fourth of the pancake. but i assure you that wasn't a problem, because i saved it and ate it the next morning at my hotel, there was even enough to share with my mom and she loved it too! our waitress was super fun and we had a great time! i definitely will be going back on my next trip to vegas, or hopefully check out one of their other locations.", 
            "one of our favorite restaurants to go to when in vegas. seen it on man vs food we also have been to their original vegas location on sahara. the portions are huge. we got the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict it's enough to share with someone and still leave the place full. our other visits we got the chicken and waffles. also <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark>. never disappointed here. i have recommended hashhouse to my friends and they have loved it. be prepared for a wait because they are always busy.",

(remember, we're in vegas)... so hungry. i wanted nothing more but to generously stuff my face. \n\nthe portions are huge! all i could do at first was just stare at the humongous size. well, only for half a second before my mouth began to attack the prey. \n\n1). <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> - stacked with the famous <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>, hot maple caramel reduction and crowned with fried leeks\n2). <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> - <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> w/ fresh spinach, <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs\n3). <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark>, cream cheese and scallions - house hash - tossed with crispy potatoes & topped w/ 2 eggs, served with fruit and biscuit\n\nwhere do i begin. the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was so moist. omg. delicious. the chicken was cooked perfectly and has the right crisp when you bite into it. juicy goodness. the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> was super good and it paired perfectly with the crispy chicken. the waffle was light, crispy, and fluffy! there were huge bacon bits in the waffle ... <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> of salty and sweet was amazing. their homemade maple syrup drizzled on top of it ... mmm. just made it even more amazing. \n\nthe benedict was also good! chipotle cream sauce. yummy. my only complaint was that they put a little too much cream sauce on top. it was a little hard to taste what i was eating since there was just so much sauce all over the dish.\n\nthe house hash salmon was decent! there was a good amount of salmon in the hash. the potatoes were cooked perfect! the scrambled eggs that came with it was nothing amazing.the biscuit was the size of two fists! o_o \n\nwe had a bunch of leftovers for the next day! :d\n\ngreat service. food comes fast!\n\npure comfort food:)",

            "i love this restaurant. it's my first time at this location, but the menu is the same at all of them. giant american sized portions of food, loud music, and crazy menu combinations such as snickers pancakes,   chicken and waffle towers and man vs food challenges. i had <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> with <mark>French Toast</mark> and my boyfriend had the meatloaf hash.  they were both excellent. our server was the lovely louisa. she was very nice and smart. i ordered a chicken sausage and she told me the casing was pork. most servers don't think that far ahead to tell a customer whose ordering chicken sausage that it contains pork, because obviously they don't want pork sausage or they wouldn't go out of their way to order chicken. \n\nshe also told us how long the ticket times were, which i've never had a server do in a casual restaurant. what a great idea! that way, you're not sitting & thinking with a stink eye that they forgot about your order because it's taking a while. we really liked her service very much. if you're hungry, this is the spot. my boyfriend is a big eater, and he was defeated. this location is open 24/7 as well, so you're never lost on getting your giant food fix!", 
            "great food! really big portion sizes so if you don't eat that much i recommend sharing. i had <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> that came with a gigantic pancake that i couldn't even finish 1/4 of and sausage and eggs. also tasted some of the chicken & waffles. yummmm! not too big on breakfast foods but i would definitely go back.", 
            "visited the hash house a go go for the first time during our vegas trip on 8/16/15, and omg the food was just amazing! i had already heard raving review's about the restaurant but wow this place really is delicious. \n\nwe of course did have to wait about 40 minutes to be seated but it wasn't too bad since we were able order drinks at the bar to enjoy during our wait. i ordered the bloody mary and it was perfection, to think i don't even like them but this one was just right. our waiter was extremely friendly and very enthusiastic which made the whole experience fun. \n\ni ordered s'mores mocha based off of someone else's raving yelp reviews and i'm so glad i ordered it because it had to be the best mocha i've ever had! \n\nfor my meal ordered <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> - two eggs w/ bacon & sausage a side of potatoes with 1 blueberry pecan flapjack, which was perfection! everything had so much flavor it was all very delicious. oh and did i mention the portions are huge, most def want to share. \n\ni wish there was a hash house a go go in norcal i guess for now i'll just have to visit san diego or vegas. :)", 
            "food was tasty.  has the chorizo skillet.  potatoes were the best \"home fries\" i have ever had.  sausage was great.  guy next to me had <mark>French Toast</mark> and said it was ok.  he also had a piece of <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with 1 bite taken out of it - he said it arrived stone cold.  bartender more or less ignored everyone at the bar except for a group of guys at the end being very loud.  had to ask to have my coffee refilled every time i needed more (very small coffee mugs).  coffee is not great.  they do have \"to go\" cups of coffee.  lady next to me ordered right after i did (<mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark>) and i had finished and left before she got it.  she had to ask where it was and i did not see it show up before i left.",

            "after much hype from the man vs food episode with adam richman, hash house a go go  opened a 2nd location at the imperial palace on the strip.\n\nhhagg is known for their enormous portions of farm fresh food with a twist and we have been to the sahara location several times including the man v food shooting so we were hoping to see the same food,service and atmosphere as the original.\n\nthe entry/waiting area has a wall of photographs of celebrities who have visited. the dining room is typical with boothes along the walls and tables filling in between. a few tv's i n the center hanging from the the ceiling a small bar along one wall.\n\nwhen we arrived there was no line so we were seated immediately but don't surprised if you have to wait 30-45 minutes when it gets busy. this place is well staffed so they keep it moving.\n\nwe ordered drinks-coffee and soda then our meal-i got the fried <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> sandwich & fries and my son @milesdavisvegas got the farmer's daughter-<mark>French Toast</mark> w/bacon & eggs.\n\nit took awhile for the food to come out -i had 3 cups of coffee waiting but the place really got busy after we arrived and our waiter was new,actually his 1st day on the job.\n\nthe <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> was fantastic-thin & crispy-pickles onion and ketchup!!\n\nthe <mark>French Toast</mark> was great-thick cinnamony with strawberries and banana,the bacon was crisp and the eggs cooked perfectly over-easy lots of yolk no runny whites!!\n\ni'm a little biased towards this place because its 1/2 places in las vegas that serve a tenderloin sandwich so i don't really explore the menu -just burgers,breakfast & the tenderloin but i see lots of people trying the chicken & waffles really killin them:)\n\ni see the reviews on yelp really rip this location but that wasn't my experience. the service was good, the food was good and it has the same feel as the original location minus the long wait.\n\nmy only knock on this place is the prices but that's just me-because-i mean the biggest thing about a midwest menu is that it's  simple & cheap!!!", 
            "i was in las vegas for a company function and had heard and read about the reviews for this place. i was eagerly anticipating my visit and even had spoken with my colleagues about going. we were staying at the flamingo so the location was ideal for us to visit for breakfast. there were 12 of us that went in and when told it was a 40 minute wait 8 decided to go elsewhere. the remaining 4 decided we would wait; you only get to vegas so often; right? we waited for 40 minutes and we were finally seated. everything is okay so far. the menu looked fantastic and i had already made up my mind i was having the chicken and waffles. i could not wait!! we ordered coffees and water and then our meals. the menu states clearly \"please be patient, everything is made from scratch and can take time to prepare\"; i am more than okay with this. i am willing to wait for fabulous, fresh food. this is where things began to deteriorate rapidly. our waitress while bubbly was inattentive or inefficient at her occupation or both. we asked for refills on coffee; after waiting for 10 mins for her to notice we needed more. she said that she had some brewing. okay, no problem. two seconds later my wife notices other servers pouring coffee for their customers. after another 5 mins we wave her down again and ask for more coffee. she says \"sure!\" as if the previous request never happened. several minutes later the coffee finally came. water glasses were never refilled without having to track someone down and ask. same with the coffee. this went on for 40-45 mins while waiting for food. the food finally started to come out. first was my wife's pancake. a couple of minutes later the <mark>French Toast</mark> came out for one of us and then a few minutes later the blt that was ordered; sans the fries. then a few minutes after that my chicken and waffles came out. now as i stated i am cool with the 40 minute wait for fresh food; but in that time frame you should be able to get an entire table of four all served at the same time. so, we all start to dig in. my wife's pancake is huge and looks great. they gave her a thimble full of syrup for a pancake that is the size of texas. no problem; just ask for more. we had to ask again after it never came. my dining companions were enjoying the <mark>French Toast</mark> and the blt. still no fries. i was taking on the chicken and waffles. they did not come with any syrup. they did come with a \"maple reduction sauce\" unfortunately it was reduced to nothing. the waffles were good and had bacon in the middle but they were dry without the necessary syrup to get them down. asked for syrup again. waited. it finally came. my friend was done with the blt. no fries...asked for them and they finally came out. asked for more coffee and water. waited. finally got it. so as you can imagine our table discussion this entire time has been how disappointed we all have been with our experience. my friend mark finally asked for the manager and voiced his concerns with our experience. the manager apologized and left. a few minutes later mark caught him again and asked for his business card and said \"i'm a letter writer\". the manager gave him the card and then came back to the table and took his blt and the drinks off of the bill. smart move. took a little prodding but it was a smart move. we could not wait to pay and get out. i would not make the effort to go back. my new name for this place is \"hash house a no go\" and i will leave it at that. good day now!", 
            "i'm surprised to see all the bad reviews of this place. \nnot my experience at all! \nwe stopped here for breakfast at this newer location inside imperial palace. \nthe place is awesome. the food was awesome! \nhuge portions and way too many choices to make an easy decision on what to order. \ni had the huge breakfast quesadilla stuffed with potatoes, eggs, <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark>, topped with chili cream sauce and served on a bed of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>!!!!!!! yum! \nalso tried a bite of the griddled <mark>French Toast</mark> dipped in banana cinnamon cream! yum. \nalso the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> w/ spinach, bacon and eggs looked great and our friends said it tasted great too! \n\nthe place was busy, but we only waited about 10 minutes. the restaurant is pretty large. i guess even with all the bad reviews on yelp, the place has tons of business! \ngo check it out for yourself. it's a fun place with good food. \n\nthe throw pillows on the booths were pretty cool too.", 
            "went to hash house on the recommendation of a friend and it didn't disappoint. \n\nthe wait for four was about 30 minutes on a mother's day sunday. but after getting and seeing the food others are eating, you start to salivate, anticipating what you're going to order.\n\nbe afraid of the portions, because they are large. you may notice that their plates are more like serving platters and their portions fill each plate (platter).\n\ni had one of their scrambles and it was the smallest plate. their bbblt sandwich may contain a 1/2 lb. of bacon and the bread is at least 1-1/4\" thick! if you order the <mark>French Toast</mark>, you'll get two large pieces of tasty delight and the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> is very very moist but keeping the skin crunchy.\n\nprices range in the $15 - $20 range, but are large (large) enough to share... unless you are the unlv football team. \n\nwe went to the location in the imperial palace. it was a great location and the wait wasn't too bad, but i hear the locations not on the strip are a bit less crowded.", 
            "hash house a go go...one of the best values on the strip! \n\nspeaking of which, to my surprise there was a hhagg location inthe imperial palace!!! i was pumped when i found out, cause i was staying next store at the flamingo! \n\nso, speaking of the imperial palace, i would never step foot in this place if it wasn't for the hhagg. i didn't know what to expect when i heard the restaurant was in this hotel. \n\nbut........ \n\nboy was i surprised! hhagg was a gem in the hotel. what a awesome job with the restaurant! very pleased. \n\nimportant!!! please read! \nbreakfast from like 830 am-11am was rocking! anywhere from 30min to an hour wait! we stopped back around 11:30/11:45 and we were seated right away and i was able to get breakfast food still (limited menu) \n\ni ended up getting <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> \ntwo eggs w/ bacon sausage or potatoes with 1 hh signature flapjack. make it a waffle or <mark>French Toast</mark> for a buck. $13.95 \name some value!! i will be back again!", 
            "this is a great place to eat on the strip.  you are definitely getting your money's worth with the portions of food.  in fact, if i was in vegas and low on cash and needed food, i would go here because you could easily get three or four meals out of your own entree.\n\nmy friend and i split the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> bennedict and we did really well, but still had a ton left over (i saw it on man. vs. food).  there's a $2 fee to split a dish, but our server told us right away about it and then said that if we ordered a side dish, we could wave the split charge.  so, we got the au gratin potatoes and were very happy with the decision.  it was like a tower of goodness-- but maybe too much for some people.  \n\nmy husband got the <mark>French Toast</mark> and i think he got a half a loaf of bread!  it was delicious!  but, the syrup was already on it, so i guess if you want more syrup, you would have to ask.\n\nevery entree we saw at the restaurant was huge.  their burgers could feed a family of four.  literally.   every entree could feed at least two people.  \n\nthe service is good, nothing amazing, but nothing horrible so don't worry about that.  the atmosphere is good as well.  we went to the one inside the imperial palace-- it's close to the entrance overall, so you won't have to wander around a maze for half and hour trying to find it.", 
            "had brunch here last weekend at the request of one of my friends. all she wanted to do while in vegas was come here and have the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & biscuit benedict. thank goodness this place was on her to do. our brunch was delicious. if you love comfort food as much as i do, then this place should be put on your vegas restaurant list. yes, it's in the imperial palace and i understand your hesitation but just close your eyes and run through the casino and you will arrive shortly and safely at hash house.  the portions were huge and we probably shouldn't have ordered a plate each but everything sounded like it was a must eat. \nthe prices are low considering the amount of food they give you. their coffee was probably some of the best american coffee i have ever had. the griddled <mark>French Toast</mark> with grilled bananas and cinnamon cream was absolutely perfect.. the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> i could've done without. and finally i am still dreaming of the  farm benedict. their <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> w/ spinach, bacon, tomato, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs was the ultimate morning comfort food. \ni so wish we had this restaurant in miami. until i go back to vegas i'll try to recreate it in miami so i can kill my craving.", 
            "went to hh for breakfast on a weekday about 8:30. we had to wait about ten minutes or so and they seemed pretty disorganized getting people seated even though there were plenty of empty tables. but once we got seated is was all good. my wife had the <mark>French Toast</mark> with bananas and a maple reduction that was really tasty. i had the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> which was killer. the chipotle cream sauce was what really made it for me. i really liked the fresh spinach and tomato on it too. about the only real thing that i can say remotely negative about the place is that the servings are huge. just too much food for most people. almost seems like a waste. i'd go back in a second for any meal to try some of their other dishes.", 
            "what size portion can a real human actually eat without exploding? i was about to find out. \nthe food here (breakfast food anyway) was absolutely divine! i had the <mark>French Toast</mark> with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and will all my will, was able to finish it. my gal had a mango coconut pancake and it was bigger than her head. i had to help her finish it (what can i say, it was a severely gluttinous weekend). \nour service was prompt despite there was a 40 minute wait (we were seated in 10, so don't let that stop you). the coffee was deliciously strong. our waitress was perfect...not overbearing, not absent....just the right amount of both. \n\nour travel mate got something with eggs and chicken and hollandaise. it looked terrible to me, but she said it was fantastic. couldn't finish it. \n\nand the bloody marys are just as large and just as delicious. this place rocks! very cheap for the amount of food you get.", 
            "hash house is reliable. you can be sure that this place will conquer your hungover ass with the largest plates of food you can imagine. texas doesn't have anything on the size of the dishes here. \n\nthe food is immaculate, speaking in terms of <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, it will blow your mind. get that and maybe the pecan <mark>French Toast</mark> and you and your partner are set.\n\ncome here hungry, go for a long walk, take a nap, then start drinking again. perfect.", 
            "a good place to go to soak up your morning hangover.  the portions are huge and everything is oversized.  our friends wanted to come here while in vegas because they had seen it on man vs. food (or one of those shows) and we didn't even have to second guess why it was on the show after walking to our table.  our friends settled on <mark>French Toast</mark> and granola pancakes which were literally the size of tractor tires as they were described on the menu!  dh and i each got the farm scrambles, i the bacon, avocado, swiss, and onion one which was delicious and him the <mark>Ham, Spinach & Cheddar</mark>, and spinach which he didn't enjoy as much as mine.  everyone was satisfied with their meals because there was complete silence as we attacked them!  the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles looked delicious and i'll have to get it next time.  juice and coffee were good, service was good, all worth a return trip.",

            "my second time coming to hash house i tried the location at imperial palace. i tried the <mark>French Toast</mark>...oh my goodness the best i have ever had! they are topped with banana cinnamon cream w/ pecan maple syrup! \n\nmy first visit to hh i tried the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles and it was ok, but the <mark>French Toast</mark> is much better!! \n\nthe portions are very large so it is a good idea to share :)", 
            "hash house's food was fresh, tasty, and everything had a good twist on traditional \"home cooked\" food. not to mention, the service was spectacular on both visits. \n\nour group of 10 dined at hash house twice for breakfast while in vegas over christmas. staying at the flamingo put us just a quick brisk walk to the imperial palace and up the escalator dedicated to hash house. getting to the restaurant before 9am both times, the staff was easily able to accommodate our large group. the restaurant was largely empty that early, but did begin to fill up around 10am. our servers, on both occasions, were courteous, efficient, enthusiastic, and even charming. for me, that can really put a dining experience over the top. \n\nwhile the food was very good, being the griddle cafe fanatic that i am, i cannot give hash house 5 stars. their pancakes (snickers) and <mark>French Toast</mark> did not compare to the deliciousness that is the griddle. \n\nbut, the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles is note worthy. perfectly <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breast that were very moist with a crisp, not overly salty, crust hinted with sage was probably the best <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> i recall having (although i rarely eat <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>). the waffles were inventive with the strips of bacon entwined in the batter in stead of bacon bits mixed in the waffle. this was perfect as the bacon didn't overpower, but accented the waffle and still gave you the satiety of have two strips of bacon with your meal. the maple reduction tasted more like balsamic, but really highlighted the dish and i recommend using the sauce on your food and not avoiding it. \nit was just yum! my boyfriend and i split the dish and it was perfect for two people. the next visit we split the <mark>French Toast</mark> which was just as huge with a griddle banana that was still in the skin split atop the super thick sliced bread. the banana was disturbing at first being black from the griddle, but was actually delicious and perfectly cooked. it went well with the <mark>French Toast</mark>. \n\nmany people at our table went with the tractor special, which was well received and the most traditional style breakfast item they offer. no one tried their hash, sadly. \n\nany meal on the menu, if you can split it with someone, do it! our server was nice enough not to charge to $2.50 split plate charge. \n\ni do think that hash house is a \"must-go\" while in vegas. but, sorry, hh, you're not the best. xoxo", 
            "so...the wait sucked at this place, but nothing else did...this was awesome!  anyone who has read other reviews i've posted knows i like one meal above all others, breakfast.  though my trips to indiana have led me to believe that there is little redeeming of that state that borders mine to the southeast, but the hash house a go-go may be it's greatest export.  \n\nwe had large group, so i'm sure that didn't help the wait, but the 2.5 hour breakfast we had was absolutely belly bustingly amazing!  our waitress was pretty aware of our wait and did a nice job to make sure our group of 6 was well cared for and not waiting long for things like coffee and other refills.  she was also helpful in ordering.  if it's your first time there, i recommend ordering (or talking someone else at your table into ordering) the chicken farm benedict.  this colossal tower of food was a sight to behold.  i went for <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark>.  \n\nthe tdc was two eggs (over medium), bacon, wheat toast and my choice of pancakes, <mark>French Toast</mark> or waffles.  this would normally be an easy choice (pancakes), but this place isn't your ordinary breakfast joint.  far from the ordinary, the pancakes, <mark>French Toast</mark> and waffles here are the size of a large platter.  and, with flapjacks like blueberry pecan, brown sugar banana, blackberry granola, snickers, butterscotch almond, apple cinnamon, mango coconut, strawberry frosted and granola waffles or banana cinnamon <mark>French Toast</mark>...forget-a-bout-it...this is the real deal.  \n\nmy choice was made slightly easier when i saw brown sugar banana pancakes.  i think that banana pancakes rank up there with precious jewels, gold bullion and other fine items that ought be cherished.  this was a banana pancake on steroids!  it was incredible.  it was soft on the inside, crispy and caramelized on the outside and delicious everywhere.  if i could have finished the one that i ordered, i would've contemplated ordering a second.  it was worth the gut busting pain that was likely to follow.  \n\nseriously, if you're in vegas, and you have the time to wait for a seat, get to this place for breakfast.  book some time before, and after, as you'll need to wait to get in and head back to your hotel for a food coma afterward.  this was a great meal and the perfect start to a 24 hour day in las vegas.", 
            "i arrived around 9am and waited about 5 minutes to be seated (i didn't want to sit at the counter). the staff was kind but not overly available. my intention was to order the chicken & waffles but changed my mind at the last minute. instead i ordered the banana <mark>French Toast</mark>.  it was very tasty but i could only eat 1/3 of it. partially because i was full but i also got tired of the flavor. my eggs were overcooked. i really liked the tangerine juice, but again the small size would have been sufficient due to flavor overload. if i could have eaten it all it would have been a good value. i will go again but will pay the $2.50 to share a dish with a friend.", 
            "whats up with these portions?? i felt like a lil fat hungry kid at the table. my pancake was about a foot in diameter making the large sides of eggs and crispy potatoes looking miniature in comparison!! glancing at the size of the meal i knew i wasn't going to be able to finish it all and thought \"something this big can't taste good??\"...right?? wrong, the food was great. i do recommend the <mark>French Toast</mark> over the pancake but it was good, good enough to remove the hangover i had. our server was chipper and she had lots of jokes which made the experience even better, i think her name was denise?", 
            "i've been to the san diego branch and couldn't stop raving about it.  so the girls and i were very excited when we found out there was one on the strip = perfect way to recover from all the partying over the weekend.\nhow wrong we were.\n\nincredibly long waits, even after we'd already been seated.  waitress just seemed very harried with the crowd, so we were happy to chill, but really, 30min before we could even place our order was a bit much.\n\nfinally received our food and it was mediocre.  we ordered the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash, chicken and waffles, and <mark>French Toast</mark> with the bananas.  of the 3, the <mark>French Toast</mark> was the only one that was decent, though the sd version was better.  \n\nportions are definitely huge, so probably a good place to go when you're still buzzed (ie impaired taste buds) and have a serious appetite.", 
            "we all loved this place! we had no wait for a table and our food came out pretty fast. they do not have their own restroom and in my hunt to find an open one in the casino i returned to discover that our food had already arrived! \n\nmy husband had the <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> benedict and boy was it massive. he only finished a 3rd of it. my mom and i split the tractor special with cinnamon banana nut <mark>French Toast</mark>. it you are sharing an item there is a $2.25 charge unless you order a side dish so i ordered my own side of scrambled eggs. what this meant was we each had our own eggs and one big piece of <mark>French Toast</mark>, half a grilled banana and she ate both pieces of bacon. we also shared a fresh squeezed tangerine juice which was unusual and very good. my mom said it was the best <mark>French Toast</mark> she had ever had for what that is worth! \n\nour server was travis and he was nice and helpful with suggestions since this was our first time here. i think he may have psychic powers since he suggested exactly what we were looking at in addition to the popular chicken and waffles. \n\nthey sell the same shirts that the servers wear for about $16 and they have a variety of hats that i think are $21-ish. if you are interested in buying any merchandise tell your server as they can add it to your total bill. otherwise, you will be like us and making a separate payment at the bar after your meal is over. the sign said they have a lot more items than what they seemed to have in stock. \n\nbottom line: interesting food and atmosphere. something different than your run of the mill chain restaurants. i really liked it.", 
            "i came across hash house a go go from their spotlight on the 702 tv show.  the television show spotlights local hot-spots, clubs, restaurants, etc.  the first time i saw them on television, the portions were huge (think cheesecake factory) and the food looked absolutely delicious.  unfortunately, i didn't get a chance to visit the eatery until my next visit to vegas.\n\nmy friend and fellow foodie were dead set on having hash house for sunday breakfast before he had to hit the road.  as we made our way to imperial palace, i was already drunk an it was only 10 or 11 in the morning.  after parking in the garage, we made our way into the casino and after asking some staff for directions, we made our way towards hash house.\n\ni was pleasantly surprise that there was no waiting time for our party of two.  after a few more shots, i glanced over the extensive menu and settled for my guilty pleasure of <mark>French Toast</mark>.  my fried ordered some variation of eggs benedict.  the food took about 15-20 minutes to get to our table and we were both with smiles.\n\nthe <mark>French Toast</mark> arrive an were beautifully presented and resemble a presentation from the food network.  the <mark>French Toast</mark> were dense, yet fluffy and were nicely griddled to a golden brown and dipped in banana cinnamon cream with pecan maple syrup.  the <mark>French Toast</mark> were mouth watering and undoubtedly the best tasting <mark>French Toast</mark> i've ever had.  in addition to the fluffy toast, caramelized banana slices accompanied the delicious toast.\n\nhash house a go go is a food experience that will forever be embedded in my mind and taste buds.  my friend's breakfast was equally up to par and gave him an equally satisfying food coma.  if i had to compare hash house a go go to something it would be the cheesecake factory, but more intimate and with a mom and pop diner feel.  oh hash house a go go, how i miss you.", 
            "a breakfast lovers dream!!\n\ni had heard of this place before but since the closest location was in san diego i soon forgot about it until someone told me i had to go while i was in vegas. i'm so glad i took that advice!\n\nthe portions are huge. i have a pretty big appetite and was able to split my meal with a friend and was still full as all get out! we shared the <mark>French Toast</mark> <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> which came with eggs and bacon and it was probably one of the best <mark>French Toast</mark> i've ever had! (even better than kimmie's coffee cup and i love their <mark>French Toast</mark>). anywho they dip it in some kind of banana cinnamon cream which is to die for.\n\nmy cousin and her friend split the vanilla waffle combo with potatoes and that was just as yummy. even after my stomach was aching from all of my food i still could not pass up a chance to try that wonderful waffle!\n\nif you're in vegas and looking for some delicious breakfast you have got to go here.. we even made a to go order for breakfast on the way home. it made the drive a little easier :)",

(i swear this restaurant is for people with big appetite and with 3 stomachs). sister said she didn't like the meatloaf entree (too bad). other sister ordered their giant pancake with sausages and scrambled eggs with a side of crispy potatoes. i mean giant pancake. i think it was 1 ft in diameter. it was huge, at least 1/4 inch thick. she of course didn't finish it. i ordered <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and biscuit (i can't remember the name but as seen on man v food). soo good.\n\nhuge biscuits with two huge <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, on a bed of perfect mashed potates and strips of bacon and some special sauce. don't forget to try their homemade jam. super delicious. scoop some unto the biscuit or on some potatoes or on some <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. try the homemade jam. \n\nthe table next to us were a party of 4 huge dudes. macho douchebags with their artificial tan and muscles bulging from their tight ed hardy shirts. they could probably eat everything on the menu. anyways, they all ordered burgers. they didn't finish it, and wrapped their half burgers to-go. another table of big dudes order the chicken and waffles and had half their food boxed togo. \n\nso, a lot of food. not expensive. the hostess told us (a party of 4) would have to wait about 40 minutes, which was totally fine. only a 30 minute wait, which flew by b/c we were reading the menu. \n\n i gotta try the chicken and waffles next time! or maybe the <mark>French Toast</mark> or a burger. eeeek",

            "i came here  on new year's eve with eight of my friends and ordered the <mark>French Toast</mark> made with bananas, it was so delicious! i am a complete <mark>French Toast</mark> snob as it is one of the few dishes my family makes very well and this surpassed any <mark>French Toast</mark> i have ever had before. the bananas in the batter were subtle and made the f.t . moist and the pecan syrup was so amazing. perfect combination of food for my taste buds. i only wish i had the recipe because it was simply amazing!", 
            "the hash house in san diego is way better.  i had <mark>French Toast</mark> and it was not impressed.  the bread was dry and didn't have much flavor.  i had to ask for syrup two times and wait about 5 minutes before i could get any.  my husband had one of the scrambles and liked it.  the bloody mary was good but the mimosa was below average.", 
            "ok, so i've heard so many things about hash house a go go, my expectations were high, but you kinda disappointed me... the wait was crazy, yes, i get that, it's vegas, st. pattys day/march madness weekend, but we got there at 11:30 and didn't get to eat until about 1:45. really? the reason we stuck around was because we heard good things about the food. so we get seated and place our orders and i got the salmon benedict (mind you, it's not the traditional hollandaise sauce, it was a red chili cream which was yum); but i was all stoked because it was supposed to come with basted eggs. imagine my disappointment when it came with scrambled eggs (yes, i know wahhhh). i was going to send it back, but after waiting that long, i didn't dare chance it. it was still yum...our waitress was super sweet, i'm knocking off 2 stars for the wait and the hosts, because they actually forgot about us and finally sat us when someone in my party went up and said, hey, what the <mark>French Toast</mark>? :) perhaps i need to go to san diego and see how it's really done.", 
            "i was soooo excited to eat here.  i had it on my list and was making sure i was not going to leave vegas without trying it. it was easy to find.  just head straight through the imperial palace until you hit the escalators.  we were are very hungry after a night of drinking and dancing and hoped to not have to wait too long to get seated.  it was pretty busy and also a friday morning.  we were pleasantly surprised to get seated promptly in a nice comfy booth.  i ordered coffee and it came quick enough and was quite delicious.\n\none thing that stuck out in my mind as odd was the waiter told us right off the bat that the kitchen does not have any heat lamps, so the food is served out as soon as it's made. i thought ok, great, that means we will have our food quickly.  eh, not so much.   our food took a bit to come out.  it wasn't excessive but we definitely waited longer on our food than we did to get a seat.\n\ndue to knowing the portion sizes are enormous we decided to split plates.  my dining partner and i chose the <mark>HH Original</mark> benedict.  it comes with bacon, fresh tomato, fresh spinach, and is topped with a roasted red pepper cream as well as two eggs.  additionally it sat on top of a split biscuit with griddled <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. the potatoes reminded me of the potato pancakes my mom would make when i was a kid with leftover <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>-nice and golden browned and quite tasty. that was probably the best thing about the benedict.  the bacon was good too, but hey it's bacon.\n\n now for the not so good, the eggs were underdone and the parts of the white were still clear.  that kind of thing doesn't bother me, but i would prefer my eggs to be cooked correctly.  the thing that was the biggest bummer was that the food was luke warm.  so i guess the no heat lamp thing doesn't necessarily work to their advantage because my food had to have sat back there for a bit before arriving to the table because it was not hot.  also, the fresh tomato and spinach did not bring anything to the table.  had the spinach been slightly sauteed or wilted and seasoned, it could have been a different story.  i think having those put on top of the benny just made it even colder in temp.  also, the whole thing was under-seasoned.  \n\nthe red pepper cream tasted like roasted red pepper bisque that was under-seasoned and cold.  i really do like the concept of having a benedict topped with lighter ingredients and sauce, but it was all cold and under-seasoned and disappointing.  i kept going back to the bacon, egg and crispy <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  i will say that i was able to split this with another person and between the two of us couldn't even finish it.  our bill came to $12 each, and i was very happy, and even though it was underwhelming, it was still worth it for the price.\n\nmy other friends ordered the bananas foster <mark>French Toast</mark>-also huge, as well as the <mark>Fresh Mushroom</mark>, artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomato and fresh spinach hash.  my friend did not like her hash at all.  i tried it and agreed with her that it was completely under-seasoned.  i hate having to add salt at a restaurant.  i think it should come out seasoned correctly.  also the salt shaker had course salt in in that barely came out the holes in the shaker-a huge pet peeve of mine.  the bananas foster was huge but nothing out of this world.  what i did really like though was the split banana topped with sugar and bruleed.  it was so delicious and the banana developed a very creamy texture.  it was served still in the peel, which i thought was pretty cool.\n\noverall, the value is great, and the quality is also good.  i can only base this review on the one visit i made here, and there were definite flaws in the execution of the food.   although the plates are huge, impressive looking, the taste is what matters most, and it unfortunately was lacking.  however, on a whole, due to the value of the food and he fact that one plate can be split between two people, i would like to go back and prove that hash house can really live up to its hype.", 
            "this place is the one good thing that the imperial palace still has going for it.\n\nmy husband ordered his usual of two eggs, home fries, and he added <mark>French Toast</mark> to his order as well. i got the vanilla waffles and a side of bacon. the only negative i have is that they used thin-cut bacon and could totally afford to use thick considering the prices they charge. the waffle was gigantic, i only managed 1 1/2 squares before i had to give up. i felt a little bad because the waitress even noticed that the one tiny cup of syrup was not enough and brought out a bunch more, which i poured all over my waffles and then ended up not finishing. oh well! i want to go back and try the sage friend chicken and waffles, but i need to have people with me who eat meat and can share as the portion size is huge. \n\nif you don't like loud music and conversation, don't go here. that's just how it is, and complaining about it isn't going to change a thing. if you go to a restaurant and expect the ambiance, temperature, and other patrons to revolve around you, then i suggest you just open your own damn restaurant. there might be a wait, especially on weekends, but they give you a pager that has quite a range so you can go into the casino and play slots or do whatever while you wait for your table. it only took about 15-20 minutes for us to get seated. definitely worth the wait.", 
            "we were on vacation with friends and this was our last morning to eat something other than a buffet.  we were told about this place by a friend in california and boy were we glad.  it was a wonderful breakfast dining experience.  the food was very good, huge portions and the waitress was excellent (i forgot her name though).  she was fun and knowledgeable and there for our every need.  all four of us were happy were our selections.  i ordered the hash spinach mushroom scramble, which was a little dry, but when i ordered a side of the chipotle sauce from the andy's man vs food dish it was perfect.  i asked for just a little bit of the sauce because it was a little dry, but they still charged extra for the sauce.  we also ordered the \"andy's man vs food\" breakfast which was delish, although crazy carb loaded with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, angel hair pasta, <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, bacon and more.  our friends got the mango coconut pancake and also the <mark>French Toast</mark> and they absolutely loved both dishes.  the coffee was hot and very good and constantly refilled as it should be at breakfast time.  i think everything was definitely a bit overpriced for breakfast with drink, tax and tip probably around $16-20 per person.  i will definitely eat here again the next time i come to las vegas, but next time i will share a dish with someone.", 
            "i'm pretty enthused with this place: chicken and waffles, biscuits and gravy, passable coffeee.  very delicious food in las vegas inside the imperial hotel.  this place is the closest to our room, and there was no wait at 9:30 a.m. on memorial day morning.  pretty wonderful food; my wife loved the <mark>French Toast</mark>.  \n\ni tried a mocha smore drink the day before which looked pretty but tasted pretty toxic, so i can't go with five stars.  \n\nwonderful service, friendly staff, great people-watching!", 
            "at first look, the pictures of the food that are hanging near the entrance of the restaurant look horrible but the food turned out pretty good. i had the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with waffles. this dish did not meet my expectations. the chicken was bland and there wasn't anything especially good about the tower of <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>. however, <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> with the brown sugar banana flapjack was delicious. the griddled <mark>French Toast</mark> was also great. also the watermelon kiwi drink is a must have.", 
            "went last week on our trip to vegas after seeing them on man v food.  loved it!\n\ngot there and told it'd be about 30 minutes to get a table and we wanted to go back downstairs to gamble, so we asked for a pager.  she said to not go too far or it wouldn't work.  after 30 minutes we came back up to check and they'd called us 5 minutes earlier (pager didn't work cuz i guess we went too far). but they quickly seated us anyway, so that was great.\n\nservice was good.  only thing that would have been better is if they'd checked on us a bit more and refilled drinks more often.  but that's often the case with the average restaurant that's so busy you're waiting to get a table.  our waitress was friendly and helpful.\n\ni ordered the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> and my husband had the banana pecan <mark>French Toast</mark>.  we're pretty big eaters and he did manage to clean his plate, but i could only do about half of mine, even though it was delicious.  if you're with someone you can share a meal with and can come to an agreement on what to order (so much to choose from) then i suggest sharing.  because it tastes so amazing you want to keep eating and you'll totally overeat.\n\nthis was probably the best breakfast meal out that i've had in years!  i have even decided that anytime i go to la, i will drive to san diego just so i can eat here.  \n\ni also used a restaurant.com coupon with no problems!", 
            "it was a sunday morning at 11:30 am and my friends and i had miraculously left our room by check-out time and dragged ourselves down to the 2nd floor of the imperial palace where the hash house lives.  there was a gigantic crowd waiting outside, but we ended up being called to our table within 10 minutes.\n\nwe tried to glance at some other tables on our way in to get an idea of the food...and holy crap the portions are huge.  i recommend splitting if you can...you'll definitely still be full even with half of a meal.  \n\nour table of 3 ordered:  <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> with the griddled <mark>French Toast</mark>, the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash, and the original eggs benedict.  i sampled all of them and everything was amazing.  i supplemented my <mark>French Toast</mark> breakfast with a much needed bloody maria.  this was my first time having the bloody maria, which uses tequila instead of vodka, and it was outstanding.  settled my stomach and removed my hangover successfully!!\n\ni was not even close to finishing my <mark>French Toast</mark>.  there were two inch and a half thick slices that were about 5 inches square.  it was flavorful and served with a grilled banana.  \n\nour service was quick, friendly and attentive - no glasses were left empty and the coffee refills were plentiful.  \n\nonly downside, aside from being in the imperial palace, is that the restaurant has no bathrooms of its own...and so you have to go wander through the casino and use the ones there.", 
            "after our $60 breakfast here i can safely say this place isn't worth the hype!\n\nwhen we arrived at 9:30am there was no wait. when we left, maybe an hour later, there were so many people waiting it had to have been over an hour wait. let me tell you, i would have been pissed if i had waited more than 15 minutes for this breakfast!\n\ndrinks - i ordered a watermelon lemonade and bf ordered a pistachio iced mocha. the drinks were awesome! mine was slightly sour but had enough watermelon flavor that it wasn't too much. his pistachio mocha was sooo good! i was mad that i didn't order it. \n\nfor breakfast both my bf and my bff ordered <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> which is two eggs, bacon or sausage, and a pancake, or you can substitute a waffle or <mark>French Toast</mark> for one extra dollar. bff got the pancake (that thing was bigger than the plate it was served on!!) and bf got the vanilla waffle. \n\ntheir eggs (scrambled) were nice and fluffy, the bacon was alright. his waffle was good, but didn't taste like vanilla, and her pancake she liked, but couldn't even eat half of it.\n\nmy order - okay you know when you read the description for something and then it arrives and you realize you read the description all wrong? this is what happened to me. \n\ni ordered the <mark>HH Original</mark> benedict. eggs benedict - i expect hollandaise and some poached eggs. whatever else happens is fine, but those are the things i need. i read that i would get a biscuit instead of an english muffin and there was mention of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, although i didn't know how that would fit in. i read about the red pepper cream, but i thought that would be along with my hollandaise. i read basted eggs, and i honestly didn't know what that meant. \n\nso i received this massive red mess with sprigs of rosemary and what look like pine needles shooting out the side of my food. i get trying to make a plate look nice, but this was a bit much.\n\nthe taste? eh. the top layers are alright. the basted egg is overcooked, no runny yolk at all, but the sauce was okay and the tomato was fine. the bottom layers though, a dry ass biscuit on top of dry <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. not a good combo. they really have no business calling this any sort of benedict since they strayed away from every traditional benedict characteristic possible, aside from stacking everything on top of each other.\n\nthere are many better places to drop $60 on breakfast at in vegas - this is not one i would revisit. also, apparently there was an episode of man vs food filmed here? that must be their claim to fame because our waiter mentioned it at least 5 times. wow, i am so impressed.", 
            "banana brown sugar pancake, huge and omg so good!!! <mark>French Toast</mark>, huge and omg so good!! 1lb applewood <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark> & mashed potato stuffed burger-huge and so so good!! no trip to vegas is ever complete without getting our fix here. the best, love it!", 
            "best go to spot for brunch. it's hard to find, inside imperial palace, but once you find it, it def is worth the trip. i had the trucker special with the <mark>French Toast</mark> griddle. best <mark>French Toast</mark> i've ever had!! \ni recommend to share an entree, the servings are huge. if you decide to have your own plate, be prepared to have leftovers. but who doesn't love leftovers?! i know i do!", 
            "as seen on man vs. food... this pace is hype, so there is always a wait!\n\ni was excited to give this pace a go but a little disappointed when we got our food... i ordered a pancake, yes it was bigger than my head, but the one pancake was pretty much my entire meal. they didn't have any breakfasts that featured their hugh cakes or <mark>French Toast</mark> with eggs and hash browns or anything like that, which was what i was really looking forward to (a breakfast plate). you do get to select one side but when my plate came out i literally looked down to find one pancake and 6 tiny potato cubes, which i consumed in 1.5 bites. the potatoes were really good too! i'd rather have a couple regular sized pancakes and a generous portion of potatoes than a ridiculously oversized pancake with one bite of potato... i like more variety in my breakfast. i'm glad we came here because now i can say i've tried it but i can honestly say i'll never be back! there are too many better places to eat in vegas!", 
            "wow! huge portions! i felt bad not being able to eat it all, it was sooo good!  i had the <mark>French Toast</mark> and i was in heaven. my friend had a burger which was out of this world. their alcoholic drinks are yummy too!", 
            "what an amazing restaurant!  we went there for breakfast on a monday morning (15 minute wait) as we heard the wait on the weekend was crazy long.  i had the <mark>French Toast</mark> which is drizzled with maple syrup and bananas foster with glazed walnuts... the meal was enough to feed myself and the bf with no problem at all.  even better, we had a restaurant.com coupon.  :-)  the waitress was all business, but really competent.  she gave us the heads up only to order one meal and to share.  everything that came out of the kitchen was hot and fresh.  i love this place.   it will be visited over and over again on our trips to vegas.", 
            "saw them on food network and was determined to go while on vacation in las vegas.  was fantastic!! our vacationing group enjoyed it so much we went 2 times in the 4 days that we were in vegas.  i personally had the banana cream dipped <mark>French Toast</mark>; and i really, really enjoyed it.  btw, every cab driver knows that when you say imperial palace that you're going to hash house a go go!!! :)", 
            "we always eat at hash house a go go when we visit san diego. so of course i was happy with my experience at this one. gigantic portions. i like their lunch items (especially the blt) and my husband likes the <mark>French Toast</mark>.", 
            "i finally got a chance to eat at the place that supposedly serves \"twisted farm food.\" it had been on my radar ever since i first saw it on man v. food. staying at imperial made it all the more tempting to just go there for each meal. in a rare showing of mercy to my wallet, i didn't do that.\n\nbefore going inside the dining area, you'll see a number of autographed portraits and menus. adam richman's is one of them. \n\ni decided to do takeout for dinner. while it was very tempting to just get the popular <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles, i was in a 1-pound stuffed burger mood. oh, that'd be one pound of meat. the entire burger was probably closer to 2 lbs., although not quite there.\n\nthe mushroom and swiss stuffed burger ($12.95) was amazing. extremely juicy and gargantuan. everything cooked perfectly. it was heaven just to see the melted swiss and sauteed mushrooms. it's served with the cold fresh veggies on one bun half and the stuffed patty on the other half. two big dill pickle slices in the burger. while the lettuce looked a bit wilted, that's probably only because everything stayed in the same closed takeout box for a few minutes.\n\ni'm guessing they used a brioche bun. very soft and inviting. i personally think it could have been better with a slight toasting on the flattop. this just felt like the juicy lucy i had in minnesota a couple years back, just in steroidal form. i think the burger could be too greasy and too imposing for some people. fork and knife might be required. i for one needed a larger mouth.\n\nburgers come with one side item of your choice. i got the basil pesto tossed crispy potatoes and enjoyed every bite. great job on the crispy potatoes. it also had some broken-down diced tomatoes in there. the olive oil from the pesto collected a bit at the bottom of the plastic takeout container.\n\ndessert is served all day here, and one of the servers mentioned that some items (like the <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark>) are for in-house dining only. might expect up to a 15-minute wait on that <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark>.\n\nbreakfast includes <mark>French Toast</mark>, flapjacks, and the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, all featured on the man v. food episode. i hope to get back there for some of those dishes.\n\ni saw the plating of the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles i spoke of earlier, and it's literally a tower of food. three or four waffles for the base, some <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> on top of that, and a large knife to hold it all in place.\n\neven with all the inflated prices on the vegas strip, i think it's well worth the price to come here. check this elite spot out the next time you're in the area.", 
            "awesome <mark>French Toast</mark>, i love you hash house!", 
            "i've tried the one at the m hotel a few years back and was very impressed. this location was super busy because its in the heart of the strip. if you have a large group, be prepared to wait for 30-45 minutes just to be seated. i suggest to snack on something along the way or while waiting for your name to be called. better yet, grab a big cocktail from the casino bar and wait...hey, you're in vegas baby :)  we were here on saturday 11:30am and it was already packed and we were starving. i suggested to eat here because the portions are huge and food is quite delicious. luckily the bar had a quicker turnaround...perfect for just a couple of fellows. i got the same thing - <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, served w/ fresh spinach, <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs. (see my pic) my friend ordered the griddled <mark>French Toast</mark> dipped in banana cinnamon cream w/ pecan maple syrup. as much as we tried to finish the meal, we had to surrender. my goodness, food coma...here we come. thank god we just planned to hang by the pool and lush out...lol. overall, hash house is a good bang for your buck. our counter server was quick and came by 3x to make sure we got everything we needed.  the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> is clearly enough for 2 but like what i said earlier...you're in vegas!  splurge a little :)  they have different locations so check their website but this one in particular is not as nicely decorated as the one in m resort. this location is extremely busy and felt tight but its open 24 hours. the m hotel location has more tables and outdoor seating with nice views.", 
            "they told us our wait would be 30 minutes, but it was more like 10! yay!\n\nour waiter was great. i ordered a scramble that had sausage, jalapenos, potatoes, and what i can only describe as chili-like. it was good. needed more sausage, less potatoes. i also ordered a brown sugar banana flapjack. big ol' 14\" thing. too ambitious on my part. we only ate maybe a 1/3 of it. it was good though. bf ordered <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> with <mark>French Toast</mark>. it came with bananas that were cut length-wise and still had the peel on them. interesting presentation. \n\ni noticed all the plates around us were served with fruit. refreshing. though their portions are huge! so that takes away that healthy factor. oh well!", 
            "delicious!!!\ni had the griddles <mark>French Toast</mark>. i don't even like bananas but the way they cooked them and served them was fantastic! the chicken sausage was pretty good as well.\n\nthe service was great as well. we got there at 10am and didn't wait too long.\n\nwe're going back tomorrow since we leave saturday!", 
            "came here for breakfast after drinking too much the day and night before. i needed something to refuel my body and give me energy. it was kind of hard to find this place because it's pretty hidden all the way in the back of the quad hotel.\n\nso for breakfast i got the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> w/ fresh spinach, <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs on a biscuit   with mash potatoes. even though you look and read it in your mind or out loud and sounds soooo delicious, it was just pleasant. it didn't wow me or had me like omg but it definitely filled me up. \n\npresentation  was awesome! it was a tower of awesomeness that i thought i could devour. the chicken wasn't bad because it was crispy on the outside and white meat in the inside. i wish the bacon was more crispy though instead of soggy because of the cream. the biscuit was huge and dense that i wan't really feeling it especially with the mash potatoes right under it. mad carbs! the chipotle cream was really good as it had a little spice to it but wasn't overpowering. it was too much carbs though. oh wait i said that.  it did cure my hangover but i don't think i would get this again although i am down to try other things on the menu. \n\nother people at my table had the <mark>French Toast</mark>, salmon, and the chorizo on an iron skillet which all looked so good. \n\nprices aren't bad either for everything. it got crowded around 11-2pm so go early if you want breakfast.",

(there were some names that were used in text exchanges, but thats neither here nor there.) \n\nwe were just there in june.   and nostalgically i recall that someone ordered their pancakes...stupid enormous, i had <mark>French Toast</mark> and a side of biscuits and gravy.  did i say side?  more like a huge portion for one.  hubby had <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash and says it was too good to not continue eating.  (i know he over did it because he could barely eat one in and out burger 4 hours later!)  \n\nwe went really early in the morning for breakfast and they were empty.  still, we liked going through the maze that is the quad to go up the escalator to the yumminess that \nawaited us.   given that there are so many awesome places to eat, we didn't eat there again, but its on our list of places to hit up without a doubt!  service was prompt, the place was clean and well maintained, and food was delish!!!  can't wait to go back again.  now.....i heard they have a location in chicago too....hrmm......",

            "hash house is a must every time i'm in las vegas. every pancake they make is better than any other pancake i've ever had. the <mark>French Toast</mark> is fantastic. the portion sizes are usually more than anyone can eat, but it doesn't hurt to try. i also recommend the meatloaf sandwich is you're their for dinner. the customer service is always good, and the food is delivered promptly.", 
            "has house a go go makes sin taste so good! \n\nbeing from indianapolis it was quite interesting to see this \"twisted farm food\", which was every bit of delicious. granted, we don't really eat like neanderthals in indy it was perfect. \n\nmy fiance and i both enjoyed the kiwi watermelon lemonades - beautifully made with an even better taste. \n\nhim: my hubby got the rosemary chicken skillet (something like that) which was an absolutely delectable serving of <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark>, fried potatoes, egg and turkey bacon. the chicken was perfectly seasoned with flavorful rosemary and paired with perfectly cooked potatoes, being served in a sizzling hot skilled. my hubby is a cop-out and got scrambled eggs (so you can't really mess that up). \n\nme: i had a \"tractor platter\" with <mark>French Toast</mark> which was perfectly seasoned with egg and cinnamon, and topped with powdered sugar (yum!). the best thing, the <mark>French Toast</mark> wasn't some tiny piece of bread but real texas toast - this was in turn served with delicious crispy shredded hash browns (cooked to perfection), which for some reason no other restaurant can seem to get hash brown crispy. kudos to hash house a go go on that. the final part of my dish was fantastic - a serving of fresh fruit, a banana sliced long, and a couple slices of orange. the banana was a great surprise because, they actually threw it on the grill, which was a taste of perfection. it enhanced the sweetness of the banana without completely caramelizing it. (it was so great that my hubby almost lost his finger because he couldn't stop munching on it)\n\noverall hash house a go go is a definite must while visiting vegas (i absolutely fell in love with this place) - and will certainly be back on my next trip to sin city.", 
            "we decided to grab brunch before we headed back to phoenix-- so glad that we did! i suggested this place to my husband and when he heard about some of the foods they offer up, he agreed to walk 2 miles up the strip from the luxor to grab a meal before we left for home. \nwe waited about 15-20 minutes a little before noon on a monday. not bad. our waiter nathaniel was really friendly, and let us know that the portions a big and it's okay to share. i love that they don't charge a split plate fee- i don't like restaurants that do. however, we decided to both get a meal so we could try more things. my husband went with the chicken and waffles, and i had the <mark>French Toast</mark> with eggs and bacon on the side. everything was so yummy!! we had left overs, so yes, you really can share and be plenty full. the prices were good, and brunch ran us $35 plus tip.", 
            "hubby had <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles..awesome presentation.  i had caramel, banana, pecan <mark>French Toast</mark> with mashed hash browns(omg), and scram eggs.  the oj was sooooo good!  service was great and it filled our bellies! we will be back!", 
            "stopped here for a 1am dinner/breakfast! the red pepper and mozzarella burger was delicious, and so was the cucumber ranch dressing on my house salad. the portions are huge! \nmy sister had the <mark>French Toast</mark> and it was also very yummy. definitely returning on my next trip to vegas!", 
            "seriously the best brunch spot in las vegas! this is such a popular spot that you almost always have to wait 30+ minutes for a table, but it's so worth it :) \n\nmy favorite item from here is the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles. the waffles have bacon in them! and the chicken is just phenomenal! as you may have read from other reviews, these come in a huge portion. it's literally 3 meals for me, no joke! i've also tried the blueberry flapjack. the flapjack is the size of a pizza!! it tastes like just your ordinary pan cake, so nothing special there. something else i've tried is their <mark>French Toast</mark>. they should rename this \"french bricks\" because that's the size of these toasts!! i also love ordering the watermelon lemonade! so yummy! \n\noverall, i love dining at hash house a go go :)", 
            "amazing!! wish i came here earlier in my trip. we had the <mark>French Toast</mark>, and hh benedict with the tangerine mimosas.\n\nfood was crazy. large portions and loved how it all tasted. waiter told us to try the pancakes (which bakes bananas and other stuff inside instead of on top!)\n\ndefinitely try the mimosas, so gooood!", 
            "went into hh lv with my heart set on the <mark>French Toast</mark> with banana cream, pecans, whipped cream. it was dinner and not on the menu. inquired with the server if i could get it anyway. she politely declined, with reason. i asked her to please inquire with the chef if he would make it for me and she came back to the table with a big yes! thank you  krystie, great server, great attitude. thank you chef!", 
            "they told us the wait would be 45min to am hour.  we went downstairs to use our phones.  there is absolutely no reception in there, their only major con. would be nice if they had free wifi.  it is difficult to have people meet you for breakfast when they can't get a hold of you.  they also do not let you use their phone. we came up after 30min and our name had actually been called 5min prior.  we waited 2 more minutes and got sat at a nice booth. our server jason was amazing.  he was very happy which made my mood better. he suggested a wonderful mimosa. fresh squeezed orange juice.  it was very fresh and a good sweet.  she ordered <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> with a vanilla waffle. they gave her potatoes instead of bacon.  they brought out her bacon quickly and she got to keep the potatoes too.  she said it was the best waffle she ever had!   i ordered the <mark>French Toast</mark>.  the banana and pecans come together with the <mark>French Toast</mark> so well. the toast is very thick. felt like i had close to a loaf of bread on my plate haha.  love the portions here $12.95 for each of our plates.  this restaurant is always consistent.  my favorite breakfast in las vegas.", 
            "meh.  the wait was reasonable. the service was good.   the food was not great. i had the banana <mark>French Toast</mark> which was good, but the bacon didn't come crispy as i requested. the blueberry pancakes were dry. it was a real let down for a las vegas breakfast spot. go to the egg and i on sahara instead.", 
            "we had this place bookmarked as it was on man vs food and were so excited we were finally able to check it out.  we came in and had to wait for maybe about 30 minutes as this place was super packed!  no worries, they were serving bloody marys and screwdrivers while you wait!  these drinks are stiff.  we were finally seated and greeted by our waiter.  i of course ordered the griddled <mark>French Toast</mark> that is dipped in banana cinnamon cream and came with pecan maple syrup.  oh my, the <mark>French Toast</mark> was fantastic.  love it and the portion was huge.  my hubby of course ordered the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> and really enjoyed it.  the chipotle cream was really good and flavorful.  everything here was really good and we both walked out in a food coma.  perfect time to walk it out on the strip! lol", 
            "previous reviewers are all correct on the portions, they are giant, too big.  most people in vegas are at a hotel and not taking home leftovers so alot of food is going to waste.  they could serve half portion sizes and charge slightly less and probably make more money without all the waste.\n\nthat to say, the food, although excessive, was awesome!!!  i will definitely be going back to this joint.  i got the farmhouse scramble with bacon and avocado with the potato smashers and a side of gravy to eat with my biscuit.  absolutely delicious.  eggs were the right texture, not too soft but not overcooked, gravy was thick and good flavor, biscuit was perfect, potatoes were pretty much <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> so if you don't want those for breakfast, don't get them, but i loved them just fine.  went great with my bowl of gravy :)\n\nboyfriend got the <mark>French Toast</mark> and he was equally pleased with his meal.\n\nonly small complaint is there was an hour wait, not a big deal, we expected a wait, so we went down and played at a $5 blackjack table right next to the restaurant.  they told us to come check back in 30 minutes just in case and when we did were told to come back in 20 minutes.  we went back in 20 minutes and they said our table had been ready for 15 minutes.  they could invest in the buzzers to let people know when their table is ready so you can enjoy the casino while waiting without having to go back repeatedly and missing being called.  we were starving and would have been happy to eat 15 minutes earlier and would have lost less money waiting... \n\nregardless, highly recommend!!!!", 
            "the portions are enormous! i had <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> with <mark>French Toast</mark> and was so full i didn't need to eat the rest of the day. my husband had the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash and he loved it, and it left him stuffed to the brim as well! the bloody marys are perfect - just the right amount of spice! i've been to vegas twice but this was the first time we ventured into the quad/linq area and it is not to be missed!", 
            "amazing breakfast! \nwent in for a very late breakfast on a wednesday about 2pm. i ordered the <mark>French Toast</mark>. my husband ordered the eggs, bacon and a pancake the size of a hubcap. my <mark>French Toast</mark> was amazing. pecan nuts and banana. to die for. best <mark>French Toast</mark> i've ever had. we got seated right away and our sever was very friendly. we never had empty glasses. next time i visit vegas i will definitely get the <mark>French Toast</mark> again.", 
            "i highly recommend going here for breakfast! my husband and i stayed at caesars and didn't like there options for breakfast. we searched yelp and it came up for a hot breakfast spot. it is about a ten minute walk from caesars  and worth it! we had the <mark>French Toast</mark>, eggs, bacon, home fries and biscuits! yum yum yum!", 
            "my go to restaurant for breakfast when i visit vegas. always good food, service and drinks too! i always order a scramble...one of these days i will venture out! but i love the griddled <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and the biscuit it comes with. my friend enjoyed the <mark>French Toast</mark>. you will leave here with your stomach very full and happy!", 
            "i literally can't think of anything wrong with this establishment. from food, to customer service, to overall look and feel of the restaurant, it definitely warrants 5 stars. \n\nquality and quantity are the key words here. the portion sizes are fit for kings and queens. huge! my husband and i have yet to finish a full meal here. the waffles, chicken, pancakes, eggs, potatoes, <mark>French Toast</mark> and many other dishes are so large that they could use their own individual plates! the meals are also vertical, literally. the food is piled on top of itself as you can see in many of the photos. the presentation and plating is stellar. as soon as you see your food, you're amazed! \n\nthe quality of the food and seasonings are top notch. one of their little catch phrases is \"twisted farm food\", which definitely holds true. they even tell you when you order that everything is made to order, that they don't use any heat lamps, and that your food may come out in separate pieces and separate times. this is so awesome to me and ensures that my food is fresh. even the juice is fresh squeezed when you order it, so it may take a few mins to arrive. \n\nthe setup of the restaurant is really cool, roomy, kind of dark, and overall has a great vibe. we haven't had one bad customer service problem here. the wait staff is fantastic, and they all look genuinely happy to be working there. the main thing i noticed is that there are a million and one employees here. you see them zipping back and forth the whole time you're there. the staff is also very diverse as far as appearance and ethnicity. \n\nbe prepared for somewhat of a wait at this location. eating at a restaurant such as hash house a go go is definitely a priority for many people when they come to vegas--myself included!", 
            "the food rocked. i got the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict. it was enough to feed 2.  my fianc\\u00e9 got the pecan banana <mark>French Toast</mark> and it was great. our server, tony, was awesome. the food came quickly too. def going back in a few days.", 
            "great service, large portions, served fast, pretty good taste !! i ordered the blueberry pecan pancakes and tried the <mark>French Toast</mark> too!! one of the diners and dives places and not very pricey!! great way to start the day after a night in las vegas. all types of people come here to eat including celebs.", 
            "if you are really really hungry i would suggest eating here. they have lots to choose from and their serving portions are huuge! which is not that bad for their menu pricing. \n\nthe only thing is that they are always crowded especially in the morning on the weekends. i've only eaten here twice and had to wait a while to be seated each time. so expect a line if you don't get there before they open. the unfortunate thing is that you can't make reservations and cell phone reception is terrible so if you're trying to get a hold of people who are meeting with you there do it before entering. \n\nother than that their food is good. so far i've tried their mushroom swiss burger and their banana nut <mark>French Toast</mark> which was delish!", 
            "soooooo good! i couldn't have asked for any better food! the s'mores mocha was amazing and delicious! we also ordered eggs, potatoes, <mark>French Toast</mark>, and pancakes. wow!!!\n\nall three of us were blown away and we have recommended this place over and over! will absolutely go back!", 
            "it was our last meal of our lv vacation, and we decided we'd do brunch here. i saw the man v. food episode and was determined to try the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>!\n\nit was a little confusing finding the restaurant.  the quad is on the strip, but the parking was a little sketchy and once in the casino we had to ask someone where the restaurant was. we were told the wait was 25 minutes, but was seated in less than 10. \n\nmy husband and i shared the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> and the <mark>French Toast</mark>...mmmmmmm!!! it was a great combo. it was a ton of food, but we justified it by making it brunch and knew we wouldn't have another meal until very late that night. the chicken is tender, the potatoes were delish (my husband loved them), and the chipotle sauce was the perfect topper. the <mark>French Toast</mark> was the best i ever had - perfectly done with pecans and grilled bananas...great combination. i didn't even need maple syrup. \n\nour waiter, scotty, was very friendly and helpful, as was the other waiters i observed. i recommend hash house a go go and suggest sharing a couple dishes. if you have a busy day planned, this is a great place to fuel up. and the coffee is great, too...not that see-thru, flavorless, tea-like stuff!", 
            "surprisingly below average. first expect a pretty long wait to get your table of corse because it is in vegas. second my wait for the food was around 45 minutes witch was annoying but in my mind this was gonna be the best breakfast ever so it was worth the wait for me. when the food came out i was ready baby!!! and the first bite.....hmm not that good. i got the grilled <mark>French Toast</mark> and a side of biscuits and gravy. i get biscuits everywhere i go just to try everyone's and find the best. this place was not good at all very stale biscuits and cold gravy. let's move to the <mark>French Toast</mark>, i understand it's grilled however burned should have been the word it overpowered the taste so it did not have much flavor and they give you a tiny little maple syrup to cover 3 huge pieces of <mark>French Toast</mark>. only come here if you are already drunk, i think it would be pretty good then but so is waffle house. friendly staff though", 
            "the food here was absolutely spectacular. i ordered the <mark>French Toast</mark> and it was so soft and perfectly tasty. the best i've ever had. i also tried my friends hash browns. they were perfect. the food there is easily 5 stars. the service however is not so great. our waiter, in particular, was quite serious and terse. we asked him to split the check and he turned into a drama queen and made it seem like it was the end of the world. i'm pretty sure he rolled his eyes too. but hopefully your service experience will be different. the food is most definitely worth giving it a go!", 
            "a. ma. zing. the waiter suggested that my husband and i split the <mark>French Toast</mark> and the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> for a little sweet/salty mix and it was ridiculous!!! highly recommend!!", 
            "the wait is crazy here so don't go if you want a quick meal or arrive hungry! go early or else you'll wait for at least an hr! food is made to order so that's another 15-30 mins wait. with that said, i really enjoyed the food here, the portions are huge, sharing food is highly recommended. got <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> with <mark>French Toast</mark> and it was delicious. i would highly recommend this place if you have the time. \n\nparking: parking lot is free but it's a maze to find the entrance.", 
            "was told by many to try hash house. walked into the restuarant. i wasn't that impressed thought it just looked like any other place. but it didn't dissappoint. awesome bloody mary & the vanilla dipped <mark>French Toast</mark> wow i need to figure out how to make it this good at home. tried a bite of my friend's waffles & <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> mind blowing. if your are ever near one it's worth it.", 
            "the place well located and decoration with celebrities comments is nice. portions were huge and delicious, i had caramel all over the mocha and was really really good. to eat i had the tractor driver breakfast with <mark>French Toast</mark> which were delicious. \nwhat i don't get is why they have people waiting outside if there are available seats inside. we waited long and i saw there were places for us.\nin any case food was good and waitress very kind.", 
            "now that's alot of food! hope you're hungry. anything you order is excellent! i always get the banana <mark>French Toast</mark>, it is very good! also the hot chocolate is excellent, come with 4 jumbo marshmallows in the cup to give you an idea of how large it will be. :) everything is yum!",

            "i am going to start off by saying that the biscuits were nothing short of phenomenal. they were by far the best biscuits i have ever had. the potatoes were up there also. \n\ni really love breakfast, but at the same time feel as though there are only so many ways you can cook an egg. nevertheless, i felt breakfast here exceeded expectations by a mile. my wife had <mark>French Toast</mark> with pecans on top and i almost never taste her food. it was so tasty. i had the farm scramble w/ <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark>, fresh corn, roasted red pepper, & mozzarella (also tasty).\n\nif you are expecting a quiet atmosphere, soothing music, and white table clothes during breakfast (or any other meal because they serve more than just breakfast), you've barked up the wrong tree. if large portions, fun wait staff and filling drinks are your thing, this will more than meet your expectations. it's more expensive than your local denny's (which is up the strip), but it's vegas... would you expect anything else?!\n\nvisit me on my website... antondaniels.com, @1antondaniels on ig", 
            "i get that this place is busy packed all the time, but maybe that just means they need to bring on more staff to help. \n\nwent in with some friends and we all ordered mimosas and food. after waiting about 25 min for our mimosa  both the drink runner and food runner showed up at our table at the same time. the food was great, but our mimosas were warm! there's nothing like sipping on warm orange juice with a splash of champaign. \n\nout server never came back to check on us, we went without napkins, water, and syrup for the <mark>French Toast</mark>. when our server came back it was just to drop off our bill. \n\nneedless to say i won't be back! wasn't worth it at all!!",

            "heavy emphasis that the food was made from scratch. what does that mean? if they are trying to make it clear that they are not just reheating frozen meals, then thank you for doing that. but it is a diner/restaurant so i already assumed they were making the food from what they call \"scratch\". then they said because all of the food is made from scratch, it would take longer to prepare. of course this was just an excuse to take 45 minutes to make my eggs and <mark>French Toast</mark>. idk exactly how they made the bacon from scratch, but i know they went out to the nearest maple tree and pumped the maple syrup. oh and of course the freshly squeezed orange juice, straight from the tropicana bottle! food was good tho, welcome to vegas.", 
            "yum!  a little tricky to find, but well worth it.  there was a 5 minute wait at 7am on a sunday, not bad!  we were seated with courtesy, and handed a menu with plenty of options.  i had the salmon scramble, which was great.  my family split the pancakes and <mark>French Toast</mark> which were off the charts as well.  i will say, the server gave us no guidance on portion sizes and allowed us to order food for twice as many people as in our party, which was disappointing.  at $62 for breakfast, it was pricey, but it is vegas after all.  no more $0.99 buffets in this town.", 
            "this place is cool. they have nice specialty drinks. i had one of their bloody mary's. pretty good. it featured a pickled green bean, jalape\\u00f1o stuffed olive and lemon. the base was spicy but not over the top. i enjoyed it. for breakfast, i had a hash made with chicken, asparagus, garlic and other veggies. it was pretty good but, in my personal opinion, it wasn't really a hash. the ingredient combinations was slightly off. one friend got the <mark>French Toast</mark> and he enjoyed it. two of my friends had the andys benedict. by far, the andys benedict was the star. all food portions were huge but the benedict was crazy large and packed with flavor on every bite. honestly, it very easily shared. two people could eat the benedict and be full. wait staff was mediocre but overall it was not a bad experience.",

            "with a room full of robuchon gifts leftover our fourth day would have been an easy one to sleep in and eat breakfast in the room - but why do things easy when there are so many great places to dine in las vegas?  despite my multiple trips to sin city in the past i'd regretfully been without a car on past visits and as such never been able to visit the local legend of \"twisted farm food\" - hash house a go-go.  having heard that a third (the other in san diego) location of the famous spot had recently opened in the imperial palace and waking up early as ever we made our way to the restaurant around 8:00am without reservations and found only 3-4 tables occupied.\n \nwith late eighties classics blasting we made our way to the hostess podium where we were greeted by a young lady clad in jeans and a hhagg shirt who led us to a four-top big enough for eight - no doubt hash house does everything big.  taking a seat we were soon greeted by our server, noelle, a pleasant young woman who was substantially more cordial and efficient than necessary at such a restaurant (a good thing, for sure.)  menus in hand we were left to decide while a mountainous eggs benedict passed by en route for another table.  hilariously enough, while we were waiting a group of six young men approached the hostess stand and then left because \"oh man, we thought this was a buffet.\"  clearly they'd not seen the portion sizes.\n \nsitting and chatting while coffee, water, orange juice, and tea were filled we decided to order only three items and share them around.  with prices ranging from $7-$17 we were informed that one of us would have to pay a $2 split entree fee - when i chuckled saying okay the response was \"you'd be amazed how angry some people get about it\" - clearly i'm jaded.  sitting back and listening to rock you like a hurricane while sipping the surprisingly good coffee the restaurant slowly filled up.\n \narriving in less than 20 minutes the portions were precisely as expected - enormous and delicious looking.  with a sweet, a savory, and a \"dessert\" there was too much food for four people.  beginning first with the blackberry granola flapjacks, my sister's choice although i'd lobbied for the snickers flapjacks, the pancake itself was enormous - literally the size of a car tire in diameter though thankfully not as thick.  with ample warm syrup and butter to spread there was really nothing subtle or nuanced, it was just good cofort food and the sweet blackberries worked nicely with the crunchy honey granola.\n\nperhaps the most famous hash house dish would be my order - \"<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> stacked with our famous <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>, hot maple caramel reduction and crowned with fried leeks.\"  golden and crispy the chicken was amply accented with sage and actually quite delicious.  stacked above and below four golden waffles loaded with whole strips (not small bits like other places) of salty bacon and topped with crispy leeks plus a sauce that was much more maple than caramel i have to admit that this was a huge portion of food.  while clearly not as subtle and refined as bouchon's chicken and waffles i actually much preferred this to roscoe's famous los angeles version and the less famous option at dc's founding farmers.\n\nour dessert would be <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark> topped with ice cream and served with a cup of coffee.  with the coffee alone costing $2.50 on the menu this <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark> is the deal of the breakfast menu at a mere $7.95.  a portion easily large enough for two hungry people or a family of four to share after dinner the pudding was essentially a black and white coffee cake that would have filled 3/4 of a standard loaf pan.  buttery and rife with chocolate the steaming hot pudding was then topped with melted snickers bars, doused with chocolate and caramel syrups, then piled high with two large scoops of vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, and crumbly brown sugar.  like the other choices there was nothing subtle about this caloric monster but honestly for all its audacity it was really quite good.\n\nsettling the bill (about $14 each after tax and a 25% tip) and returning a large portion to the kitchen (we still had p.u.b. leftovers and the robuchon basket in the room) we thanked our service team and made our way to <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> accompanied by eddie van halen's eruption.  generally a fan of refined flavors, elaborate cooking techniques, quiet dining rooms, excellent service, and great food hash house a go go wasn't exactly my kind of place - but the service was excellent and the food was pretty darn good.", 
            "i decided to give the hash house a go go at imperial palace a try since i had already visited the one on sahara ave.  given the past reviews of how mediocre this location was, i took it with a grain of salt and set low expectations.  and in a way, it helped.\n\nthe restaurant is definitely much smaller than the sahara location and it did feel a little congested.  it might have been because i sat at the bar instead of a table.  also the vibe of the restaurant felt different maybe because it's on the strip with more tourists whereas the sahara location was more laid back.  the really good thing though is that their prices are pretty much the same so no inflated strip prices here.\n\nafter tackling <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> last time, i decided to try their <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=f_5_unx-wrafcxuakbzrdw&select=9bclmrftsqxj9isx6atdlg). boy, did i totally underestimate how doughy those <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> would be.  i was a little bummed out that i didn't get too much syrup, but i was too hungry that morning to wait much longer.  i didn't think i did too bad though, i managed to leave just two waffles behind =).  the chicken sadly was overcooked this time so overall i had a really doughy and dry meal.  if i had to choose my favorite between the chicken and waffles or the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> wins hands down.  much more flavor and not very dry thanks to the chipotle cream sauce.\n\ni probably won't be coming back to this location again unless i happen to be at imperial palace with a huge hunger attack.  i think i'll stick with the sahara location from now on.",

            "omfg.\n\nlike seriously, omfg.\n\ni had to have texted my friend just those four letters at least 5 times because this place was better than i could have imagined.\nthis was seriously one of the best breakfasts i have ever had. ever. \n\nmy boyfriend & i saw this place on one of the tourist channels in the hotel and they mentioned it had been featured on man vs. food. now, we both enjoy watching that show but have never had the opportunity to try one of the places where adam has gorged himself so we knew that we simply had to try this place before we went back home. and in my opinion, it could not have been better.\n\nfirst, i had fairly low expectations for this place because it is in a pretty seedy looking casino on the strip. i mean, i had never even heard of the imperial palace let alone knew that it had such an awesome restaurant hiding inside. also, it was known for having huge portions which typically means to me that the food is going to be just ok.\n\ni was totally wrong.\n\nthe restaurant itself is actually very nice compared to the rest of the casino. it's really spacious and clean, and they play awesome music. also, aside from your average orange juice, they offer tangerine juice. who else does that!? no one, that's who.\nmy boyfriend and i were already loving it just from those two things. \n\nfor breakfast i ordered <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> which i got with two over easy eggs, sausage and the brown sugar banana pancake.\nthat's right. this was no boring old plain whatever pancake with some bananas sliced on top. \nthis was a huge effing pancake with a beautiful crust of brown sugar goodness with at least two whole bananas cooked into the massive cake. omfg.\ndrool. \nthe delicately flavored moist and fluffy cake gently embraced the bananas as they were surrounded by delicious little pockets of crunchy brown sugar. i was a little closer to heaven with each bite. \nthe eggs and sausage were also stellar, perfectly cooked with surprisingly very little grease. i was very impressed.\n\nmy boyfriend chose the man vs. food favorite which was a ridiculous benedict of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and biscuits topped with <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, scrambled eggs, mozzarella cheese and some veggies covered with a chipotle cream sauce. it was huge. definitely the frankenstein's monster of benedicts if i've ever seen it.\nit was also very tasty though. the chicken was delicious, again surprisingly not greasy at all. especially for <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>. the chipotle cream was flavorful with a good amount of heat and all the veggies were super fresh. \n\nthe service was also spectacular. our waitress was super friendly and our food was brought out very promptly, even though she told us that our dishes may not come out at the same time. she told us they don't use heat lamps so they want everything to be served right when it comes out so it gets to you nice and hot. that is fine with me! \nthis place definitely deserves all 5 stars. great service, fantastic ambiance, amazing food and huge portions. \ni will for sure be coming back to this place as soon as i can. \ni would even drive all the way out to vegas again just to come to the hash house, it's that good. next time i have to try the chicken & <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>. \nyes. they have <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>. \nomfg.",

            "this restaurant is located inside the imperial palace.   based on that fact, i totally didn't expect this place to be as awesome as it turned out to be.  my friends and i only tried this place out because my bf's sister (a major foodie) said that they had a good breakfast selection.  \n\nthe bf and i shared:\n\n- fresh market tomato salad: if you're gonna try a salad, try this one.  what won me over was the griddled crispy parmesan cheese that topped the salad.  it was soo goood.\n\n- ny times <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> tower:  okay, this is seriously something you have to try when coming here.  there's bacon in the waffles.  crispy <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> is so perfectly crispy.  then there's the leek on top?!!  i loved it.  i personally didn't like to combine the two but i also didn't mind eating it side by side.  what can be wrong about <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>??? and there's definitely nothing wrong with waffles.  the two make a very nice couple.\n\ni was also able to try one of my friends':\n\n- stuffed burgers (you get to choose from about 3 different stuffings - he tried mashed potato, bacon, and cheddar cheese): i thought the burger was okay...it was a little bit on the dry side but all in all, i like <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> of flavors in the 1 pounder.  \n\nthe service was decent.  we liked our waiter.  he knew the right times to come by.  i like the atmosphere.  very diner like.  apparently a lot of famous people come here so you can check out their wall of fame, which is pretty cool.\n\n\nthe hotel itself is so sucky but i guess not horrible.  the place reaks and i wouldn't stay here again (was here for the cheap prices haha).  but do come here for this restaurant :)", 
            "the best chicken & waffles i've ever had in my life. roscoe's can suck it!\n\ni was guided here by yelp after searching for some nearby breakfast foodstuffs. reviews were solid, and they spoke of portions so huge they were legendary. finding it inside the imperial palace was a little tricky, but a helpful security guard guided us while he told me about how \"you can't go wrong with anything\" in regards to what i should order. we got seated no problem - must have come during a lull. \n\nmy eyes immediately locked on the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles once i was presented with the menu. two succulent fried breasts of chicken placed atop a tower of four <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>, coated in syrup. call a cardiologist because i was ready to risk a heart attack for this meal. \n\nof course, i can't have a big breakfast meal without a suitable beverage. enter the b.l.t. mary, a 20 oz. bloody mary made with bacon-infused vodka, all the usual fixings, and garnished with a strip of bacon, romaine lettuce and a tomato slice. it also came with a single piece of white toast that my gf noted looked like a large melba toast. i opted out of eating it, though. \n\ngood thing, too, because my jaw went slack when she brought out my order. the portion was gargantuan. i quickly dove in. the chicken tasted like something sweet had been added after the deep-frying, making it ridiculously savory in addition to being extremely succulent. the waffles were so chock full of bacon that it was protruding from every seam. <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> of chicken, waffle and syrup was the experience i wanted to have at roscoe's, but never got. the flavors were so good that i drove myself to finish off both breasts and 3 of the waffles entirely. after that, i was certain my stomach was about to explode. \n\nmy gf got the \"basic two eggs with potatoes, bacon and fruit\" for $6.95, but there was nothing basic about it. the plate was huge, and she could barely finish it off. even their most unassuming items are still enough food for two. total out <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> was about $35, and worth every single penny. i'll be making this my go-to breakfast spot in vegas from now on.",

            "to say that the dishes here are gargantuan in size is an understatement.  they give you enough food to feed half of china. having a location right on the strip is a big plus.  the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> and <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict always remains a favorite.  \n\neven though the food is decent, the wait is horrendous.  plan about an hour to an hour  and half.  they give you the pagers but they dont work in the casino area - sucks!  the sheer volume of people that come through here has a huge impact on kitchen staff as food service is excruciatingly slow.  one of the dishes we ordered was the fried salmon sandwich and it came out 30 min after the chicken.  how does it take longer to fry fish than chicken?  the wait staff came by to check on us often and let us know that the fish would be coming out in 5 min. they must be on spanish time cuz it took 30 min and we had to take it to go.  the person who ordered that was nonetheless very displeased since everyone else was done with their entrees before it came out. i dont think hh should levy split plate charges since it would help them out a lot to have less entrees ordered.\n\nfor a better experience, although a bit out of the way, i recommend going to the location off of the strip.",

            "at first look, the pictures of the food that are hanging near the entrance of the restaurant look horrible but the food turned out pretty good. i had the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with waffles. this dish did not meet my expectations. the chicken was bland and there wasn't anything especially good about the tower of <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>. however, <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> with the brown sugar banana flapjack was delicious. the griddled <mark>French Toast</mark> was also great. also the watermelon kiwi drink is a must have.", 
            "i was so excited to try the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles but it just did not meet my expectations. also, i didn't even realize my meal was off until the end but i was too disappointed to bother bringing it up to our waiter. the idea of <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> sounds amazing but mine just wasn't all that great. the batter was bland. the chicken was soo dry that after every bite i felt the need to down mouthfuls of water just to get it all down without choking. i got only one piece of chicken rather than two with the four <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>. so essentially, i paid $18.50 for one piece of super dry <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and four mediocre waffles. i thought i wad trippin that i somehow forgot that i ate the chicken or bf ate it when i wasnt looking but i confirmed my suspicions with the picture i took.\n\ni like that the dish is beautifully garnished but i dont like that they pour the syrup on the waffles prior to bringing it out. i normally don't like too much syrup on my waffles so that was disappointing and it came out soggy because it had been sitting.\nthe only thing i absolutely liked was the kiwi watermelon lemonade. it tasted refreshing after an exhausting day on the strip. the server was nice and kept our glasses full but the food wasnt all that great. on that note, i may be back to try another dish but the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles was just wayy too disappointing and definitely not worth the money for just that one piece. :(", 
            "we went here for breakfast on a friend's recommendation and were not disappointed . the server told us the portions were big and maybe we should share but me and my boyfriend have very different tastes in food so we each got our own meal. i got the salmon benedict  and he got the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> the waitress said the salmon dish was going to be spicy but i think she was thinking about normal people not used to spice. i love spicy thai food and the salmon dish was just right for me it tasted awesome. she was right about the portion sizes though we each ate half and took the rest back to our hotel.", 
            "i'd love to give this place 4 stars, and my reason for taking a star off might seem odd to some, but honestly... the portions are a little excessive. no one like leaving hungry, but at the same token, not many people i know like being presented with a plate holding enough food to feed 4 people easily. i had the crispy pork loin benedict, which was really tasty. the southwest sauce on it was perfect, but the scrambled eggs on top were almost superfluous. the pork loin covered my entire plate and was laid on top a big biscuit <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. i don't think i was able to finish half of it. i get that they're known for their ridiculous portions, but seriously... it was a bit much. \n\ntheir <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> (yes, there's strips of bacon in the waffles) were really good. super fluffy and a perfect balance of sweet and salty. their biscuits are big and fluffy and are great with their homemade jam. i think their jam may have been some of the best i've ever had. and the kiwi watermelon lemonade was so so good! \n\nif they were to tone down their portions (you can keep them big without being insanely ginormous) i'd give them 4 stars.", 
            "this place was amazing!! we ordered the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> and coffee. told them we were going to share & i guess because everyone wants to do this due to their huge portions, there is a charge. now we have been told of the plate charge @ other restaurants which usually means the kitchen portions it out on another plate for you and we just decline that & they forego the charge but not here. but the waiter did suggest how we might as well order a side dish so we are actually getting something for our $2.50 plate charge. we ordered more bacon of course!! i think that was $3.50 but still, it was all well worth it. i ordered tthey were amazing!!!! we ate two & took the other two back to our room where we had it the next a.m. as we were getting ready to head out. (we had a microwave). the coffee was great as was the service! the only complaint i have is the hostess. when she gave us the little pager thing, i told her i had to use the restroom. she told me where it was (downstairs) and i asked if the pager would work that far...she said \"yes\" so downstairs we went. don't worry, the bf held the pager for me so i didn't take it n the bathroom (though i'm sure there are people who do). we got a message on it saying the pager wasn't receiving messages. we had to go back upstairs to get it reset. we still had about 30 mins of a wait so we went downstairs again, but not as far as the bathrooms, to play a few slots & got the same message. so for future reference, the pagers don't work downstairs!",

            "this place has been hyped by my friends who are vegas regulars and now i know why - this place is great.  had the opportunity to go 3 different times and each time the food was great, the service by the wait-staff was just as impressive.....with the exception on one of those days, one of the hostesses on duty was pretty pretentious and kind of a total \"b\", she let me know the wait time would be 10 minutes because of the lunchtime rush...which was no problem, but after 30 minutes, we were not seated.    i would have been \"ok\" if she would have apologized if she had forgotten to seat us but instead, she said, \"oh well, deal with it.\"  that comment irritated me - which was clearly visible...to which the second hostess apologized and quickly found a seat for my group and i.  \n\ni ordered my meal of their signature dish - chicken and <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> and their rosemary infused ice tea....to quote robin, \"holy super sized meal, batman!\"....the portion was more than generous - i was able to share my meal with a friend and had enough food to take back to my hotel and share with another friend who had stayed behind to \"nurse a headache\".  after i paying  the bill, gave my  server a nice tip because he made sure all of his assigned tables were being taken care of.  as i walked past the hostess station, i gave the hostess who seated me and rectified the situation a tip as well.  as i gave her the tip, i noticed the hostess who ticked me off look over and i shot her a look and used her words, \"oh well, deal with it!\" and walked out.  \n\ni went back the following day for breakfast and what a different experience - great service....and the eggs benedicts and blt bloddy mary were delicious.  \n\nby the way, the hash house, is open 24/7...so, don't pay attention to what the hash house website says.    ....and don't mind the remodeling being done at the quad hotel.",

            "when we arrived, the waiting area was packed! the wait was estimated for a 15-20 so the men decided to grab a bloody mary and us ladies took a few pics and next thing you know we were being seated. \n\nonce we sat down our server came over immediately and took our drink orders and i chose to get one of the specialty drinks that came in a neat souvenir glass. everyone had pretty much decided what was being order and from then it was on!\n\n- <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles that include, two <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breasts with hardwood smoked <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> tower, hot maple reduction and fried leeks -awesome sauce\n\n-<mark>Corned Beef</mark>, red onions and swiss cheese  -awesome sauce\n\n-griddled <mark>HH Famous Meatloaf</mark> & 2 eggs served with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, fruit & biscuit - now of course my husband had to be different and go against the grain and order this and he  was disappointed but he is lucky i love him so i shared my chicken and waffles and hash with him (yes i order both, i mean you only live once right)\n\nthe portions were huge and it took us the rest of the trip to finish it! \n\nthis has been added to my favorite places to eat in vegas.",

            "had my first <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles ($17.50) so good! the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was delicious: extra crispy yet so moist. i recommend breaking down the tower when it comes to the table (after taking a photo to savor it for later) to prevent the bottom two <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> from getting all soggy. also, if you go make sure to bring a friend or two. no matter what you order, there's enough to feed 2-3 people...unless you're a polynesian linebacker :d\n\nwhen you get there, be prepared to wait. they have some interesting things to look at and they have wifi, but seating is at a limited supply. also, use the bathroom before you go up the stairs...i don't think they have one up there.", 
            "the food were good a bit cold when it came out. the food also takes a long long long time to come out so just make sure you are willing to wait at least 30 mins. huge portions and long lines. it's worth to try once but wouldn't come back unless i'm craving for <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>.", 
            "just came to this restaurant, excited to try it. my friend and i ordered the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> with eggs and the salmon sandwhich.  the portions were really big so we couldn't eat everything and only ate half of our foods. we asked the waiter for some boxes to go and as the waiter brought back my container there was a live baby roach that was moving all around in the container as i was about to put my waffle in there. \n\ni immediately called for the waiter to come over. this was unacceptable. i asked the waiter to bring over the manager and all she said was that we have exterminators that spray and that the only thing i can do is take half off your bill. she acted as if it was no big deal.\n\nwhy should i have to pay when i got a roach in my container. so disgusted and nasty. i will no longer be eating here.", 
            "i ate here twice.   the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> and blt bloody mary were delicious.   i sat at the bar, got great service and i will return.", 
            "loved this place! the portions are huge and the boyfriend and i don't always like the same foods. needless to say, we had a lot of food left over but it was sooooo good. i had the famous <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> and he had the garlic chicken and avocado hash. both were amazing! service was great and fast too. will def come again on the next visit.", 
            "giant portions is an understatement. come hungry! we went around 7am and got a table quickly. started to get packed at 8am. server was really polite and available. restaurant appeared clean. food came out relatively quickly. \n\ni ordered <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> with griddled <mark>French Toast</mark>. it was so delicious. the candied pecans and banana are a great touch. \n\nhusband ordered the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>. there are strips of bacon cooked in to the waffle!! this was awesome as well. \n\ndefinitely a place to try while in vegas.", 
            "maple <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> and <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was so yummy good but need two to split this plate. 4 waffles and two chicken breasts for $18. bloody marys were the bomb.", 
            "i specifically chose this location over the one inside rio because of their 4 star reviews over 3 stars at rio... unfortunately, i'm only giving this place 3 stars because the service was pretty bad. 3 stars for their great menu with unique offerings (lots of breakfast items), huge portions, and ample seating. \n\nvalue: since their portions are hugenormous, you can understand why they charge so much. however, $5.99 for hot chocolate, it's a bit overpriced. \n\ntaste: i only ordered the chicken and waffles. the chicken was crispy on the outside and tender meat inside- great! the taste- well, it's just ok. it can have a bit more flavor. the waffle is bacon infused. and since bacon makes everything better, i had no complaints there. the chicken is a bit over battered for my liking... leaving fried batter all over the plate so on top of the thick <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>, you have all this breading from the chicken--- carbs anyone???\n\nservice: here's why i deducted 2 points... the bf ordered espresso... accidentally, upon setting the cup on the table, the server spilled the espresso on the table, my seat, pants, and sleeves. we all know how small an espresso is so with half of it gone, he barely had any. you would think he would offer to replace it, nope! fine. we realized our server clearly do not care about beverage because we already had our food and the water never came. tending to our hydration needs seemed such an abhorrent task for him. the server gave no apologies, no f*ck, nor two sh!ts \n\nfinale: this place is overrated. their food presentation is impressive however the taste does not match its aesthetics. what can i say, i'm a professional complainer and an emotional eater. eating is an experience for me. to me, this was not a good one."

            "so it seems that people are totally split on hhagg at ip.  they either had a horrible experience with bad service and/or bland food or they had a great experience.  i'm happy to say that ours was the latter.\n\nwe got there about 7 am, the place was almost deserted and we were seated immediately.  just after we were seated the server came over, took our order for coffee, water and a large (fresh & tasty) tangerine juice.  \n\nwhen she returned several minutes later with our bevs, she asked if we still needed time to decide, which we did. when she came back we still didn't know what we wanted so she gave us a few suggestions and told us her favs as well.  \n\nwe like servers who tell you their favs, not just what \"other\" people like or a list of just about everything on the menu.  \n\nafter several suggestions she sold us on the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> and a side of fruit.  \n\nfor those of you who had bland food at hhagg, i'm so sorry! =(  ours was anything but.  \n\nfrom the bottom up here's how the benedict went:\nbiscuits: soft, warm and fluffy\n<mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>: half hash brown, half mashed, griddled with a nice browned crispiness\neggs: not over done, not underdone, just right\n<mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>: everything bacon should be; salty, thick and smoky \nspinach and tomato: a good offset to the heaviness of the dish \n<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>: holy yummers!!!  ours wasn't bland at all; it was sage-y & succulent \ngriddled cheese: a crisp & tangy blanket of heaven\nchipotle cream benedict sauce: the perfect rich and zesty topping to a decadent breakfast\n\noh and the fruit...it was called a small side but it had 2 thick slices of cantaloupe, 4 thick wedges of pineapple, 4 -6 strawberries, several orange slices.  it was ripe and tasty, no sub-par \"garnish-grade\" fruit here; and just $3.95", 
            "we decided to have a late breakfast here since it was across the street from our hotel.  i had already been to the one in san diego, so i knew to expect huge portions.  my friends wanted to check it out to see what all the hype was about.\n\ni went with the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash, some people got the <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, avocado, onion & swiss farm scramble, and one person decided to tackle the ginormous <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>.  \n\nmy dish was pretty good.  it had just the right amount of <mark>Corned Beef</mark>, potatoes and scrambled eggs.  i've had the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> before, and that was way too much food for one person.  you will pretty much lapse into a food coma right after you eat it.  that is definitely a dish two people can share.\n\nthe restaurant was pretty busy, and it took forever for us to order and get our food.  i felt like we spent more time waiting than eating.  if it wasn't for the slow service, i would've given it 4 stars.", 
            "i'm going to start this off by saying that i am not a fan of casino eatery places (aside from buffets) that are on upper floors of the buildings. i feel like they are almost always desolate (at least in my experiences) and are void of any and all character that it may have if it were in it's own separate location. and this particular place was of no exception. there were three other tables (the place was a really dull atmosphere- cmon, it's vegas people!). i perhaps saw my waitress three times-including bill drop-off and pick-up and the food was not on the cheap end of things. \ni ordered <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> (w/ fresh spinach, <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs- i subbed grilled chicken in for the fried, not like that redeems calories or anything) and it was huge. and contrary to other reviews, delicious. the mimosa i ordered was really strong for such a little thing and had me kind of whirling out back into the casino. i ate off that thing for two days and will definitely get it again (at the other location) next time i'm there : )", 
            "5 stars for the food. \n3 stars for the service.\nso i came out at an even 4.\n\n\namazing breakfast is had here. \n\ni was really excited to eat somewhere other than subway at vegas this time around... and the hash house a go go definitely provides a bang for your buck (which is critical when doing vegas on a budget like i am).\nbut who am i kidding? i didn't even pay for this meal! a good friend did (and that right there is the ultimate best way to do vegas on a budget!). \n\ngot the <mark>HH Original</mark> benedict but veggie style, so without the <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark> (got asparagus on the side instead).  the roasted red pepper cream it came with was absolutely uh-mazing! as were the griddled <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>! \n\nalmost couldn't finish my meal, the plate was so large! be prepared to get a to-go box and eat the rest after when you're good and drunk :)\n\nthe service was a bit on the slow side... but it was vegas on a saturday morning. a tip would be to come an hour before you actually want to eat and then go gamble downstairs while you wait for a table.\n \nalso... i gotta say that the entrance to the imperial palace from the strip is harder to find than one would think. there's some stores and a restaurant in the front that actually obstruct the casino entrance behind.  there seems to be only a vehicle entrance through two driveways, however, the actual pedestrian pathways are next to these driveways... they just looks like shady alley ways. took us a second to figure it out!",

            "this place is amazing!!! so unique and delicious!\n\ni was told about this place by a friend who couldn't stop raving about this place and they were right!! \n\nmy husband had the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> w/ fresh spinach, <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream scrambled eggs. the dish on man vs food. it was so good. the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was so crispy even through it's covered with this really yumm sauce. the bacon and cheese on top of that rich creamy sauce, it was so good. best <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> i ever had.\n\ni was trying to be a bit healthier than my husband so i got the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark>, fresh corn, roasted pepper & mozzarella scrambles. it was so good, i think the corn was the best part, but overall it was <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> of the ingredients.\n\nkiwi watermelon lemonade is amazing!! love the kiwi part :)\n\nalso a warning - the hash house a go go in san diego is the original, but it not nearly as good. the ones in vegas is much better!!!", 
            "three of us arrived midday on a weekday. the wait was about 15-20 minutes.\n\nwe knew the portions were huge and a doggy bag was not an option. so, we decided to share two dishes. but because they frown upon that, we ordered an additional side so they had no issue with three people chowing down on two entrees.\n\nwe ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles, brown sugar banana flapjacks and a side of bacon. in addition, based on some other yelp reviews, we ordered the kiwi watermelon lemonade.\n\nthe lemonade was super potent and overly sweet. even after mixing thoroughly, it was way too much to drink straight. since i had an unsweetened iced tea, we added a lot of that to the lemonade which made it bearable. perhaps cutting it with a portion of water (or tea) would make it easier for most to drink.\n\nthe <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles was made to be a visual showstopper. that was all. i was disappointed because i had been worked up by veterans of this dish. sure, it was a monstrous pile of food with a huge steak knife and rosemary sprigs holding it together. sure, it had bacon in the waffles. sure, it had <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>. but my opinion went down as i started eating it. the chicken seemed overcooked and dry. i couldn't taste any sage. the waffles were more dense and the bacon didn't really add much. the bright note were the leeks which were very tasty, but not tasty enough to save this dish.\n\nthe brown sugar banana flapjacks was really a single flapjack that was so huge it hung over the sides of the plate, and it was already a huge plate to begin with. the flavor was good and a great size to share between three people.\n\ni think the most memorable thing was the side of bacon. i was afraid that it would be overkill because there was bacon in the waffles. but this was thick cut <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark> so it was crispy and juicy and super flavorful. probably some of the best, if not *the* best, bacon i've had.\n\nparking at the imperial palace was a bit tricky since there weren't easily visible signs indicating that we were entering the ip garage. if you're not comfortable with driving along the strip, i would recommend taking the tram from another hotel on the strip to the ip.\n\nthe amount of food you get is a plus, but if this is your first time, i would recommend going with a big group and ordering one chicken and waffles to share between everyone. that way you can try more things on the menu.", 
            "as the cheddar cheese slowly repels from the burger, i quickly snatch it with my tongue before the jealously hungry plate that caresses my burger even touches my meal. yes i am a jealous person when  it comes to good food.  <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, avocado & cheddar burger on a fresh bun (i do not know the name of the bread but it was yum!)  was fabulously delicious with the fries as the only disappointment. to me they tasted as if they were borrowed from burger king.\n\nand the woman sitting on the table next to us kept asking questions when we took a bite. that's okay. she was curious about everyone's food taking a photo of me every time i sunk my teeth into the over-sized $13.00 burger.\n\nthe server was fabulous checking up on us frequently; however only exception was the busboy and hostess did not bring the cucumber ranch dressing my friend was eating in a bowl large enough to fit a 10 pound cat. we had to ask the waiter and he brought it to us within 2 minutes. if only the busboy could have taken two minutes from the conversation with the hostess about his dog to bring the dressing might have brought up the score 1 notch.\n\nno complaints about the huge portions.",

            "everything the world needs to know about us fat americans can be found at the hash house a go go.  vegas is a city of sin and this is gluttony at it's finest.  hash house describes their concept as twisted farm food.  it's american comfort food taken out of it's overalls and dressed up.  i came here for one thing.....the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>.  i saw it on man vs food and knew someday it would have to be mine.\n\nso many times when a place \"creates\" a tower of food all combined together on a gargantuan plate, it's not well thought out.  this is different and the key here is each ingredient is great on it's own.  from the bottom up we have <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, nicely seasoned and thrown on a griddle to get them slightly browned.  then why stop with one starch when you can have two?  the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> are topped with a couple of fluffy buttermilk biscuits that are some of the most tasty i've ever had.  followed by fresh spinach (it's great that they don't cook it so it doesn't get mushy) and slices of red beefsteak tomato.  this is topped with a couple of slices of hickory <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark> and then it's namesake....a half pound well seasoned <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breast.  corn flakes are used as the batter and it keeps it's crunch well.  top this with scrambled eggs and cheese.  the cheese is fried up on the griddle so it's melted prior to going on everything else.  this also creates a nice browned skin to the melted cheese.  i forgot to ask what cheese they were using, but it wasn't too strong.  it seemed it's main job was bond itself to the chipotle cream sauce that is poured on top and create one cheesy gooey chipotle sauce that seals everything in.  winner winner chicken dinner!  i hope they never open a hash house near me because i could see myself craving one of these life ending creations often.  5 stars all the way.\nthe masterpiece... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=8ow8c6e4iway0mhurzqn_q#4mg6mmblxil1kwp_ucw3kg\n\nand here's a nice cross section of it to fully appreciate all it's glory...  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=8ow8c6e4iway0mhurzqn_q#50ilis2pomhauloth8so2w\n\ni also got a chance to try the big o' <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> sandwich.  we all agreed while impressive to look at, it wasn't on the same level as <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>.  it was a tasty deep fried pork cutlet but i found it needing more than just the sprinkling of ketchup on it as it got a little dry.  i did love the pickles as the vinegar flavor worked well with the pork.  perhaps some kind of creamy bbq sauce would have been better.  the bun was a whole wheat bun, but was a throw away here.  why whole wheat?  i have no idea.  3.5 stars http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=8ow8c6e4iway0mhurzqn_q#smjihbrjw3f9noleumympq\n\nmy wife for some reason got the most boring burger on the menu.  as such i found myself saying....just a burger.  their burgers are two half pound patties stuffed with a few different options.  well it doesn't seem that they are really \"stuffed\" just things are put between the 2 burgers.  she got bacon, cheddar, and avocado.  so to me it was just how they layered everything, big deal the bacon, cheddar, and avocado was between two separate patties.  there was also no sauce?  just ketchup.  we asked for some mayo, so it wasn't so dry, but this place should really come up with their own sauce.  if you want a burger, there are better more creative options in vegas, such as burger bar or bachi burger.  3.5 stars. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=8ow8c6e4iway0mhurzqn_q#hjjzmdozjlfqe0gsgrp17a\n\ni'm sure there are other 5 star dishes here as i saw a lot of amazing looking things.  my daughter's plain pancake was one of the best i've ever tasted.  they do them all kinds of ways here.  of course the pancake was the size of a medium pizza and a good 3/4 inch thick.  for sure i'm trying one of their hash dishes next time.  after all they are called hash house.  the meatloaf and smoked mozzarella hash sounds great with a couple of over easy eggs on top.  i can recommend the banana latte.  it was excellent. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=8ow8c6e4iway0mhurzqn_q#v1jbffdhdwldaageybhhwg\n\nexpect at least a 20-30 minute wait as the word is out on this place.  they told us 45, but we were in in 20.  it's a huge restaurant and they move them in and out fairly well.  open 24 hours!!!!", 
            "before leaving to vegas, my coworker insisted that i should eat at hash house. we have one in califonria, but she said that vegas is a lot better. well, since my coworker is so in love with this particular location, i had to try it out. my group of friends and i came on a busy summer saturday morning around 11am. the hostess told us the wait would be about an hour or more. go figure....because when we walked up the stairs (yes it is located upstairs of harris casino), we can see a large crowd of people, either standing or sitting. the waiting area is small and stuffy and full of hungover club-goers from the night before. \nwe waited for about 30 minutes and we were tired of waiting. so we asked the girl who took down my number if we can order something to go and she said yes and told us to order it with the bartender. so my boyfriend and i walked over to the bartender and tried to get our orders in, but no one acknowledged us....we were literally flagging down the bartenders and the waiters but they just ignored it. i understand that this place gets packed and busy, but please dayummmn rude.  about 20 minutes in, we were finally asked \"how can i help you?\" at that time, our name was called and we ended up dining in.\nwe ended up ordering 2 items:\n1. sage-<mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, which comes with layers of ooey-gooey goodness! the infamous sage-<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, fresh spinach, scrambled eggs, <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, tomatoes, and grilled mozzarella are served on a bed of grilled <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and fresh split biscuit, and lastly they top it with their homemade chipotle cream sauce!! this portion can feed up to 3 hungry people. for something that cost around $13-20 and that is shared with 2-3 adults, it's worth it! the plate came out pretty messy, but it tasted amazing. the chicken was crispy and juicy, and eggs and bacon can never go wrong together. i finished a little portion and had the worst food coma i've had in a while. \n2. of course we ordered the chicken and waffles.  the waffles were thick and fluffy and also stuffed with bacon inside! major plus for the bacon eaters! the chicken was surrounded with leek and a stick of sage that was pierced into the chicken. the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was delicious, perfectly made and so moist. it wasn't all greasy like the chicken you would get from popeyes or kfc\n\neverything was so delicious, and none of us finished out plates. there were 6 of us by the way. i will definitely come back, at an odd hour like 5am to avoid the wait. i hope the staffs can help us faster next time.. its worth checking out if you take it for what its worth.", 
            "less is more. i wish this place was better. i have been wanting to try hhagg for a long time, but it never seems to work out. i finally made it on tuesday morning and felt sick all day. it's carb overload. (thats hard for me to say because i love carbs).\n\nthe meal just started off on the wrong foot. i hate spicy food, and i have a weak tolerance. i ordered the <mark>HH Original</mark> which is <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, fresh tomato, fresh spinach, roasted red pepper cream and two basted eggs. all this over the biscuits and then over a huge pile of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. reading this on the menu, there is no spice - safe for me to eat. not so fast... when the plate comes it is decorated in a red sauce (which i was falsely led to believe was red pepper cream) and took a nice big taste of it and turned out to be hot sauce. it sent my taste buds into a frenzy and i really wish they would just garnish the plate with the actual red pepper cream instead of adding the hot sauce to the plate. it really ruined my taste buds for the rest of the meal. \n\noverall, just disappointed. not worth all the fuss.", 
            "this restaurant is located on the 2nd floor of the quad. they're open 24hrs so if it's late in the night, this is one of the options you have. decor is rustic with a lot of farming decorations.\n\nour order:\n<mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>: ($16.99) <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> w/ fresh spinach, <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs served on a fresh split biscuit with griddled <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>\n<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> tower: ($17.50) <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> stacked w/ <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>, hot maple caramel reduction and crowned with fried leeks\nkiwi watermelon lemonade: $5.50\niced pistachio mocha: $6.99\n\nwarning: portions here are huge!! it wasn't on man vs. food for a reason! i totally forgot how large the dishes are here and ordered too much as we were starving. first thing that came out of my mouth as it was placed in front of us, \"omg. what did we just do?!\" as we were trying to tackle the dishes, we were watching other tables make the same mistake as we did and to hear their gasps were hilarious. we and most of the tables around us had to take the remainder of our orders to go. you have been warned!\n\ni wasn't a fan of the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> that they're so famous for as i didn't really taste the sage and the batter was really thick. since the chicken is covered in sauces, it's not going to be crispy so it's basically a bunch of mush when you dig into it. i had ordered the waffle tower and was surprised that the bacon was actually inside the waffle! i thought it would be layered between the waffles or bits sprinkled around.. but nope! very nicely toasted so it had the slight crunch that i enjoy in my waffles (but still soft and airy on the inside). i also liked the biscuit in the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> as it was quite flavorful, soft, and slightly crumbly. both dishes were merely ok in their entirety though.\n\nin the iced pistachio mocha, you're able to taste the pistachio but since i love the flavor, i would've liked it if it was stronger. it's mostly a sweet drink though so wouldn't say it's strong in the caffeine department. \n\nwhat i'd definitely would come back for is the kiwi watermelon lemonade. it's so refreshing and sounds like a weird combination, but it's so good! i had the non-alcoholic version but next time i'll try their alcoholic one (if it's not too early in the day though).\n\nthe waitress that assisted us was cheery and friendly. we came here on a friday afternoon around 2pm so it wasn't very crowded. fairly easy to flag someone down when we needed something.\n\nhaving tried their famous dishes, i wouldn't order them again as there are so many other options to try. hopefully i'll remember to share a dish the next time i come though!",

            "honestly, i am not a breakfast person. never liked pancakes because every time i eat them i feel like i am chewing styrofoamey nothingness that sucks so fucking bad that you must add aunt jemima and butter to it to make them somewhat edible.  \n\nhowever, the dilemma is that my better half loves breakfast and so, we compromise and usually have brunch... with bottomless mimosas and/or bloody mary's  to wash that styrofoam down. so, when we were in vegas recently and she suggested that we eat at hash house a go go (hhagg) at the linq before leaving las vegas like nick cage, i was like, \"of course honey\" because you know, happy wife... yadda yadda yadda. \n\nwhen we showed up at high noon like clueless morons that get shot by stray gunfire at a shootout, we were totally ambushed by the 45-minute wait. we should have thought it through that a lot of people would be grabbing a bite to eat before heading back to their not-so-sinful cities... damn that hangover...  speaking of hangover, if you get to the end of my review, i have a treat for you...\n\nanyways, i gave the server my name and after receiving a plastic laminated number card, we headed out to kill some time by exploring the stores at the linq promenade, which felt a lot like the grove in los angeles sans a trolley and actual worthwhile stores to spend money at. this place looks much better at night, kind of like that girl/guy from drai's or hakkasan that you somehow end up waking up next to. \n\nby the time we got back to hhagg, we waited another 5 minutes and then our number was called. then they do this weird fucking thing where they make you stand on a red rug in the middle of the restaurant. all i can say is that, it was weird just standing there. \n\nafter a few minutes we were seated and our awesome hipster-bearded server, andrew, served us. we ended up sharing the most popular dish that was purported to be a new york times favorite on the menu... the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles. \n\nlet me repeat - we shared this shit. \n\nthis thing was humongous. it came with two jurassic-sized <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breasts with waffles that had <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark> cooked into them that was then topped with a hot maple reduction, and fried leeks... all this stuff was stacked into a giant tower that was all skewered together with a rosemary spear and a freaking steak knife. \n\ntruly amazing... all for less than $20! we ended up getting the tractor iced coffee for around $3 and this was always refilled promptly by andrew and he even gave us a to-go cup for our 4th helping of iced coffee when we were leaving. \n\ni've had chicken and waffles elsewhere. i've done the fancy at bouchon and of course the not-so-fancy at roscoe's. but honestly, i have never enjoyed chicken and waffles to the point that i literally sounded like i was having an orgasm as i ate and after i ate because i was moaning so much from the tasty food and from being so full. oooooh! ohhhhhhhhhh! oh gawd! \n\neverything was tasty. the batter of the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was perfect and adding bacon to the waffles made a world of a difference. and the leeks! holy smokes were they fucking delicious!\n\nlook, people that give hhagg a bad review are \"hhaggs\" that ended up not getting the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles. stick to what they are good at. that is like going to lawry's prime rib and complaining that their spinning salad sucks. of course it's going to fucking suck dipshit, that's why they spin it. \n\nlook, this place is open 24/7 so take a break from drinking, macking, gambling, bringing-your-homies-down-because-you-lost-all-your-wages-on-the-1st-night-like-a-chump-and-got-a-cash-advance-from-your-credt-card-with-28%-interest, and/or sucking-your-gut-in... and just go-go to hash house a go go. it will be the best decision you make. just anticipate a wait if you go during peak hours.\n\n* so i referenced the hangover earlier... the following is a true story. i went to the roscoe's chicken & waffles in south los angeles off manchester and a brother came up to me and literally said, \"hey i saw your hairy ass penis in that movie! too-da-loooooo...\"  damn that ken jeong. damn you!", 
            "if you're a tourist and you're looking for a typical american breakfast/brunch experience, that's definitely the place. nearly every item on the menu is too heavy, too big or too sugary to manage to eat it all. \n\nbut first things first, the line for the tables is extremely long. i mean like 40 minutes at least. however, you can easily keep yourself amused the whole time by reading letters from famous people who ate there and loved it very much. there's also photos and articles from magazines. after you are called, the waiter leads you into a big room full of people and gives you big printed menu. the place was extremely busy the whole time, but the staff was great and we didn't have to wait too long to order or get food.\n\nas i said before, the choice is overwhelming. really! there's so many options that i could sit there for an hour and i still wouldn't be completely sure what to order. so i started with watermelon kivi lemonade. it was amazing! very sweet, big and colorful and yet refreshing. i drank two of them. and a sweet coffee. so when we left i was on sugar rush :d. for breakfast we both decided on farm benedict. mine was a bit on the lighter side, with <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, fresh tomato, fresh spinach, potatoes and roasted red pepper cream but my fiance went crazy and chose the version with <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark>, market yellow tomato, spinach, potatoes and barb' que cream. <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark>. for breakfast. he's mad. the other reviews certainly don't lie, the portions are enormous. i honestly cannot imagine a person that would eat it whole. we could share one and we probably would still left some of it. the dish itself is a big mix of everything you could possibly want for breakfast all in one, layer after layer and topped wit crazy amount of sauce. it's a strange mix of flavors. i loved it but it was so heavy i can't imagine eating something like that more often than twice a month. \n\nthe prices weren't very high and we had a great time there, laughing, looking disbelievingly at our dishes, taking pictures. the place is always full of tourists so nobody cares. definitely a must visit!",

            "awesome, ate here yesterday scrambled eggs with <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark> and avocado to die for, peach jam was a must try i don't even usually use jam!  who would have thought, our server bri was amazing good job girl"

            "a good place to go to soak up your morning hangover.  the portions are huge and everything is oversized.  our friends wanted to come here while in vegas because they had seen it on man vs. food (or one of those shows) and we didn't even have to second guess why it was on the show after walking to our table.  our friends settled on <mark>French Toast</mark> and granola pancakes which were literally the size of tractor tires as they were described on the menu!  dh and i each got the farm scrambles, i the bacon, avocado, swiss, and onion one which was delicious and him the <mark>Ham, Spinach & Cheddar</mark>, and spinach which he didn't enjoy as much as mine.  everyone was satisfied with their meals because there was complete silence as we attacked them!  the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles looked delicious and i'll have to get it next time.  juice and coffee were good, service was good, all worth a return trip.", 
            "this place is great! we came here on a thursday morning around 11am and had a 15 min wait not too bad. our server was great very friendly and offered good suggestions on what to order. i had the <mark>Ham, Spinach & Cheddar</mark>, spinach scramble with mashed potatos and it was bomb! the biscuits were my favorite part sooooo fluffy. the only negative was waiting for the actual order it took a long time for breakfast about 30min. but they were pretty packed. we will be back again the next time we are back in vegas."

            "some travelers get their kicks from group tours and antiquing.  i get mine from finding great places to eat breakfast.  i'm not really sure how i began my love affair with artery-clogging hash browns and german chocolate pancakes, but i don't forsee it ending any time soon.  i'm of the opinion that the very best breakfasts weigh down your tummy like a bowling ball made of sausage, which is probably why i had such a blast at hash house-a-go-go.\n\non the recommendation of a friend who used to live in vegas, my girlfriend and i ate at hash house on the second day of our recent vacation.  i ordered eggs mixed with <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark>, sundried tomatoes and (i believe) basil, served with a homemade biscuit and fried <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  i've had <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark> and sundried tomatoes together on pizza but never mixed in eggs.  <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> was every bit as tasty as i'd hoped it would be.  the fried <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> took me back to the pre-microwave days of my childhood, when my mom would reheat the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> she'd made the day before in a pan filled with melted butter.  the biscuit, which was significantly denser than i'd thought it would be, felt like it weighed half a pound.  if i'd eaten it with butter and jelly, i might not have felt very fondly about it.  however, on our table was a small metal tin filled with delicious jellied peaches, which turned out to be the perfect topping for hash house's ridiculously heavy pastries.\n\nhash-house-a-go-go offers friendly service and excellent breakfast food served at reasonable prices.  for me, the best part of my hash house experience was watching my tiny girlfriend try to eat a giant pancake that was at least 18\" in diameter.  she literally begged me to help her finish it but i was halfway to a food coma myself.  you win this round, breakfast!  but i'll be back.  sooner or later, i'm always back for more.", 
            "i had never been to hh and i think i've figured out why. if i wanted that much food i would go to one of the brunch buffets and get unlimited mimosas. \n\nthe portions are huge. like don't expect a calorie intake less than 5,500 calories. even the drinks are huge. hh is known for its bloody marys, minimum size is 20 oz. \n\nwhile i didn't love my scrambled eggs with sun dried tomatoes, <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark>, and basil with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and a biscuit, others were raving about their biscuits and gravy and friend chicken. other disappointments are the soggy toast, not crispy potatoes (even though they are famous for the crispy potatoes), over medium eggs being really runny. the homemade peach jam was delicious. needless to say no one cleaned their plate. the bloody maria was typically 20 oz., very spicy, had a green bean, two olives, and a pickle. good but not great. \n\nservice was very slow on bringing drinks, the food, refills, anything. we watched as she had to make six stops after taking our request and actually doing it. \n\nafter almost an hour wait, then slow service and not great food, i'd say not again. neat that man vs. food gave the place great reviews, probably more for the quantity. and even with the quantity, you are still paying for it (on average $20-$30 for breakfast per person).", 
            "i've eaten here 3 times. it's become a staple each time we visit vegas and stay at the ip. we first saw it featured on man vs. food for their huge portions and they are not kidding. i've made my meals last 3-4 servings. i've tried the mango-coconut pancake, the <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark> scramble, and most recently the veggie hash. all awesome. their biscuits are divine and about the size of a large softball.\n \nthere is always a wait so anticipate that or get there early. the value is very reasonable considering your meal is about 4 serving sizes. i've never had their fancy cocoas and coffee drinks but they always look good on the menu. service is always friendly and prompt considering the wait to be seated.  \n\na can't-miss breakfast place.",

            "so unlike wicked spoon, this place is ridiculouss in portion sizes. huge portions that will stuff an entire family! \n\nwe got the chicken and waffles and the duck. the chicken was dry but the waffles were okay. i personally don't like <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> of the two together so i didn't like it, but i saw many people eating it.\n\nthe duck was delicious and super juicy!! i loved the potato/sweet potato mash they included with it. the only thing i hated about this was the <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark> that was just put there. i didn't feel like the flavors mixed and the <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark> literally made me want to gag. \n\nprobably won't come back because its a one time type of thing. but it was a great experience!", 
            "great first experience had me back a second time in a weekend! first of all, it is true, be ready to share! don't be a pig! and be ready to wait as well on some mornings. the wait sucks, but the place is good! the line to the hostess stand is usually crowded with people waiting, so make sure to go up front and talk to someone. most likely people are waiting and not in line. \n\nonce seated, the friendly server got our drink orders in and out to us in a jiffy! i had the chorizo skillet - pretty tasty and huge! my wife had the sundried tomato, basil & <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark> scramble. we also had a traditional buttermilk pancake. was really good! the coffee hit the spot as well, forget the swill at the buffet, this was a good bean! wife had the bloody and it was fantastic in all its greatness. really tasty too!\n\ni noticed alot of people taking pics of the gigantic plates of food and were laughing at the idea of actually finishing the food in front of them. so share if ya can. i did not finish the feast, but as i rolled out <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark>, there was a smaller line of hungry people that were pissed because i was grinning from ear to ear in full happiness! \n\ntry it at least once.", 
            "husband and i were craving a good breakfast and it was after 11am. i enjoyed the <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark>/ sundried tomato/ basil scramble w/ their crispy yum potatoes which had lots of diced red onions and bell peppers mixed in.  loooved it!  my jaw dropped when i saw my husband's plate of monster pancake w/ blueberries and candied walnuts. i actually said, \"holy sh--\"  as a genuine response to it. plenty of good coffee and attentive service as well. the place was hopping and there was a 20 min wait before we got seated.  \nwas surprised that this popular spot is located up some escalators inside the imperial palace casino. don't think we would ever have found it otherwise if it weren't for yelp. would definitely come back to try some other items.", 
            "vegas's best breakfast ever!!!! ginormous portions!  i had a mango coconut pancake that was even good reheated in the hotel microwave!  the pancake is at least 10\" in diameter.  i might have finished a quarter of it at the table. might.  i did finish the rest later tho!  never thought i'd eat a leftover pancake......\n\n i always get the goat-cheese salad too cuz i'm a sucker for <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark> everywhere i go.... its warm yumminess that doesnt even make mii mind the fact that i'm eating vegetables ;)  everything is fresh and scrumptious!\n\nmy dad got a skillet that was also big enough to feed two.  the biscuits come with basically everything, also ridiculously huge in a good way!  they're about 4-5\" tall and come out fresh and piping hot with a sprig of rosemary planted in the middle.  (u just have to see the portion sizes to know how big beautiful and wonderful all the food there is!!!!", 
            "hungry? you better be if going to the hash house! stayed at imperial palace for a recent convention and ate at the hh each of the three mornings. tried to give another place a shot but it was as if a giant pork covered magnet was pulling me in.\n\ntheir coffee rivals any starbucks/coffee house. seriously. it's hot, it's dark and it's good stuff. no need for sugar or cream, just man up and drink it like it was meant to be drunk.\n\nmy first breakfast was a chorizo, jalepeno, <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark> hash and it was fantastic. potatoes in the hash are perfectly crisp. over easy eggs were cooked perfectly and served with a fluffy biscuit and fruit. wonderful, homemade jam sits at every table.\n\nsecond day i went with the basic which is 2 eggs, potatoes, fruit and a biscuit. i added bacon for an extra $2.50. i probably should have left the bacon off as it was a little disappointing. i know, i know. bacon? disappointing? not sure how those two words could ever be uttered in the same breath but my two strips were melded together and a little overdone. reminded me of the bacon in the cafeteria of the hospital i work in. pre-cooked and piled into a metal pan and heated on the grill for each order.\n\nlast morning was a saturday morning and the place was slammed so i sat at the bar. i ordered the biscuits and gravy breakfast which comes with two eggs, fruit <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. i really wanted to order according to menu and try the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> but those crispy potatoes are sooooo good that i made the substitution for the mashed. tasty gravy with nice big chunks of sausage!\n\nall the dishes are nicely arranged and garnished. each morning my biscuit came with a sprig of rosemary sticking out of it. nice touch.\n\nthe atmosphere is pleasant with good music being piped in. wait staff is friendly and service is fast. on the morning i sat at the bar for breakfast, the bartender asked if i drank and i replied to the affirmative. (hello!?  is this not vegas??!!) next thing i knew there was a gratis mimosa sitting next to my coffee. \n\nyep, i'm a fan!", 
            "this is good. you should come here when in vegas. sat at the bar/ counter. this place is a souped up version of the long standing diners that feed the working, drunk and unruly of las vegas. \nthe biscuit was huge, the portion of the <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark>, mushroom, and sun dried tomato scrambler i had was generous. the counter guy seemed swamped and a bit peeved when the wait staff asked him to do extra things or when i requested a copy of my receipt. get him some help back there.", 
            "located on the second floor inside the imperial palace casino on the strip.\n\nwe came for an quick bite after catching the human nature show.  our server asked us if it was our first time eating at hash house.  we said yes.  he warned us that portion size was huge.\n\nknowing that, we opted for the \"just grazing\" section of the menu as it was around 9:30pm.\n\nhubby got the bbq pork ribs and i had the fried green tomato stack.  i wished i had taken a picture of my order.  four slices of cornmeal crusted green tomatoes with <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark> and chicken breast meat stuffed in the barrel.  and stacked on top of a huge watermelon wedge.  it was very good.  i enjoyed <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> of tomatoes with the chicken breast meat.\n\nhubby's pork ribs were tangy, tender, and sweet and the meat fell off the bone. sat on top of some red potatoes.  good combo too.\n\nbeverages included homemade lemonade and the kiwi strawberry watermelon which was way too sweet.", 
            "two words: food poisoning!!!\n\nthis is my bf's favorite breakfast place. i had never been. the wait was about an hour. he told me it would be worth it. not.\n\ni ordered scrambled eggs with <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark> that came with a side of potatoes and warm biscuits. it looked delicious. it lacked seasoning. i don't know if it was the <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark> or the strawberry spread that i put on my biscuits, but less than an hour after walking out of there i had terrible stomach cramps. \n\ni bought pepto bismol at a convenience store and took one after another to help with the stomach pains. i was stuck in my hotel the rest of the day & night.  it ruined my time in vegas.\n\ni really think it was the strawberry spread that had been sitting on the table. maybe it was contaminated with bacteria from lack of refrigeration.", 
            "without a second thought, i would have given them a 5-star, if not for the long wait time after ordering the food.\n\nunfortunately, like most breakfast places, you cannot make a reservation. so, you'll have to come in, write your name down and then wait! we stayed at the quad and wanted to come here for breakfast on a saturday morning. when called them from our room, they said the wait time was 30min. so we came down to write our names to get on the wait list. and when we did, the lady said that the wait time was going to be 45min. we waited.\n\nfinally, our names were called and we took our hungry selves inside the restaurant. here is what we ordered:\n - coffee\n - scrambles (smoked chicken, sundried tomato pesto, spinach and <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark>)\n - waffle\n - pancakes\n\nwe got the food 50 minutes after placing the order. so frustrating. but the meal turned out to be fantastic. the portion is big enough for 2 people to split. 6 of us split 3 dishes and we left the restaurant with a full stomach and a satisfied breakfast.", 
            "quite worried about the large portions after reading the reviews, but the sun-dried tomato with <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark> scrambled egg omelette came in a manageable quantity, and was definitely enough to kick-start a day in vegas. \nfluffy scrambled egg was what you'd expect from any good quality american breakfast, and the hazelnut mocha overflowing with goodness was a nice complement. \nthough the line to get in was long and it was a busy morning, once in the servers were prompt, polite and attentive. definitely worth a visit if you stay on the strip.", 
            "literally, just got back from dining here & it was delicious!  went solo & grabbed a seat at the bar as soon as i walked in - although the place was packed!!  crystal & mark were my bartendars/servers & they were awesome!  had the sundried-tomato, basil & <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark> scramble with potatoes & a biscuit.  and what meal would be complete without a pineapple mimosa - yum!  it was so good i'm going back & taking my boyfriend with me!", 
            "guess the food is better when you eat in?\n\nstayed at the rio with my family and my dog so someone had to stay behind with the pup while everyone else procured breakfast. this seems to be the only real breakfast place in the hotel/casino so options were pretty limited.... kind of like the menu.\n\n if you want <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>, bloody marys garnished with a deconstructed sandwich, etc, then 4  stars are probably well deserved.\n\nmy parents ordered the basic breakfast (one with scrambled eggs the other with over easy, both with sausages) and i ordered the sun dried <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark>, & basil scramble with an extra side of chicken sausage.\n\nin all honesty, i was starving so didn't realize a the stuff i missed until we got our to go order to the room.  first of all, all our orders were supposed to come with biscuits and fruit and we received a total of 1 biscuit and no fruit.  second of all, i didn't even mind that there weren't enough biscuits because the giant hockey puck they tried to pass off as a biscuit was a dense mass that tasted like it was made yesterday.\n\nwe all chose fried potatoes which looked sad and possibly prepared at the same time the biscuit was made.  i didn't eat mine but my dog seemed to like it.\n\nalso i'm pretty sure (receipt confirmed it) that my chicken sausage (which they do admit is in a pork casing) was actually pork sausage and was a little over seasoned for my tastes.\n\nlastly, the eggs. had such high hopes for these. the scrambled eggs were either not seasoned and or not eggs? they were dense and oddly textured saved only a little by the sundried tomatoes, scant amount of fresh basil, and few crumbles of <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark>.  full disclosure, my dog wouldn't eat the eggs unless it had been touching sausage or had some cheese attached. \noverall our breakfast was disappointing. other than the forgotten items though the service was fantastic (hence the 2 stars rather than 1). all the staff members were so friendly and nice! the place was well decorated and very clean.\n\nif they can get the kitchen sorted out i may consider eating here again but this place is definitely out of rotation on any future vegas trips - even if we stay at the rio again.", 
            "we came here because we have been to the san diego one and loved it. beware, they get very crowded at all times. but that is pretty much the same story for any good food place in vegas. the menu is a little smaller than the normal hash house but the food was delicious. i got the farm scramble with tomatoes, <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark> and basil. i really really enjoyed that. the <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark> was the perfect pairing for it. we also got their bloodies- the bacon one. i liked it but it was pretty spicy which i did not expect. it didn't say it was going to be spicy on the menu like some of the others did. it was harder to drink for me. also, their bloody mary menu is very tiny compared to the normal hash house which was a little disappointing. all in all, the food and service were really good just don't expect a great selection when it comes to bloodies (something they are known for).", 
            "went here around 11ish the morning after christmas and the wait for a party of 4 was about 30 minutes or so.  not too bad considering how packed it was!\na solid 5 stars for the food!!  we ordered the chorizo hash, the bacon/avocado scramble with griddled <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, sundried tomato/<mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark> scramble with crispy potatoes, and the brown sugar banana pancake (a must-try!).  the portions were huge and awesome.  the 4 of us were starving when we came in and barely finished half of all the food we ordered.  definitely recommend sharing!\nminus 1 star for the waiting area (very cramped and not a lot of space to sit or stand while you wait), noisy (the hostess screams the name of each party as tables become available and it can get annoying...also difficult to hear her over all the people...they should use a microphone/speaker system).  also, the restaurant itself was kinda dim/dark and not the cleanest.  service was okay, not great, not horrible, but got the job done.\noverall, a great brunch spot with great food (and portions), if you don't mind all the noise!", 
            "this was by far the best place we ate at during a weekend in vegas. we wanted something other than denny's or a buffet, so we hiked it up to the linq where hash house lives.\n\nthe place was packed. and i mean people in every nook and cranny waiting for a table. they told us it'd be an hour. well we walked here from mgm so we said, fine we will wait. it was a bit chaotic and somewhat frustrating. alas, they have a tiny bar, maybe 8-9 seats. we were watching it like a hawk, bam 2 people got up and we were on it like white on rice. so if you can get a seat there it's much better than waiting an hour.\n\nthe bartender was sweet and really great. they were obviously very busy but continued to talk to us. we both got mimosas which were definitely not shy on champagne. they were 8 bucks...not bad. \n\nmy wife ordered the eggs with <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark>, spinach, etc. it was delicious and of course a huge portion. i ordered the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>...whoa! this thing was massive!!! it had a giant biscuit, maybe a whole chicken, bacon, tomato, <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> (lots and lots of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>) and the most amazing chipotle sauce. that sauce was divine. there was no chance in hell i was finishing this. i didn't eat again until we got back to nj around 1:30am and i still wasn't all that hungry. \n\noverall, great service at the bar, fantastic flavorful food and decently priced drinks. the chaos of the line to get in is why i knock off a star, it was a mess. but that is mostly because of other people not the restaurant but i wish they had buzzers for people instead of slips of paper. when we come back to vegas this will definitely be on the list of stops!", 
            "i've been to hash house on two separate occasions now. my first visit was for breakfast on a previous trip to las vegas, and my most recent visit was for dinner. \n\nthe restaurant is located on the upper level of the linq hotel & casino. the decor is what i'd call a modern farmhouse style. picture lots of wood and rustic elements mixed with silver metals. i like that particular style, so i felt right at home. \n\nthe portions here are enormous! neither my husband nor i could could finish even half of our plates during either visit. the dishes are shareable, which i highly suggest if you're coming here with children. they offer a large variety of menu items. a few of the items we've tried from the menu are chicken & waffles, traditional pancake/egg/bacon breakfast, grilled salmon with <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark> <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, and blue cheese stuffed burger and fries. all were very delicious! \n\none thing to make note of if you plan to enjoy some of these huge portions yourself... breakfast usually has a long wait, while lunch and dinner do not. enjoy!"

            "been to the san diego hash house a few times already, so i knew what to expect when coming to this one, other than it being nestled in a smokey old hote/casino, but that pretty much describes every restaurants that's stuck on the las vegas strip. \n\na vey stark contrast in design from the very san diego hillcrest location, where there's an outdoor patio and warm earth tones and sometimes a dj on the weekend, to a very cafeteria interior. \n\nsame items on the menu, breakfast is the way to go, when you go to hash house a go go. i also recommend going when you are ready to inhale a huge portion and probably make this your meal of the day. these are generous portions. since we were in town for meetings and a tradeshow, felt it was the safer route to just have the freshly squeezed tangerine juice, god bless vitamin c, you know you'll need some when you're walking through the smokey casinos and doing a little imbibe during your time in vegas. \n\nwent the \"healthy\" route with the farm scrambled with <mark>Ground Turkey, Mushroom & Broccoli</mark> and mushroom along with their addictive crispy potatoes that are perfectly crunchy and charred. oh but there's more, a homemade  biscuit is included with this meal. suppose if you need the extra iron, there's a sage leaf that's included as a garnish that you could try to gnaw off on. \n\na friend also got the frisbee sized pancakes, didnt try them, but he seemed to enjoy them and again did i mention frisbee sized?\n\nwe all did a good job with stuffing our bellys as much as we could. service is decent, food comes out quick. on another day when you don't have any business meetings, etc i'd say get a cocktail, i've had them before and just a nice way to top off a soon to come food coma. \n\ngood alternative when you're sick of buffets and any other non descript restaurant that may be in your hotel for breakfast or brunch."

            "after the cher concert we walked over to the imperial palace starving and decided to try this place out:\nfirst off, the service in a word - sucked!! there were no smiles well of course if you count the 17yr old bus boy flirting with me... it took forever for our waitress to take our order and just as long for her to bring us our drinks. for about 8 minutes there were actually no employees to be seen out on the floor, all us customers were just looking around hoping an employee appears...\nthe place is alot smaller than what i thought it would be, anyhow  we thought the food was good. on the table was the cheeseburger,chicken sandwich,grilled chicken breast over <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, polenta & w/grilled carrots (i love carrots!!!), and the crab cakes with potatoes & veggies. stuffed seems to be the trend in this restaurant cause thats what we were. \ni didn't care for the biscuits everyone seems to love....i like dinner rolls better than biscuits anyways...\nall in all i would try this place again most likely in the other location and i will only go if i am terribly hungry....", 
            "i first heard about this place on man vs. food (big shock). i didn't realize that there were two locations- the one on sahara, where mvf was taped, and this on, inside imperial palace. we were within walking distance of this one.\nwe made our way through the reno-esque imperial palace casino, went up the escalator, and arrived at a near-empty restaurant on a friday night. we were seated immediately. \n\ni ordered the chicken and waffles. it was huge, and the waffles had whole strips of bacon in it. yes, whole strips! sadly, those were the highlights. the chicken didn't have much seasoning, unless you count the rosemary skewer that held everything together. rosemary's a really strong herb, and i tasted it in every bite. i wasn't crazy about the reduction, either.\n\nmy husband had a <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breast with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. frankly, i liked his food more.\n\nthe service was great, and the waffles made great leftovers the next day. but otherwise, i left kinda disappointed. i wouldn't rule out coming back here when i'm in las vegas again, but i'll order something else.", 
            "i dunno. i want to love this place, i do. i love the concept, the atmosphere, the ginormous portions and even the staff was super friendly! but, i dunno, really, all it comes down to is the food. and it was just meh for me.\n\ni got the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, eggs, biscuits. the food wasn't hot, it was lukewarm, a turn off already. the biscuits were good but not anything i couldn't have gotten from kfc. <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> were meh, whatever. and the chicken was just meh too, neither crispy nor soggy - a weird in between and flavor wasn't bland it was just again, whatever.\n\ni also got the pistachio mocha, which at first tasted soooo bitter!!! but once i stirred everything together it was quite delightful and had a hint of pistachio flavor, which i loved especially cause i'd never had anything like it. \n\nprice: a\npotion: a+\nservice: a\natmosphere: b\ntaste: b-/ c", 
            "omg ! this place is out of control. the food excellent, the service awesome, and location ? well let's just say i walked past it before being redirected by a friendly security guard who politely told me to turn around and look up at the sign on the ceiling. okay it was a long night at the ti beforehand. overall this place is great. now i know there is one in san diego, we'll be there. next time we will share plates due to the outrageous portions on their platters. that's right, not plates but platters. i had my favorite biscuits and gravy with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, enough to feed a small army. others in our party had pancakes, of which they offer several different kinds from classic buttermilk to snickers bar, and the andy sage's <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> plate. not a complaint in the group of ten, except not being able to finish. can't say enough except bring a group to share with and a huge appetite.", 
            "this place was fun to go to in a group but unfortunately not for the small appetite or anyone who doesn't like their food options to touch much.  heh-heh!\n\nthe house mimosa made with tangerine juice was very tasty, and my co-diners told me the blt mary was really good, too.\n\nevery platter (even a simple caesar salad) came out big enough for 2+ people and arranged in some unique design.  (with my friend's chicken and waffles, it was like a tower.)  i had the biscuits and gravy.  i didn't want <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and had hoped to give that part to my husband, because they said they couldn't substitute for anything else.  but i didn't know they surround the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> with biscuits, cover the entire plate with gravy, and then toss the scrambled eggs on top of the whole thing, which made giving him the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> impossible.  it was quite a sight!", 
            "i saw the man vs. food episode and made my friends go with me.  i don't think i could've finished the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> by myself.  between the three of us, we had the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, mango flapjacks, and and omelet.  \n\nthe <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> comes with cheese and bacon and is placed on top of a mountain of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  it's so big that it comes with a steak knife.  \n\nthe flapjacks have quarter-sized pieces of mango in them.  i regret saving this for last because we all know how pancakes are the next day.  they were delicious, but we couldn't finish them.\n\nthe omelet was one of the best i've ever had.  perfect mix of eggs, cheese and avocado. \n\nall three of these came out to about $40.  inexpensive by any standards, especially vegas.  we should've came here two days during our trip.  we would've saved a lot of money in food.", 
            "i came here for one thing and one thing only, the chickens and waffles. i was sold after seeing the picture. it was the #1 thing i had to get when i was in vegas. \n\nlittle did i know that they did not serve it on their late menu. i got sooooooooooo fucking pissed that my gf knew i was being like a kid and throwing a tantrum. what a fail! \n\ni had to make the best out of it so i decided i ended up getting the indianas favorites which came with andys <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, 2 eggs, bacon mashed potatos and a biscuit. \n\nthe <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was awesome. perfectly made and so moist. it wasnt all greasy like the chicken you would get from kfc. if you like bacon, you will love the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>.the gfs blueberry pecan flapjack was delicious and pretty humongous. \n\ntheir 1 lb angus burgers look mighty tempting also as i saw a few tables order them. \n\none of my favorite beers is offered here, arrogant bastard in a 24 oz bottle. gotta love that. \n\nlastly i hated how this hash house location is at imperial palace. this casino is just a complete fail. ghetto as hell. seriously do i have to take 2-3 different elevators just to get to the casino? next time im headed to 2nd hash house location for my chicken and waffles. \n\nthere you have it, 2 reviews in one.", 
            "man vs food ain't got nothin on me!\n\nit took us a while to find this place--we had to go on a long adventure through the \"extravagant\" imperial palace casino to find this place.  hash house was packed, which was a good sign. i'm surprised this many people trudged through the casino to actually eat here.\n\nservice was pretty good, although the ice water tasted pretty gross--it was probably just tap water.  our server was very helpful in taking our orders, since it was our first time and we didn't know what to expect. \n\n i ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with a side of crispy potatoes. man this thing was huge! two breaded and deep-<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breasts sat atop 2 biscuits, bacon, eggs, cheese, <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, and covered in a chipotle sauce. it was messy, down and dirty, and i felt my arteries clog up with each bite--just the way i like it. you've got to eat this right away, otherwise all it all becomes soggy and not as tasty as it could be. after tackling this heavy meal, the tap water wasn't so bad at all. the crispy potatoes weren't that good--they were burned and a little dry. i should've opted for the side of sausage instead.\n\nof course, major food coma is to be expected afterwards--the host commented on how slow we were walking. all of us were dragging our feet as we left. nobody wanted to do anything but just lay around and nap. we ate this meal at around 1pm....9 hours later none of us were hungry yet.",

            "the tagline for the joint is \"twisted farm food,\" but it really should be \"good food writ large,\" with emphasis in the \"large.\" hash house can't do anything small. but that's ok. the quality does not suffer from the size of the potions. \n\ni have had the 1 lb. stuffed burger here multiple times. note: before attempting, skip breakfast & lunch. i get mine stuffed with cheddar & bacon (skipping the avocado), one of three varieties. it comes with a steak knife and a sprig of sage stuck on the top. tip: use the knife; you cannot eat this burger whole. the burger is good beef, cooked just right. the side of fries is huge and they are cooked just right. the drizzle of bbq sauce and the sticks of something add a nice touch. all-in-all, a burger, fries, and a lemonade will run you just over $20 (with tip) and will leave you with a good taste on your tongue, a warm feeling on your belly, and no need to eat for the rest of the day. \n\ni had a breakfast here too, a chicken breast deep fried with a maple glaze, grilled <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> with bacon, and two eggs w/ fruit & a biscuit on the side. once again, the dish was huge. the chicken breast was magnificent. the biscuit was flaky and huge. i could not finish. i passed on the overpriced oj to keep the cost below $15, but once again, this is a meal that can last you the day. \n\nhash house dies not try to be pretentious, like so many strip establishments. it's hearty food, and while the prices seem strip-like (that is, 50% higher just because it's in vegas), the amount you get easily justifies the prices (at least for the food; they must make their nut on drinks, where even soda prices are stratospheric). this is a destination place to ear when you are in vegas.", 
            "omfg.\n\nlike seriously, omfg.\n\ni had to have texted my friend just those four letters at least 5 times because this place was better than i could have imagined.\nthis was seriously one of the best breakfasts i have ever had. ever. \n\nmy boyfriend & i saw this place on one of the tourist channels in the hotel and they mentioned it had been featured on man vs. food. now, we both enjoy watching that show but have never had the opportunity to try one of the places where adam has gorged himself so we knew that we simply had to try this place before we went back home. and in my opinion, it could not have been better.\n\nfirst, i had fairly low expectations for this place because it is in a pretty seedy looking casino on the strip. i mean, i had never even heard of the imperial palace let alone knew that it had such an awesome restaurant hiding inside. also, it was known for having huge portions which typically means to me that the food is going to be just ok.\n\ni was totally wrong.\n\nthe restaurant itself is actually very nice compared to the rest of the casino. it's really spacious and clean, and they play awesome music. also, aside from your average orange juice, they offer tangerine juice. who else does that!? no one, that's who.\nmy boyfriend and i were already loving it just from those two things. \n\nfor breakfast i ordered <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> which i got with two over easy eggs, sausage and the brown sugar banana pancake.\nthat's right. this was no boring old plain whatever pancake with some bananas sliced on top. \nthis was a huge effing pancake with a beautiful crust of brown sugar goodness with at least two whole bananas cooked into the massive cake. omfg.\ndrool. \nthe delicately flavored moist and fluffy cake gently embraced the bananas as they were surrounded by delicious little pockets of crunchy brown sugar. i was a little closer to heaven with each bite. \nthe eggs and sausage were also stellar, perfectly cooked with surprisingly very little grease. i was very impressed.\n\nmy boyfriend chose the man vs. food favorite which was a ridiculous benedict of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and biscuits topped with <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, scrambled eggs, mozzarella cheese and some veggies covered with a chipotle cream sauce. it was huge. definitely the frankenstein's monster of benedicts if i've ever seen it.\nit was also very tasty though. the chicken was delicious, again surprisingly not greasy at all. especially for <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>. the chipotle cream was flavorful with a good amount of heat and all the veggies were super fresh. \n\nthe service was also spectacular. our waitress was super friendly and our food was brought out very promptly, even though she told us that our dishes may not come out at the same time. she told us they don't use heat lamps so they want everything to be served right when it comes out so it gets to you nice and hot. that is fine with me! \nthis place definitely deserves all 5 stars. great service, fantastic ambiance, amazing food and huge portions. \ni will for sure be coming back to this place as soon as i can. \ni would even drive all the way out to vegas again just to come to the hash house, it's that good. next time i have to try the chicken & <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>. \nyes. they have <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>. \nomfg.",

            "as i am sure is the case with many, my boyfriend and i were made aware of this place through the travel channel's man v. food show.  the host visited the hash house a go go on sahara, and he tried the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict.  my boyfriend was hooked--when we went to las vegas at the end of last month, he insisted upon a visit.\n\nfortunately for us, we discovered that there is a second location in the imperial palace, which was right down the street from where we were staying.  in order to check on the times when certain food is served, my boyfriend repeatedly tried to call them with no answer at least the first two times.  \n\nthe restaurant is easy to find at the back of the casino and up a specifically designed escalator.  there is plenty of room to wait with seating for customers, and we only had to wait for about 15 minutes on a sunday afternoon around 12.  the hostess staff, presumably the same group that ignored our phone calls, were a little unprofessional, preferring to congregate and gossip rather than seat patrons or help in the dining room.  \n\nthe atmosphere in this restaurant is terrible.  the walls were covered in this industrial metal sheeting, which made it look like a warehouse.  it also amplified the noise in the room, which would have been invasive even without this design flaw.  it is clear that this restaurant is designed to make people feel uncomfortable enough to eat and leave as quickly as possible.  clearly this worked as no patrons i observed lingered over their ample meals.\n\nwaitstaff was friendly, but service was a little oblivious.  it took 20 minutes to actually receive a bar drink, and i think we saw our waitress three times during the entire experience.  we also lacked silverware.\n\nthe food was pretty good.  the sizes definitely live up to the hype.  i ordered the chicken salad sandwich, and it was huge.  the bread was the best part--it was homemade and thickly sliced.  the chicken should have been in smaller chunks, though, and it was a little tough, however, <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> of light mayo and tomatos really did add something to the sandwich.  the side salad had clearly been sitting in the fridge a bit too long and should have been discarded rather than served, but the cucumber dressing was a very refreshing accent.  \n\nthe best entree by far was the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict, which did not disappoint.  it was huge, layered with <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, eggs, fried cheese, <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, and topped with chipolte cream sauce.  it was an amazing combination and a huge entree.\n\nthis is definitely worth a visit, but it may not be worth a return.",

(i swear this restaurant is for people with big appetite and with 3 stomachs). sister said she didn't like the meatloaf entree (too bad). other sister ordered their giant pancake with sausages and scrambled eggs with a side of crispy potatoes. i mean giant pancake. i think it was 1 ft in diameter. it was huge, at least 1/4 inch thick. she of course didn't finish it. i ordered <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and biscuit (i can't remember the name but as seen on man v food). soo good.\n\nhuge biscuits with two huge <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, on a bed of perfect mashed potates and strips of bacon and some special sauce. don't forget to try their homemade jam. super delicious. scoop some unto the biscuit or on some potatoes or on some <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. try the homemade jam. \n\nthe table next to us were a party of 4 huge dudes. macho douchebags with their artificial tan and muscles bulging from their tight ed hardy shirts. they could probably eat everything on the menu. anyways, they all ordered burgers. they didn't finish it, and wrapped their half burgers to-go. another table of big dudes order the chicken and waffles and had half their food boxed togo. \n\nso, a lot of food. not expensive. the hostess told us (a party of 4) would have to wait about 40 minutes, which was totally fine. only a 30 minute wait, which flew by b/c we were reading the menu. \n\n i gotta try the chicken and waffles next time! or maybe the <mark>French Toast</mark> or a burger. eeeek",

            "upstairs at imperial palace, the digs aren't quite as funky (in a good way) as the location on sahara, but the food is great.  sage fried  cicken benedict starts with a fluffy biscuit then layers on <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, fried eggs, bacon, and <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and then tops it all off with chipotle sauce for an outstanding meal that, in this case, served three easily when accompanied by a banana brown sugar pancake that was at least 12 inches in diameter.  but first things first... start the meal with one of their famous and fabulous bloody marys or a house tangerine mimosa to get off on the right foot.  this is a great place for an unusual breakfast or brunch.  beware!  all meal portions are huge.", 
            "i didn't waste any time going to hash house a go go right when i got off the plane.  i was hungry!!  and i wanted a big meal that wasn't a buffet.  plus, it was one meal that i really wanted to get it over with since it basically kicked off what was my food tour through the vegas strip and was the biggest and most intimidating meal that i would encounter.\n\nsince i've already had their <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles and <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, i went with a change of pace and tried their <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> benedict.  and just like the other two dishes, once i saw my waitress bringing it to my table, i immediately started cracking up because it was so enormous (http://bit.ly/1kicqlz).   it's a loaded plate - <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> w/ market yellow tomato, spinach, bbq cream, topped w/ scrambled eggs all over two biscuits and a griddled <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  the <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> was good. if you've ever had tonkatsu at a japanese restaurant, it's pretty much the same deal, only 10x's bigger.  and i did pretty well, managed to kill the <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> and left one biscuit behind.\n\nwashed it all down with their house special kiwi watermelon lemonade (http://bit.ly/1ywcgru).  a friend of mine recommended it and even my waitress said it went well with everything on the menu.  they were right!  very refreshing and colorful too!!\n\nthis experience was a lot better than my last visit 9 months ago.  probably because this time i opted for a table and not a seat at the bar.  the service was definitely better as my waitress was very enthusiastic.  also the $10 restaurant.com coupon helped make it a good experience too!  so good service, big food, and full stomach.  it was a great way to start off my food tour on the strip.", 
            "i had a chance to eat here on my last trip to vegas.  the place was packed on a weekday morning around 10 am, so i had  to wait for half an hour to get seated.   service was fairly prompt, and the food came out in decent amount of time considering how packed the place was.\n\nthe food was decent, but nothing really overwhelmingly good.  i ordered the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash, with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  this place is supposed to be the 'hash house' so i was expecting this to be knocked out of the park.   the food was served very lukewarm.  it wasn't anywhere near being hot.  i was disappointed by this and informed the server.  she offered to bring more <mark>Corned Beef</mark>, which there was no way to refuse.  soon after she brought a full side plate of <mark>Corned Beef</mark> which at least equaled the portion served in the meal.  shortly after that a manager came by to apologize for the initial dissatisfaction with the food.\n\nso at least they made a serious effort to address their cold food, but seriously when i pay 14  bucks for a breakfast entree it should be frigging perfect.", 
            "size matters. that's all i'm saying. because for all of the ugly stereotypes about america, and there are plenty, this is the one that i find least offensive.\n\ngas guzzling suvs? can't stand 'em. big hair? totally 80s. urban sprawl? saddening. but give me a 18\" plate with 5 lbs. of waffles, sage-rubbed <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, maple syrup, <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>... and i'll stand up and sing \"proud to be an american\" with the best of them.\n\nloved this place in san diego, and this location is just as good. not to mention, after you lose your @$$ in the casinos (and look around... trust me... you will...) you can have a $15 lunch entree, split in half, and take leftovers home. that big.", 
            "this place is all about quantity, not quality.  if you're starving, come here.  if you want good food, go elsewhere.\n\ni had biscuits and gravy.  i used to live in the south, so i know what this dish (which, honestly, is just a heart attack on a plate) is all about.  the restaurant got the heart attack part right, but totally missed out on the part that makes the heart attack worth it.  the sausage gravy was chalky and flavorless.  the biscuits were cold.  perplexingly, the biscuits and gravy were served on a massive bed of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  now, i love <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, but it just didn't fit in here.  i ate less than a quarter of it.  no one else at my table finished their meals either, and we all agreed that it was pretty mediocre.  \n\nservice was much better than i ever would've guessed, which is the only reason that they get two stars.", 
            "prepare to share!  they weren't kidding when they said the portions were huge.  i should have planned better after food cruising on the way to my seat and seeing the size of the plates. they are enormous!  that aside, they are creative!  i posted a pic of the menu. there were at least 5 things in the running for my breakfast. i landed on the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles and my bf had <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>.  when they arrived we were blown away (see pics).  \n\nmy chicken was cooked very well. the batter was crispy and not too heavy. the waffles were packed with bacon in them. but the best were the strips of fried leeks that graced the top and the drizzle of syrup. my only complaint is that i wanted more syrup which could have easily been addressed had i asked my super friendly waiter. \n\nthe benny was also huge and very well presented. the biscuits were warm and wonderful. they were dense and biscuit experts may say they weren't flakey enough, but then they were covered with a hollandaise sauce that had a little kick. the fresh, red <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> were home-style (nicely lumpy) and an odd but tasty addition to a breakfast dish. \n\nwe can't leave without mentioning the awesome tangerine house mimosa.  the cranberry was ok, but the tangerine blew it away. the food was great but not 5 star outstanding (i rarely give 5 stars anywhere). but i can't recommend this place highly enough. come hungry, leave happy with a doggie bag.", 
            "we came here for breakfast.  we checked in and waited.  and waited and waited.  the lines were very long.  we finally got a seat and were very excited to sit down and enjoy a fabulous breakfast.  \n\nfood was just ok.  we got the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>/<mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>/egg combo (forgot what it was called) and a chorizo skillet.  the skillet was far better than the other dish and this surprised me.  the order on the eggs was wrong (brought scrambled-- ordered over medium) and we waited almost until the end of our meal for this to be corrected.  we also had bloody marys and they were also just ok. \n\nthis place is fun; presentation of food is unique and i think it is better than most places for breakfast, but i think vegas is full of overrated places like these.", 
            "came in here bc i was taking in a show at imperial palace sunday evening and thought dinner here would be convenient. \n\nwe had only about 45 minutes so i asked the waiter if he could rush our order. i went with the bbq ribs but he returned within minutes to advise me they just ran out. wth run out at 6:30 pm?  i then changed my order to the ny steak medium rare and it came with asparagus, carrots <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> with melted cheese on top. the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> portion was large and tasty but the steak was cooked properly but was tough and had to much grissel. for around $28.00 i thought it was overpriced. \n\nthe waiter was accommodating and friendly but i've visited the san diego and sahara lv location and the food here was the most disappointing of the three. we did get to our show in  time which was a plus.", 
            "way too much hype about this place which is maybe why i was more disappointed than i would have been otherwise.  i ordered the egg scramble with <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> on the side.  it was bland. even after adding an exorbitant amount of salt, it still was just blah.  the potatoes were fine, but oraida at home would have been just as good.\n\nthe people i was with got the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles.  the chicken was very bland, as well.  crispy, but flavorless.  \n\noverall disappointing.\n\nservice was just so-so.  \n\nhash house a no go.", 
            "holy cow. where do i start?\nfirst of all, i had never heard of this place, and my mom was adament about wanting to try this place because of all the awesome reviews she'd seen here on yelp! i'm glad she insisted on it, because this place was yummmmm-o. \nnow, let me be frank, the parking at emperial palace is a pain in tukhus. at least it was on the night we came. the restaurant was also a little tricky to find inside the actual casino, but once we figured out where we were going, we were good to go. \nif there is one word i can use to describe the food here: hugemongous. but that's also leaving out how delicious it is. i ordered the meatloaf with bbq sauce, and it was divine. seriously, i wanted to buy a gallon of it and take it home despite how hard it would have been to get it through airport security. i ordered like three extra serving cups of it. the meatloaf sandwich was rich and buttery, and served with a steak knife because it was so freakin' massive. unfortunately, i couldn't finish it or take it back to our hotel, so i had to leave about 1/2 to 2/3 of it on my plate. sad. \nmy mom ordered the pacer's hash, and it smelled awesome. our friend tiffany, who wasn't that hungry, thought it smart to just order a couple of sides, and chose the loaded cheese and bacon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and a side salad. woah. these things could hardly be considered sides. they were both the size of an entire meal. \nso if you're looking for some delicious food at a good price, hash house is where you'll find it. \nand, you can burn some of those calories off by gambling downstairs when you're done.\n... wait... maybe i've got that wrong. oh well. try it out!", 
            "if you have a huge appetite, this is definitely the place to go!\n\ni came here on new years eve for lunch.  there was a pretty long wait to be seated but it was well worth it!  as i was waiting to be seated, i looked at the menu and knew that i wanted to order the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>... this dish did not disappoint!  it was a unique combination of amazing-ness all on one gigantic plate. a layer of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> was topped with two big biscuits with scrambled eggs, tomatoes, and spinach.  then, the friend chicken sat on top of the biscuits.  the chicken was crunchy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  chipotle sauce was poured on top, which covered the entire plate.  there is no way one person could finish this plate on their own (although they would want to).\n\ni wish they had one of these restaurants in the bay area!", 
            "since we were staying at imperial palace, why not eat at hash house since i have been wanting to try it. \n\ni had the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. i knew their portions were huge but damn every dish that came out was massive. i actually was a huge heffer this weekend and i ate my whole plate (don't judge me). everyone knows how big and artery clogging this could be but i ate every bit of it. i loved the everything the benedict came with, however i wished it came with poached eggs not fried egg. i love the drippy egg yolks, too bad it wasn't on this one. the biscuit <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> were good. it did get very heavy and difficult to eat but with everything together a piece of egg, tomato, crispy bacon, and a piece of that juicy chicken made it more delicious.  the chicken wasn't too crispy because of the sauce but it was nice and juicy, not dry at all. i must say...those tomatoes are amazing. so sweet and juicy. if there was a whole one on my plate...i'd eat it like an apple. it was that good (i love tomatoes). \n\nwe wanted to eat there again before we left but it was not possible. they need to open later on sundays too!! people are still hungry!\n\n\nservice was great, the wait was about 30-40 mins but it really wasn't that bad, it went by fast. just go down stairs to gamble a little to kill some time. \n\n-go !

            "went here for breakfast on the day after christmas. had the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>, omg it was ginormous... how could anyone eat this meal. first of all it was in a deep dish bowl the crust looked like a 12 inch saucer with a 5 inch bowl in the middle, the bottom of the bowl was filled with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> with the crust half way in the bowl with sausage with gravy filled in it and scrambled eggs on top. i wasn't able to finish even half of it. it probably could have fed 3 people... go there if you haven't eaten in a few days....",

            "i was soooo excited to eat here.  i had it on my list and was making sure i was not going to leave vegas without trying it. it was easy to find.  just head straight through the imperial palace until you hit the escalators.  we were are very hungry after a night of drinking and dancing and hoped to not have to wait too long to get seated.  it was pretty busy and also a friday morning.  we were pleasantly surprised to get seated promptly in a nice comfy booth.  i ordered coffee and it came quick enough and was quite delicious.\n\none thing that stuck out in my mind as odd was the waiter told us right off the bat that the kitchen does not have any heat lamps, so the food is served out as soon as it's made. i thought ok, great, that means we will have our food quickly.  eh, not so much.   our food took a bit to come out.  it wasn't excessive but we definitely waited longer on our food than we did to get a seat.\n\ndue to knowing the portion sizes are enormous we decided to split plates.  my dining partner and i chose the <mark>HH Original</mark> benedict.  it comes with bacon, fresh tomato, fresh spinach, and is topped with a roasted red pepper cream as well as two eggs.  additionally it sat on top of a split biscuit with griddled <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. the potatoes reminded me of the potato pancakes my mom would make when i was a kid with leftover <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>-nice and golden browned and quite tasty. that was probably the best thing about the benedict.  the bacon was good too, but hey it's bacon.\n\n now for the not so good, the eggs were underdone and the parts of the white were still clear.  that kind of thing doesn't bother me, but i would prefer my eggs to be cooked correctly.  the thing that was the biggest bummer was that the food was luke warm.  so i guess the no heat lamp thing doesn't necessarily work to their advantage because my food had to have sat back there for a bit before arriving to the table because it was not hot.  also, the fresh tomato and spinach did not bring anything to the table.  had the spinach been slightly sauteed or wilted and seasoned, it could have been a different story.  i think having those put on top of the benny just made it even colder in temp.  also, the whole thing was under-seasoned.  \n\nthe red pepper cream tasted like roasted red pepper bisque that was under-seasoned and cold.  i really do like the concept of having a benedict topped with lighter ingredients and sauce, but it was all cold and under-seasoned and disappointing.  i kept going back to the bacon, egg and crispy <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  i will say that i was able to split this with another person and between the two of us couldn't even finish it.  our bill came to $12 each, and i was very happy, and even though it was underwhelming, it was still worth it for the price.\n\nmy other friends ordered the bananas foster <mark>French Toast</mark>-also huge, as well as the <mark>Fresh Mushroom</mark>, artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomato and fresh spinach hash.  my friend did not like her hash at all.  i tried it and agreed with her that it was completely under-seasoned.  i hate having to add salt at a restaurant.  i think it should come out seasoned correctly.  also the salt shaker had course salt in in that barely came out the holes in the shaker-a huge pet peeve of mine.  the bananas foster was huge but nothing out of this world.  what i did really like though was the split banana topped with sugar and bruleed.  it was so delicious and the banana developed a very creamy texture.  it was served still in the peel, which i thought was pretty cool.\n\noverall, the value is great, and the quality is also good.  i can only base this review on the one visit i made here, and there were definite flaws in the execution of the food.   although the plates are huge, impressive looking, the taste is what matters most, and it unfortunately was lacking.  however, on a whole, due to the value of the food and he fact that one plate can be split between two people, i would like to go back and prove that hash house can really live up to its hype.",

            "we were on vacation with friends and this was our last morning to eat something other than a buffet.  we were told about this place by a friend in california and boy were we glad.  it was a wonderful breakfast dining experience.  the food was very good, huge portions and the waitress was excellent (i forgot her name though).  she was fun and knowledgeable and there for our every need.  all four of us were happy were our selections.  i ordered the hash spinach mushroom scramble, which was a little dry, but when i ordered a side of the chipotle sauce from the andy's man vs food dish it was perfect.  i asked for just a little bit of the sauce because it was a little dry, but they still charged extra for the sauce.  we also ordered the \"andy's man vs food\" breakfast which was delish, although crazy carb loaded with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, angel hair pasta, <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, bacon and more.  our friends got the mango coconut pancake and also the <mark>French Toast</mark> and they absolutely loved both dishes.  the coffee was hot and very good and constantly refilled as it should be at breakfast time.  i think everything was definitely a bit overpriced for breakfast with drink, tax and tip probably around $16-20 per person.  i will definitely eat here again the next time i come to las vegas, but next time i will share a dish with someone.", 
            "i love hash house! the portions here are huge. the first time i went i got the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. i ate about a third of it before i was stuffed! i like that they have a unique take on benedicts - they use biscuits instead of egg mcmuffins, include a layer of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, and it's topped with scrambled eggs instead of poached, but you can request poached on the side if you want. they also come with their own unique sauce rather than hollandaise.\n\nfor my second time i shared with friends and had the blueberry pancake, quesadilla, and pork benediction. the pancake was good; very fluffy and came with a good amount of toppings. the quesadilla was delicious and like the benedictions, come with a layer of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>! the pork benediction wasn't as good as the sage one i had my first time. i also wasn't expecting the pork to come fried. it had to much breading and the meat was a bit tough.\n\nif this place served regular human portions, i would decrease my rating to a 3. but the portions are ginormous, food is decent, and the menu has a wide selection making it suitable for groups. there is always a line, but platinum members and higher are seated pretty much right away!", 
            "tired? haven't slept? hangover? this is the place you want to be. in a city filled with mountainous buffets and chef-endorsed eateries, sometimes what you really need is a place that serves hearty, down to earth grub. and that is pretty much what you get at hash house a go go. \n\ni had the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> and it was a monsterous plate of fried goodness. at first, i noticed a huge load of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> underneath everything else which made me a little cautious (didn't want to food coma before going on the 5 hour drive back to la). but surprisingly, the mash was rather light and went really really well with the rest of the dish. my chicken was cooked and fried perfectly with just enough batter for a nice little crunch. the bacon was a nice touch and the sauce they used brought the entire dish together. overall, the flavors were very harmonious but truthfully, the most amazing aspect is the power of this meal to cure hangovers/ aggravated stomachs. be it a night of cavalier partying or a low key drink fest, the food here will do more than enough to stop the room from spinning. \n\njust be ready to wait a bit and make sure all of your party is present when you put your name down because they won't give you a buzzer until everyone is there. there will definitely be a wait but they have a selection of magazines for you to dive into, assuming you're in a state to read. \n\ni will say that our waiter was rather rude at times and didn't seem too keen on earning his tip that day. one of my friends was very hungover and in obvious discomfort but the waiter still seemed to think it was necessary to poke constant fun at him; obviously he was joking (i hope) but there's a point where jokes get old and the waiter needs to learn when to stop. maybe he realized we were getting annoyed because he disappeared for a while and left us to tend to our empty glasses of ice. i don't think it's enough to justify docking any stars but it's worth mentioning. \n\njust be ready to come hungry and leave bloated. and make sure to get your poolside time in before you pay a visit because it is unlikely that your hard earned six pack will survive this episode.", 
            "on our first morning in vegas during our most recent trip, i just typed in best breakfast in yelp and this restaurant came up! i was lured by the fact that adam from man vs food had come here and wanted to try it out! \n\nthe location: imperial palace.. my first thought: really?! uff. but off we went!\n\nimperial palace was going through major renovations.. the entire front section was closed off.. we had to park next door at bill's? i think that's what it was called.. after nearly falling to my death by slipping on wet floors, we located the restaurant which was on the second floor. once you go up there, it's like you're not even in imperial palace anymore! the restaurant decor was really cool and hip (awesome that i just used that word, i know). the wait was about 20 minutes.. i'm not sure if they took reservations but we just walked in. \n\ni tried the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. oh my goodness. i was in love with this dish. when it came out, i swear i thought that i could probably only finish half (the portion was huge. it was the size of a small dog). but to my surprise.. i finished 80% of it. shocking, i know. but you guys, this was so amazing. it was biscuit.. <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>.. scrambled eggs.. cheese.. fresh spinach.. <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>.. chipotle sauce.. omg the goodness was overwhelming! i could not stop eating and probably gained 3lbs but it was amazing! and i can't wait to go back!\n\nalso! ps - get the kiwi watermelon drink. super yummy!", 
            "omg the serving size!!! when my boyfriend and i first walked into this place we thought we were in for an ok meal considering this place is inside the imperial palace, but boy were we wrong. as the waiter seats us we walk past a guy who is eating a pancake the size of a party platter plate. we thought this was a special thing until our meal came. my boyfriend ordered \"andy's crispy indiana style <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark>\" he loved the meat and the bbq cream sauce but i fell in love with the griddled smoked mozzarella they put on top of the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. we both loved the fresh corn which we both agree is the best we've ever had. i had the \"black skillet chicken\" which was great and had just the right flavors. but keep in mind each dish can feed 2 to 3 people so with have a fridge ready for leftovers or plan on splitting to dishes. but altogether the food was amazing and when my boyfriend and i go back to vegas next year we defiantly plan on eating there again.", 
            "bland. very, very bland. huge disappointment, despite the hype. the only thing \"twisted\" about this place is the sheer amount of crap they pile on and not a single gram of seasoning.\n\nwe ordered <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and eggs with bacon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>; and sausage gravy with biscuits. the chicken was dry. the maple reduction made the breading a bit soggy, which created an unsavory contradiction.\n\nhad breakfast at 10 am on thursday morning. wait was 10 minutes. service was fair. food was not worth the price, despite the large portion (which was left unfinished and us unsatisfied). won't be coming back here again.", 
            "hash house a go go is coming to chicago! now i can relive the hungover moment that i had in vegas lol.\n\ni had a list of restaurants that i wanted to go to on my recent trip to vegas. hash house is the only place i made it to on that list. \n\nwe arrived around 1pm on a sunday. don't be afraid of all the people waiting. we were seated within 10 minutes. the hostess was super nice. the rest of our party wasn't there yet, but she still sat us down right away. i was tired of eating eggs so i got the waffle. my friend had some sort of skillet. \n\nmy waffle was huge and tasty. it was a little tough to eat though. it wasn't one of those waffles that's crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. it was just soft all around. i ordered a side of strawberries with whipped cream. it cost me $6 for 5 strawberries!! i wish the waitress would have told me that. my friend's skillet wasn't like your regular skillet where they put the eggs on top of the potatoes and then melt the cheese. the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> were separate. \n\ni'll give this place another try when they open in chicago, but when i go to vegas i'll pass.", 
            "i ate here one afternoon this past april. the menu is extensive and tempting. the theme of \"twisted farm food\" (i.e affordable comfort dishes with a contemporary spin) is imaginative and well-executed. my grilled cheese sandwich was huge and delicious with all kinds of cool extra ingredients. the side of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> with bacon and cheese was equally humungous and delicious. the margaritas here are good also. the bartender who served me hit a nice balance of behaving in a relaxed manner while being very quick and efficient. for me, this place is a must-visit next time i am close to the mid-strip. recommended!", 
            "after our $60 breakfast here i can safely say this place isn't worth the hype!\n\nwhen we arrived at 9:30am there was no wait. when we left, maybe an hour later, there were so many people waiting it had to have been over an hour wait. let me tell you, i would have been pissed if i had waited more than 15 minutes for this breakfast!\n\ndrinks - i ordered a watermelon lemonade and bf ordered a pistachio iced mocha. the drinks were awesome! mine was slightly sour but had enough watermelon flavor that it wasn't too much. his pistachio mocha was sooo good! i was mad that i didn't order it. \n\nfor breakfast both my bf and my bff ordered <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> which is two eggs, bacon or sausage, and a pancake, or you can substitute a waffle or <mark>French Toast</mark> for one extra dollar. bff got the pancake (that thing was bigger than the plate it was served on!!) and bf got the vanilla waffle. \n\ntheir eggs (scrambled) were nice and fluffy, the bacon was alright. his waffle was good, but didn't taste like vanilla, and her pancake she liked, but couldn't even eat half of it.\n\nmy order - okay you know when you read the description for something and then it arrives and you realize you read the description all wrong? this is what happened to me. \n\ni ordered the <mark>HH Original</mark> benedict. eggs benedict - i expect hollandaise and some poached eggs. whatever else happens is fine, but those are the things i need. i read that i would get a biscuit instead of an english muffin and there was mention of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, although i didn't know how that would fit in. i read about the red pepper cream, but i thought that would be along with my hollandaise. i read basted eggs, and i honestly didn't know what that meant. \n\nso i received this massive red mess with sprigs of rosemary and what look like pine needles shooting out the side of my food. i get trying to make a plate look nice, but this was a bit much.\n\nthe taste? eh. the top layers are alright. the basted egg is overcooked, no runny yolk at all, but the sauce was okay and the tomato was fine. the bottom layers though, a dry ass biscuit on top of dry <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. not a good combo. they really have no business calling this any sort of benedict since they strayed away from every traditional benedict characteristic possible, aside from stacking everything on top of each other.\n\nthere are many better places to drop $60 on breakfast at in vegas - this is not one i would revisit. also, apparently there was an episode of man vs food filmed here? that must be their claim to fame because our waiter mentioned it at least 5 times. wow, i am so impressed.", 
            "this restaurant is located in the imperial palace hotel. the restaurant itself looks a little drab and old, like there used to be a previous restaurant residing here. nevertheless, the famous hash house a go go name doesn't disappoint. \n\nbeware: this place tends to get super busy, especially on weekends. so either come really early...or really late. \n\ni came here with three other people and was forewarned about the portions here. when we tried to order our entrees we were told that there was a charge for sharing (what?!). thankfully, our waitress suggested that we order two entrees and two sides so we could bypass the nonsense charge. first off, my friend and i ordered morning cocktails: a pineapple champagne cocktail and a hibiscus. unfortunately, the drinks were not good. save the money, it's not worth it. \n\ninteresting menu tid-bit: look up on their menu <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark>. only in vegas would they have that as a menu item. \n\nas far as entrees went, we ordered the <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> hash and the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> farm benedict with two sides: mac and cheese and some vegetables. the hash was actually not very good at all. i swear the salmon tasted like it came out of a can and it was super dry. we ended up picking at it throughout the  meal and didn't even finish it. now the farm benedict on the other hand....amazing!!!! hands down one of the best entrees i've had for breakfast ever! i couldn''t stop eating it! it was a combination of <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, biscuits, and gravy heaven. i wish we had ordered two of these. thank goodness our waitress recommended it!! she also recommended the brown sugar banana flapjacks, which i've read on yelp are amazing, but we didn't order it this time around. \n\ni would definitely say that the food saves this place. i can't speak for other locations. the service was sub-par, and for some reason they couldn't find any extra plates for us as well as silverware! it wasn't even that busy the morning we went so how does that happen? \n\ndefinitely coming back here for breakfast whenever i'm in sin city. i wouldn't mind trying other locations as well. one thing's for sure: i'm gonna order that farm benedict next time.", 
            "i'd love to give this place 4 stars, and my reason for taking a star off might seem odd to some, but honestly... the portions are a little excessive. no one like leaving hungry, but at the same token, not many people i know like being presented with a plate holding enough food to feed 4 people easily. i had the crispy pork loin benedict, which was really tasty. the southwest sauce on it was perfect, but the scrambled eggs on top were almost superfluous. the pork loin covered my entire plate and was laid on top a big biscuit <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. i don't think i was able to finish half of it. i get that they're known for their ridiculous portions, but seriously... it was a bit much. \n\ntheir <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> (yes, there's strips of bacon in the waffles) were really good. super fluffy and a perfect balance of sweet and salty. their biscuits are big and fluffy and are great with their homemade jam. i think their jam may have been some of the best i've ever had. and the kiwi watermelon lemonade was so so good! \n\nif they were to tone down their portions (you can keep them big without being insanely ginormous) i'd give them 4 stars.",

            "i'd been dying to try the san diego location since friends keep posting pictures of these giant fancy plates of food from this place. we walked in about 9 am on a sunday morning. we saw lots of people sitting in the waiting area so we were expecting a wait but luckily the hostess just ushered us in. they have plenty of small tables available for 2- 4 people. guess there were large groups outside. but by the end of the meal, the place was packed, both inside and out. anyways, the first thing the waitress said was that the portions are huge. i already knew that and decided to split a dish with someone. the guys each ordered their own dish and ended up boxing up half of it. hahaha. so i split the house hash with chicken. it was served in a heavy iron skillet along with a biscuit, 2 eggs and fruit. we were starving but it was so much food. the two of us had trouble finishing it. it wasn't that amazing either. the food is just ok. i don't know if i love it or will crave it in the future. it's a little bit greasy. i think their gimmick is just huge portions and i guess their food presentation is pretty good. my friend got the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict (which is a man vs food fav) but man it's like almost a foot high, everything piled on top of each other. looked really good. i only tried a bit of the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and chicken and hollandaise sauce. it was tasty. that dish was like $16 though. everything is about $15 or more but i guess if it feeds you twice, it's ok. hard to have leftovers on vacation though and i'm guessing a lot of people that come here are tourists. oh and the other guy at our table got <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> with a waffle, eggs, sausage, and fruit. the waffle took up like  of the plate and half of the waffle went home with us as well. haha. oh and i have to mention service was horrible. our waitress liked to disappear for long periods of time. she was nice and polite but nowhere to be found. other people brought out our drinks and food. and we had to flag other wait staff to get an extra plate and boxes at the end. man, it would've been a much quicker meal if we had better service.",

            "big yummy breakfast food. aka comfort food overload deluxe.\n\nmy x-brother-in-law told me about the hash house a go go several years ago while we were fishing in mexico. he said \"dude you are gonna love this place, we're going when we hit <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> tomorow, the breakfast there is off the hook.\"  but it wasn't in the cards as we got thick in the fish and opted for some fresh bluefin sashimi instead.\n\nso fast forward several years, that hash house place is still ingrained in the back of my mind and what do ya know, while taking a breather from the venetian's casino i go for a walkabout and stumble on a sign that tells me there is a hhagg in the imperial palace hotel. so i go thru this construction maze of an entry to the iph and into the hottest (like 90 degrees) casino on the planet. i go pass the performing blues brothers  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/9wjtzw8beyotqjk41v8wqw?select=tzsiv-_ypvbtuh7mh_f8cg#tzsiv-_ypvbtuh7mh_f8cg blackjack dealers and up an escalater to find that they are closed! damn, so i make plans for the next days breakfast.\n\nwake up at zero dark thirty (6:30) so i can have b-fast before going to the fabtech trade show. i get there no line! yes the casino gods are favoring me today. i asked to be seated at the bar for quicker service. this was the first time i ever ordered a glass of milk at a bar, it felt wierd. i then ordered up a <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>.  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=w3bt2l3t-ifyfctq_q2vbq&userid=emmzx-ggdksu4enmbae6dw\n\nfood: andys <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> ... this was a giant breakfast, the chicken and eggs atop a couple of biskets piled onto a heap of country style <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> loaded with bacon bits all covered up with a benedictish gravy with diced bell peppers. this was some good stuff a solid 4 **** star for me. but less bisket and more of that yummy gravy and it would have been 5 stars.  http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=vdlsre-gndkh8n82jleo5a&userid=emmzx-ggdksu4enmbae6dw\n\nservice: from the hostess taking my picture http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=eo1u2kj6oyu_a_kr9pc-6a&userid=emmzx-ggdksu4enmbae6dw and quickly seating me, to the bar (milk) tender who was way cool and friendly, the service was great, fast and polite. 5*****stars\n\ni'll be back.", 
            "to repeat what others said below, the portions are huge. two people could easily split just one order. \n\ni had the eggs benedict with the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, that was shown on man vs. food. it was amazing. first of all, it was huge. it had a large piece of delicious <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> on top of eggs, biscuits <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. it was all topped off with a gravy that had some zip to it. the biscuits were obviously home-made and absolutely light and fluffy. the gravy was a perfect compliment instead of traditional hollandaise.\n\nmy companion had the egg skillet with chorizo sausage and got a tortilla in lieu of a biscuit. right choice. it was a great meal - wrapping up eggs, chorizo <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> in a home-made tortilla. again, very delicious.\n\nmy companion also had a blt bloody mary....which is a bloody mary with bacon, tomato, lettuce and a slice of toast coming out of it. it was tasty, but probably not worth the price. may just want to stick with a traditional bloody mary.\n\nwait was 25 minutes when we arrived around 11am on a friday. we sat at the bar so we didn't have a wait, but it appeared they turned tables pretty quickly. staff was very friendly and helpful, making recommendations and suggestions.\n\nmenu was extensive and offered a lot of options, with some very interesting and clever combinations of foods. i wanted about 10 different things off the menu.\n\ni can't comment on the poor reviews, especially for lunch/dinner items, but i think the breakfast is out of this world.", 
            "what is the opposite of tapas?  this place!  i went for the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> w/ fresh spinach, <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs served on a fresh split biscuit with griddled <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. i could only eat a 1/4 of it sans the carbs.  it was really interesting that i could taste each of the items and could mix and match.  i thought the chicken was good even though i took most of the batter on it.  you have to try it and go with more people and share.  trust me people = small village because that entre could feed a small village.  enjoy it's las vegas", 
            "first off, definitely recommend this restaurant!\nbut i'm telling you, you better be hungry. :)\nmy boyfriend and i went here for the first time last month (for my birthday breakfast). i chose it because of all the hype i heard about it. i was not dissapointed one bit! \nthe food is awesome (some of the best i've ever had eating out) and the service was good, too.\ni was surprised on how huge the portions were! and for the price, such a killer deal. i ordered the biscuits and gravy (which was served over <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and topped with scrambled eggs.) and my boyfriend got the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> skillet. both were to-die-for meals. we also noticed how tasty their eggs were, some of the best we've had. i wish i could go back and try their famous <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles i've heard so much about. \n\nif you are in vegas, this place is a must! seriously, you will be so impressed.", 
            "they have an interesting menu, we ordered a skillet and a salmon platter for breakfast. \n\non the plus side the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> were pretty good.   the biscuits were large and pretty good as well - a tad dry though.  we really liked the home made jam!  they did not offer any butter or anything else for the biscuits, we could have asked but did not.\n\ni asked for my eggs over medium... they came out cold and runny and i could not eat them.  the salmon was cold... was it supposed to be?  the skillet came with a lump of cheese on one side, the rest had little to none so they did not do a good job of \"mixing it up\". \n\nfor the amount of money we spent for breakfast (about $25 after taxes) we should have walked out of there very well satisfied.", 
            "(at the quad formerly known as the imperial palace) parking is at the rear in one of those famous vegas labyrinths except it looks abandoned, dirty and unsafe, park in valet. \n\nthe waiting staff was prompt and courteous, restaurant has seen a lot of action but still clean, just a little beat up.\n\ni started with the blt bloody mary , the bacon was good.....i left half my drink , there was something tangy missing in the drink it was just your basic mix with tabasco....\n\nfor lunch i ordered the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, it was this towering plate with massive pieces of food, the honeydew melon slice on it was delicious, the chicken breast was dry, it had scrambled egg on top of the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> which was decent and sharp cheddar cheese on top of that.....the cheese tasted burnt with an aftertaste , all that was on top of a layer of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> which were decent in taste, there was also some slices of tomato and spinach leaves....i left most of the food not because it was too much but because it did not taste great as the legend says. the melon was great though.\n\ni believe this is a place to fix a hungover  than just a place to go have lunch just because, i do try everything twice just in case the first time sucks so in the future i will go to another location and give it another chance.", 
            "i ordered the man vs. food <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and eggs benedict... wow! the chicken was tender and the eggs were not over cooked. the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> were flavorful and the biscuit soft and crumbly.  i even enjoyed the chipotle sauce that was poured over the entire thing. it wasn't too creamy and it had a nice kick. and of course, the meal was ginormous!  (perfect for sharing.)  even though it was huge, this didn't take away from its quality.  all the ingredients were still fresh! this seems pretty true about all other meals served there.  you get quantity and quality.", 
            "i absolutely love this place! my husband and i make it a point to come here every time we come to vegas. i've never been disappointed here and there is never enough time (or room in my belly) to try everything i want. one of my favorites is the hash house original benedict with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, biscuits, spinach, tomatoes, poached eggs(or they call them basted, not totally sure what the difference is) and roasted red pepper cream sauce. sooo good! the portions are massive and the <mark>HH Original</mark> benedict is about $15 or so, so you can save some money by just ordering that and splitting with someone else. it always sounds like a good idea before we get there, but then i can't decide and we usually end up ordering two entrees. the banana-brown sugar pancake is awesome too and doesn't even need syrup. it's massive as well of course. i can usually only eat about 1/4 of it. the breakfast quesadilla has potatoes and a bunch of other yummy stuff, also perfect. i'm not a big fan of bloody mary's, until i had one here. awesom bloody marys and nice and big. perfectly seasoned and not too spicy. can't wait to have one in a few days. vegas baby, vegas!!!", 
            "so this place is located in an upstairs hidden corner of the used to be imperial palace (soon to be the quad). it is sorta tricky to find, but that does not seem to deter vegas tourists from visiting this totally fun place. \n\nwe tried to visit on a saturday morning but were greeted with a 45 minute wait. we were hungry, so we decided to pass this one up and try it again on monday morning. still a 35 minute wait, but we really wanted to try it. \n\nas others have said, once you are seated the service is excellent. the menu has all sorts of fun and unique offerings such as a banana latte and banana and maple sugar pancakes. my boyfriend and i are normally people who walk in and decide what we want fairly quickly, but hash house's menu boasts so many unique flavors that it took us a while to decide. \n\nwe finally decided that we wanted the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles (apparently a man vs. food favorite), some pancakes, and a side of crispy potatoes. the waitress took one look at us (we are not large people) and recommended we wait on the pancakes until we received the rest of our food, as the portions are so good. we appreciated her honesty, because the portions were huge and the chicken and waffles <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> were more than enough. \n\nthe flavor, texture, and presentation was superb. the sage as a bit of complexity to the chicken flavor that still mixes well with the waffles. the syrup was a little less sweet than most, which makes it perfect with the savory part of the dish. the chicken was also obviously high quality. one of the things i normally hate about <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> is the low quality chicken that places sometimes use. \n\nwe fully enjoyed our dining experience. the dishes are so large and tasty looking that it is fun to watch the servers take them to their respective tables and then watch the look on the people's faces as they begin to dig in. we are already planning to visit again on our next vegas trip, and even want to stop in late night after gambling just for one of their fun lattes.", 
            "so this was our second time at the vegas hash house.  the reno one seemed so much better.  we had a party of 6, which was a 50 minute wait.  the place is loud, you have to yell to hear the person next to you.  i wasn't hung over, but it was just plain irritating.  our server was friendly, but not on-the-ball.  it took a while for her to get our order, which normally is okay, but we were dining with two small children.  what really knocked down my rating was the delivery of the food.  one friend got her meal first, along with one child, mine came about 5 minutes later, our other friends, probably 10 minutes later, and my husband, well, the person who got her food first was nearly finished by the time his arrived.  the server explained that they made everything fresh to order, so it didn't come out together. uh, unacceptable.  you're left to want to dive into the food, after waiting a ridiculous amount of time for it, and not wanting to be rude and waiting until everyone is served.  not cool.  \n\nthe food itself was terrible.  i had the biscuits and gravy, the sausage was pink.  i didn't feel like waiting 2 more hours for food, so i picked around it.  the gravy tasted old - made-to-order my ass.  the biscuits were stale, and really resembled hockey pucks.  the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> in the middle were not necessary and were not appetizing.  i ordered a side of sausage, and it was two tiny pieces of skimpy meat, obviously the ridiculous portion size is for the low-cost, crappy carbs only.  i didn't even care if anyone else liked their meal, it was a less-than-stellar experience and i won't return.", 
            "i fell in love with this place... woke up at 11am and we were starved. we needed a solid meal to eat before leaving vegas. so i yelped up \"brunch\" and found hash house a go go! \n\ntook us forever to find this spot. there were so many people waiting in line. we waited close to an hour to get to in. we were sooooo hungry. \n\nservice: nice and polite, they were very helpful as we were first timers. \nambience: very trendy and \"barn-like\" decor. the booths were so spacy and comfortable. \nfood: amazing, aaamazing. let's first talk about the portions. solid portion! i was sooo full from lunch, then i had enough for dinner as well. the andy's sage fried you must, must try the chicken with maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> & biscuits (15.95). the chicken was good, maybe a little dry. the scrambled eggs were sooo fluffy. one of the best eggs i've had. the bacon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> is just delicious and solid. the bacon did just the trick. the biscuits were sooo yummy. my friends get some butter and the peach jam to put on the biscuits. sooo great! such a good price and great portion! my friend's food portions were very generous too.\n\na great brunch place. i will definitely take my boyfriend here next time since he is a picky brunch fan. will recommend this to others as well.", 
            "this was my second time here, and it was more disappointing than the last.  my first time here i ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> (the man vs. food favorite), and i thought it was ok.  nothing spectacular at all.  but my friends seemed to have enjoyed their meals a lot.  my friend is a platinum member of total rewards so i didn't pay for this meal, hence nothing to complain about if you didn't pay for it i guess.  plus we skipped the line, so i didn't have to wait.  i do need to note that the portion here are huge, so sharing entrees is an option here.   \n\nthis time around, however, i was extremely disappointed in the food.  i came here a second time to see if maybe the food i ate the first time around was a bad day, so i gave this place a second chance.  after this experience, i really think this place is over-rated, and i can't understand why it gets as crowded as it does.  the wait on this particular saturday was 45 minutes to an hour.  we finally got sat, and we ended up ordering right away since we were all starving.  i kid you not, it took an hour for our food to come.  and our server, alonzo, noticed this too because he came over twice to give us the status of our food.  the first time it was because the table next to us that came 10 minutes after we did and didn't order right away got their food 30 minutes before we did.  alonzo informed us it was because his manager accidentally  put the food ticket in front of everyone else's.  ok, fine.  the second time he came around, he apologized for the food taking so long and that it would be coming up.  he must have read our minds both times because we were talking about how long the food was taking.  i know the food is made from scratch and all, but are you churning the butter and digging out the potatoes from the dirt back there too?  shoot, an hour for <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> is too damn long!  i found the service from alonzo to be very professional and courteous despite the disappointment and delay of the food. \n\nwhen we finally got our meal, we were no longer hungry anymore.  the ham, spinach, and cheese scramble was alright, the country potatoes had this weird sour after taste that had such a bad taste in my mouth i didn't even want to finish them, and the crappy home-made biscuits tasted like hard chalk  no, it wasn't fluffy and buttery, but bland, hard, and completely devoid of taste.  i decided that this was definitely a 2 star yelp experience.  i was so disgusted by the experience i actually felt the need to speak to alonzo and the manager about how bad it was.  if the food had been good, the hour wait would have been worth it, but no, the wait was a complete waste of time.  while the portions are big, that just means big portions of more tasteless and bad food.    \n\nalonzo was completely understanding and offered to discount our bill for us.  he understood why we were upset at the experience and did not bs us. i asked him if we could speak to the manager.  this manager guy was less than professional and gave us bullcrap excuses for why everything took so long.  hey man, your employee already told us you were the reason the guys next to us got their food 30 minutes before we did.  secondly, i've been here once before and the food didn't take nearly half as long as it did this time around. just take responsibility for your actions and be honest.  he gave us a 30% discount on our food, but i don't think this was enough to want to return to this over-rated restaurant or recommend anyone to even waste their time going.  i'll just take it as a loss.  however, it was enough to bump up it from a 2 star experience to a 2.5 star experience.   \n\ndespite all this, i don't recommend anyone to go here for breakfast.  the wait is too long for tasteless food.  las vegas is renowned for their world-class food, and this place isn't it, people.", 
            "biscuits!! \n\nhuge buttery biscuits in sweet buttery sauce.  free as the \"appetizer bread\" of the meal.  ate one and was 80% full.\n\n<mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>\n- a huge (head sized), unorthodox benedict.  a thick layer of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, with heavy biscuits, topped with a huge deep<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breast, tomatoes and spinach, and a fried egg-cheese mixture, all covered in yummy mayonasy sauce.  everything was good except that the chicken breast was bland and dry, and thats supposed to be the star of the show, unfortunately.  no sage taste at all\n\nwonderful service - very helpful and nice.  when my friends requested souvenier cups she gladly checked the stock, and got the last few cups for us.  she also very thoughtful and asked if we wanted separate checks, before closing the checks.\n\nthis place is a-ok, i would just be prepared to bring some home.  you can definitely make 3 meals out of 1 order.",

            "one of the best reasons to stay at the quad in las vegas because this place is open 24 hours!! \n\nmy group ordered everything to go so we could take it up to our room. the waitress at the bar was super friendly and made sure we had everything we needed so we didn't have to come back for utensils or anything. \n\ni got the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> ($17 with tax) which is a favorite of adam richman from man vs. food. \n\nthis round, food wins. why, you ask? \n\nit's ginormous. \nthanksgiving gave a stamp of approval on the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>.\njesus likes their biscuits.\nthe south would be very happy with this <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>. \nthis most interesting man on earth picked the tomatoes and spinach from the freshest farms.\ngordan ramsay would claim the benedict sauce as \"duh-licious. absolutely incredible.\"\ncheese\n\nthis was the only meal i had all day and i still couldn't finish it! plus, it's perfect to help you keep a high tolerance to alcohol. so again..<mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, biscuits, <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, tomatoes, spinach, cheese and all of this smothered in benedict sauce. \n\nbest breakfast dish i have ever had. hands down. i will now build a shrine to this dish.", 
            "i love benedicts and i was craving a good been- i read some yelp reviews and found hash house a go go and decided that would be my breakfast place. i also looked online and the menu seemed delicious and i love fresh, organic and farm food. i ordered the <mark>HH Original</mark> benedict. i knew i would miss my hollandaise sauce but the roasted cream sauce sounded interesting. the service was great and the food comes out super fast. it was huge to my surprise. it was pretty bland to me and what makes it huge is the super enormous scoops of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and two fluffy biscuits. it's a total carbohydrate nightmare. i ate the sauce and the eggs and a few bites of potato with biscuit. but i still craved my traditional benedict that i originally had my heart set on. i should have ordered a scramble instead because there is a lack of protein in this dish. \nthis is in the quad casino and there is a lot of construction going on in the casino so it can be hard to find - just follow the signs or ask someone. \nif you like carbs- then you will probably like hash house a go go. this place will make you fat.", 
            "so much hype. i have bookmarked this place since my first trip to vegas when i was 21, and all i have to say is freaking finally after how many years? goodness! \n\nnow open 24 hours?! wait, what?\n\nfirst off: packed. 30-45 mins wait. note that if you are a larger party, you will be waiting longer (5+ people = large). how they do their seating is: smaller parties first and then large parties. and you all have to be presented to be seated. if you check in with the host saying how many groups before you, she/he will not tell you that it's one small/large group before you - fyi.\n\nservice: our waitress was sassy at first. maybe because it was a busy saturday and everyone got on her nerves, but it was definitely not early... we went around 11 close to noon and it was crazy packed. later on she was attentive to our needs and became nice. we tipped her anyway!\n\nfood: large portions. i cannot stress that enough. so if you're a hungry hippo, you'd be satisfied with your own plate, for sure. but a girlfriend and i split a dish. (i don't know what they're popular for, i just heard great things about this place). i ordered the egg benedict <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> = huge. nicely decorated and visually appealing; so good enough to eat for sure with a side of crispy potatoes. \n\ni wish it didn't have the biscuit, it made the dish extremely heavy. the dish included: cheese, eggs (duh!), dried tomatoes, spinach, salmon (not a lot at all), biscuit <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> (starting from the top to the bottom layers). so definitely a heavy plate with the potatoes and biscuit. the flavor was in the middle, like some bites were very bland and others were good.\n\ni was actually not satisfied with my order. and it was on my end, not the restaurants. i should have went with the salmon scrambled dish - had a bite out of that and omg so baaamb! \n\nvenue: it's in confusing area - the quad, and parking was a hassle or whatnot. the restaurant is actually really big, and i couldn't tell because the way it's laid out. \n\ndefinitely would come back and try another dish - maybe dinner time since it was so packed for brunch!", 
            "wow! delicious!!! i am convinced there are giants cooking in the kitchen. the serving sizes are huge. the prices were great, considering how much food you are getting. two people can easily share one meal. \n\nwe were a party of four. we went during the week, wednesday, september 4th. we got there just in time to beat the rush, and we still had to wait about 15 minutes to get seated. it was so worth it.\ni ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with maple reduction, served with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. incredible!\nmom ordered the \"basic\" breakfast and loved it. \nfriend ordered biscuits and gravy with side of bacon....yum!\nfiance ordered eggs with mango, coconut flapjack. the flapjack was huge...i mean, seriously, the size of  a large skillet. \nover all, great experience. the server was on top of things, though they did have to correct a couple of minor things with our order.

            "it started with seeing hash house a go go on a vegas website. then found out it was a man vs food stop, which if you know me, know that i had to go once i heard that. we stopped in for breakfast and we got there just in time. when we walked up there were only 2 people in the restaurant. when we left there were about 20 people waiting to get in. we were greeted by an excellent server, who definitely knew his shit. he was on it with recommendations, suggestions, asking what stuff we liked. he was awesome.  we ordered some drinks that came with boba straws in them, which in my opinion gets you drunk faster.  more liquid quicker. we ended up splitting a dish and i am glad we did because they give you a mountain of food. we got the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> & biscuit. first of all, the chicken breast was bigger than my hand. second it is the best <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> i have ever had... sorry kfc.  the seasonings in the batter was perfect and the maple made the chicken breast so tender. the chicken was sitting on top of 4 bacon strips that topped a mountain of thick <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. added to the plate were 2 eggs, and fruit all over the dish, a biscuit that honestly didn't need any butter or jam. it was moist and very flavorful on its own. i added a couple of pork sausage links because i didn't really that they made plates to feed mountain men. but those were really good also. i really don't think i could complain anything at all for this place. perfect service, mouth watering food and cute atmosphere. i think i am going to make it a point to go back every trip to vegas and try something different.", 
            "incredible. just wow. i wish i could give more stars, and that i had more space in my stomach to try more of the menu.\n\nmy boyfriend and i both got stuffed burgers--mine had bacon, cheddar, and avocado, and his had bacon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. i'd also like to add what i though was a smear of ketchup on the side of the plate was actually barbecue sauce with a soy sauce base, and it was mind-blowing. it was one of those meals where we didn't speak to each other, just chewed and went 'mmmmmmm' a lot.\n\nby the end of the meal, he said next time we go to vegas, we're staying at the quad, just so we can be closer to hhagg.\n\n(also, we went on a thursday afternoon in october and there were only a few other people, so if you want to avoid the lines, this might be a way!)", 
            "i. love. this. place.! \n\nfirst things first...my husband was positively green (not in a good way) from our insanely wild vacation. but this place is perfect for a vegas-sized hangover (or so said scott, our server). the table next to ours and the one behind us were busy oooohing and aaaaahing as the food fashion show commenced. after he briefly blanched at the size of the entrees, hubby finally decided to go with the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> w/ maple reduction, eggs, biscuit and bacon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. it was the perfect cure.\n\nsince i'd already been there a few times, i wanted to try something new, and decided to og with the meatloaf w/ 2 eggs, <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, and biscuit. when i asked scott for a little jam for my biscuit, he brought back the most delightful, delicious peach compote concoction i've ever had. it tasted very much like the inside of a peach cobbler. mmmmmmm!!!! \n\nfor the amount of food, the reasonable prices and the excellent quality of preparation, we will, of course, return...and bring additional back-up to battle the beast that is vegas.",

            "sorry in advance for the ridiculously long post...\nim not sure where to start... the mediocre food or the mediocre service. we stopped by on a sunday night with a reasonably large group (10). since we wanted to see the bellagio show before is ends at 12am we stopped by hash house to check on the wait. we were told there was no wait and in fact they were slow. we asked to put our name down for a reservation and were told they dont take reservations (ok). we cam back round 11 and were promptly told it would be 20-25 minutes. we were not please but decided to wait because we where here and staying close by and all wanted toi tyr the food. after a 10 minute wait the greater came and told us it was going to be at least another 25 minutes because they only had one large table available and that table just received their food. annoying, i should have taken this as a sign, but the majority of the group was fine although a little annoyed. one friend decided to walk around and saw that they were in fact very slow (almost no tables occupied) and also had a back room with a large table available. he asked the receptionist if they could put tables together since almost the whole restaurant was empty or let us sit in the back. all we receive was a \"no, we cant do that\". cant or wont? still we waited on. 15 more minutes pass and surprise they open the table in the back section. so i guess they could do it. finally we are all sitting down starving and ready to go in on some delicious food... or were we. we placed our orders based on their \"late night menu\", which is lack luster at best (about 10 items). the waiter came round and although he was polite seems a little slow based on how unbusy they were. heres were it went south quickly. i ordered the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> and asked for the eggs poached, cause who the hell scrambles eggs and calls it eggs benedict?! the wait for the food again seemed long for how slow the place was, 20 minutes, but for good food i would gladly wait. first thing i noticed when they bring my food is eggs are not poached. i ask the waiter to fix it and he graciously takes my plate back. 10-15 minutes pass my whole party is eating (although one guy got his food alarmingly later then everyone else). the waiter brings back my plate and it looks disheveled and clearly reconstructed. i look at it and touch it to see if they remade the plate or just switched out the eggs. the waiter quickly snaps at me \"i had them remake the whole plate\" to which i reply \"i highly doubt that, because its not hot.\" the icing on the cake and what made it so blatant that the food was not remade was my poached eggs were not even on the dish... they came on the side in a sad lonely little bowl. they remade the whole plate... really? there was no apology no admission he just carried on as usual. we received the check (tip already included because of the size of our group) and he went on about his business with out offering anything to compensate for the poor service and blatant lie. his name was david btw, i was so pissed off i made sure to look it up so i could mention him, by name, in this review. the final nail in the hash house coffin, the food aint that good. its ok at best. its over sized and over sauced and the taste is underwhelming. its like they put extra portions of mediocre food on a plate cover it on bacon, <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and sauce and call it spectacular. i know good food and this is no where close. not a single person at the table seemed to be impressed, only one person even took left overs. the most impressive thing about the food at this restaurant other then the portion size was the huge branch of sage sticking out of their plate. that was pretty awe inspiring. total restaurant fail.",

            "previous reviewers are all correct on the portions, they are giant, too big.  most people in vegas are at a hotel and not taking home leftovers so alot of food is going to waste.  they could serve half portion sizes and charge slightly less and probably make more money without all the waste.\n\nthat to say, the food, although excessive, was awesome!!!  i will definitely be going back to this joint.  i got the farmhouse scramble with bacon and avocado with the potato smashers and a side of gravy to eat with my biscuit.  absolutely delicious.  eggs were the right texture, not too soft but not overcooked, gravy was thick and good flavor, biscuit was perfect, potatoes were pretty much <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> so if you don't want those for breakfast, don't get them, but i loved them just fine.  went great with my bowl of gravy :)\n\nboyfriend got the <mark>French Toast</mark> and he was equally pleased with his meal.\n\nonly small complaint is there was an hour wait, not a big deal, we expected a wait, so we went down and played at a $5 blackjack table right next to the restaurant.  they told us to come check back in 30 minutes just in case and when we did were told to come back in 20 minutes.  we went back in 20 minutes and they said our table had been ready for 15 minutes.  they could invest in the buzzers to let people know when their table is ready so you can enjoy the casino while waiting without having to go back repeatedly and missing being called.  we were starving and would have been happy to eat 15 minutes earlier and would have lost less money waiting... \n\nregardless, highly recommend!!!!",

            "so it's, i don't know, 1am, on a tuesday morning in vegas, and i'm starving. i have this terrible habit of waiting until the very last minute to eat anything and therefore, i get insanely grumpy as my stomach starts to growl and hurt and all i want to do is eat something. only problem is, even though it's vegas and the place never really shuts down, it's still hard to find something to nosh on that doesn't cost an exorbitant amount of cash, or is even really open (and no, i will not eat denny's way up by the rivera- it's gross and the walk is ridiculous).\n\n\"ever heard of hash house a go go?\" my buddy asks me as we stand by the bellagio fountains, sweating in the humid air, my temper already on a very short fuse cuz i'm sure not even orphans in war torn africa are as hungry as i am at that moment in time.\n\n\"nope,\" i reply. \"but as long as it isn't pizza or somewhere far, i'll give it a shot.\"\n\nwe cross over to the quad (which is actually pretty nice now that it's been remodeled and doesn't reek of pure tackiness) and, there at the top of the escalators, we walk into the place. yes, i said \"walk-in\", as in we didn't have to wait in these really long lines everyone is complaining about on here. maybe it's because it was mid-week and early in the morning, i have no idea, but those long wait times were non-existent.\n\nlike others, i don't really get the whole ambiance of the place. is it industrial? is it retro? is it some weird steam-punk amalgamation? whatever it is, it doesn't really work. the various pictures on the wall (i seem to remember cowboys and burgers- but then again, i think i was a little drunk), just don't seem to mesh with the metal and the gray paint. but whatever, i was there to eat, not be an interior critic.\n\nhow long do you think for us to be seen by our waitress? 30 minutes? 40? neither of those. honestly, i would wager it was all of about 5 minutes or so before our waitress was at our table, asking for our orders. hell, we had barely even begun to look at the menu. in fact, i was a little to preoccupied with the waitress herself, who was looking really good with her tattoos and nice smile. her helpfulness was also pretty alluring.\n\nnow, speaking of the menu, which is really what this whole thing is about isn't it? it's not especially big, by which i mean there wasn't a huge selection to chose from. the place brands itself as a breakfast joint, and they have a decent amount of offerings in that department, but i was more interested in something a little more traditional. i picked the burger and only after i made that decision did i realize it had <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> on it. <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>? on a burger? what the hell? well, i was in vegas and it was late, and i was hungry, and i had to live a little, so i went with it. plus, the waitress (who's name i can't remember, although i wanna say it was gia, or something like that) had been so nice and i didn't want to make her hate me. my buddy, also drunk and clearly feeling the effects of drunk hunger, ordered the chicken and waffles on the suggestion of our server. she said it was good and what most people ordered. she also said the portions were huge.\n\nwhen she said huge, she meant it. my burger came and i swear to god the thing stood like 8 inches tall. so much meat and toppings crammed in it. yes, those <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> took up some of that space and i debated scratching them off with a knife, but they must have put those potatoes in there for a reason, right? i went ahead and just dove right in, tastes be damned. i can say that whoever made the decision to put those fluffy, white, mashed roots on a hunk of beef is a culinary genius and deserves an award. simply put, my burger was delicious. i couldn't even finish all of it in one sitting, however i was able to take it back to the hotel and eat the rest of it for lunch the next day. it was almost like a whole new meal. as far as the chicken and waffles went, those too, should win some type of prize. they came pilled up on a plate in some kind of pyramid like stack, ready for consumption.  oh, and those waffles had bacon in them. yes, tasty, salty, crunchy, glorious bacon, mixed into the batter! \n\nwould i recommend this place? yes!\nwould i return? that would be a resounding hell yes!",

            "got the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, which was highly recommended here on yelp and was featured on man vs. food and boy it did not fail to deliver! soo delicious - wish i could have eaten it all, but sadly there was just so much food and there was no fridge or microwave in our hotel. :( the giant serving comes with a huge piece of <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breast with egg, tomato, bacon, spinach, <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> all topped with a slightly spicy house bechamel sauce. if you get it to go, the sauce comes on the side, which is a nice touch and allowed me to adjust the amount of sauce i wanted (so you might want to ask for it on the side as well judging by how much sauce comes on it otherwise). the only thing i wish was that sage flavor on the chicken came through a little more. not too pricey given the portion size. i came here around 7 am on a saturday so it was not very full (there were maybe 4 parties are so sitting). my take out order came out in less than 10 minutes, which was certainly impressive. the restaurant is pretty small overall though so i can see how it gets insanely packed. my advice, come early. you won't regret it.",

(my suggestion is to make a dish with those three and keep the chipotle on the side).  within minutes of eating a little less than half, i was very ill.  now, this could only be the food, and not the 17 or so vodka tonics from the night before...or the bloody mary i had while waiting.  be warned. \n\nmy companions had various versions of: flank steak, chunk hash browns, various veggies, and biscuit - and it all looked really messy and unappealing.  one friend had the bblt (just add bacon to bacon), which comes on huge texas toast, and she added a medium fried egg on the side.  that looked really good.  the service was outstanding and the time at the table, and getting out was pleasant, unrushed, and memorable (there were 7 of us).\n\nall in all, i'm so glad i had the experience, but i won't go through this kind of trouble for that kind of meal again.",

            "oh god i wish we had this place in  vancouver, bc! i loved it! \n\nmy friend and i heard alot of good things about hash house a go go so we had to try it out! knowing it was opening late at night was a plus too! we went there after a long night of partying. we ordered the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> and the chicken and waffles and shared both. \n\nwe got the chicken benny first and my lord it was amazing! my taste buds were on another level! my mouth is watering just thinking about it now haha. this had a layering of heaven! it has <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> on the bottom, with a huge piece of <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> on top of it, then <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, tomato, mozzarella, scrambled eggs with chipotle cream sauce on top.. heaven! \n\nshortly after we got the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles. it has two <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breasts with hardwood smoked <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> tower, hot maple reduction and fried leeks. by this time we got pretty full and only finished halfway and packed the rest to go. the portions were huge and sooooo good! \n\nwe ended up going there twice.. i really wanted to go a third time haha!", 
            "we met with family here for breakfast.  the portion sizes are ginormous. their servers are friendly, the food is great.  there's not much that doesn't come with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  nobody was able to finish their food.  if you're a healthy eater,  order a lot of ala carte. the eggs were great,  and the hot chocolate was out of this world.  it's hard to find if you're not familiar with the area but if you self park at the flamingo and walk straight through their casino,  past the flamingo habitat,  you'll see the linq across the street and it's right inside. the escalators are marked hash house.", 
            "i was really looking forward to hash house. everything was good, but sadly nothing was great. our server was friendly but with an agenda. there were two items he recommended - chicken and waffles, and the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. i wanted the former, so that was fine. but david, rebel that he is, wanted instead a combo of <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, eggs, bacon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and biscuit. our server tried hard to steer david back to the benedict - \"you have to trust me on this\". but it wasn't what he wanted, and he stood firm. substituting sausage for bacon was not allowed. maybe that's what happens when you wander off the recommended path. my chicken was very generous, and i loved the fried leeks on top. one piece of chicken was very good, the other had some soft and chewy bits and just didn't taste as good. the waffles were ok, but nothing special. david liked his chicken, but thought the potatoes were uninteresting and the biscuit heavy. on the way out we reminisced about an amazing breakfast we had on our last trip which was to seattle at lola. this wasn't that. it's an interesting breakfast place but not a great breakfast place.", 
            "this place gets two stars from me for being open 24 hours and a third star for good service. however, just based on quality of the food, i'd say, one star. portions are huge but the food has no taste. may be they figured the \"late late night\" diners don't care. i had a bacon/avocado scramble. it was very bland and felt like someone threw in all the leftovers into the pan. my husband ordered a benedict. and wow, we were speechless. this mess of a plate had a biscuit, scramble, deep fried battered chicken, <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  it was nowhere near a benedict and was disgusting. even the parts of the dish alone were not that good. i guess this dish's big claim to fame is that it was featured on man vs. food. i'd say you are better off eating at a fast food place.", 
            "went here around 11ish the morning after christmas and the wait for a party of 4 was about 30 minutes or so.  not too bad considering how packed it was!\na solid 5 stars for the food!!  we ordered the chorizo hash, the bacon/avocado scramble with griddled <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, sundried tomato/<mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark> scramble with crispy potatoes, and the brown sugar banana pancake (a must-try!).  the portions were huge and awesome.  the 4 of us were starving when we came in and barely finished half of all the food we ordered.  definitely recommend sharing!\nminus 1 star for the waiting area (very cramped and not a lot of space to sit or stand while you wait), noisy (the hostess screams the name of each party as tables become available and it can get annoying...also difficult to hear her over all the people...they should use a microphone/speaker system).  also, the restaurant itself was kinda dim/dark and not the cleanest.  service was okay, not great, not horrible, but got the job done.\noverall, a great brunch spot with great food (and portions), if you don't mind all the noise!", 
            "i came with a party of 10 and it took a little over an hour to get seated. it didn't feel that long because you can kill time walking around the strip. from the pictures the food looked amazing but when it actually came out we were not impressed. i ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> which came with a biscuit, bacon, two eggs, <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. everything on the plate was piled on top of each other so the syrup on the chicken got on everything and made the bread on the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> soggy. it also mixed in the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and eggs. i didn't think the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was as amazing as people said it was supposed to be. i also ordered a mimosa which was pretty good but not worth $8. the biscuit was super dry and we asked for butter but the waiter forgot and never brought it. one of my friends ordered a corn beef hash and it was overloaded with cheese. she ended up only eating a couple bites which was such a waste since, like everyone points out, the portions are huge.", 
            "okay... this place is amazing! went here two days in a row. i can't find it in myself to order anything but the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. griddled mozzarella, <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, bacon, sliced juicy tomatoes and fresh spinach, over a biscuit... topped with chipotle cream sauce. excuse me, diet what? the portion is huge and it's impossible to eat all of it, but it is just too good not to order. also tried the caramel mocha which was really tasty... not a big fan of the blt bloody mary. it was way too weak and not enough spice but to be honest, the food and service made it a perfect experience both times.", 
            "i love this place for breakfast!  haven't had any other meal here but i'm sure it's just as good as the breakfast since there's always a pretty long wait no matter what time you come!\n\nthe food definitely deserves five stars but i'm rating the entire experience so i have to knock off a star for service.  i think you're pretty safe to order just about anything on the menu and it will be wonderfully satisfying.  to me, the hand hammered port tenderloin is the absolute best choice and i've ordered it just about every time we've been here!  i take the liberty of sampling everybody else's choices though so i've eaten quite a few menu items.  no matter what i order though, i'll make sure it comes with the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> because i tell you what, those are the absolute best!\n\nservice however isn't the greatest.  it's sort of slow and sometimes really really hard to get!  it's always packed and i understand they are busy but maybe management needs to have a few more workers on the floor that can actually help the diners.  there were four workers cleaning tables and sweeping the floor that couldn't even fill our water glasses!  the servers are also pretty territorial and really won't help unless you're in their section.  that being said, they are all super friendly and smile a lot so it kind of makes you not realize you're not being helped!  it's definitely not bad enough to make me ever say i won't return, it's just not that great and people should know what to expect so i'm throwing it out there!\n\nmake sure you are hungry when you arrive and don't drink too much either because the portions are enormous!!  i'd say share an entree with somebody else but darn it, then you wouldn't get to sample more of their great cuisine!", 
            "looking for a big breakfast?  craving coffee <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and traditional american comfort foods piled in a giant mountain on your plate?\n\nthen hash house a go go is the place for you.\n\nlocated on the second floor of a recently renovated casino, they are very popular and often have quite a wait to get inside.\n\nprices are a little more than diners on the outside, but for right on the strip, it's a good option, and way cheaper than any of the casino buffets.\n\nyou already know if you like this kind of restaurant  if hash and eggs sounds good, then check it out.", 
            "i had the steak and egg special and it was amazing. the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> were perfect and the steak was cooked to order. in addition the kiwi watermelon lemonade was perfect too. definitely coming back to hash house everytime im in vegas. especially those late nights and alot of the places are closed.", 
            "came here late at night with a large group and was seated right away. i ordered \"the basic\" consisting of eggs, potatoes, and bacon. true to it's name, the meal was quite basic and was probably very basic to cook -- as the eggs seemed to be made from the powder variety <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> were over-cooked. \n\nthree stars because my friends enjoyed their meals (flapjacks seemed to be good) and huge portions of food are given for those las vegas after-club appetites.", 
            "decided to eat breakfast here based on others yelp reviews. although there was a long line it seemed to go fairly quickly. the table service was good, waiter was attentive but food was a little slow to come out. portions are huge and no way can any one person finish a meal on their own! the chicken and waffles and pancakes seemed to be very popular. prices are the same as any other breakfast diner u might eat at around vegas. my boyfriend and i split 1 pancake eggs bacon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> for $15 with some leftover ! i highly recommend!", 
            "originally, my group wanted to grab some $7 steak and eggs. good thing we decided it was too far because we ended up at hash house a go go! no regrets! there is always a line, so put your name down, get an approximate wait time, and then go gamble downstairs. check back 15-20 minutes before your wait time is up because they can give you a better estimate then.\n\n- <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash, red onions and swiss cheese: i don't normally like <mark>Corned Beef</mark> because it's too salty, but this dish was awesome!\n- <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> with market yellow tomato, spinach, bar b' que cream and topped with scrambled eggs: this was probably my favorite dish out of them all. the pork was crispy on the outside but juicy on the inside. the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> complemented the meat quite well.\n- <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> with maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> & biscuit: this was also very bomb! that <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>-egg-bacon combo is awesome.\n- <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with bacon-waffles: bacon. waffles. that was such a pleasant surprise! this dish came out last when we were completely full, but my group still devoured it like hungry kids who haven't eaten in a week.\n\nhuge portions of food that satisfied my taste buds and my belly. after dining here, you'll be asking yourself, \"what vegas body?\" don't worry, it's totally worth it.", 
            "visiting vegas for my birthday. took a cab here because of all the awesome reviews. waited an hour to eat and it was all worth it. this place brought me back to life from a night of partying and celebrating. i'm a plain jane so i got the plain buttermilk flapjack with eggs (scrambled with cheese) <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and a side of bacon. my server kai saw i was sitting alone and sat down at my table to take my order. nice personal touch. she recommended some drinks for me and i opted for the kiwi watermelon lemonade. she did advise is stir it a bit (altho it's soo pretty seeing the swirl of red yellow and green) to get the flavor a nice blend. fresh watermelon in the drink, they give you a big straw to not disturb your drinking pleasure and boy was it delish. when my meal came out i now see why they only give u one flapjack. it's huge. it took up more than half of the plate and was so soft and buttery and yummy. they give u one cup of syrup and i barely used it the flapjack takes soo great. eggs were divine, potatoes cooked awesome and bacon cooked to perfection. many thanks for such great service and great food. i opted for the souvenir cup and my total was only $35. not bad at all!! i know why it's recommended and when i return to vegas i'm coming back not only for the food but i hope to see kai there as well. she's an awesome server!", 
            "hash house is a must place to go go. they have everything from breakfast to traditional american cuisine. be warned the portions are huge! i would recommend sharing a meal with someone. i got the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, it was so good. it has biscuits topped with eggs, bacon, chicken, and a delicious gravy. it also comes with some fruit and cut potatoes on the side. this entree is a man vs food stand out and it definitely lives up to its name. my boyfriend and two of my friends got the meatloaf. they all really enjoyed it. the gravy on top of the meatloaf <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> was so good! another one of my friend got the chicken and waffles. the waffles had a nice surprise inside of them... bacon! the chicken was moist and very tasty. my last friend got the salmon plate. she also enjoyed this entree and thought the salmon was prepared very well. our server was so sweet and so attentive. we didn't get any drinks here but i would love to come back and try their blt bloody mary! :)", 
            "i was excited to try the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles but i couldn't justify ordering such a ridiculous amount of food. i wasn't in the mood for a burger but opted for the baby burger thinking it was a more appropriate amount of food. that wasn't the case. it was also served dry. i wanted to order the same breakfast potatoes with my burger that my friend ordered with her meal but was told i couldn't. i settled for bacon & cheese <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> instead. we wanted bloody beers but were told we couldn't get those either. strange because they serve both beer and bloody mary's. our server came off as friendly but then seemed somewhat annoyed and put out when i asked her questions. also strange since she said we were her first customers of the day. overall, i might go back. but only if i was sharing a meal with at least 1 more person because the meal sizes were just too enormous. a fresh baked biscuit with butter & their fresh strawberry jam with a cup of coffee would've been a better choice.", 
            "i have to start by saying that it isn't actually opened 24 hours a day (at least not during the winter) which i learned the hard way after trying to go here at 4am after a legendary vegas night out. \n\nluckily i went here prior to the failed attempt mentioned above and this place was all that i had imagined during my extensive research prior to visiting. the experience starts with the super sweet, almost overly accommodating host (whose name i can't remember). we tried to get a table for 8 but couldn't because there were only four of us present which was a little irritating but also understandable. he told us we could either wait for the others before we were seated or get seated and then move to a larger table once they came. we opted to be seated and figured we could just be separate because the others were only planning on drinking anyway. \n\nthe drink that i got (champagne cocktail of some sort) was ok but nothing noteworthy. my friends had some of the other cocktails (one blue one and one with watermelon) and they raved about them. three of us ordered the chicken and waffles which was definitely a mistake because one order could have fed us all! ok, maybe not three people but it definitely could have fed two people with moderate appetites especially if you got something else like we did. i guess it's not the waiter's job to tell you that you're ordering twice the amount you need nor do i know if they would have allowed us to split it but i do wish the option was there. the food was absolutely amazing though! the chicken was super crispy like i like and the waffles were sweet and the bacon added to the taste. my friends ordered <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and they were good too. the next day one of my friends went back and ordered the signature <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> and said it was amazing as well but also too much for one person.\n\ni'd definitely suggest hash house if you're in the area\n.", 
            "curiosity was the major reason for going to the hash house in henderson. \n\nbeing a first time patron, i decided to go easy: two eggs, one pancake, potatoes. the eggs and the pancakes were fine, the potatoes were nothing special, in quality and quantity - nothing more then grilled, salt, ... .  \n\nmy companion had corn beef hash, potatoes, two <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and a biscuit.\n1. the hash was made from shredded corn beef: the meat was taste but shredded is not the way it should be used here. this made it  difficult to swallow.\n2. the eggs were okay, like min, not extra large.\n3. the potatoes, like mine, were nothing special but not burnt.\nand 4. the potatoes were, sneak-a-ly, put  under the hash, making the portion look tremendous - fake-out.\n5. finally the biscuit: large, yes, heavy like a rock, yes.  not appetizing.\n\nthe staff were amicable, but very rehearsed: if i heard the word \"tremendous portions\"  one more time, i would have left: the manager was explaining the menu to the people in the next booth. \"tremendous portions, made fresh daily, made in-house\"\nover and over and over again.\n\nthe icing on the pancake: $28.00 is too much for a basic breakfast food.\n\nmy girlfriend said she had been to the sahara location before and it was very good. so, i repeat - this was one experience at one location.\n\ni will try again but not real soon.\n\nmichael d cohen", 
            "i yelped to find this gem. it's located in the linq hotel and casino which is currently being renovated so a lot of construction workers walking around and lots of painting walls going on. it shouldn't really cause a problem if you're just walking through like i was. \n\nnow to the restaurant, i hope you are hungry! they don't play when it comes to food here. i got the biscuits and gravy which was served over <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. wow. it was huge. i could have probably done without the potatoes just because it's starch on starch on starch, but it was tasty nonetheless. my friend got the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> with chicken. i can't remember exactly what is was called but it was insane. a tower of deliciousness. i ended up eating off that plate too :). i would imagine this is what they are known for, so don't go without giving it a try!", 
            "this place is crazy busy at breakfast time. it's located upstairs in the linq casino and the waiting area was bursting at the seams. one downfall here is that they only use a pa system to call you to your table so you are stuck waiting in all that chaos. i think our wait was well over an hour. they have a bloody mary bar set up in the waiting area which would have been great if it was properly staffed. service was super slow. \n\nonce we were seated things moved along pretty quickly. i ordered the blt bloody mary but when they brought it there was no bacon. the server ended up bringing me a piece of bacon wrapped in a napkin. sort of took away from the whole experience. on top of everything it was not the best bloody mary i have had. \n\nthe food was really good. the portions were huge! we had to try the signature <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. it was very unique and tasted great. i really loved the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. i would return but i would try to come at a less popular time or try the off strip location.",

            "this place has monstrous servings of food. \n\nthere wasn't too many people there on a sunday morning. \n\nwe ordered the chicken and waffles. that thing was gigantic of a food. there was huge pieces of bacon inside the waffles. the chicken was crispy.\n\nthe chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> was enormous. even the server stopped and said it is a huge portion. after 45 mins it still looked like she didn't even touch it. \n\ni ordered a simple scramble with avocado, onions and cheese, with their buscuit <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. their *fresh fruit* was a dinky cantalope and orange piece. so don't expect to go healthy at a place where it's all out calories and fried food. \n\noverall, it was good food if you are super hungry and hungover. i would go back for the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & Waffles</mark>. \n\nit's close to old town vegas. just right across from <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> strip.", 
            "one word-amazing!  everyone should try the hash house experience!  the portions are huge because that is kind of their thing.  it can be a bit intimidating so you have been warned.  the food also comes out as it is made so you might get some plates before others, but at least you know it isn't just sitting back there.  i had the eggs benedict with a red pepper sauce <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  it was incredible.  my husband had the reuben which i think is called a \"pub crawl\" on their menu.  it was awesome!  if you go for breakfast or brunch especially on a weekend, be prepared for a long wait.  but breakfast for dinner is always a good choice too!", 
            "perfect place to unleash my inner fat kid lol.\n\nthe eta wait time was about 45 minutes for a group of five, but when we can back to check in after said 45 minutes, they had passed our name! the hostess was nice enough to put us back on our normal spot though, but fair warning that the wait is probably shorter than they say.\n\nthe portions are humongous, it's true. i ordered a benedict, and when it came out, i had no idea that it was mine. it looked like a monster! probably because it was resting on a mount olympia model of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. intimidation aside, it was yummy and hit the spot during an inebriated vegas spell. i'm not sure how okay i would be eating it sober, but oh well lol. i even shared my dish with a friend and we both could barely finish it. good place for a group, but make sure to come with empty stomachs and a hefty vegas diet!", 
            "there was no wait - maybe because it was lunch time but the service was sucky to say the least. the waiter had no name tag but he was easy to decipher as he had a huge mohawk. our party of 6 waited 20 minutes for drinks, he was running around like a mad man from table to table ( i will say the table next to us kept ordering sides of mayonaise ? random!) the plate of chicken with waffles was huge enough for 3 people to share and a side of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> made this heavenly !! \nlater that weekend, we called back at 230am for a burger to -go and they refused to take the phone order and said we had to walk in and place it. it took 45 minutes to get it and it was just alright. i have been to the one in sd and had much better service and food at that location. i guess it comes with the tourist mecca territory.", 
            "i visited for brunch on a saturday during a girls trip to vegas recently. the wait was quite long, over an hour i believe, but once we sat, service was quick and friendly. \n\nwe all had bloody mary's, which were really tasty and the spice level was perfect. we ordered and shared three dishes- chicken and waffles, the salmon 'benedict' and <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> 'benedict.' each dish was massive... i'm not exaggerating, no one human should consume all of this food unless you're literally starving! my favorite was the chicken and waffles, the waffle was really tasty and the bacon infused syrup was amazing. on the other hand, my chicken 'benedict' was a bit of a disappointment. i found absolutely nothing wrong with it, but it was't a benedict ( it was <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> onto of a huge biscuit <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>) and it was very one-note. especially given the size, i found it hard to even make a dent in it due to the bland nature of all elements. the chicken was ok, but a little dry and did't have any distinct kick. the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> just tasted like a baked potato that had been smashed with no flavor and the biscuit was good, just didn't really add anything to the big pile of blandness. there was a ton of sauce spread on top, i'm not entirely sure what it was, but it seemed like a gravy with some sort of spice added, but that too was surprisingly bland.\n\nthere was definitely the potential for this meal to be great, but there needs to be more flavor.. more textural variation.. a kick! i would rather be given a more reasonable portion and for the dish to have more of a flavor dynamic.", 
            "after spending a fortune on lunch somewhere else, this place is just what we were looking for. something a bit less pricey, but tasty, and a nice big portion. \n\nwe walked in around 9pm on a pretty busy monday night. our wait was less than 15 minutes. we were seated and given water in less than 5 minutes. \n\nlet me tell you, this place doesn't screw around. the portion sizes are huge. the food/$ ratio is off the charts here. for two of us, our bill came to $29. i had the bacon, avocado, cheese stuffed burger with cheddar bacon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. my fianc\\u00e9 had a mozzarella and red pepper stuff burger with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. both meals were awesome and let me tell you, just one of those meals would have cost around $30 anywhere else on the strip. both meals came out steaming hot. if i had one complaint, it would be that the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> were a bit dry - needed more butter - other than that, great meal, good service, and a very, very fair price.", 
            "okay i did not actually love what i ordered but i'l take the blame on that one. i knew the food was different and was it ever! just know that everything seems to come with a boatload of home style <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> under it! everything! at first i thought it was a colossal waste of food, but quickly realized you could take the leftovers home and eat for days. so if you're a local (or a visitor with a fridge) and want a down home dining experience at a decent price this is the place for you. the food was good. i am an eggs benedict fan so if you're looking for traditional this is not the place. my dish was slathered in a reddish orange creamy bell pepper sauce. however the only thing i can't stand are bell peppers. the waitress did tell me. the eggs and the bacon sans sauce were delish though. the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> were overkill but cool at the same time. we had the best waitress ever. my coffee came up right away even before we ordered! she was leaning over all four corners of the booth, out of the blue to refill our cups, excellent service. again prices were reasonable, especially for vegas.", 
            "this place seems like it's packed 24/7 since it's open 24/7. i have a platinum rewards card so we skipped the wait (which looked ridiculous) and were seated in less than 5 min. even though that was speedy, it took about 45min for us to get our food after we ordered.\n\nthe taste of the food was good, which was probably the best part of the meal. it wasn't amazing but it was better than decent. we had the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles, <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, and the <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> scramble. the waffles were okay; i wish they had bacon bits throughout the whole thing instead of bigger pieces of bacon. the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> that came with the benedict were really good. the scramble was a little fishy but still good. \n\ni guess the portion sizes were reasonable/a really good deal for the price, but i feel like it would even be good if the prices were halves and the portions were halved. no one finished or even ate half of their meal, and i was eating with two pretty hungry guys who know how to eat. i feel like we wasted so much food because we took it to go and even though we ate some of it later, it wasn't as good and we didn't finish it. we all also felt really sleepy and tired after. i think it would be good hangover food but we weren't hung over lol\n\nif you eat here, definitely share. one entree will feed 2, maybe 3 people. i have no idea how it would be possible for one person to finish one meal. \n\ni'm not sure if i would come here again. it wasn't a terrible experience but it wasn't the best either. i liked it more than i disliked it.", 
            "stopped here on a recommendation from a friend. met all expectations!! the dishes are huge and easy to split! we split the indiana tenderloin (i think?) with the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, creamy bbq sauce, and cheese. omg, it was the most delicious meal we had in vegas! would definitely eat here again.", 
            "we learned about this place when it was on man vs food. we waited for our table for about thirty minutes. after our meal, the line was so packed. definitely came at the right time for a big brunch. these portions are out of this world big. there was three of us, and we wanted to try three dishes, so we had to go for it.\n\n<mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>:\n\nholy lord. this thing was massive. i mean, it could've fed a family of five. <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was amazing. the bacon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> were amazing. the chipotle sauce this is dripped all over is amazing. this dish will make you feel disgusting and terrific at the same time\n\nchorizo hash:\n\nsuper tasty and spicy. if you like a little kick from the jalape\\u00f1os and chorizo, this is a the dish for you\n\n<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles:\n\n<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was perfectly cooked with a tender inside and crispy outside. i loved the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>. add a little of their syrup, it's a perfect dish\n\nthis brunch was definitely all the food we needed for the day. a little overwhelming, but absolutely delicious.",

            "overall, this was one of the best eating experiences in recent memory!!  i came here on a sunday afternoon with some friends. it was my first time trying this place. i do remember it being featured on man vs. food. located in the second floor of the linq hotel, there was a 25 minute wait to an hour, but managed to get seated within a half hour or so. until then, we used that time to take a look at the menu, so that by the time we were seated and served, we'd know what we wanted to order.\n\nsince we were super hungry, it was a tough decision to make since there was such a variety of food entrees to choose from, whether you're craving something hearty to the more smaller and healthier  portions. i decided to order the <mark>HH Original</mark>. the dish featured a sweet but large helping of bacom <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> topped with two biscuits, two slices of thick bacon, tomato slices, spinach, and over easy eggs smothered in red, hot chipotle sauce.\n\noh. my. god. first of all, the portion size was quite enormous. the size of these entrees are enough to keep you full the rest of the day. all that was left after i finished was a piece of biscuit. it was soooo worth the wait! the coffee to top it all off with was nice and fresh :)\n\nour server, tawney,  was outstanding! she was super friendly and was excited aboout providing us with the best service possible, and she stuck to it. she happily shared past experiences of seeing people's reactions to the portion sizes, and also kept making sure our food arrived at our table in a promptly and timley manner. such a wonderful experience for our first time here. the next time i want to come back to vegas and crave for some good morning eats, hash house a go go at the linq is the place to go :)", 
            "went with my man for a late night meal. maybe we ordered the wrong pancake. yeah, i am pretty sure, i ordered the wrong pancake since my man tried the pumpkin one a couple of years ago and really loved it. oy vey!\n\nhe ordered a basic breakfast meal, which included 2 eggs and a choice (yeah, not multiple) of sausage, ham, bacon, or potatoes, plus a flapjack. usually places include potatoes because they are ridiculously cheap to produce. tsk, tsk hh (which i kept thinking meant happy hour). \n\nmy man ordered 2 medium <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and i choose the banana and brown sugar flapjack because i thought that \"flavor\" sounded good-wrong! to add insult to injury, they charged +$1 for this flavored pancake, ugh. \n\nthe decor is country chic, meaning they have elegant cow-hide chairs they were trying to preserve by seating everyone in the plain jane black leather seating to the right of the entrance. \n\nthe pancake was a monstrosity. maybe a 10\" diameter, not sure, but it was ginormous and not a very pretty pancake. i did not like the brown sugar, which caused one side to form a weird crust. then part of the banana tasted artificial. that is a no-no hash house a go go, a huge no no! my man said the small portion of potatoes and eggs were decent. \n\nat around $16, i still felt kind of ripped off, but at least we were stuffed. tip, do not order the banana and brown sugar flapjack, it will not please you.   \n\nhh, you should really prohibit smoking in the restaurant, it felt barbaric smelling smoke and i loathed eating in a smoked filled room. people, it is rude for anyone to light up in a restaurant (some people have no home training), we are not at your house.",

            "regretted this breakfast choice. they are making a name for themselves on the huge portions alone. or at least from the choices we made. my husband had the biscuits and gravy and i chose the adams <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. both were obscene, which don't get me wrong, we were expecting, however, they were missing flavor. they served both dishes on top of dry <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> (about 4 to 5 large potatoes worth of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>). the biscuits for both dishes were also very dry. the chicken was good and i enjoyed the hollandaise sauces (but there definitely wasn't enough sauce to moisten the family size portion of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> on my plate). my husband didn't enjoy his gravy at all and actually was sick afterwards.  the wait was long for a table and the food was slow to come to the table. overall, i really expected a better meal after an hour. next time we'll go back to guy's for his huge but also flavorful breakfast.", 
            "do not enter unless you are super hungry . this place has a cool vibe as soon as you walk in. the decor is fabulous. portion sizes are massive and the menu for dinner is fantastic. tiffany looked after us and she was super friendly. my husband ordered the 1/2 rack of ribs which came with carrots, beans and amazing wasabi <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> whilst i opted for something lighter and had the warm spinach salad.  the food came out within minutes. the ribs had an asian flavour to them which was complimented by the wasabi mash. the spinach salad was extremely fresh, dressed with a tasty zingy balsamic fusion.  i'm going again today to check out the breakfast menu with room in my belly.", 
            "i can see why this place has so many great reviews. the big portions are a novelty, yes, but they also taste delicious. i ordered the quesadilla on top of a bed of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and i was not at all disappointed. i could barely eat 1/3 of it but it was very satisfying. \n\nthe wait time was less than they predicted for us and our food felt very fresh as well. the server was nice and very prompt despite the busy atmosphere. \n\nyes it is pricey but it's a good dining experience!", 
            "so my bf and i were looking for a breakfast spot, a friend of ours recommend we try this place so we did, i personally wasn't impressed, i think its an ok place nothing special, they do have huge portions but thats it. my bf had the stuffed burger with fries thats was good, fries were nicely seasoned, i had the steak and eggs with a side of bacon, my steak had a good flavor but it had a lot of fat so it was kinda gross, the grilled <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> were also pretty good and the bacon was nice and crisp, other than that, i really don't have anything else to say, i did see a lot of people ordering the chicken and waffles so i might consider giving this place another chance.",

            "i am in love! this place has humungous portions, and our group of five, got four entrees and shared, but we still had leftovers! i originally wanted to try the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict, but i was the size of the plate, and was immediately intimidated. i opted for the sausage gravy and biscuits, which came over a bed of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and some fruit. loved it! the beau had the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash, which was also really good. my twin sister had the chicken and waffles, and wow! the size of that dish! her bf went for the omelette with salmon(? not sure of the name), but that was also delicious and more on the healthier side. definitely worth the wait. must go, and must try!\n\nalso, our server billy was great! exceptional all around!", 
            "whenever we are in las vegas this is a must eat for  breakfast/brunch. here's my review:\n\n 1) service - 3 stars. it's my first time to dine in this location and it was packed! waited for 30 mins to be seated and another 30 mins for the food. our waitress was nice and deliver our drinks as fast as possible. \n\n2) food - 5 stars. for the price and the portion of the food that you get its so worth it! we ordered only 2 entrees for a group of 4. we all shared it and left the restaurant pretty stuffed! my favorite is the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with waffles! the chicken is crispy on the outside, soft and juicy in the inside, and then you drizzled it with the maple syrup that comes with it and it's heaven!  we also ordered the original benedict, it's loaded with carbs (biscuits on top of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>), tomatoes, spinach and bacon. in case you were wondering the red strings that they put in a every dish is a deep fried angel hair pasta. not sure if it's just for decoration but it gives a nice crunch to the dish.\n\n3) ambience - 3 stars - nice atmosphere for breakfast and the place looks clean.", 
            "mmm yummm!! my friend and i stopped by here for lunch on our last day in vegas and boy am i glad we did! there was a little of a wait to get seated but the wait probably only took about 15 minutes or so. so we originally wanted to order 2 entrees to share and good thing we didn't because after asking our server, he said we should definitely share. so we decided to get the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> that everyone is highly raving about in the reviews. and apparently, this plate was showcased in man vs food! we also ordered a mint mocha latte to share. when our dish arrived, we just kind of stared at it in astonishment and relief that we did not order 2 plates! that <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> was massive in width and height. loll. the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was fried perfectly and tasted really good especially with the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, eggs, tomatoes, bacon, and the thick sauce that the dish came with. such yummy goodness! even after splitting this dish, both my friend and i couldn't finish it. it was just so much food!! the mint mocha latte was really good also; just a perfect amount of mintiness! :) i need to bring my bf here next time!", 
            "insane amount of food at a good price!  sure it seems expensive, but you're essentially getting two meals for one price. i had the biscuits and gravy that had <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> buried in gravy and wasn't too sure how that could be pulled off, but all-in-all, it was pretty damn good. the wife had the maple chicken that was simply amazing. i heard it gets really crowded here, so get there early.", 
            "i love this place! been here twice and it hasn't disappointed me. the food is delicious and the portions are huge, so make sure you come in with an appetite. i recently had the bone in rib-eye and it came with some really delicious pumpkin <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> along with some vegetables. had the chicken and waffles before that and i could barely eat half the plate... and i do enjoy eating food, so you know there's a problem there. lol",

            "food is ok (i like the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> instead of hash browns), but the place is pretentious and expensive. they need to master the basics, like cleanliness  -- had a big glop of something on my menu and a sticky fork. the pretense (big sprig of rosemary stuck in the biscuit) may justify the higher price, but a biscuit with no butter seems a little dry. portions are huge."

            "with a room full of robuchon gifts leftover our fourth day would have been an easy one to sleep in and eat breakfast in the room - but why do things easy when there are so many great places to dine in las vegas?  despite my multiple trips to sin city in the past i'd regretfully been without a car on past visits and as such never been able to visit the local legend of \"twisted farm food\" - hash house a go-go.  having heard that a third (the other in san diego) location of the famous spot had recently opened in the imperial palace and waking up early as ever we made our way to the restaurant around 8:00am without reservations and found only 3-4 tables occupied.\n \nwith late eighties classics blasting we made our way to the hostess podium where we were greeted by a young lady clad in jeans and a hhagg shirt who led us to a four-top big enough for eight - no doubt hash house does everything big.  taking a seat we were soon greeted by our server, noelle, a pleasant young woman who was substantially more cordial and efficient than necessary at such a restaurant (a good thing, for sure.)  menus in hand we were left to decide while a mountainous eggs benedict passed by en route for another table.  hilariously enough, while we were waiting a group of six young men approached the hostess stand and then left because \"oh man, we thought this was a buffet.\"  clearly they'd not seen the portion sizes.\n \nsitting and chatting while coffee, water, orange juice, and tea were filled we decided to order only three items and share them around.  with prices ranging from $7-$17 we were informed that one of us would have to pay a $2 split entree fee - when i chuckled saying okay the response was \"you'd be amazed how angry some people get about it\" - clearly i'm jaded.  sitting back and listening to rock you like a hurricane while sipping the surprisingly good coffee the restaurant slowly filled up.\n \narriving in less than 20 minutes the portions were precisely as expected - enormous and delicious looking.  with a sweet, a savory, and a \"dessert\" there was too much food for four people.  beginning first with the blackberry granola flapjacks, my sister's choice although i'd lobbied for the snickers flapjacks, the pancake itself was enormous - literally the size of a car tire in diameter though thankfully not as thick.  with ample warm syrup and butter to spread there was really nothing subtle or nuanced, it was just good cofort food and the sweet blackberries worked nicely with the crunchy honey granola.\n\nperhaps the most famous hash house dish would be my order - \"<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> stacked with our famous <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>, hot maple caramel reduction and crowned with fried leeks.\"  golden and crispy the chicken was amply accented with sage and actually quite delicious.  stacked above and below four golden waffles loaded with whole strips (not small bits like other places) of salty bacon and topped with crispy leeks plus a sauce that was much more maple than caramel i have to admit that this was a huge portion of food.  while clearly not as subtle and refined as bouchon's chicken and waffles i actually much preferred this to roscoe's famous los angeles version and the less famous option at dc's founding farmers.\n\nour dessert would be <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark> topped with ice cream and served with a cup of coffee.  with the coffee alone costing $2.50 on the menu this <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark> is the deal of the breakfast menu at a mere $7.95.  a portion easily large enough for two hungry people or a family of four to share after dinner the pudding was essentially a black and white coffee cake that would have filled 3/4 of a standard loaf pan.  buttery and rife with chocolate the steaming hot pudding was then topped with melted snickers bars, doused with chocolate and caramel syrups, then piled high with two large scoops of vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, and crumbly brown sugar.  like the other choices there was nothing subtle about this caloric monster but honestly for all its audacity it was really quite good.\n\nsettling the bill (about $14 each after tax and a 25% tip) and returning a large portion to the kitchen (we still had p.u.b. leftovers and the robuchon basket in the room) we thanked our service team and made our way to <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> accompanied by eddie van halen's eruption.  generally a fan of refined flavors, elaborate cooking techniques, quiet dining rooms, excellent service, and great food hash house a go go wasn't exactly my kind of place - but the service was excellent and the food was pretty darn good.", 
            "this \"twisted farm food\" caf\\u00e9 in the heart of the imperial palace was my breakfast location of choice for way to many early mornings. the urban/farm type decor is different, but well kept and clean. the food here is an experience to say the least. the menu is expansive to say the least with specialties such as <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> which is a 14oz budweiser and a side of bacon! or the blt bloody mary. they are known here for their <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles which are extreme for sure. please see a few of the pictures for the full impact. the service here was spot on, all the staff is younger sort of \"punk rock\" which fits the feel in general, but the food left me a bit confused. i never had the signature giant pancake or the chicken and waffles..but i did try several other items and found the experience to be pretty bi-polar. the home made giant biscuits that are given table side (and come with most any entree) are fun due to their sheer girth (that's right i said girth!)...but one bit left me tasting baking soda and begging for honey, or butter, or jam...or anything to quench my now parched gullet. this went the same for their signature \"hashes\" for breakfast. the \"crispy potatoes\" they are all built upon reminded me of the potatoes found downstairs at the buffet...i had the \"<mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark>\" skillet which was the driest experience laid upon potatoes i could have hoped for...although the skillet meatloaf breakfast was a nice change. the \"stuffed\" burger here are tasty, but beware the horseradish <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. i got these for dinner one night and lugged them back to my room. there was sooo much horseradish on the taters that i literally coughed them right back up. i know i know..sorry for the visual, but i don't want any fellow yelper's getting sucker punched by these taters in the future.\nperhaps i just ordered the wrong items 4 out of 7 meals, but i think if the food completely catches up with the service and hype, then this place is going to be a real vegas draw!", 
            "here we go with another superfluous review of hash house a go go.  we all know it, it looks like most of us love it.\n\ni seriously thought i was going to die during my wait for a table at hash house.  my weekend in vegas was coming to a close, and none too soon.  i killed more brain cells than i want to consider, and i was so ill from overconsumption that i could hardly sit up without battling the urge to hurl.  it was gnarly, at best.  i am so glad i waited, because hash house magically cured me.\n\ntake my advice - if you had some errors in judgment during your saturday night in vegas, spend your sunday morning by trekking to the imperial palace, wading through the smoke and celebrity impersonators, and taking the escalator to hash house a go go.  order a coke, and pick a skillet.  i suggest the chorizo.  devour it.  then go blow $50 in the penny slots and consume a hair <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> that bit you.  all will be right in the universe again, trust me.", 
            "the best chicken & waffles i've ever had in my life. roscoe's can suck it!\n\ni was guided here by yelp after searching for some nearby breakfast foodstuffs. reviews were solid, and they spoke of portions so huge they were legendary. finding it inside the imperial palace was a little tricky, but a helpful security guard guided us while he told me about how \"you can't go wrong with anything\" in regards to what i should order. we got seated no problem - must have come during a lull. \n\nmy eyes immediately locked on the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles once i was presented with the menu. two succulent fried breasts of chicken placed atop a tower of four <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>, coated in syrup. call a cardiologist because i was ready to risk a heart attack for this meal. \n\nof course, i can't have a big breakfast meal without a suitable beverage. enter the b.l.t. mary, a 20 oz. bloody mary made with bacon-infused vodka, all the usual fixings, and garnished with a strip of bacon, romaine lettuce and a tomato slice. it also came with a single piece of white toast that my gf noted looked like a large melba toast. i opted out of eating it, though. \n\ngood thing, too, because my jaw went slack when she brought out my order. the portion was gargantuan. i quickly dove in. the chicken tasted like something sweet had been added after the deep-frying, making it ridiculously savory in addition to being extremely succulent. the waffles were so chock full of bacon that it was protruding from every seam. <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> of chicken, waffle and syrup was the experience i wanted to have at roscoe's, but never got. the flavors were so good that i drove myself to finish off both breasts and 3 of the waffles entirely. after that, i was certain my stomach was about to explode. \n\nmy gf got the \"basic two eggs with potatoes, bacon and fruit\" for $6.95, but there was nothing basic about it. the plate was huge, and she could barely finish it off. even their most unassuming items are still enough food for two. total out <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> was about $35, and worth every single penny. i'll be making this my go-to breakfast spot in vegas from now on.",

            "i was so excited to try this place out and hyped it up so much i didn't think it could disappoint. i saw this place featured on man v. food and on countless billboards around the strip. this location, inside imperial palace, had a huge line and fairly long wait. i was famished and didn't mind the wait as long as the food lived up to all the hype. before i even looked at the menu, i knew i wanted to order their signature dish...the chicken and waffles. while i waited for my order to arrive, i saw a wide arry of delicious dishes being zipped back and forth in front of our table. all looked craftly plated, with huge heaping portions. i salivated each time my beloved (or so i thought) chicken and waffles would zip in and out of my line of sight. finally it arrived, moment of truth. i bite into my deep <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breasts and was underwhelmed to say the least. batter was soggy, not crispy with the resounding crunch i had imagined. i gave them the benefit <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> and moved on to the waffles, hoping that hash house would redeem themselves here. but alas, i was disappointed yet again. the waffles were huge, and filed with bacon which made my eyes grow large with a childlike wonder, yet i lamented again when i found those waffles to be soggy and rather flat in flavor. \n\nneedless to say i walked away from this place pretty much disappointed. will probably not be returning anytime soon...at least not on my own accord.",

            "food is good and portions big, but felt like i was in a grind joint.  we were a party of three.  one person was served before the other two and since his mother taught him not to begin eating until everyone has their plate in front of them, he sat waiting while his food grew cold.  \n\nbut that is the least of what went wrong.  \n\nthough there were numerous tables open we were seated next to a serving station that was the size of a shoe box.  normally i would refuse a table next to a serving station but it was so small i thought it would be no big deal.  wrong!  waiters frequented the station every minute or two.  they slammed doors and tossed silverware creating a noise on the level one would expect to find in a las vegas nightclub.   \n\ni asked to be moved but the wait staff (not ours) was unresponsive.  before i could find our waiter the other tables soon filled making moving impossible.\n\nmy table mates and i had to yell at each other to be heard, so i'm sure we paid forward the uncomfortable noise level. \n\nwhy would they have a table next to such a noisy serving station?  and since they do, why don't they train their staff to eliminate as much noise as possible, i.e. don't slam <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark>, don't toss the silverware, place it.\n\nwill never go there again.",

            "this place is a trip. when you walk in off the strip, you have to walk through a construction tunnel. there are barely any signs outside to announce that any business is still active. once inside, the casino is so old that the slot machines may as well be from the times, when i was a teenager. the ceiling is slow. the air conditioning is set on energy-saver mode. there is an elevator that takes you up. i mean i pushed the button. i couldn't quite tell, if it was moving up or merely idling. the light for the buttons was broken. the air conditioning definitely didn't reach in there. sweat was pouring down my front, back, everywhere. \"las vegas has them now,\" the line from the movie hangover flashed in my head. there definitely was no telling, if i'd get out of this elevator.\n\neventually, <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> opened one floor higher. the restaurant was equally aged. the web site promised farm fresh produce. that made me think of healthy food. it's not healthy. it's super sized southern portions. omg, i had a tower of waffles with a pile of <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> on top. someone stabbed a knife through it to keep it from toppling. it was at least a foot high. the plates were made for giants. this place is really about the portions that are so over the top and over the top again that your eyeballs fall out. it's like a freak show of food. it's definitely worth the experience of checking it out once.\n\ni recommend splitting an entree with a party of 10. and, be sure to ask for a wolf-pack-sized doggie bag.\n\nhint: there are coupons floating around.",

            "well......we all know that the portions here are gigantic so you might as well leave your diet out <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> because there's no point in trying to make \"healthy\" choices here. the wait can be long....actually it's always long. expect at least a minimum of 35 minutes for a small group. \n\nonce you're seated, service here is quite prompt. the staff here are pretty equipped in getting your order and meals delivered quickly without making you feel like you have to gulp down your meal. \n\ni ordered the hash with sun dried tomatoes and artichoke hearts and egg whites.....as healthy as i can make it! chris ordered the \"healthy start\" with a side of chicken sausage. our friend ordered the bbblt sandwich and another friend ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>. we all agreed to ordering a side of the brown sugar banana flapjack and an iced banana latte. \n\nof course our eyes pretty much fell out of our socket when each of our meal arrived. we didn't know how to manage the portion, but we all took one bite at a time. everyone enjoyed their meal. the bbblt was met with a lot of satisfaction along with their famous <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>. you know it's good when all you see are smiles and thumbs up from everyone. matter of fact, it was so good that we all agreed to come back again the next day!! i enjoyed heir biscuit. it was dense on the outside and the inside was soft and pillowy. the strawberry jam added another level of \"omg\" to their food. the latte was one of my favorite drink which surprised me. the brown sugar flapjack was too good!! the carmelites brown sugar and the banana was a match made in flapjack heaven. we all finished it but i think chris and i ate a majority of it. but there is no regret! \n\nthe next day, chris and i returned and ordered the same thing except we ordered the snickers flapjack and a mint choco latte. the latte was okay. i prefer the banana latte over this one and the snickers was good but by far, our favorite was still the brown sugar flapjack. \n\nhash house is a basic staple must here. it's nothing fancy and nothing gourmet about it. it's farm food to another level. it definitely is a place where you have to at least try it once or twice. and in our case, twice!!", 
            "this place has monstrous servings of food. \n\nthere wasn't too many people there on a sunday morning. \n\nwe ordered the chicken and waffles. that thing was gigantic of a food. there was huge pieces of bacon inside the waffles. the chicken was crispy.\n\nthe chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> was enormous. even the server stopped and said it is a huge portion. after 45 mins it still looked like she didn't even touch it. \n\ni ordered a simple scramble with avocado, onions and cheese, with their buscuit <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. their *fresh fruit* was a dinky cantalope and orange piece. so don't expect to go healthy at a place where it's all out calories and fried food. \n\noverall, it was good food if you are super hungry and hungover. i would go back for the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & Waffles</mark>. \n\nit's close to old town vegas. just right across from <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> strip.", 
            "this place was highly recommended by a couple of people. the place looked nice and the staff was friendly. they had a pretty decent sized menu and i was debating on a couple of things. i got the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash which was good, and my fianc\\u00e9 had the biscuits and gravy & really liked it. <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> side was that they advertised they had the best bloody mary's and it wasn't good at all. it said it had a fresh tomato pinwheel & bacon, and mine was only served with a green bean, olive, and lemon. and the mix wasn't good either, not very flavorful and  tasted watered down. and i'm sure this would be different if i was going back to my house or something, but the portions were monstrous! i'm one of those people who hates wasting food and there is absolutely no way i would be able to finish any of the plates they had there. i wish they would've told us how extremely big the portions were and we could have split something. and again if i would've been going home i could've taken leftovers, but we were walking the strip so that wasn't an option. since i hate wasting food, we overstuffed a togo box, which shows how much food we both had left, and gave it to a homeless group on the strip asking for food. so just a heads up from the staff to anyone that hasn't eaten there before would be nice.",

            "omg - i have never been to hash house a go-go before.  i am now a lifelong loyal hard core fan!!!!\n\ni had been hearing amazing things about the place for a few years and decided i just had to go last time i was in vegas.  we went for breakfast and arrived around 10:00 or 10:30.  the line was huge!  out <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark>, standing room only in the waiting area, back to back kind of line.  we took the number we were given and with a wait time estimate of \"about an hour\" went down to the casino to lose some cash while we waited.  \n\nafter about 30 minutes we went back upstairs to the standing room only section and waited about 20 more minutes until a seat on one of the benches opened.  we sat down and waited another 30  minutes for our names to be called.  be prepared to wait!!!!!  the wait is long but it is totally worth it!\n\nthe place has an awesome ambiance.  they have several different dining areas all with a different feel.  they have tons of wait staff all wearing awesome and fun socks.  the abundance of wait staff makes your wait time for re-fills or condiments close to zero.  the food took awhile to get out but we were warned about that when we were seated because of how busy it was.\n\nthe food is actually artwork!  i got a blt that was the size of a toaster with a huge piece of sage sticking out of it.  it was amazing and delicious.  when i got the bill for it i actually laughed out loud.  i had been in vegas for 4 days now and had paid way too much for subpar food - this food was awesome and comparably super cheap - great value!!!!!!!!\n\ni am told hash house a go-go has a couple of locations in different cities - i will make sure to go for a visit every time i am in one of those cities!\n\ngo to hash house and enjoy!!!!  5 stars for food, price, wait staff and every thing else!", 
            "i really wanted to make sure we ate well in vegas and boyyy did hash house and go go help accomplish that on the breakfast end!! i found this place on google and after so many good yelp reviews i placed it on the \"to eat list\". the hubby and i woke up early friday morning and did our morning stroll of the strip (walking from mandalay all the way to this location to work up our appetite). this location is located in the back of the harrah's hotel which can be confusing because it notes on here that it is near the linq. the wait here on a friday morning at 9am was long! i guess i wasn't the only one that had done my research. i placed our name on the list and was told it would be a 25 to 30 minute wait. the hostess informed each guess that you could purchase a bloody mary while you waited. also, the restaurant doesn't have a bathroom for its patrons, so if you need to go i would suggest going before you eat-- you have to go down the stairs around the corner and through the woods (jk on the woods part) to get to the restroom. finally after waiting we were called and placed at a very nice looking booth. the breakfast menu looked so good the hubby and i didn't know where to start. the menu prices are also very reasonable-- so there is something on here for everyone. my husband ended up ordering the basic meal and the house strawberry shortcake, while i opted to try the famous chicken and waffles, a side of bacon, and a side of eggs. also what's being in vegas without ordering a drink for breakfast!?? i ordered the spiked kiwi watermelon lemonade, which was amazing!!! if i could i would start a lot my mornings with this drink! it took a little while for our food to come out (25 minutes or so) but i gave them the benefit <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> since they had a packed house. my husband enjoyed every bit of his meal. my plate of chicken and waffles was massive. there was no way i was going to be able to finish it on my own. i enjoyed my waffles and chicken but i felt the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> could have been seasoned a little better. my husband really enjoyed his strawberry shortcake as well. our service was really good and when i am back in the vegas area, i will be back to this restaurant!", 
            "we had been told by many a people that we just had to go here. so after a late night of gambling and some sleep we trudged over to linq to have chicken and waffles. \n\nwhen we entered we knew we were going to be in for some good food. there was a line out <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> and a 20 minute wait. luckily we were well prepared and enjoy people watching. \n\nwe each ordered mimosas and split the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles. they. were. amazing. and the plate was absolutely gigantic. i'm so glad we chose to share. it was the perfect meal and kept us full for most of the day. i'm a sucker for bloddy mary's and wish i would have gotten the blt mary. i saw another table ordered a round and i plan on getting one next time we are in vegas. tomato slice, piece of lettuce, bacon and a side of toast. \n\nbeyond the food, the service was prompt and impeccable. we watched all the waiters whip back and forth with huge smiles. the bussers were right on the empty tables and the turn around time was impressive. \n\nthis is a must go to, as in the name a go go. we will be back."

            "i will give 4 stars based on my favorite meal...the tractor driver breakfast with the banana brown sugar pancake.  i visited vegas for a week and came to hash house a go go three times for breakfast/brunch and one late night trip to split <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark> and a watermelon lemonade (which was a little too sweet for my taste).  one visit we had a bad experience by waiting an hour for the food and an indifferent waitress.  i was immediately hooked on their fresh tangerine juice, but they only had it for my first visit.  the banana brown sugar pancake is so delicious.  the way the brown sugar sort of carmelizes to a yummy and sweet crunch...divine.  the griddled <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> were good.  warning:  their portions are scary huge.  i recommend sharing at this place regardless of what you order.  they send home leftover pancakes in a small pizza box to give you an idea.  all the items i saw or ordered came on platters or giant round plates that must have weighed five pounds alone.  a woman next to us the night we went in for dessert ordered a chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> which looked like a giant flying saucer of crust had crashed into it.  for my first trip, i got the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> which was good, but a little too much and too heavy for me.  my other trips were all about that banana brown sugar pancake.  trust me, if you like bananas, you can't go wrong.", 
            "if you've eaten here and can't get full off the portions of the food they serve here, you are clearly lying! the portion sizes at hh are ginormous! i have a huuuggge appetite, and i need to share with someone else to keep my tummy from exploding. i consider the prices a bargain for how much food we got and the quality of it. it's also nice that it's centrally located on the strip in imperial palace.\n\nmy first visit here, i ordered the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash loaded with baked potato chunks and topped with 2 eggs. i almost died trying to finish my half of the dish, but it did wonders to my massive hangover. \n\ni came here again this last weekend, and decided to try the popular <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles. the order came with two large breaded chicken breasts and 4 waffles. the breading was derish! but the chicken was really dry, and difficult to finish by the end of the meal. the waffles were amazing! i took my first bite of the waffle and realized that there were bacon strips grilled into the waffles. my friend, who is a loose vegetarian, looovvveeed the waffles.\n\nwe also ordered the fries. i don't know what was in the seasoning, but it was bomb! :) \n\ni tried a bunch of different dishes as well (to help my friends out... obvi!). the quesadilla, which was probably the size of 4 normal ones, was stuffed with potatoes, jalapenos, eggs and tomato. super flavorful and spicy. the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> looked nothing like a <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> and overly rich with taste. the dish came with a ginormous piece of fried tortilla chip that looked like an upside down sombrero. i think that was the \"crust\" of the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>. the sausage gravy stuff was on top, and we realized later on that the huge mound of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> was hiding under the sombrero chip. o_o\n\nafter we were done eating, even though the table still had a good portion of food on it, our waitress entertained us with the thought of dessert... maybe next time.",

            "this place was amazing enough for me and my friends to go to twice in a row! the waiter was quirky and funny, and also very friendly :) he recognized us the second time we came too (\"oh, long time no see!\") we heard about the giant portions of hash house, and we starved ourselves accordingly. still, we could only order 3 plates for 6 people :\\ be warned that there it is $2.50ish for every extra plate they put on the table for sharing! so with both days, we ordered:\n\nchicken and waffles: amazing. a-maaaaa-zingggggg!!!!!! we ordered this twice because it was so good! big bacon strips cooked right into the waffle and sticking out at all sorts of delicious angles! not too sweet to overpower, yet not too salty to be weird. yum. i could eat a whole plate by myself! the chicken was not bad either, though alone i felt that it was a bit bland. the fried green onions around it also gave the dish a great zing!\n\n<mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>: not really a benedict, as there is no hollandaise sauce. instead, it is a creamy chipotle sauce that my friends loved. they actually ordered extra sauce ($1.95) and cleaned it completely. the benedict was very filling, but also good...i'm just not really sure what i ate aside from the chicken and the biscuit or something...\n\nmeatloaf: holy mother of pearl this was good! meatloaf was tender and held together just right! the potatoes were also very delicious and the green beans were cooked to a nice delicate crunchy perfection! carrots were meh, but no one's complaining with the rest of the dish! tip: meatloaf tastes orgasmic with the chipotle cream sauce!\n\nchicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>: this was very good as well. light and a teensy bland/plain compared to the other dishes, but still good in its own right. my friend busted out the tabasco to spice it up, and i put in a bit more salt and pepper. chicken was moist, and the chunks of potato and veggies were all cooked just right. only thing was that the biscuit was hard as a rock. i think i finally broke one with my teeth and a part of the biscuit flew out and near hit the person across from me. i don't mind too much though as the rest of the dish (and the other dishes) were so good.\n\npancake, scrambled eggs, potatoes: the pancake is giant! the godfather of all pancakes! it was probably 5 normal ihop pancakes (make that 6 or 7) clumped together and stacked with another 6 or 7 pancakes! not as delicious as the waffle imo, but definitely a wow factor. the pancake had a good taste, but at some points it did feel like it was way too thick for me (not what she said). not much to say on the eggs (they were normal?), but the potatoes had this weird crunchiness which made us wonder if it was leftover fried potatoes from breakfast/lunch...seemed to be re-fried or something. both <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> need more salt, but i honestly just wouldn't order this dish. why get pancakes when you got chicken and waffles?!?\n\noverall? mouthgasm. it was funny seeing my guy friends just put a bite in their mouth, sit back, and siiiiiiiiiiiiigh. definitely come here when you stop by vegas! oh, and as for pricing...this was essentially all-you-can-eat as there was so much food and you definitely need to share! total for both times (again, 5-6 people, 3 dishes) came out to be around $15 with tip/tax+2 extra sauces. great deal for delicious food in giant portions!", 
            "oh my god, the portion sizes are huge!!\n\nsome girlfriends and i came here for a late breakfast after a late night out on the strip. it was about 11:30 when he showed up and we waited about 20 minutes. it doesn't matter when you come--you will have to wait at least 20 minutes.\n\ni ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles. i know this is supposed to be 'the thing' to get here, but i'll honestly say i was not that impressed. there was far too much sage and even with bacon baked right into the waffles, they didn't have much flavor. my friends ordered the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>, which i like a lot more.\n\nthe service was okay. this place is always busy, so the wait staff is constantly go-go-going (hence the name of the place, perhaps?). it's hard to navigate through the place without being bumped in to by a waiter or waitress in a hurry. all in all though, they do an okay job.", 
            "omg!! portions can get insane depending on what you get! my boyfriend and i had breakfast here before we left to head home to the bay area. he ordered the chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> and i had <mark>French Toast</mark>. the chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> was enormous. he couldn't even finish it halfway. that's rare for him! i barely finished my <mark>French Toast</mark>. my <mark>French Toast</mark> wasn't huge, it just had a lot of sides. service was great, although for breakfast you would have to wait about 30 min because it gets pretty packed. but if you can get in a lot sooner than that, that's even better! i want to come back and try their lunch menu next time.",

            "hash house a go go is definitely a new favorite of mine. we stopped by for dinner before our evening outings. the place was only at 50% capacity,  but for some reason as a table of 7 we were forced to wait 15 minutes. \n\nour server was very cheery and helpful but service overall was quite slow. he would linger for too long when we didn't need him, yet completely disappear when we required something. very annoying. \nservice: d+ (-1 star for that)\n\ni ordered <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark>: two eggs + sausage accompanied by one gigantic pancake. opted for the brown sugar banana flappy for an extra $1. eggs and sausage were nothing special, but that pancake was absolutely insane. 1.5 feet in diameter with at-least two bananas inside! tasty but overall too sweet, and too much of it; like trying to eat bananas foster alone for dinner. i barely ate half of the pancake. \n\nthankfully the girlfriend's [chicken] breast was the perfect savory item to balance my sweets. delicious with yet again very generous portions. i'd be tempted to order this next time. \n\nothers ordered the chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> and meat loaf: only good things to say about them. even the kid's cheeseburger looked decent and large enough to satisfy the average adult. everything was reasonable priced as well. most items were $12-$20. very impressed. \nfood: a-\n\n**tips\n-don't be the fool that fills up on those delectable honey biscuits. \n-if your name isn't takeru kobayashi, you're not going to finish your food. don't try to be a hero, son. \n-not in the mood to devour a small animal? you better split something. \n\ndefinitely a go go for me!", 
            "oh really? 4 stars? how? i ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>. it was dry... rosco's in la is so much better... or maybe i'm just spoiled by rosco's... and popeyes... popeye's are better than dat piece of dry meat that i had on top of that mountain of <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>.. which is pretty good... so next time. i would stay away from dat <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and get that waffle at the side.. oh.. chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> sucked too.. marie calendars would be better... sigh.. what a let down. we waited 2 hours for dat...", 
            "we ate dinner there. the portions are huge, at lest twice the size of regular portion. we wish somebody had informed us of that, we would have order half of the food. chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> was very good. burgers, kids and adults were ok testing but the quality, we thought, was lucking. we ended up with bunch of burger leftovers that nobody wanted to eat next day. if you want to eat on budget and don't care much about the quality of food you just have to share the portions and you get a good bank for your buck.", 
            "hash house is your typical american diner with big taste and big portion! the second time around i got to tried way more items on the menu and learned to share everything! like before the banana pancake is super fluffy with a caramelized crust that's irresistibly addictive! the chicken waffle is also really good especially if you like herby sage batter and crispy waffles...oh wait, they're bacon filled crispy waffle! if you're really hungry, go for the chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>. that thing is not big, it's huge! it's also filled with very heavy thick cream that's really filling. i just wish it has more veggies and that the veggies are cut into smaller pieces and softer. the scramble is just okay. it's probably the smallest portion out of items i just listed...however super cheesy and flavorful.  \n\nthe service is a little lacking as it's such a busy place; however the waitresses tried to remember as much as they can and were very nice about everything.", 
            "their chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> is a must. it will definitely leave a an unforgettable impression on ya. not only is it the most creamy, rich, and comforting chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> i've tried, the presentation is an eye turner and it's enough to feed two voracious adults. \n\ni've finally tried their watermelon lemonade and it was as refreshing as it looks and sounds. sip. whoosh. yum!\n\ndo yourself right, and go try the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> and of course their famous <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffle tower. i love their rosemary infused waffles..... drool....\n\ni love the fact that it's 24 hours in the city that never sleeps. how suitable!", 
            "this place has monstrous servings of food. \n\nthere wasn't too many people there on a sunday morning. \n\nwe ordered the chicken and waffles. that thing was gigantic of a food. there was huge pieces of bacon inside the waffles. the chicken was crispy.\n\nthe chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> was enormous. even the server stopped and said it is a huge portion. after 45 mins it still looked like she didn't even touch it. \n\ni ordered a simple scramble with avocado, onions and cheese, with their buscuit <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. their *fresh fruit* was a dinky cantalope and orange piece. so don't expect to go healthy at a place where it's all out calories and fried food. \n\noverall, it was good food if you are super hungry and hungover. i would go back for the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & Waffles</mark>. \n\nit's close to old town vegas. just right across from <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> strip.", 
            "this was my third time here, and it's questionable if it will be my last. \n\nthe main reason to come here would be if you are hungry, don't feel like paying for a buffet, and want a comfort food experience. the price works out to be about the same as you would pay at wicked spoon or other breakfast/lunch buffet. keep that in mind as you read the rest of this review. \n\nfood quality:\nit's definitely \"comfort food,\" they do not mislead you there. but is it high quality? no. taste? flavorful. sure, the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles was more flavorful than your average chicken. i'll give them innovation points there. also, the chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> crust + cream sauce filling was well-seasoned, using thyme and rosemary to add some unique flavor. \n\nfood quantity: \nhuge portions. come hungry. but the food is rich, so it's hard to put down a whole large skillet full, especially if you plan to be a functioning vegas-goer the rest of the day. \n\nservice:\nterrible service. the wait is long to get into the restaurant. every time i have been here they manage to skip my name, claiming they \"called me twice.\" our waitress this last time literally talked my boyfriend out of ordering what he wanted and made him feel super awkward. \n\nambiance:\nnightmarish. very loud. seating arrangement is to cram as many people in as possible, so you're literally facing people and their plates. it's hard not to stare at what your neighbor ordered because the portions are huge. \n\nprice:\nok, so you're getting a lot of food. but does that justify the $17.99 price tag? i think that's the question i am struggling with. \n\nso, it really comes down this: does the flavor and comforting gimmick of the food outweigh the long wait and hefty bill? questionable. i'm really torn about whether i will be back, but i know that there are much better places to eat in vegas.", 
            "5 stars for the chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> and the great service!\n\nif i could, i would marry that chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>...\nas you can tell, that's what i would highly recommend. the corn beef with a side of potatoes was bland, dry, and boring. the chicken and waffle is as good as the rest of these yelp reviews say and so are the huge portions! \ni had chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> for 2 more meals afterwards and i loved it!!", 
            "for hours after i ate at hash house a go go, i was wondering what on earth i did to my body. how many actual pounds of food did i ingest, and why, did i challenge myself to eat all of it? to be fair, i failed the challenge, but tried really hard.\n\narrived around 11:30 am on a monday, and the wait for 2 was an accurate 35 minutes. service was prompt, and while the wait for food itself was going to be about 40 minutes, our server was able to get our drinks and a small order of sweet potato fries out to us really quickly. the tangerine honey screwdriver is a great twist on a classic cocktail, so i'd definitely recommend it.\n\nwe ordered the towering chicken & waffles, the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>, and a side of biscuits and gravy (\"do you know how much food that is?\" asks our server. \"yes\", i say, \"i just really want to try all of it.\") while the c&w is impressive in presentation, it was probably my least favorite on the list, though it wasn't bad at all. the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> was really great - whatever is in their gravy is just on point. so flavorful. and their biscuits and gravy is just perfect. a bit of spice, the meat is awesome, and the biscuits were light and fluffy.\n\nprobably someplace i'd go back to if i were in vegas again and wanted to torture my body. but perhaps i'd share a meal next time.", 
            "tried this place one more time, and i'm so glad i did. we discovered the chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> and it was the best one i've ever had! well-seasoned, flavors were multidimensional, and just plain tasty!\n\nthe portion is humongous though! honestly the portions here are huge. one entree is enough for two guys or four little asian girls. lol \n\nwonderful service! without our server, we would not have discovered this wonderful dish! for that i'm forever grateful!", 
            "i freaking love this place! i'd yelp allowed more specific reviews, i'd give it a 4.5. huge portions, so plan on sharing. everything is good. the signature chicken and waffles are worth trying, but i'd recommend the corn beef hash or the chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> instead. \n\nstay away from the over sugary alcoholic drinks and just order what you like from the bar.", 
            "1+ hour wait. crazy!! so i went to the casino downstairs for a bit and lost $6 at the slots :(. and curse the casino server lady, she checked my id (mind you i'm in my early mid-20s) and stole my unopened rasberry-rita. i was going to sip on that on the strip while it's my last day there. \n\nother than that the food was great. the plating was great. \n\nthe serving size was too great. goodness, the waiter could have given us a little warning. five scrawny asian ladies with five different orders, each plate fit for a team of giants. so uncanny for californian natives. other than that, the food was awesome. we had the chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>, chicken and waffle, benedict, steak and eggs, and something with salmon.\n\nif i was a vegas native i would have togo-ed all that wasted food. why is there surprise mashed potatoe under the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>? we didn't need that. next time i'm sharing 1 order with my girlfriends. \n\nthe last thing we said to the waiter was, \"i swear we touched it.\"",

            "we ate here on the 23th and our server jon was great, he gave some great infoe on different things on the menu we wanted to order. my husband had a burger i had the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> , now be ready because the portions are beyond huge but my goodness the food was great. the meal started out with home made biscuits with honey butter and these were the size of a soft ball,, great meal come hungry and enjoy every moment.", 
            "servings are huge here.  i had the meat loaf (which was awesome), but the couple at the next table ordered a <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>. it was ginormous, and it looked so good!", 
            "we got there a little after 10:30 am and the line was already long. we waited 30 minutes before we were seated. the waiter was very friendly. he took our drink and food and left. it didn't take very long before we got our drinks and then came our meals. the portions are huge. 2-3 people can eat off one plate, literally. my favorite is the chicken waffle which consist of 3 large thick waffles topped with 2 huge chicken breast being held by a steak knife. my friend ordered the chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> and let me tell you, this was no ordinary pie. it looked creamy with chunks of chicken and veggies. and if you're into pancakes, don't forget to order the banana pancake. it was massive. it was actually larger then the plate. lol. make sure to was down all that food with their signature bloody mary.  everyone went home with a souvenir glass which by the way was awesome, it reminded me of the leaning tower of pisa. if you're willing to wait, this place is  definitely a place to grab something to eat and enjoy with family and friends!!!"

            "i will give 4 stars based on my favorite meal...the tractor driver breakfast with the banana brown sugar pancake.  i visited vegas for a week and came to hash house a go go three times for breakfast/brunch and one late night trip to split <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark> and a watermelon lemonade (which was a little too sweet for my taste).  one visit we had a bad experience by waiting an hour for the food and an indifferent waitress.  i was immediately hooked on their fresh tangerine juice, but they only had it for my first visit.  the banana brown sugar pancake is so delicious.  the way the brown sugar sort of carmelizes to a yummy and sweet crunch...divine.  the griddled <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> were good.  warning:  their portions are scary huge.  i recommend sharing at this place regardless of what you order.  they send home leftover pancakes in a small pizza box to give you an idea.  all the items i saw or ordered came on platters or giant round plates that must have weighed five pounds alone.  a woman next to us the night we went in for dessert ordered a chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> which looked like a giant flying saucer of crust had crashed into it.  for my first trip, i got the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> which was good, but a little too much and too heavy for me.  my other trips were all about that banana brown sugar pancake.  trust me, if you like bananas, you can't go wrong.", 
            "with a room full of robuchon gifts leftover our fourth day would have been an easy one to sleep in and eat breakfast in the room - but why do things easy when there are so many great places to dine in las vegas?  despite my multiple trips to sin city in the past i'd regretfully been without a car on past visits and as such never been able to visit the local legend of \"twisted farm food\" - hash house a go-go.  having heard that a third (the other in san diego) location of the famous spot had recently opened in the imperial palace and waking up early as ever we made our way to the restaurant around 8:00am without reservations and found only 3-4 tables occupied.\n \nwith late eighties classics blasting we made our way to the hostess podium where we were greeted by a young lady clad in jeans and a hhagg shirt who led us to a four-top big enough for eight - no doubt hash house does everything big.  taking a seat we were soon greeted by our server, noelle, a pleasant young woman who was substantially more cordial and efficient than necessary at such a restaurant (a good thing, for sure.)  menus in hand we were left to decide while a mountainous eggs benedict passed by en route for another table.  hilariously enough, while we were waiting a group of six young men approached the hostess stand and then left because \"oh man, we thought this was a buffet.\"  clearly they'd not seen the portion sizes.\n \nsitting and chatting while coffee, water, orange juice, and tea were filled we decided to order only three items and share them around.  with prices ranging from $7-$17 we were informed that one of us would have to pay a $2 split entree fee - when i chuckled saying okay the response was \"you'd be amazed how angry some people get about it\" - clearly i'm jaded.  sitting back and listening to rock you like a hurricane while sipping the surprisingly good coffee the restaurant slowly filled up.\n \narriving in less than 20 minutes the portions were precisely as expected - enormous and delicious looking.  with a sweet, a savory, and a \"dessert\" there was too much food for four people.  beginning first with the blackberry granola flapjacks, my sister's choice although i'd lobbied for the snickers flapjacks, the pancake itself was enormous - literally the size of a car tire in diameter though thankfully not as thick.  with ample warm syrup and butter to spread there was really nothing subtle or nuanced, it was just good cofort food and the sweet blackberries worked nicely with the crunchy honey granola.\n\nperhaps the most famous hash house dish would be my order - \"<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> stacked with our famous <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>, hot maple caramel reduction and crowned with fried leeks.\"  golden and crispy the chicken was amply accented with sage and actually quite delicious.  stacked above and below four golden waffles loaded with whole strips (not small bits like other places) of salty bacon and topped with crispy leeks plus a sauce that was much more maple than caramel i have to admit that this was a huge portion of food.  while clearly not as subtle and refined as bouchon's chicken and waffles i actually much preferred this to roscoe's famous los angeles version and the less famous option at dc's founding farmers.\n\nour dessert would be <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark> topped with ice cream and served with a cup of coffee.  with the coffee alone costing $2.50 on the menu this <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark> is the deal of the breakfast menu at a mere $7.95.  a portion easily large enough for two hungry people or a family of four to share after dinner the pudding was essentially a black and white coffee cake that would have filled 3/4 of a standard loaf pan.  buttery and rife with chocolate the steaming hot pudding was then topped with melted snickers bars, doused with chocolate and caramel syrups, then piled high with two large scoops of vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, and crumbly brown sugar.  like the other choices there was nothing subtle about this caloric monster but honestly for all its audacity it was really quite good.\n\nsettling the bill (about $14 each after tax and a 25% tip) and returning a large portion to the kitchen (we still had p.u.b. leftovers and the robuchon basket in the room) we thanked our service team and made our way to <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> accompanied by eddie van halen's eruption.  generally a fan of refined flavors, elaborate cooking techniques, quiet dining rooms, excellent service, and great food hash house a go go wasn't exactly my kind of place - but the service was excellent and the food was pretty darn good.",

            "my second visit to the ip location.  on my first visit (may, 2012), i had no idea what to expect, with the word 'hash' in the name one is led to believe hash browns would be involved, when in fact, nothing comes with hash browns.  my friends ordered one of the large <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> 'breakfasts', i wasnt in the mood for a giant meal, so i ordered 'andys <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark>', which comes with coffee @ $8.95, it was more than i could finish, and ok, i'd call this the 'value play' on the menu here, everything else is gonna wring your wallet.\n2nd trip, we again visited the ip location on a monday morning; driving into the ip location at this particular time (10/22/12) is insane with the construction going on, and their parking garage is deplorable.  the wait was crazy long, luckily the beepers they give you work immediately downstairs where we could play video poker at the bar and drink 'free' coffees.\nwhen we got back upstairs to the waiting area, they called out our name instead of using the beepers (?).\nthe decor here is farmer-full-metal-jacket, with plate metal on the walls.  i think this creates sort of a faraday cage where no cell signal attempting to transmit yelp checkins or photos is possible! :) both times here checkins/photos failed to go thru.\nwaiter was fairly attentive, after we ordered he then warned us the kitchen was very slow and orders were running 30-40 mins.  oh goody.  i ordered the 'steak hash' and a v8.  wife got bacon/eggs and coffee.\nsteak hash, with sun dried tomatoes and topped with green beans <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, along with two eggs on the side, came served in a faux iron skillet (meaning, it wasnt used to cook in).  sometimes i think chefs add sexy ingredients that are going to sound good, without really thinking thru the flavor.  it was really quite dreary tasting and unappetizing, and the steak was overcooked slices of beef.\nafter tip we were out $40 for breakfast that i really didnt enjoy much.  \nso the two-star here is mainly due to the value, my opinion is overpriced 'just ok' food.\n\noh, i did notice there appears to be wi-fi here, but it needs a password, you might ask your server about it - i wont be back here.", 
            "i finally got a chance to eat at the place that supposedly serves \"twisted farm food.\" it had been on my radar ever since i first saw it on man v. food. staying at imperial made it all the more tempting to just go there for each meal. in a rare showing of mercy to my wallet, i didn't do that.\n\nbefore going inside the dining area, you'll see a number of autographed portraits and menus. adam richman's is one of them. \n\ni decided to do takeout for dinner. while it was very tempting to just get the popular <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles, i was in a 1-pound stuffed burger mood. oh, that'd be one pound of meat. the entire burger was probably closer to 2 lbs., although not quite there.\n\nthe mushroom and swiss stuffed burger ($12.95) was amazing. extremely juicy and gargantuan. everything cooked perfectly. it was heaven just to see the melted swiss and sauteed mushrooms. it's served with the cold fresh veggies on one bun half and the stuffed patty on the other half. two big dill pickle slices in the burger. while the lettuce looked a bit wilted, that's probably only because everything stayed in the same closed takeout box for a few minutes.\n\ni'm guessing they used a brioche bun. very soft and inviting. i personally think it could have been better with a slight toasting on the flattop. this just felt like the juicy lucy i had in minnesota a couple years back, just in steroidal form. i think the burger could be too greasy and too imposing for some people. fork and knife might be required. i for one needed a larger mouth.\n\nburgers come with one side item of your choice. i got the basil pesto tossed crispy potatoes and enjoyed every bite. great job on the crispy potatoes. it also had some broken-down diced tomatoes in there. the olive oil from the pesto collected a bit at the bottom of the plastic takeout container.\n\ndessert is served all day here, and one of the servers mentioned that some items (like the <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark>) are for in-house dining only. might expect up to a 15-minute wait on that <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark>.\n\nbreakfast includes <mark>French Toast</mark>, flapjacks, and the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, all featured on the man v. food episode. i hope to get back there for some of those dishes.\n\ni saw the plating of the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles i spoke of earlier, and it's literally a tower of food. three or four waffles for the base, some <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> on top of that, and a large knife to hold it all in place.\n\neven with all the inflated prices on the vegas strip, i think it's well worth the price to come here. check this elite spot out the next time you're in the area.", 
            "definitely an experience!\n\nhuge southern indiana style food taken to a new level. this place was highly recommended to us by friends so we checked it out, mostly for the chicken and waffles.\n\nhuge portions left us both a little too full. i would recommend splitting a dish here (and that is from a girl that knows how to eat). don't plan to eat healthy here, if that is your plan go somewhere else.\n\nyou can order bloody mary's while waiting to be seated. we ran downstairs and lost some money at o'sheas wile waiting and popped back up. i do think they need a notification system for when your table is ready, especially since we were told 45 minutes and checked back early and were seated in 25.\n\nwhat we ordered:\n\n<mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> & biscuit. i could have done without the cheese <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> here. the sauce is not a typical hollandaise, more of a spicy southern dressing (still very good)\n\nchicken & waffles. <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> stacked with our famous <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>, hot maple caramel reduction and crowned with fried leeks. i have had better waffles, but these we're good and had bacon in them? so probably no complaining. reduction sauce was delish, i wanted more syrup but my boyfriend was fine with it. the leeks were a great flavor in the dish, but not that \"eater friendly\" to actual eat. the boyfriend choked a little and moved the rest to the side. he ordered and loved the house mimosa made with fresh squeezed tangerine.\n\ni would have loved to try one of the many coffee drinks but knew it would be too much!\n\nthe <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> in both dishes was wonderful. great texture and super flavorful.\n\nthe <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark>, meatloaf, and <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark> all looked amazing as well.", 
            "mixed review, as my personal experience was somewhat different from the rest of the members of my party. it was an hour and a half wait for a table, as pretty much everyone else on yelp has mentioned, but we accepted that and went downstairs to gamble and peruse the shops. once we were seated and eventually ordered, there was an hour and fifteen minute wait for our food to arrive. the waiter was a nice enough fellow, but perhaps overworked because once he performed a duty (taking our order, bringing ice water, delivering the food), he would disappear and we wouldn't see him for quite some time. on three separate times, we had to ask other waiters who just happened to be passing by to bring us something. my wife and i played it smart and ordered the chicken and waffles, thinking there's no way to screw that up. right! we were happy with our meal, even sharing it between the two of us there was quite a bit leftover. the happy lad at the end of the table who ordered biscuits and gravy was equally satisfied. then things got interesting: the lady to my left had a scramble with fairly raw, runny eggs, her husband had oatmeal with overripe fruit and no spoon to eat it with (and, of course, we couldn't find our waiter), and another young lady who ordered <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark> found out too late that the <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark> at hash house a-go-go is snicker's <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark>, and had the consistency of a fairly large brick of fudge brownie. she had the lady balls to complain, and the waiter was willing to take it off the bill. if this review were based simply on my experience alone, i would say 4 stars."

            "this \"twisted farm food\" caf\\u00e9 in the heart of the imperial palace was my breakfast location of choice for way to many early mornings. the urban/farm type decor is different, but well kept and clean. the food here is an experience to say the least. the menu is expansive to say the least with specialties such as <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> which is a 14oz budweiser and a side of bacon! or the blt bloody mary. they are known here for their <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles which are extreme for sure. please see a few of the pictures for the full impact. the service here was spot on, all the staff is younger sort of \"punk rock\" which fits the feel in general, but the food left me a bit confused. i never had the signature giant pancake or the chicken and waffles..but i did try several other items and found the experience to be pretty bi-polar. the home made giant biscuits that are given table side (and come with most any entree) are fun due to their sheer girth (that's right i said girth!)...but one bit left me tasting baking soda and begging for honey, or butter, or jam...or anything to quench my now parched gullet. this went the same for their signature \"hashes\" for breakfast. the \"crispy potatoes\" they are all built upon reminded me of the potatoes found downstairs at the buffet...i had the \"<mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark>\" skillet which was the driest experience laid upon potatoes i could have hoped for...although the skillet meatloaf breakfast was a nice change. the \"stuffed\" burger here are tasty, but beware the horseradish <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. i got these for dinner one night and lugged them back to my room. there was sooo much horseradish on the taters that i literally coughed them right back up. i know i know..sorry for the visual, but i don't want any fellow yelper's getting sucker punched by these taters in the future.\nperhaps i just ordered the wrong items 4 out of 7 meals, but i think if the food completely catches up with the service and hype, then this place is going to be a real vegas draw!",

(i don't know what they're popular for, i just heard great things about this place). i ordered the egg benedict <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> = huge. nicely decorated and visually appealing; so good enough to eat for sure with a side of crispy potatoes. \n\ni wish it didn't have the biscuit, it made the dish extremely heavy. the dish included: cheese, eggs (duh!), dried tomatoes, spinach, salmon (not a lot at all), biscuit <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> (starting from the top to the bottom layers). so definitely a heavy plate with the potatoes and biscuit. the flavor was in the middle, like some bites were very bland and others were good.\n\ni was actually not satisfied with my order. and it was on my end, not the restaurants. i should have went with the salmon scrambled dish - had a bite out of that and omg so baaamb! \n\nvenue: it's in confusing area - the quad, and parking was a hassle or whatnot. the restaurant is actually really big, and i couldn't tell because the way it's laid out. \n\ndefinitely would come back and try another dish - maybe dinner time since it was so packed for brunch!", 
            "service wasn't the best, but considering how busy it was, i didn't really mind. the food was awesome...huge portions! i got the <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> scramble? not sure what the actual name of it on the menu was. but the bloody marys won me over. i absolutely loved them - plus they've got a bloody mary bar (also serves screwdrivers) to keep you entertained while waiting to be seated. also tried their banana pancakes.. amazing!!!!!", 
            "what i really admire about this place is the emphasis they put on making everything from scratch and using high quality ingredients. it's written in fine print on the bottom of their menu, along with a little notification that your food may take awhile to prepare because of it. (our waiter quoted us 45 minutes for our food to be done after we ordered.)\n\nas for the food though, i was pretty underwhelmed. we ordered the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, chicken and waffles, a <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> scramble and a chicken hash dish. the portions here are very large. four dishes fed 7 girls, and we probably would have been just fine with 3 entrees instead of being greedy and adding the fourth.\n\nthe star of the show was the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. delish! the sauce and melted cheese... mmm.. the flavor is different from your traditional benedict with hollandaise sauce, and well worth your time. \n\neverything else we ordered though kind of fell flat for me. bland... boring... a waste of my stomach space. i was looking forward to the chicken and waffles most but i had a few bites and abandoned it. \n\nthe wait to be seated and the wait to get your food is a little unbearable, especially when you're hungover from your vegas shenanigans the night prior. but i would come back just for that benedict!", 
            "this place was horrible. bad service, long waits for food & service, bland food. barely saw the staff.....\n\nyes, the food is huge portions but everything is practically tasteless & bland! the biscuits that everything come with are horrible & taste more like flour than anything else. very, very dry.\n\ni got the <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark>/potato hash & it was ok. the potatos were burnt & greasy. i ended up just picking out the salmon. the boyfriend got the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & said it was incredibly dry.\n\nwon't return unless it's 2am... not worth the wait from 10am-2pm.", 
            "hash house a go go is always jam packed but don't let this deter you!  the restaurant is quite large so even though you see tons of folks waiting it's usually about a 20-30 minute wait (at least from what i experienced around lunch time).\n\nfood: portion sizes are hugeeeee. you should probably order a few things and split it with a group.  i tried scrambled eggs with <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> and brie cheese and it was delicious!!! i also had their waffles which were okay but nothing to write home about.  i tried the watermelon kiwi lemonade drink and that was delicious but might be considered too sweet and syrupy for a few folks. btw their bloody mary is delicious, didn't try the blt version but that's on my to-do list.\ni saw quite a few orders of the chicken & waffles..i guess that's the popular dish around here.\n\ndecor: industrial + farm\n\nservice: good nothing to complain about.\n\nprice - affordable especially for all the food you're getting. \n\nwould i go back? - heck yes. i want to try their smores hot chocolate!!", 
            "the wait here is crazy... because it's hash house in a casino on the strip, so duh!  you can get a drink to liven up your wait a bit, though. the bloody mary is actually very good. and large... like everything else here. \n\nthe portions are huge and sickeningly so.  it wouldn't surprise me if they adopted a policy of wheeling food out in a wheelbarrow -- it would fit the theme perfectly!  every plate i saw cleared around us was still half full, as the tv was playing a commercial to help starving african kids.  it felt pretty indecent to be throwing away all this food just for some 'murican farmhouse gimmick. \n\nthe flavors were good, but everything just kind of gave me indigestion.  the benedicts come with a biscuit instead of an english muffin. everything's just a little overboard.  the <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> benedict isn't with lox how you would expect it to be, but salmon with smoke flavoring. it was still pretty good, but wasn't what i thought i was ordering.\n\ni think the gimmick wins over the actual experience.  when your food first appears in front of you, you're kind of star-struck and giddy.  but about 3 bites in, you realize you're just about done and there's no fridge in your hotel room.",

            "my first time here. this is for the one at the quad hotel next to harrah's on the strip. ummm...i liked it. a lot. my wife, daughter and i had brunch here on saturday afternoon. the food here is what they call \"twisted farm food\". it really is a good description of what they serve. it's high quality food that is creatively and well prepared. \n      the restaurant itself is busy and bustling 24 hours a day. decorated in a farmhouse motif, the staff is constantly moving in and out of the kitchen delivering plates of very large portions of food. \n       our server, erik was friendly and accommodating. we perused the large and varied brunch menu while he brought our drinks. the menu has some really good sounding dishes. the signature dish here is the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> tower. it consists of 2 large <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breasts sitting on top of 3 homemade waffles. i saw a lot of people having it and it looks...really good. maybe next time on that one. \n        we each chose one of the \"scrambles\". i had the <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> scramble with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and a buttermilk biscuit. the scramble itself was good but not out of this world. nothing i couldn't make in my own kitchen. the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> were excellent. probably the best iv'e had. the biscuit is huge and has a hint of rosemary and also a large spring of rosemary sticking out of the top. it was excellent as well. my wife and daughter had basically the same thing except they had different ingredients in their scrambles and my wife had crispy potatoes instead of mashed. we all liked our dishes very much. \n        on this saturday afternoon, this place looked like the place to go to cure a hangover. more than a few people looked like they were in pretty bad shape.\n       this location is the only one that is open 24/7/365.  i can definitely see putting hash house a go go on our regular rotation. i can't wait to return to try the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> or one of the benedicts.\n        if you don't believe me, check out my kid's reveiw below..",

(it was so great that my hubby almost lost his finger because he couldn't stop munching on it)\n\noverall hash house a go go is a definite must while visiting vegas (i absolutely fell in love with this place) - and will certainly be back on my next trip to sin city.",

            "wow! the first thing that comes to mind when we got our food! but first i must say that this was the number one place on my list to try when i went to las vegas a couple weeks ago. i saw it on the food network and travel channel. apparently there are multiple locations, but we went to the one that was on the vegas strip in the quad.\n\nupon entering the lobby from the escalators the fist thing noticeable are the numerous pictures of celebrities and their autographs along the wall. that being said, it had to good...because we had to justify the 30-45 min. wait for a table! worth it in the end though.\n\nas we sat down, the server was very upbeat and friendly given how busy the restaurant was. in my experience, the tone and vibe of a busy restaurant will reflect through the server. i felt very welcomed and excited to be trying this place out though. the first thing we asked was for recommendations and he gave us the top 3 most popular dishes. out of the six of us, we decided to order all 3 of them plus one! the ones were the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles, <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, big o' chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> and the chorizo house hash. full menus are online, but each dish was super! \n\nmy personal favorite was the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles. this was superb! the sage really was present in the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and was totally different from any other \"chicken & waffles\" i ever had. the taste was really \"upscale\" but very, very good! the other people in our party didn't like the unique taste because of the overwhelming taste of sage...but that was the reason it stood out for me so much. i am not picky and love new foods, especially new tastes that i had never had before. the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was juicy and of course tasted well with the bacon! the everyone loved the waffles! very soft on the inside but nicely crisp on the outside. and it all worked very well with the maple syrup reduction...such a dream! \n\nthe <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> was similar in taste as far as the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> portion, but was different in texture with the biscuit base, chipotle cream and griddled mozzarella. very rich and good.\n\nthe last two were the chorizo house hash and big o' chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>. both were the favorites among the group as a whole. the chorizo was very good, not too salty, which i have come across on numerous occasions having the meat at various restaurants. a bit spicy with the jalape\\u00f1os, but i love spice personally. everyone devoured this dish as well as the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>. the shell/crust of the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> was mouthwatering. that part of the dish was gone in a flash! so flaky and buttery went well with the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> filling and gravy!\n\ni must say these dishes individually are large! just one of them can feed 2-3 normal individuals. and for the price, very worth it! each dish was presently superbly especially the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles. every time that came out of the kitchen to a different table people would be astonished and stare as the towering masterpiece found its home in a new customer.\n\nthis is a super recommendation if you are ever nearby or decide to take a trip to las vegas! go now!", 
            "server was not very considerate and constantly trying to rush us for brunch. i ordered the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark>, peppers, asparagus, and rosemary hash with egg whites and half order of potatoes. alright quality, way too much oil and not much added flavor/spice. portion wasn't what i expected (yes, even though i got 1/2 potatoes). however, my friend got a pancake that was enormous. i tried it and it was very good and cooked perfectly. perhaps i just got a subpar dish for this place or i was expecting more, but overall i was not impressed and would have been more pleased at a waffle house (from georgia).", 
            "i agree with other yelpers that this place is overhyped. i liked the big portions because it allowed us to share, but the flavor was lacking and over powering at the same time. our server was great, but our food was not. my brother and i split the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> hash and man, was the rosemary super strong! i like rosemary, but it tasted almost bitter. the potatoes were nice and crispy and the biscuit was tasty though. the famous chicken and waffles was disappointing. the presentation was awesome and looked promising, but the chicken was tasteless. the waffles were ok. all in all, it was just ok and we waited a long time.",

            "excessive. just effin excessive.\n\nhash house is the comfort food equivalent of watching wipeout or maybe motorboating a generously proportioned woman.  its... extreme.  <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, on a biscuit, on <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> with a chipotle cream sauce poured over the whole thing.  yes. really. for serious.  \n\nand unless you can make a ryan's buffet manager cry, you'll need to share.  the portions are gut busting.  we're talking 4 waffles with two <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breasts on top here.  the table next to us ordered the <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark>, and i seriously thought it was a fried doormat. insane.\n\nate here every morning i could in vegas.  you might regret hash house an hour later, but you won't forget the experience... and you'll go again given half the chance.", 
            "portions as big as two of your heads! \n\ni've been here a few times on various vegas excursions and each time i left overly stuffed and satisfied.    they don't mess around with portion sizes.  this is not a place for those with tiny appetites.  \n\non one trip, i had the <mark>HH Famous Meatloaf</mark> hash and my wife ordered <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>.  both were pretty good.   the meatloaf wasn't the juiciest meatloaf, but had a good taste.   the chipotle sauce for the benedict was yummy.  \n\nmore recently, i went with my wife and a couple of friends.  the table shared a blueberry, pecan, brown sugar pancake, 2 orders of the <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> benedict, and a quesadilla.   \n\nthe pancake was sweet, soft but not undercooked, and ginormous.  i really don't know how one person can put that platter of fluffyness down themselves.  \n\nthe <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> was breaded and fried to a nice crispness but i think i would have been happy with a big slab of un-breaded/fried pork.  perhaps i would have appreciated the fried-ness if i were hungover.  :)\n\ni only had a bite of the quesadilla and i remember it being very quesadilicious. \n\nthe lines can get backed up during the late morning brunch time, but if you are a total rewards member (platinum or higher), there's a separate faster line.\n\ndon't plan on having phone reception there.  my phone (att) had no service for most of the time, and other carriers struggled with weak signals.", 
            "omg the serving size!!! when my boyfriend and i first walked into this place we thought we were in for an ok meal considering this place is inside the imperial palace, but boy were we wrong. as the waiter seats us we walk past a guy who is eating a pancake the size of a party platter plate. we thought this was a special thing until our meal came. my boyfriend ordered \"andy's crispy indiana style <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark>\" he loved the meat and the bbq cream sauce but i fell in love with the griddled smoked mozzarella they put on top of the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. we both loved the fresh corn which we both agree is the best we've ever had. i had the \"black skillet chicken\" which was great and had just the right flavors. but keep in mind each dish can feed 2 to 3 people so with have a fridge ready for leftovers or plan on splitting to dishes. but altogether the food was amazing and when my boyfriend and i go back to vegas next year we defiantly plan on eating there again.", 
            "don't tell my husband i didn't give it five stars!!!!\n\nhh was good. well, it was ok. i had to act more in love with it than i really was because the husband was so hyped. when you're married to me you only have so much in life, so i let him have his moment. \n\ni had the <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> sandwich and he ordered the 1 lb burger stuffed with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and bacon. i heard the food portions were huge and i considered having us split an entree, but being on vacation we opted for being typical americans instead. the food came out and it was huge. stupidly huge. \n\nthe <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> was the diameter of a dinner plate but the bun that it was set upon was normal size. using the bun like a cookie cutter, i trimmed the excess pork so i could pick it up. the pork was awesome--just really big. \n\nhusbands burger was ok. it really didn't have any flavor and i was really turned off by the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> in it. he loves <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, so maybe that's why he thought it was so amazing. eh. mac n' cheese was good. \n\nservice started out great with an attentive waiter but by the end of the meal he had disappeared. i flagged someone down just as he reappeared and at that point his attitude had shifted. odd. \n\nwould i eat here again? only if i were to take someone who had never been here before. other than that, it's just mediocre food.", 
            "this place is worth the wait!  i came here recently with my boyfriend.  we had the <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> benedict and the chorizo & jalepeno hash with a bloody mary and the banana latte (see my pics).  the <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> was pounded so thin and fried crispy, i could not stop eating it.  the chorizo and jalepeno hash was also good but i could not stay away from the <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark>.  the banana latte was fantastic!!!  the bloody mary is a huge drink and could use a bit more tomato juice.", 
            "this place was the best!!  came here for lunch on saturday.  wait was about 45 minutes.  but it was so worth it.  the waiter warned us that the portions are huge and that we can share the entree.  we should have listened to him.  each of us ordered our own entree.  i ordered the <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> sandwich.  the meat looked like it could have been for 3 sandwiches.  my friend ordered the chicken and waffles and my other friend ordered a scramble.  omg!!  they were so good.  prices are reasonable.  my entree was about $15.  great price for the portion.    will for sure come back!",

            "talk about heart attack on a plate. by far one of the best experiences i've had for a hearty meal. there is a good amount of items you can choose from and make sure you go with a big group of people. i really like this place and it is definitely a go back to restaurant if you ever come back to vegas!\n\nlocated at the quad, this place is pretty bombay. i always wanted to try it and finally we were able to! just to let you know, a plate of this would probably feed a family of 4 and maybe more. the portions are gigantic and full of flavor. it is definitely not for you if you're on a no carb diet lol. i ordered a burger and a since we went in a big group, we had the <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> cutlet, man v food <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>, and benedicts. everything was delicious, but my suggestion is stay away from the burgers and try something new! the burger i had was a typical burger but it was huge. the tenderloin cutlet was delicious and will be ordering that next time i go to hash house! but yes guys, you have to try this place!",

            "everything the world needs to know about us fat americans can be found at the hash house a go go.  vegas is a city of sin and this is gluttony at it's finest.  hash house describes their concept as twisted farm food.  it's american comfort food taken out of it's overalls and dressed up.  i came here for one thing.....the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>.  i saw it on man vs food and knew someday it would have to be mine.\n\nso many times when a place \"creates\" a tower of food all combined together on a gargantuan plate, it's not well thought out.  this is different and the key here is each ingredient is great on it's own.  from the bottom up we have <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, nicely seasoned and thrown on a griddle to get them slightly browned.  then why stop with one starch when you can have two?  the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> are topped with a couple of fluffy buttermilk biscuits that are some of the most tasty i've ever had.  followed by fresh spinach (it's great that they don't cook it so it doesn't get mushy) and slices of red beefsteak tomato.  this is topped with a couple of slices of hickory <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark> and then it's namesake....a half pound well seasoned <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breast.  corn flakes are used as the batter and it keeps it's crunch well.  top this with scrambled eggs and cheese.  the cheese is fried up on the griddle so it's melted prior to going on everything else.  this also creates a nice browned skin to the melted cheese.  i forgot to ask what cheese they were using, but it wasn't too strong.  it seemed it's main job was bond itself to the chipotle cream sauce that is poured on top and create one cheesy gooey chipotle sauce that seals everything in.  winner winner chicken dinner!  i hope they never open a hash house near me because i could see myself craving one of these life ending creations often.  5 stars all the way.\nthe masterpiece... http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=8ow8c6e4iway0mhurzqn_q#4mg6mmblxil1kwp_ucw3kg\n\nand here's a nice cross section of it to fully appreciate all it's glory...  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=8ow8c6e4iway0mhurzqn_q#50ilis2pomhauloth8so2w\n\ni also got a chance to try the big o' <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> sandwich.  we all agreed while impressive to look at, it wasn't on the same level as <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>.  it was a tasty deep fried pork cutlet but i found it needing more than just the sprinkling of ketchup on it as it got a little dry.  i did love the pickles as the vinegar flavor worked well with the pork.  perhaps some kind of creamy bbq sauce would have been better.  the bun was a whole wheat bun, but was a throw away here.  why whole wheat?  i have no idea.  3.5 stars http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=8ow8c6e4iway0mhurzqn_q#smjihbrjw3f9noleumympq\n\nmy wife for some reason got the most boring burger on the menu.  as such i found myself saying....just a burger.  their burgers are two half pound patties stuffed with a few different options.  well it doesn't seem that they are really \"stuffed\" just things are put between the 2 burgers.  she got bacon, cheddar, and avocado.  so to me it was just how they layered everything, big deal the bacon, cheddar, and avocado was between two separate patties.  there was also no sauce?  just ketchup.  we asked for some mayo, so it wasn't so dry, but this place should really come up with their own sauce.  if you want a burger, there are better more creative options in vegas, such as burger bar or bachi burger.  3.5 stars. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=8ow8c6e4iway0mhurzqn_q#hjjzmdozjlfqe0gsgrp17a\n\ni'm sure there are other 5 star dishes here as i saw a lot of amazing looking things.  my daughter's plain pancake was one of the best i've ever tasted.  they do them all kinds of ways here.  of course the pancake was the size of a medium pizza and a good 3/4 inch thick.  for sure i'm trying one of their hash dishes next time.  after all they are called hash house.  the meatloaf and smoked mozzarella hash sounds great with a couple of over easy eggs on top.  i can recommend the banana latte.  it was excellent. http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hash-house-a-go-go-las-vegas-5?select=8ow8c6e4iway0mhurzqn_q#v1jbffdhdwldaageybhhwg\n\nexpect at least a 20-30 minute wait as the word is out on this place.  they told us 45, but we were in in 20.  it's a huge restaurant and they move them in and out fairly well.  open 24 hours!!!!", 
            "i fell in love with this place in san diego so getting the chance to go back was a no-brainer. although the d\\u00e9cor isn't nearly as nice as the san diego location, the food is equally amazing. a native hoosier, the <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> sandwich tends to be elusive outside of indiana so when i find one the rest of the menu becomes irrelevant. clara (\"show me the beef\" fame) would be excited to see that the meat significantly dwarfs the bun. in fact it is the sized of a normal dinner plate. on top of that was the side dish of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> covered in strips of bacon and smothered in cheese -- had to have been at least a pound. i hear their breakfast is equally as good. i took three college athletes who all amazingly scarfed down their meals with no problem. another bonus was the price. while vegas is known for price gouging, the prices here are normal for 3x the amount of food.",

            "definitely an experience!\n\nhuge southern indiana style food taken to a new level. this place was highly recommended to us by friends so we checked it out, mostly for the chicken and waffles.\n\nhuge portions left us both a little too full. i would recommend splitting a dish here (and that is from a girl that knows how to eat). don't plan to eat healthy here, if that is your plan go somewhere else.\n\nyou can order bloody mary's while waiting to be seated. we ran downstairs and lost some money at o'sheas wile waiting and popped back up. i do think they need a notification system for when your table is ready, especially since we were told 45 minutes and checked back early and were seated in 25.\n\nwhat we ordered:\n\n<mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> & biscuit. i could have done without the cheese <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> here. the sauce is not a typical hollandaise, more of a spicy southern dressing (still very good)\n\nchicken & waffles. <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> stacked with our famous <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>, hot maple caramel reduction and crowned with fried leeks. i have had better waffles, but these we're good and had bacon in them? so probably no complaining. reduction sauce was delish, i wanted more syrup but my boyfriend was fine with it. the leeks were a great flavor in the dish, but not that \"eater friendly\" to actual eat. the boyfriend choked a little and moved the rest to the side. he ordered and loved the house mimosa made with fresh squeezed tangerine.\n\ni would have loved to try one of the many coffee drinks but knew it would be too much!\n\nthe <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> in both dishes was wonderful. great texture and super flavorful.\n\nthe <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark>, meatloaf, and <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark> all looked amazing as well.", 
            "the portions on every entree is really really big!\n\ni mean, i can eat... but this place give you large portions that will test your stomach capacity. \n\nthe last time i came here i got the <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> sandwich. it was was a very hearty meal. the <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> was a lot bigger than the sandwich that i had to put the <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> into the shape of the buns so that i can eat the sandwich. the outer part of the sandwich i had to save for later. it came with average fries. it was salted perfectly.\n\nthis place was a little hard to find because during the time i went they were doin renovations. it was a single elevator that was outdated that took us right up to the restaurant. \n\noverall, i would suggest this place for people visiting because it was definitely an experience. they try to plate their food well but it does come a bit messy. its okay though. haha", 
            "got the espresso double shot to start my meal and then moved on to my <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> benedict - portion is huge so definitely prepare yourself before coming here!", 
            "if you're in vegas do your mouth a favor and come here! i have tried lots of different things off the menu: fried green tomatoes, <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark>, quesadilla all incredible and huge portions. we always share and leave stuffed! yes you will have a wait but it's worth it!", 
            "great food, but service was slow!! split meals for sure!  <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> was terrific.", 
            "i know you're starving and don't want to wait. suck it up and go win some money while you do! i've been to the one outside of the strip so to find this gem in the linq was a great surprise. it was about an hour wait for 2 (not bad for this restaurant) and i sent my boyfriend off to gamble while i waited. staff was very friendly and while i was bummed we weren't in a super lively part of the restaurant, we didn't go there to socialize. i ordered the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> and he ordered the bbblt. my meal was so amazing! savory, creamy, crunchy, delicious. huge portion that we both ate a lot of and i still managed to take home more than half of it. i didn't try his sandwich and although he said it was really good, he couldn't keep his fork out of my dish. i've had the <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> before too so i highly recommend it as well!", 
            "mouth watering food, fast service, polite servers and nice ambiance and great location!!!\n\nwe arrived in vegas at 2:30 and after checking in at mirage we went to hhgg for midnight breakfast (i.e, around 3 in the morning). the server greeted us very nicely and we were seated right away. the menu had very limited options for late night. we ordered \n-blueberry-pecan flapjacks\n-chocolate waffles\n-<mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & Waffles</mark>\n-indiana <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark>. \n\nthe service was super quick and in no time we were gorging on the food :) the portions were huge and the presentation...ohh my my!!! i loved my pancake which was fluffy and filled with fresh blueberries and also the chocolate waffles which were chocolicious and covered in ice cream!!! the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & Waffles</mark> had safe <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and crispy waffles on the bottom which was little dry for my hubby but taste was great. the <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> was amazing and had delicious <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> on the side and topped with very thin and crispy onion. the waiter was nice enough to accommodate our second request for choco waffles as quickly as possible. \n\noverall the experience was memorable and i will definitely recommend checking this place out!", 
            "if you're a tourist and you're looking for a typical american breakfast/brunch experience, that's definitely the place. nearly every item on the menu is too heavy, too big or too sugary to manage to eat it all. \n\nbut first things first, the line for the tables is extremely long. i mean like 40 minutes at least. however, you can easily keep yourself amused the whole time by reading letters from famous people who ate there and loved it very much. there's also photos and articles from magazines. after you are called, the waiter leads you into a big room full of people and gives you big printed menu. the place was extremely busy the whole time, but the staff was great and we didn't have to wait too long to order or get food.\n\nas i said before, the choice is overwhelming. really! there's so many options that i could sit there for an hour and i still wouldn't be completely sure what to order. so i started with watermelon kivi lemonade. it was amazing! very sweet, big and colorful and yet refreshing. i drank two of them. and a sweet coffee. so when we left i was on sugar rush :d. for breakfast we both decided on farm benedict. mine was a bit on the lighter side, with <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, fresh tomato, fresh spinach, potatoes and roasted red pepper cream but my fiance went crazy and chose the version with <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark>, market yellow tomato, spinach, potatoes and barb' que cream. <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark>. for breakfast. he's mad. the other reviews certainly don't lie, the portions are enormous. i honestly cannot imagine a person that would eat it whole. we could share one and we probably would still left some of it. the dish itself is a big mix of everything you could possibly want for breakfast all in one, layer after layer and topped wit crazy amount of sauce. it's a strange mix of flavors. i loved it but it was so heavy i can't imagine eating something like that more often than twice a month. \n\nthe prices weren't very high and we had a great time there, laughing, looking disbelievingly at our dishes, taking pictures. the place is always full of tourists so nobody cares. definitely a must visit!", 
            "it was hard to decide what to order but this was the first stop on our honeymoon and man was it a good one. \n\nwe were quoted a 15 minute wait time but it was closer to only 5 minutes which was excellent. my husband and i were able to sit next to each other at a booth which i thought was very cute. this was our first time here and we were quite impressed. \n\nour waiter was a bit all over the place. we waited much longer for food than other tables around us but it was worth the wait. my husband had the fried <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> sandwich and it was delicious and hilarious since the bun was 1/4 of the size of the entire piece of pork. fries were battered which i love and he really enjoyed the juicy pork. \n\ni had the chicken and waffles. the chicken was incredible. some of the best i've ever had. the waffle was sweet and smoky due to the addition of bacon which i adored. the hot sauce syrup was tasty and i just really like it. \n\nthe side of biscuit and gravy was just obscene. the biscuit was huge and the puddle of gravy was excellent. \n\nit would have been a 5 star spot in my book if not for the very spotty service. i'd come again because the food and portions were phenomenal.", 
            "i've been to hhagg before and know that the portions are insane. like, it's crazy how big they are. i wasn't looking to totally blow my macros on my first meal so, i kept it basic and, ordered the basic for breakfast :)\n\nfood was hot, appetizing and service was a plus! now, my sangria. it was probably the worst one i ever had. the only fruit in it was diced apples. what are thosssse!? anyways, that's my only complaint. my mom loved this place so much she ate here 3x during our stay at the linq. we went back for dinner at 4 and it didn't start until 5. i was really bummed about that so, i just got a side salad. oh, my aunt really enjoyed the stuffed burgers but, as expected they're huge! same for the <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark>. omg, i'm getting nauseous now thinking about the portions as i write this review. \n\nso, there you have it. the main take away is the portions. ask for an extra plate and save yourself a tummy ache and a few dollars. you'll thank me later, i promise!"

            "i really tried to like this place. i really did. i'm a big man vs. food fan, so i was pretty excited the first time i came here.\n\nfirst visit:\n\ni ordered the famous <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles - chicken was overcooked and dry. the dish didn't really have that much flavor, and the waffle was terrible. imagine dry teriyaki chicken w/ waffles. grade : d\n\nthe girl ordered the meat loaf hash - the meat loaf was so bad that we thought it was tofu. the potatoes were burned. it wasn't pleasant. grade  : f-\n\ni figured the chef was having a bad day so i gave them another chance...\n\nsecond visit :\n\ni ordered <mark>HH Original</mark> benedict - mysterious cheese-flavored gravy over two eggs, bacon, and biscuit. the gravy ruined the dish, it was like movie theater nacho cheese mixed with country gravy. yuk. grade : f\n\nthe girl ordered some tractor man combo with a ginormous blueberry pecan pancake - it really sucked. the pancake was big, but too dense. the blueberries + pecans + pancake didn't really go well together . grade : f\n\nthe mom had the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> - \n\nshe didn't really have much to say except \"this is a horrifying experience.\"\n\n'nuff said.", 
            "5 stars for the food. \n3 stars for the service.\nso i came out at an even 4.\n\n\namazing breakfast is had here. \n\ni was really excited to eat somewhere other than subway at vegas this time around... and the hash house a go go definitely provides a bang for your buck (which is critical when doing vegas on a budget like i am).\nbut who am i kidding? i didn't even pay for this meal! a good friend did (and that right there is the ultimate best way to do vegas on a budget!). \n\ngot the <mark>HH Original</mark> benedict but veggie style, so without the <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark> (got asparagus on the side instead).  the roasted red pepper cream it came with was absolutely uh-mazing! as were the griddled <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>! \n\nalmost couldn't finish my meal, the plate was so large! be prepared to get a to-go box and eat the rest after when you're good and drunk :)\n\nthe service was a bit on the slow side... but it was vegas on a saturday morning. a tip would be to come an hour before you actually want to eat and then go gamble downstairs while you wait for a table.\n \nalso... i gotta say that the entrance to the imperial palace from the strip is harder to find than one would think. there's some stores and a restaurant in the front that actually obstruct the casino entrance behind.  there seems to be only a vehicle entrance through two driveways, however, the actual pedestrian pathways are next to these driveways... they just looks like shady alley ways. took us a second to figure it out!", 
            "i just found one of my favorite breakfast places on the strip.  wow!  big portions and won't put a big dent in your wallet.\n\ni tried my son's meatloaf...excellent!\ni had the <mark>HH Original</mark> eggs benedict (<mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, fresh tomato, fresh spinach, roasted red pepper cream and topped w/ two basted eggs...excellent!\n\nthe griddled <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> was also excellent.", 
            "i liked it enough, but my boyfriend thought it was sloppy. i got the chourizo hash and he got the <mark>HH Original</mark> eggs benedict.\n\nnow we're not terribly healthy people, so my boyfriend's \"sloppy\" feedback doesn't have anything to do with him being offended by the portion size. trust me, he ate the whole damn thing man vs. food style. i guess there's just food that makes you fat and then there's food that makes you feel fat just by looking at it.\n\nour waiter told me that the chourizo hash was the best hash they make, so that's what i got. it wasn't terribly spicy... pretty much perfect. maybe too much for a hangover cure but good as a brunch item otherwise. the portion was huge and the potatoes were excellent.\n\nmy eggs were severely undercooked for over-medium... shoot, they were undercooked for sunny side up. i ate them anyway with no ill effects.\n\ni enjoyed the presentation of mine (obviously the boyfriend was nauseated by his) and you definitely get plenty of quality, creative food here... but... i just can't vouch for it.", 
            "first stop on the hang over train was hash house a go go. i came here with a few friends after hearing about it and was skeptical about dining at the imperial palace after once having to stay at the hotel. i ordered the <mark>HH Original</mark> farm benedict... you cant go wrong! if your not hungry then don't come since the portions are large. the presentation is nice but once you dig in it becomes a huge mess but it all ends up in the same place anyways. i must say after having hash house i've been craving to go back here. another alternative to hh is tractor in san diego which is across the street from hh. both places are amazing and if you have the chance try it out.", 
            "been here a few times and it's our favorite breakfast place anywhere.  the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> or the <mark>HH Original</mark> benedict is all we need and that'll fuel you up for the whole day.  it's very easy to get carried away and order too much so it's best to share.", 
            "i was worried this location wouldn't be as good as the one in town but i was pleasantly surprised. we had a little wait (40 min for 7 people) but it was totally worth it. the food quality was spectacular. none of the other 6 people had ever eaten here before and they all can't wait to come back. the olives for the bloody mary was stuffed with jalapenos for extra kick. my <mark>HH Original</mark> benedict was as big as my head and sooo delicious. the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> is unreal and the biggest surprise was how perfect the quesadilla was. it was spicy with crunchy fresh jalapenos. i will be back my next trip for some more belly busting goodness!", 
            "i was soooo excited to eat here.  i had it on my list and was making sure i was not going to leave vegas without trying it. it was easy to find.  just head straight through the imperial palace until you hit the escalators.  we were are very hungry after a night of drinking and dancing and hoped to not have to wait too long to get seated.  it was pretty busy and also a friday morning.  we were pleasantly surprised to get seated promptly in a nice comfy booth.  i ordered coffee and it came quick enough and was quite delicious.\n\none thing that stuck out in my mind as odd was the waiter told us right off the bat that the kitchen does not have any heat lamps, so the food is served out as soon as it's made. i thought ok, great, that means we will have our food quickly.  eh, not so much.   our food took a bit to come out.  it wasn't excessive but we definitely waited longer on our food than we did to get a seat.\n\ndue to knowing the portion sizes are enormous we decided to split plates.  my dining partner and i chose the <mark>HH Original</mark> benedict.  it comes with bacon, fresh tomato, fresh spinach, and is topped with a roasted red pepper cream as well as two eggs.  additionally it sat on top of a split biscuit with griddled <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. the potatoes reminded me of the potato pancakes my mom would make when i was a kid with leftover <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>-nice and golden browned and quite tasty. that was probably the best thing about the benedict.  the bacon was good too, but hey it's bacon.\n\n now for the not so good, the eggs were underdone and the parts of the white were still clear.  that kind of thing doesn't bother me, but i would prefer my eggs to be cooked correctly.  the thing that was the biggest bummer was that the food was luke warm.  so i guess the no heat lamp thing doesn't necessarily work to their advantage because my food had to have sat back there for a bit before arriving to the table because it was not hot.  also, the fresh tomato and spinach did not bring anything to the table.  had the spinach been slightly sauteed or wilted and seasoned, it could have been a different story.  i think having those put on top of the benny just made it even colder in temp.  also, the whole thing was under-seasoned.  \n\nthe red pepper cream tasted like roasted red pepper bisque that was under-seasoned and cold.  i really do like the concept of having a benedict topped with lighter ingredients and sauce, but it was all cold and under-seasoned and disappointing.  i kept going back to the bacon, egg and crispy <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  i will say that i was able to split this with another person and between the two of us couldn't even finish it.  our bill came to $12 each, and i was very happy, and even though it was underwhelming, it was still worth it for the price.\n\nmy other friends ordered the bananas foster <mark>French Toast</mark>-also huge, as well as the <mark>Fresh Mushroom</mark>, artichoke hearts, sun-dried tomato and fresh spinach hash.  my friend did not like her hash at all.  i tried it and agreed with her that it was completely under-seasoned.  i hate having to add salt at a restaurant.  i think it should come out seasoned correctly.  also the salt shaker had course salt in in that barely came out the holes in the shaker-a huge pet peeve of mine.  the bananas foster was huge but nothing out of this world.  what i did really like though was the split banana topped with sugar and bruleed.  it was so delicious and the banana developed a very creamy texture.  it was served still in the peel, which i thought was pretty cool.\n\noverall, the value is great, and the quality is also good.  i can only base this review on the one visit i made here, and there were definite flaws in the execution of the food.   although the plates are huge, impressive looking, the taste is what matters most, and it unfortunately was lacking.  however, on a whole, due to the value of the food and he fact that one plate can be split between two people, i would like to go back and prove that hash house can really live up to its hype.", 
            "after our $60 breakfast here i can safely say this place isn't worth the hype!\n\nwhen we arrived at 9:30am there was no wait. when we left, maybe an hour later, there were so many people waiting it had to have been over an hour wait. let me tell you, i would have been pissed if i had waited more than 15 minutes for this breakfast!\n\ndrinks - i ordered a watermelon lemonade and bf ordered a pistachio iced mocha. the drinks were awesome! mine was slightly sour but had enough watermelon flavor that it wasn't too much. his pistachio mocha was sooo good! i was mad that i didn't order it. \n\nfor breakfast both my bf and my bff ordered <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> which is two eggs, bacon or sausage, and a pancake, or you can substitute a waffle or <mark>French Toast</mark> for one extra dollar. bff got the pancake (that thing was bigger than the plate it was served on!!) and bf got the vanilla waffle. \n\ntheir eggs (scrambled) were nice and fluffy, the bacon was alright. his waffle was good, but didn't taste like vanilla, and her pancake she liked, but couldn't even eat half of it.\n\nmy order - okay you know when you read the description for something and then it arrives and you realize you read the description all wrong? this is what happened to me. \n\ni ordered the <mark>HH Original</mark> benedict. eggs benedict - i expect hollandaise and some poached eggs. whatever else happens is fine, but those are the things i need. i read that i would get a biscuit instead of an english muffin and there was mention of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, although i didn't know how that would fit in. i read about the red pepper cream, but i thought that would be along with my hollandaise. i read basted eggs, and i honestly didn't know what that meant. \n\nso i received this massive red mess with sprigs of rosemary and what look like pine needles shooting out the side of my food. i get trying to make a plate look nice, but this was a bit much.\n\nthe taste? eh. the top layers are alright. the basted egg is overcooked, no runny yolk at all, but the sauce was okay and the tomato was fine. the bottom layers though, a dry ass biscuit on top of dry <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. not a good combo. they really have no business calling this any sort of benedict since they strayed away from every traditional benedict characteristic possible, aside from stacking everything on top of each other.\n\nthere are many better places to drop $60 on breakfast at in vegas - this is not one i would revisit. also, apparently there was an episode of man vs food filmed here? that must be their claim to fame because our waiter mentioned it at least 5 times. wow, i am so impressed.", 
            "i absolutely love this place! my husband and i make it a point to come here every time we come to vegas. i've never been disappointed here and there is never enough time (or room in my belly) to try everything i want. one of my favorites is the hash house original benedict with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, biscuits, spinach, tomatoes, poached eggs(or they call them basted, not totally sure what the difference is) and roasted red pepper cream sauce. sooo good! the portions are massive and the <mark>HH Original</mark> benedict is about $15 or so, so you can save some money by just ordering that and splitting with someone else. it always sounds like a good idea before we get there, but then i can't decide and we usually end up ordering two entrees. the banana-brown sugar pancake is awesome too and doesn't even need syrup. it's massive as well of course. i can usually only eat about 1/4 of it. the breakfast quesadilla has potatoes and a bunch of other yummy stuff, also perfect. i'm not a big fan of bloody mary's, until i had one here. awesom bloody marys and nice and big. perfectly seasoned and not too spicy. can't wait to have one in a few days. vegas baby, vegas!!!", 
            "i ordered a variety of things, bc i wanted to try so much.\n(remember that the portions here are huge.)\n\nbanana latte: don\"t bother ordering this. this did not taste anything like bananas!\ni was so disappointed. i could have saved myself $9.\n\nthe <mark>HH Original</mark> benedict: thumbs up. its very tasty.\n\n<mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>: thumbs down. its basically 4 pieces of square shaped waffles with two bacon strips baked into it.....i thought this waffle was going to have bits of bacon all over the entire things, cooked into it.:(\n\nmeatloaf: delicious.\n\nthe one thing i loved about this place is the way they plate everything. the portions are huge ,but the way they plate it is very clean and colorful, not messy at all. great job.\ni will definitely be back to try more things.", 
            "i love benedicts and i was craving a good been- i read some yelp reviews and found hash house a go go and decided that would be my breakfast place. i also looked online and the menu seemed delicious and i love fresh, organic and farm food. i ordered the <mark>HH Original</mark> benedict. i knew i would miss my hollandaise sauce but the roasted cream sauce sounded interesting. the service was great and the food comes out super fast. it was huge to my surprise. it was pretty bland to me and what makes it huge is the super enormous scoops of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and two fluffy biscuits. it's a total carbohydrate nightmare. i ate the sauce and the eggs and a few bites of potato with biscuit. but i still craved my traditional benedict that i originally had my heart set on. i should have ordered a scramble instead because there is a lack of protein in this dish. \nthis is in the quad casino and there is a lot of construction going on in the casino so it can be hard to find - just follow the signs or ask someone. \nif you like carbs- then you will probably like hash house a go go. this place will make you fat.", 
            "less is more. i wish this place was better. i have been wanting to try hhagg for a long time, but it never seems to work out. i finally made it on tuesday morning and felt sick all day. it's carb overload. (thats hard for me to say because i love carbs).\n\nthe meal just started off on the wrong foot. i hate spicy food, and i have a weak tolerance. i ordered the <mark>HH Original</mark> which is <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, fresh tomato, fresh spinach, roasted red pepper cream and two basted eggs. all this over the biscuits and then over a huge pile of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. reading this on the menu, there is no spice - safe for me to eat. not so fast... when the plate comes it is decorated in a red sauce (which i was falsely led to believe was red pepper cream) and took a nice big taste of it and turned out to be hot sauce. it sent my taste buds into a frenzy and i really wish they would just garnish the plate with the actual red pepper cream instead of adding the hot sauce to the plate. it really ruined my taste buds for the rest of the meal. \n\noverall, just disappointed. not worth all the fuss.", 
            "what the frick. could the dishes be any bigger?!??!\n\nfashooo share with someone when you eat here. do not even doubt the size because anything you get will be good enough for 2 if not 3 people!! you definitely get your moneys worth, but the food is definitely not ideal to take to go when you can't finish your meal so try to find a dish wanted w your friend and just gooo for it.\n\nsomehow i finished all the toppings of my <mark>HH Original</mark> benedict only leaving behind half the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and a little bit of the biscuit (which is to die for btw the biscuit was ooooh lawdddd)\n\nbut everything else....\n\nchicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> - the size of an actual freakin pie. looks like a pie that threw up its insides gracefully\n\n<mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> - huge pile of compost lookin food but bet it tasted good\n\nchicken rosemary hash plate - big square plated hash on a pan big enough to cook on\n\njust why. never again not listening to reviews. satisfying, but really hash house?? really???", 
            "most tourists decide where to eat because people rave about it on yelp, and so did we. the food portion is huge! and the decoration is awesome, but i'd focus more on the taste.     i think what i ordered is <mark>HH Original</mark> benedict, i know the waitress already told me it is different from the usual benedict because they use tomato sauce instead of hollandaise sauce and i still wanted to try. i don't know what is wrong but they just don't seem right for me. the mashed potato was tasteless and didn't go well with the only sour tomato sauce, so as the biscuit. i expected more balanced flavor from the signature dish that represents the restaurant. my brother ordered corn hash beef with scrambled egg and said it's just bland and nothing special but the size.", 
            "i was simply amazed at the size and presentation of the chicken and waffles plate! it is the biggest plate i've ever seen in my life! \\u00a0it's just a massive tower of yummyness. the\\u00a03\\u00a0waffles are filled with crispy bacon, the\\u00a0fried sage crusted chicken\\u00a0was really flavorful and crispy while the inside of the chicken was juicy and it paired well with the fried leeks and maple syrup.\n\ni also tried the <mark>HH Original</mark>\\u00a0which is made w/<mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, fresh tomato, fresh spinach,roasted red pepper cream and topped w/ two basted eggs. pretty good too.", 
            "i'm never impressed by quantity over quality but i really wanted to like this place. the wait was 90 minutes for breakfast so we went and gambled and returned in 75 minutes $150 richer. score!  so, we're all riding a jackpot high ready for some good food. i was drawn to the benedict menu, while my dining partners had <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and corn beef and cocktails. maybe it was the alcohol -- they loved their food but i was greatly disappointed (drinking coffee).  i had the <mark>HH Original</mark> that was supposed to have tomato cream sauce. i was unpleasantly surprised to receive a plate covered in marinara sauce; eggs, mash, biscuit covered in marinara. the biscuit on it's own-delicious. the mash-yum. <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark>?  an utter failure. where was the cream sauce?  my recommendation, drink heavily or win the price of the meal and you won't care so much.", 
            "overall, this was one of the best eating experiences in recent memory!!  i came here on a sunday afternoon with some friends. it was my first time trying this place. i do remember it being featured on man vs. food. located in the second floor of the linq hotel, there was a 25 minute wait to an hour, but managed to get seated within a half hour or so. until then, we used that time to take a look at the menu, so that by the time we were seated and served, we'd know what we wanted to order.\n\nsince we were super hungry, it was a tough decision to make since there was such a variety of food entrees to choose from, whether you're craving something hearty to the more smaller and healthier  portions. i decided to order the <mark>HH Original</mark>. the dish featured a sweet but large helping of bacom <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> topped with two biscuits, two slices of thick bacon, tomato slices, spinach, and over easy eggs smothered in red, hot chipotle sauce.\n\noh. my. god. first of all, the portion size was quite enormous. the size of these entrees are enough to keep you full the rest of the day. all that was left after i finished was a piece of biscuit. it was soooo worth the wait! the coffee to top it all off with was nice and fresh :)\n\nour server, tawney,  was outstanding! she was super friendly and was excited aboout providing us with the best service possible, and she stuck to it. she happily shared past experiences of seeing people's reactions to the portion sizes, and also kept making sure our food arrived at our table in a promptly and timley manner. such a wonderful experience for our first time here. the next time i want to come back to vegas and crave for some good morning eats, hash house a go go at the linq is the place to go :)"

            "i saw this place on man vs food and he had rave reviews for it.  since everything you see on tv is true, i decided to stop here this weekend cause i expected delicious food.\n\nthis location is located in one of the classiest casino and hotels on the las vegas strip, the imperial palace.  it's asian motif along with the celebrity impersonators makes it a grade a destination in the 702. it's located upstairs and i heard it's pretty new to the casino.  definitely looks new.\n\nmy friends and i waited about 45 minutes to get a table.  i spent the time wisely, winning 60 bucks at the blackjack table.  the place is pretty crowded as they accommodate big parties.  the restaurant is really big as i saw tables and tables of people.\n\nthe wait for the food took a while, i'd probably say like 25-30 minutes.  for some reason, i fell in and out of hungriness so by the time i got my food, i wasn't as hungry as i was an hour ago. that was really a shame because the portions were pretty damn huge.  when i looked at my friends' faces, they looked as if it was more of a task than a great meal.  \n\ni ended  up ordering the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, which was featured on man v food i believe.  it wasn't as good as i expected it to be.  the damn thing was huge but there was so much going on with that thing that the flavor's just mashed up and it was like i was eating slop.  <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and bacon are two of my favorite things but when they are combined, it's just too rich for me.  there was just too many diff flavors combined into one.  \n\ni don't recall any of my friends saying their food was great but maybe everyone was full.  i saved half of the food for later and ate it after a night of drinking. for some reason, that shit still wasn't super appetizing.  those fries ray gave me were better tasting!\n\noverall, it wasn't bad but it wasn't great.  if you like big portions, holler at this place.  honestly, i don't think the wait was worth it but possibly go on a weekday or something and i'm sure the lines will be shorter.", 
            "i've got to agree that the portions are huge and should be shared by 3 or more people.  if you have a refrigerator in your room for the left overs then go ahead and get one meal for yourself.\n\nwe actually ate there twice because we were staying at the imperial palace.  the first night we had the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles and the #5 burger that was stuffed with bacon and avocado.  the chicken was dry and the hamburger really didn't have much flavor.  i also ordered a beer off of the draft list and was told that they don't carry draft beers at the that location but they all of the restaurants use the same menu.  that seems kinda cheap to me.  i was really looking forward to a mothership.\n\nthe next night my husband and i shared the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>.  this time the chicken wasn't dry and the hollandaise sauce was flavorful but the biscuit underneath was dry and hard.  our girls got the tractor pancake breakfast and the pancake was huge!! one lady that was walking by said \"look its the uncle buck pancake!!!!\"  the girls got a laugh out of it but when i tasted it i thought \"dry again.\"\n\nso what i would recommend is that if its late and you are staying in the hotel it doesn't hurt to try it once but don't make a special trip just to eat there.  i was very disappointed.", 
            "i will miss you hash house a go go.  our time was short, but well spent.  and now all i have is pictures to drool over.\n\nbefore eating here i read the review that keith a. did.  i noticed the waits are long. so when we got to vegas and were planning everything out, i called down and spoke with someone about best times to come in.  he asked if i was going to be around mid-week and i said, \"yep! till thursday!\"  he said, \"any day mid-week after 10:30 is generally no wait at all.\"\n\ni called again on wednesday morning to double check and the gentleman said there's no wait at all.  we got down there about 45 minutes later, and as said, we were promptly seated with no wait.  our server was a really nice guy who was on top of his game.  polite, kind, and friendly.  three things most servers should practice!\n\nmy wife ordered a egg scramble that was decent sized, it came with a biscuit and she ordered a mimosa and said that all of it tasted really good.  i tasted the scramble, it had chicken, corn, eggs and cheese.  maybe a few other things i cant remember but it tasted really fresh!\n\ni got the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> bene!!! my eyes were huge with amazement at this insane looking mound of food that was put on my table.  i stared at it wondering how the hell do you eat this thing!?!?  after simply \"diving in\", i had a system going and it was going well!!! so many flavors colliding that i was very impressed.  the chipotle topping was a nice flavor added to everything else.  i saved some for that night being i was so stuffed and it was gone!!!  \n\nif eating at this location, give them a call and see what the wait is, it'll help decided if you wanna come or not.", 
            "my friend michelle saw this restaurant on man v. food and she wanted to try it. we came here for lunch on the first day we were in vegas. i didn't see this restaurant last time i was in vegas, so i'm guessing it's fairly new. it's in imperial palace on the upper level. my friends and i had to wait for about 15 minutes before getting seated. we were looking over the menu and the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles caught my eye. i was stuck between the chicken and waffles and <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark>. \n\nas we were called in, i saw that other people's portions were huge! the plates were big and the food was also big!  i had to come to a final decision and the winner was chicken and waffles. after seeing one from the table next to us, my friend jenn and i decided to share. good thing we did because we were still unable to finish one plate! the waffles were thick and fluffy and also stuffed with bacon inside! major plus, since i love bacon! the chicken was surrounded with leek and a stick of sage that was pierced into the chicken. the sage was a little too overpowering for me, but it was something different. my friend michelle ordered the strawberry pancakes and it was the biggest pancake i have ever seen! i don't recall her finishing it all because it was so much! \n\nthis place was very good and the service was mediocre. it took a while to get our food but i think it was worth the wait! once again, the portions were huge and the prices were pretty decent compared to other restaurants on the strip.", 
            "when i was told that we would be going to lunch at imperial palace the snob in me instantly was like omg ew......   my friend assured me i would not be disappointed... so i bought into it.... \"ok lets go\"   as we walked to our table i began to notice that this place is insane for serving size...  my order was the kokomo sandwich (meatloaf sandwich with 2 oversize pieces of texas toast as the bread and a humongous serving of french fries... other items at my table were a pancake the size of oregon, pork something or other doused with creamy bbq sauce that... that thing looked and tasted delicious....  of course someone had to get the man vs food  - <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>....  which was delicious....  i dont think people use the word delicious enough by the way!   overall i was super impressed....  i cant wait to go back!", 
            "holy moly! can we say huge portions????!!! this was yummy, but i feel like the focus was more on novelty than flavor. so much was on my plate that i felt like certain things lost flavor. \n\ni got the eggs benedict with <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, griddled mozzarella, fresh spinach with eggs and bacon on a buttermilk biscuit with hollandaise. it was good, but the i couldn't fully taste the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with everything else going on.  my friend got the meatloaf. this was definitely tastier.\noverall, a great experience, and i definitely recommend it if you're hungry!", 
            "went to hash house on the recommendation of a friend and it didn't disappoint. \n\nthe wait for four was about 30 minutes on a mother's day sunday. but after getting and seeing the food others are eating, you start to salivate, anticipating what you're going to order.\n\nbe afraid of the portions, because they are large. you may notice that their plates are more like serving platters and their portions fill each plate (platter).\n\ni had one of their scrambles and it was the smallest plate. their bbblt sandwich may contain a 1/2 lb. of bacon and the bread is at least 1-1/4\" thick! if you order the <mark>French Toast</mark>, you'll get two large pieces of tasty delight and the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> is very very moist but keeping the skin crunchy.\n\nprices range in the $15 - $20 range, but are large (large) enough to share... unless you are the unlv football team. \n\nwe went to the location in the imperial palace. it was a great location and the wait wasn't too bad, but i hear the locations not on the strip are a bit less crowded.",

            "man crushes. \n\nguys have them. no man is immune to them. no matter how he likes to boast how hetero he is and that having man crushes aren't very manly. odds are that he's a closet man-crusher. man crushing does not entail an intimate coital relationship. these are just guys that you may want to go to a bar with and throw down some brews and play darts (not the of the butt variety). the focal point of said man crushes can be athletes, actors, comedians, office jerk, gynecologists.... \n\nto bring me closer to one of my man crushes (yes i'm not scared to say i have several....it's liberating), i decided to visit one of the places i've seen on a show i loosely base my life on. man vs. food (adam richaman). when i found out that i didn't have to drive off the vegas strip in order to visit it's sister location, my heart skipped a beat and i'm pretty sure i behaved like a teenage girl about to come into close quarters with justin timberlake (wet). \n\ni went with the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles. the chicken was void of any sage flavor. i don't even know what sage is supposed to taste like, but i'm sure this chicken was void of it. it was bland, but, i will admit, it was the best cooked <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> i've ever had. crunchy batter and all moist and sh^t inside. nothing that a little bit of salt and hot sauce didn't help. the waffles were dense. they'd give rush limbaugh a run for his money. and much like rush, there was bacon inside of the waffles. there's enough food on the plate to feed everyone on the blackjack table. \n\nit's inside the imperial palace casino on the second floor. so if you're a cocksucker that likes to pretend to have more money than your anchor blue jeans is letting on to me and only like to be seen in aria or bellagio, stay out dickhead. us regular people have more fun anyways.\n\nbefore i call it a week, here's a small sample list of men you can gush over and man crush on.  also a list of men you need to hate.\n\nyes:\nchuck norris\nsteven segal\njason statham\nryan reynalds\njo koy\nbj penn\n\nno:\ndr. phil\nbill o'reilly\nmichael moore\nja rule\nkany west\noprah",

            "went to hh for breakfast on a weekday about 8:30. we had to wait about ten minutes or so and they seemed pretty disorganized getting people seated even though there were plenty of empty tables. but once we got seated is was all good. my wife had the <mark>French Toast</mark> with bananas and a maple reduction that was really tasty. i had the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> which was killer. the chipotle cream sauce was what really made it for me. i really liked the fresh spinach and tomato on it too. about the only real thing that i can say remotely negative about the place is that the servings are huge. just too much food for most people. almost seems like a waste. i'd go back in a second for any meal to try some of their other dishes.", 
            "order the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> and warm spinach.\n\nthe warm spinach would have been better if they didn't drench the salad in vinaigrette.  a completely weak $9 salad.  small with no substance, much like the garbage of a hotel casino this place is located in.  does anyone else besides me think it's time for place to go?  imperial palace?  come on now, is this place even politically correct?\n\nthe benedict tasted absolutely disgusting.  i enjoy artery clogging goodness as much anyone else but this was just so poorly executed.  so the place had a few biscuits, scrambled eggs, and two <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breast fillet haphazardly lumped together on a plate, drench and i mean completely a quart of sauce drench in some sauce i cannot make out.  nothing is spared, everything just tasted like this disgusting thousand islands mayo based concoction.  even if the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was good, there would have no way for me to have known.\n\ni asked if they could change the television channel over to the oregon stanford game, i got a yes, but no action.  of course it's probably random chance with my server and runners but i hate lip service!  if you're not going to do something of if you don't want to please don't tell me that you will, if not for the absolutely quick response time of las vegas metro i would have stabbed the man in the back with the butter knife.  if you even think that the food is going to take another 15 minutes, why would you tell me it'll be a couple minutes?  ridiculous!  must have been at least 45 mins from when we put the order in to when the food came out.  i honestly looking back should have just took my friend's suggestion of walking out and leaving.  i just couldn't tell if he was serious, but knowing him as long as i do, i should have know he was.\n\ni felt so bad for suggesting this place to my good buddy that i gave him my credit card for the night.  i know a lot of people like to come here for the first time because of their huge portion size (which at around $15 -$23 a plate i hardly think is that amazing) but i doubt there are many repeat customers.", 
            "the food was awesome! however i cant say much about the service.  we had a party of 12 and we werent all there at once so we werent seated until our whole party was there...once we were all there we had to wait for a table 5 minutes plus but then there was only a few customers inside...we were finally seated and half of us wanted the brunch and the other half wanted dinner but then the waiter told us that we could not order dinner until 5 which at that time was about 4:45pm...so the other half waited til 5! i have to say the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> was hands down the best! i will be back to hash house however will not be going to this location.", 
            "i'm going to start this off by saying that i am not a fan of casino eatery places (aside from buffets) that are on upper floors of the buildings. i feel like they are almost always desolate (at least in my experiences) and are void of any and all character that it may have if it were in it's own separate location. and this particular place was of no exception. there were three other tables (the place was a really dull atmosphere- cmon, it's vegas people!). i perhaps saw my waitress three times-including bill drop-off and pick-up and the food was not on the cheap end of things. \ni ordered <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> (w/ fresh spinach, <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs- i subbed grilled chicken in for the fried, not like that redeems calories or anything) and it was huge. and contrary to other reviews, delicious. the mimosa i ordered was really strong for such a little thing and had me kind of whirling out back into the casino. i ate off that thing for two days and will definitely get it again (at the other location) next time i'm there : )", 
            "huge portions, not enough flavor.  this \"man v food\" is really tempting my husband to go to all these places, even when i say it doesn't even look good, we still go!\n\nwaited 20 minutes for a table, the host greeted us, he was very polite.  our waitress seemed high energy.  i start with a latte, they don't have nonfat milk just so you know, it was alright.  i ordered the salmon hash.  i do ask the crazy questions before ordering like substituting whites for full eggs, no cheese etc.  i've turned to a calorie counter so this is important.  he orders the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, no substitutions, as is.  thirty minutes later, two people have to bring out our food because the benedict requires to hands, one for the plate and one to support the benedict so it doesn't fall down.  the benedict consisted of a split chicken breast fried, 2 biscuits split in half, at least a pound of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, fried cheese, spinach, tomatoes topped with a hollandaise sauce.  he ordered with the pistachio mocha which tasted like hersheys chocolate and pistachio extract, i would pass on that drink and it cost about $6.\nso the benedict, he ended up picking out the chicken and some potatoes and the spinach, the rest was just too mediocre.  it could feed at least 4 people.\n\nmy meal, which cost extra mind you because of my substitutions didn't come out right, they had to have been a half pound of brie cheese, though i said no cheese.  the waitress did ask if i wanted a new one, but i was disappointed with the flavors anyways, why wait another half hour?  so the waitstaff is a 5, but the food is pushing a 2/3.  not very cheap.  and i still had to pay for my meal with the substitutions. with it being in vegas, i would try another place.", 
            "i will give 4 stars based on my favorite meal...the tractor driver breakfast with the banana brown sugar pancake.  i visited vegas for a week and came to hash house a go go three times for breakfast/brunch and one late night trip to split <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark> and a watermelon lemonade (which was a little too sweet for my taste).  one visit we had a bad experience by waiting an hour for the food and an indifferent waitress.  i was immediately hooked on their fresh tangerine juice, but they only had it for my first visit.  the banana brown sugar pancake is so delicious.  the way the brown sugar sort of carmelizes to a yummy and sweet crunch...divine.  the griddled <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> were good.  warning:  their portions are scary huge.  i recommend sharing at this place regardless of what you order.  they send home leftover pancakes in a small pizza box to give you an idea.  all the items i saw or ordered came on platters or giant round plates that must have weighed five pounds alone.  a woman next to us the night we went in for dessert ordered a chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> which looked like a giant flying saucer of crust had crashed into it.  for my first trip, i got the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> which was good, but a little too much and too heavy for me.  my other trips were all about that banana brown sugar pancake.  trust me, if you like bananas, you can't go wrong.", 
            "visited this location as it was on the strip.  a bit difficult to find in the imperial palace, but it was worth the slight inconvenience.\n\ni thought about the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, but i saw another customer receive one and it looked like way too much food for me.\n\nhad the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash instead and ate every last bite.  good quality <mark>Corned Beef</mark> and the potatoes were nicely seasoned and had nice crust to them.",

            "if you've eaten here and can't get full off the portions of the food they serve here, you are clearly lying! the portion sizes at hh are ginormous! i have a huuuggge appetite, and i need to share with someone else to keep my tummy from exploding. i consider the prices a bargain for how much food we got and the quality of it. it's also nice that it's centrally located on the strip in imperial palace.\n\nmy first visit here, i ordered the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash loaded with baked potato chunks and topped with 2 eggs. i almost died trying to finish my half of the dish, but it did wonders to my massive hangover. \n\ni came here again this last weekend, and decided to try the popular <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles. the order came with two large breaded chicken breasts and 4 waffles. the breading was derish! but the chicken was really dry, and difficult to finish by the end of the meal. the waffles were amazing! i took my first bite of the waffle and realized that there were bacon strips grilled into the waffles. my friend, who is a loose vegetarian, looovvveeed the waffles.\n\nwe also ordered the fries. i don't know what was in the seasoning, but it was bomb! :) \n\ni tried a bunch of different dishes as well (to help my friends out... obvi!). the quesadilla, which was probably the size of 4 normal ones, was stuffed with potatoes, jalapenos, eggs and tomato. super flavorful and spicy. the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> looked nothing like a <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> and overly rich with taste. the dish came with a ginormous piece of fried tortilla chip that looked like an upside down sombrero. i think that was the \"crust\" of the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>. the sausage gravy stuff was on top, and we realized later on that the huge mound of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> was hiding under the sombrero chip. o_o\n\nafter we were done eating, even though the table still had a good portion of food on it, our waitress entertained us with the thought of dessert... maybe next time.",

            "with a room full of robuchon gifts leftover our fourth day would have been an easy one to sleep in and eat breakfast in the room - but why do things easy when there are so many great places to dine in las vegas?  despite my multiple trips to sin city in the past i'd regretfully been without a car on past visits and as such never been able to visit the local legend of \"twisted farm food\" - hash house a go-go.  having heard that a third (the other in san diego) location of the famous spot had recently opened in the imperial palace and waking up early as ever we made our way to the restaurant around 8:00am without reservations and found only 3-4 tables occupied.\n \nwith late eighties classics blasting we made our way to the hostess podium where we were greeted by a young lady clad in jeans and a hhagg shirt who led us to a four-top big enough for eight - no doubt hash house does everything big.  taking a seat we were soon greeted by our server, noelle, a pleasant young woman who was substantially more cordial and efficient than necessary at such a restaurant (a good thing, for sure.)  menus in hand we were left to decide while a mountainous eggs benedict passed by en route for another table.  hilariously enough, while we were waiting a group of six young men approached the hostess stand and then left because \"oh man, we thought this was a buffet.\"  clearly they'd not seen the portion sizes.\n \nsitting and chatting while coffee, water, orange juice, and tea were filled we decided to order only three items and share them around.  with prices ranging from $7-$17 we were informed that one of us would have to pay a $2 split entree fee - when i chuckled saying okay the response was \"you'd be amazed how angry some people get about it\" - clearly i'm jaded.  sitting back and listening to rock you like a hurricane while sipping the surprisingly good coffee the restaurant slowly filled up.\n \narriving in less than 20 minutes the portions were precisely as expected - enormous and delicious looking.  with a sweet, a savory, and a \"dessert\" there was too much food for four people.  beginning first with the blackberry granola flapjacks, my sister's choice although i'd lobbied for the snickers flapjacks, the pancake itself was enormous - literally the size of a car tire in diameter though thankfully not as thick.  with ample warm syrup and butter to spread there was really nothing subtle or nuanced, it was just good cofort food and the sweet blackberries worked nicely with the crunchy honey granola.\n\nperhaps the most famous hash house dish would be my order - \"<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> stacked with our famous <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>, hot maple caramel reduction and crowned with fried leeks.\"  golden and crispy the chicken was amply accented with sage and actually quite delicious.  stacked above and below four golden waffles loaded with whole strips (not small bits like other places) of salty bacon and topped with crispy leeks plus a sauce that was much more maple than caramel i have to admit that this was a huge portion of food.  while clearly not as subtle and refined as bouchon's chicken and waffles i actually much preferred this to roscoe's famous los angeles version and the less famous option at dc's founding farmers.\n\nour dessert would be <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark> topped with ice cream and served with a cup of coffee.  with the coffee alone costing $2.50 on the menu this <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark> is the deal of the breakfast menu at a mere $7.95.  a portion easily large enough for two hungry people or a family of four to share after dinner the pudding was essentially a black and white coffee cake that would have filled 3/4 of a standard loaf pan.  buttery and rife with chocolate the steaming hot pudding was then topped with melted snickers bars, doused with chocolate and caramel syrups, then piled high with two large scoops of vanilla ice cream, whipped cream, and crumbly brown sugar.  like the other choices there was nothing subtle about this caloric monster but honestly for all its audacity it was really quite good.\n\nsettling the bill (about $14 each after tax and a 25% tip) and returning a large portion to the kitchen (we still had p.u.b. leftovers and the robuchon basket in the room) we thanked our service team and made our way to <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> accompanied by eddie van halen's eruption.  generally a fan of refined flavors, elaborate cooking techniques, quiet dining rooms, excellent service, and great food hash house a go go wasn't exactly my kind of place - but the service was excellent and the food was pretty darn good.", 
            "i decided to give the hash house a go go at imperial palace a try since i had already visited the one on sahara ave.  given the past reviews of how mediocre this location was, i took it with a grain of salt and set low expectations.  and in a way, it helped.\n\nthe restaurant is definitely much smaller than the sahara location and it did feel a little congested.  it might have been because i sat at the bar instead of a table.  also the vibe of the restaurant felt different maybe because it's on the strip with more tourists whereas the sahara location was more laid back.  the really good thing though is that their prices are pretty much the same so no inflated strip prices here.\n\nafter tackling <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> last time, i decided to try their <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles (http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=f_5_unx-wrafcxuakbzrdw&select=9bclmrftsqxj9isx6atdlg). boy, did i totally underestimate how doughy those <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> would be.  i was a little bummed out that i didn't get too much syrup, but i was too hungry that morning to wait much longer.  i didn't think i did too bad though, i managed to leave just two waffles behind =).  the chicken sadly was overcooked this time so overall i had a really doughy and dry meal.  if i had to choose my favorite between the chicken and waffles or the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> wins hands down.  much more flavor and not very dry thanks to the chipotle cream sauce.\n\ni probably won't be coming back to this location again unless i happen to be at imperial palace with a huge hunger attack.  i think i'll stick with the sahara location from now on.", 
            "my second time coming to hash house i tried the location at imperial palace. i tried the <mark>French Toast</mark>...oh my goodness the best i have ever had! they are topped with banana cinnamon cream w/ pecan maple syrup! \n\nmy first visit to hh i tried the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles and it was ok, but the <mark>French Toast</mark> is much better!! \n\nthe portions are very large so it is a good idea to share :)", 
            "hash house's food was fresh, tasty, and everything had a good twist on traditional \"home cooked\" food. not to mention, the service was spectacular on both visits. \n\nour group of 10 dined at hash house twice for breakfast while in vegas over christmas. staying at the flamingo put us just a quick brisk walk to the imperial palace and up the escalator dedicated to hash house. getting to the restaurant before 9am both times, the staff was easily able to accommodate our large group. the restaurant was largely empty that early, but did begin to fill up around 10am. our servers, on both occasions, were courteous, efficient, enthusiastic, and even charming. for me, that can really put a dining experience over the top. \n\nwhile the food was very good, being the griddle cafe fanatic that i am, i cannot give hash house 5 stars. their pancakes (snickers) and <mark>French Toast</mark> did not compare to the deliciousness that is the griddle. \n\nbut, the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles is note worthy. perfectly <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breast that were very moist with a crisp, not overly salty, crust hinted with sage was probably the best <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> i recall having (although i rarely eat <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>). the waffles were inventive with the strips of bacon entwined in the batter in stead of bacon bits mixed in the waffle. this was perfect as the bacon didn't overpower, but accented the waffle and still gave you the satiety of have two strips of bacon with your meal. the maple reduction tasted more like balsamic, but really highlighted the dish and i recommend using the sauce on your food and not avoiding it. \nit was just yum! my boyfriend and i split the dish and it was perfect for two people. the next visit we split the <mark>French Toast</mark> which was just as huge with a griddle banana that was still in the skin split atop the super thick sliced bread. the banana was disturbing at first being black from the griddle, but was actually delicious and perfectly cooked. it went well with the <mark>French Toast</mark>. \n\nmany people at our table went with the tractor special, which was well received and the most traditional style breakfast item they offer. no one tried their hash, sadly. \n\nany meal on the menu, if you can split it with someone, do it! our server was nice enough not to charge to $2.50 split plate charge. \n\ni do think that hash house is a \"must-go\" while in vegas. but, sorry, hh, you're not the best. xoxo", 
            "if you are sick of buffet for brunch, or even for lunch/dinner, hash house is a legit alternative!\n\ngenerally i go for the buffets on sundays during my stays in vegas but friends and i decided to try something different.  we all had hash house in sd so decided to try out the vegas strip location.\n\ntwo of us ended up getting the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>.  yes it's as crazy as it sounds :]] <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and thick <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> then topped with hot maple caramel reduction and fried leeks. sage on the chicken gives it such a different flavor and what better way to start the day than with <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>??  <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> are filling and the little bits of bacon is a nice smoky touch from the sweetness of the waffles.  the maple reduction and fried leeks are good just by itself. i can drink a gallon of the maple reduction and just eat a salad made of fried leeks.\n\nthe other two went for the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. fried... chicken... benedict!  it comes with fresh spinach, <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs. what a healthy way to start the day huh?\n\nhash house's specialty is what it markets itself as: twisted farm food. it's nothing gourmet and definitely not the healthiest breakfast food around but it's fun, delicious, savory, and guaranteed you won't leave hungry!", 
            "delicious!  missed the man v food episode, but followed a cousin's recommendation.  service was great, wait was about 15 minutes for two of us, on a holiday monday, around noon.  prices are very reasonable, portions are massive, and the \"man v food\" <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> is fantastic!", 
            "the only reason i gave it a 3/5 was the location at the shitbox that is imperial palace. i despise that hotel. it stinks, and you can easily get lost trying to find the restuarant.  aside from that, prepared to come early cause after the popularity of man vs food this spot has become known. portions are huge. i had the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict and brown sugar banana pancakes. let's say after i devoured it, i probably should've napped for hours. it was very delicious and pretty affordable compared to a vegas buffet or something. would like to try the location a little off the strip from man vs. food episode.", 
            "saw this on our tv in our hotel room on one of those vegas channels.. decided to come here after looking at the menu online. came here around 3pm and no one was there which was nice since we didn't have to wait. \n\nour waitress was super nice and offered up a bunch of suggestions. i got the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> and the boyfriend got biscuits & gravy. the portions are epic. way too big for one person - probably even two. my meal was good although the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and the plate were awkward and i didn't like them paired with the rest of the items on my plate. the chipotle sauce was amazing. <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was good, eggs very good. overall it was good but i'd definitely get something else next time. the boyfriend really liked his biscuits and gravy but didn't like the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> on the plate. he thought that potatoes did not go well with the biscuits and gravy. so i guess we both felt the same way about the potatoes :/", 
            "this \"twisted farm food\" caf\\u00e9 in the heart of the imperial palace was my breakfast location of choice for way to many early mornings. the urban/farm type decor is different, but well kept and clean. the food here is an experience to say the least. the menu is expansive to say the least with specialties such as <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> which is a 14oz budweiser and a side of bacon! or the blt bloody mary. they are known here for their <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles which are extreme for sure. please see a few of the pictures for the full impact. the service here was spot on, all the staff is younger sort of \"punk rock\" which fits the feel in general, but the food left me a bit confused. i never had the signature giant pancake or the chicken and waffles..but i did try several other items and found the experience to be pretty bi-polar. the home made giant biscuits that are given table side (and come with most any entree) are fun due to their sheer girth (that's right i said girth!)...but one bit left me tasting baking soda and begging for honey, or butter, or jam...or anything to quench my now parched gullet. this went the same for their signature \"hashes\" for breakfast. the \"crispy potatoes\" they are all built upon reminded me of the potatoes found downstairs at the buffet...i had the \"<mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark>\" skillet which was the driest experience laid upon potatoes i could have hoped for...although the skillet meatloaf breakfast was a nice change. the \"stuffed\" burger here are tasty, but beware the horseradish <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. i got these for dinner one night and lugged them back to my room. there was sooo much horseradish on the taters that i literally coughed them right back up. i know i know..sorry for the visual, but i don't want any fellow yelper's getting sucker punched by these taters in the future.\nperhaps i just ordered the wrong items 4 out of 7 meals, but i think if the food completely catches up with the service and hype, then this place is going to be a real vegas draw!", 
            "we stopped by on our way out of town at the imperial palace location in the strip.  the food was quick and fresh.  wife and i split the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with waffles and i threw in a 24oz bud in a bag in the order.  the chicken has great flavor and is moist. waffles with the bacon cooked into them are awesome as well.  great place and relatively reasonable if you split an entree. unless your a big eater i suggest you share.", 
            "this place was a roller coaster ride of excitement and disappointment. \n\nwhen i was randomly looking for lunch places in vegas while my ladyfriend was at her conference this place popped up. having just watched man vs food and seeing this place i figured what the hell, let's try it out. looking at the prices for lunch i knew it would be a gamble, but this is vegas, so let's bet it all!\n\ni was by myself so i sat at the bar and was serviced by a pleasant enough spikey hair lady behind the bar. no problems here.\n\ni ordered the chicken and waffles because that's their \"specialty\" and it should fill me up from about 11am til dinnertime.\n\nit arrived quickly in all its visual majesty. it really is an impressive tower. check out my pic, it's like #250 in the yelp list. four large waffles topped by a 4 giant pieces of <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>. this is going to be awesome i said to myself.\n\nthen, i started eating some of it, and my joy turned to sorrow. sadly, the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> had no flavor. i don't think i've ever had flavorless <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, but this place somehow pulled it off.\n\nnext, the waffles. there too was a i disappointed. they were really bready and had none of that malty waffle goodness. i had to ask for more syrup just to make the whole thing edible.\n\nyes, it is a gigantic amount of food, but for $16, it better look and taste good, and this wasn't the case. this was my most expensive lunch $20+ and also the worst. sometimes you bet it all and lose it all in vegas...", 
            "horrible service from the wait staff. the food was just as good as the original location but service sucks!!!!! i ordered the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> and they ran out of biscuits. instead of telling me, they had the nerve to serve it without and try to sneak it past me. our table of 6 received our food one plate at a time over the course of 20 minutes. what is even funnier, is that the last item served was a salad! i will only go to the original location from now on, this one blows.", 
            "i went awhile back, but didn't get the chance to write a review yet so here we go!\n\nthis was my first time here and my family and i walked here all the way from excalibur. that was a super long and cold walk! so once we finally got there, we were all starving! there was like 14 of us, but it didn't take long for us to be seated so yay! me and my sister wanted to try the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles for sure so we decided to get to different items and we would just split it. \n\nwhat we got:\nmildford <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> sandwich($13): it was huge! i could barely eat half of the sandwich and my sister couldn't even eat it at all. it was just too much food for the both of us. as for the side dish, we got the basil pesto crispy potatoes. those were delicious! it was so good i kept scraping the bottom of the dish to get all of the sauce. yummy!\n\n<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles($19): ...that was delicious too! the chicken was full of flavor and crunchy...yummy...the waffles were super thick though and that's the reason we got full so fast...we did however finish the chicken, but not the waffles. i loved the fried leeks on there was well. it was very flavorful and even though i was stuffed i still sat there chewing on that as i waited for the rest of my family to finish. or well...attempt to finish all their food.\n\nservice:\ngreat! our server was super friendly and my baby cousin really wanted fruit so our server saw that so he personally went to get him some fruit! it was so sweet of him and you could see the smile on my baby cousin when he brought it out. \n\noverall, everything was great!",

            "as i am sure is the case with many, my boyfriend and i were made aware of this place through the travel channel's man v. food show.  the host visited the hash house a go go on sahara, and he tried the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict.  my boyfriend was hooked--when we went to las vegas at the end of last month, he insisted upon a visit.\n\nfortunately for us, we discovered that there is a second location in the imperial palace, which was right down the street from where we were staying.  in order to check on the times when certain food is served, my boyfriend repeatedly tried to call them with no answer at least the first two times.  \n\nthe restaurant is easy to find at the back of the casino and up a specifically designed escalator.  there is plenty of room to wait with seating for customers, and we only had to wait for about 15 minutes on a sunday afternoon around 12.  the hostess staff, presumably the same group that ignored our phone calls, were a little unprofessional, preferring to congregate and gossip rather than seat patrons or help in the dining room.  \n\nthe atmosphere in this restaurant is terrible.  the walls were covered in this industrial metal sheeting, which made it look like a warehouse.  it also amplified the noise in the room, which would have been invasive even without this design flaw.  it is clear that this restaurant is designed to make people feel uncomfortable enough to eat and leave as quickly as possible.  clearly this worked as no patrons i observed lingered over their ample meals.\n\nwaitstaff was friendly, but service was a little oblivious.  it took 20 minutes to actually receive a bar drink, and i think we saw our waitress three times during the entire experience.  we also lacked silverware.\n\nthe food was pretty good.  the sizes definitely live up to the hype.  i ordered the chicken salad sandwich, and it was huge.  the bread was the best part--it was homemade and thickly sliced.  the chicken should have been in smaller chunks, though, and it was a little tough, however, <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> of light mayo and tomatos really did add something to the sandwich.  the side salad had clearly been sitting in the fridge a bit too long and should have been discarded rather than served, but the cucumber dressing was a very refreshing accent.  \n\nthe best entree by far was the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict, which did not disappoint.  it was huge, layered with <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, eggs, fried cheese, <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, and topped with chipolte cream sauce.  it was an amazing combination and a huge entree.\n\nthis is definitely worth a visit, but it may not be worth a return.", 
            "this place is really popular in san diego. my husband and i have been trying to eat at the one in san diego for a really long time but the wait is always so long. \n\nwe were in vegas this weekend with family and wanted to finally try it.  it was located inside imperial palace on a 2nd floor of the hotel. imperial palace is not the nicest hotel but when you finally make it to the restaurant the decor is nice and the restaurant is pretty big. \n\nmy husband ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles and we both shared it. we specifically wanted to try it because we saw it on man vs. food and saw adam try the dish. the dish is definitely way too big for one person so sharing is a must when you go to hash house.  it was very tasty and the chicken is not oily so it was a plus for me!  the presentation of the dish was definitely cool:).  the waiter said the wait for the food after we ordered was 45 minutes since it was made from scratch but  it came out after only waiting for 10 minutes. \n\n3- stars for the service for me. my husband ordered a bloody mary and they completely forgot about it and we ended up cancelling it all together. \n\ni really liked the food so i think i will try it again in san diego.", 
            "well worth the 45+ minute wait (and the 30 minutes of trying to find the entrance to the ip... and navigating through the casino to find the restaurant).  well, well worth it.  \n\nthe <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> was quite simply the most perfect breakfast imaginable.  my boyfriend, from the south, even said the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was better than his - huge compliment from the most particular eater i have encountered.\n\nour table of four ordered the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, <mark>French Toast</mark>, chorizo scramble, truck driver breakfast with a vanilla waffle, and a snickers pancake on the side.  the only complaint was about the vanilla waffle - my sister-in-law was not a fan, but since i did not try it, i am still going with 5 stars. :)\n\ni am quite the large eater, as is my 6'5\" 300lb brother, and there was food enough for at least three more when we left.  this is definitely going to be a must-stop every time we are in vegas.  my diet and exercise plan is glad there are not any locations in phoenix. :)", 
            "if i were reviewing food alone this would be an easy 4 star, maybe even 5, it's the only reason we went twice.  that <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> will forever be in my dreams; unfortunately the service will always haunt my nightmares.  two days in a row you guys failed.  hard.  telling us to come check on our table in 20-30 minutes because the buzzers don't work in the casino (why even give them out? if we aren't in the casino we are sitting right in front of your face, just call our name), then when we come back in exactly 19 minutes you have given away our table and proceed to sit three more parties in front of us.  don't tell us we can go downstairs if you are going to give away our table.  our waiter on this day was a little flighty; service was al little slow, but nothing too bad, 20% was earned. but day two taught us how bad it could be.  our server started off with a little banter, a little personality is always nice, and was lacking the day before.  then she was gone.  i had ordered a blt mary (which was delicious), and delivered to my table after about 10-15 minutes by someone else,  our server did appear when i had finished it to see if id like another.  i said no thank you, but some more water would be nice, and a dining companion asked for a re-fill on her diet coke.  the diet coke made it back, but no water.  then another server brought out one of our four food orders.  a bit later two more orders, then the final.  still no server and no water.  none of us got water until we were finished eating and finally flagged down a server from another table, and you can imagine how long that was with the size of their portions.  we waited about 10 more minutes, still thirsty, and finally asked a bus boy for water and a box.  he brought the water, thank god.  after another 10 minutes out server came back, we asked for her to get the box, she did.  we also asked for out check.  she gave us some flack about coupons, but finally got it done.  worst service ever\nmoral of the story, <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> delish, but have lots of time and low expectations for everything else.",

            "stopped here for lunch after a morning of drinking (yah i know but it's vegas right?) and was glad to be seated after only a 5 minute wait.  we were kept entertained by all the photos of celebrities who've visited, so it wasn't too bad.\n\ndisclaimer:  the dishes here are definitely meant to be shared by at least two people.  there's so much food on the plate, that out of 11 hungry guys, only 1 was able to make it past the halfway mark (and that's because he got a sandwich).  that cornmeal breaded salmon sandwich did look might good.  the fries were crispy and well seasoned.  not even my crazy friend, who usually eats like a mountain beast, could conquer his <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> benedict.  this piece of pork was freakin huge and was about the size of the plate.  biscuits and gooey goodness underneath, it was really good.  i also tried some of the gigantic chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> and that was also really good.  i ordered <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>: <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, fried cheese, thick crispy bacon, chipotle sauce, all over biscuits and more... just damn delicious!  another friend also got the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> over <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>, which was also tasty.  but everything tastes better with bacon.  fact.  they also had a vegetable hash skillet, which our vegetarian friend really enjoyed.\n\nthe meal started off great, shoveling good food into our faces, but by the end we felt like sick pigs.  it was funny to watch my friend's agonizing face, while he kept taking \"one more bite\".",

            "really really really ridiculously delicious. i tried the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict- it was unreal & so was the portion. the line sucks, and this restaurant is inside the imperial palace, but who cares- the grub is worth it. stay away if your trying to eat healthy or watching your weight. i walked  out probably 5lbs heavier than when i walked in. this place totally lives up to the hype- got to try it next time your in vegas.", 
            "the second we exited flamingo from the 15 fwy i said, \"we have to go to hash house a go go right now!\" thank goodness!! i saw it on man v food and have wanted to eat here for a really really long time. so, i already pre-meditated the fact that i would probably have to wait about a hour for a table, or be on the list for next day, or whatever. whatever the reason i was willing to wait. i just wanted to eat here really bad. \n\nits at the imperial palace (weird hotel with lots of smokers), went left, right, south, north, couldn't find the place. asked security for assistance, and bypassed a huge \"hash house a go go\" sign above an escalator in the middle of the casino. \n\nthis place does not disappoint. the proportions are huge. if you can't finish a $6 burger at carl's jr then split a plate with a friend. if you can finish a $6 burger at carl's jr then split a plate with a friend. they are generous with proportions. i was under the impression that it would be super expensive with outrageous prices, but no i was wrong. plates are from $11-$15, totally affordable. its vegas, live it up. \n\nwe ordered the meatloaf breakfast, hh delux (?) plate, and <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>(as seen on man v food).\n\nmeatloaf tasted interesting, came out in a skillet with chunks of potatoes and vegetables with two huge biscuit. (i swear this restaurant is for people with big appetite and with 3 stomachs). sister said she didn't like the meatloaf entree (too bad). other sister ordered their giant pancake with sausages and scrambled eggs with a side of crispy potatoes. i mean giant pancake. i think it was 1 ft in diameter. it was huge, at least 1/4 inch thick. she of course didn't finish it. i ordered <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and biscuit (i can't remember the name but as seen on man v food). soo good.\n\nhuge biscuits with two huge <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, on a bed of perfect mashed potates and strips of bacon and some special sauce. don't forget to try their homemade jam. super delicious. scoop some unto the biscuit or on some potatoes or on some <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. try the homemade jam. \n\nthe table next to us were a party of 4 huge dudes. macho douchebags with their artificial tan and muscles bulging from their tight ed hardy shirts. they could probably eat everything on the menu. anyways, they all ordered burgers. they didn't finish it, and wrapped their half burgers to-go. another table of big dudes order the chicken and waffles and had half their food boxed togo. \n\nso, a lot of food. not expensive. the hostess told us (a party of 4) would have to wait about 40 minutes, which was totally fine. only a 30 minute wait, which flew by b/c we were reading the menu. \n\n i gotta try the chicken and waffles next time! or maybe the <mark>French Toast</mark> or a burger. eeeek", 
            "i unfortunately stayed at ip, but was pleasantly surprised that house hash was in this hotel. i went here for dinner and breakfast the next day. i was with a big party and was able to try a few dishes, so here i go.  \n\nrosemary <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict: my favorite dish on the menu. yes, this is the one that was featured on man vs food.\n\nslow cooked bbq ribs:  awesome sauce and meat fell off the bone. horseradish coleslaw was tangy and spicy!\n\nbutternut squash dish: cooked to perfection!  not soggy at all.\n\nchicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>:  great flaky shell and sauce used for chicken was delicious.\n\nthe food was delish, service always came quickly with a joke or a smile, and the portions are unbelievably huge!! definitely a place where you can share a plate.",

            "huge portions and so nom nom nom\n\n1. bacon cheddar <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>: delish \nbut: eating it was kind of hard because there were long strips of bacon underneath a blanket of cheese. sounds delish but honestly i wish the bacon was cut up or something. as much as i love bacon i didn't like how i would be basically a crap ton of bacon with no potato. boo. \n\n2. <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>: *dies* so good\n* i personally like to eat things separately and not have my food touching (ocd much?? haha) but this dish omg it only tastes good if you mix it up!! so... basically\n\neating it separately: meh\neating it together: ahhhhh! nom nom nom ^__^ \n\ngo there but be prepared to share!!! also, they do have a split fee charge, but if you order a side they won't charge the fee. so yeah do it \n\n** my only problem with the benedict is that the biscuits were kind of hard :/ like seriously hard. blech. butttt once its covered in the sauce <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> its like voila nom nom biscuit.", 
            "the main reason why i wanted to eat here was because i saw this place on man vs food. \n\ni had ordered the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, which is basically what adam richmond had ordered on man vs food. \n\nthis food had many layers and each layer complimented one after another. \n\nmash potatoes, grilled cheese, <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, biscuit, smoked chipotle sauce, and bacon. \n\ni would definitely come back here again just not before going to edc.", 
            "hash house a go go is restaurant serving up a mix of southern and down home farmland cooking or \"twisted farm food\" as they say. they have 4 locations in nevada and one in california serving breakfast, lunch and dinner.\n\ni'd heard all the fuss about man vs food and knew i better check this place out. we were a group of 10 and since reservations weren't allowed, we expected a long wait. we arrived at 6:30pm on a friday surprised to see no line and lots of empty tables.  it's never a good sign for a place to be that empty on a friday, but maybe it's because it's so hidden within the imperial palace casino. \n\ni grew up eating food like this, but never have i seen such large portions and presentation. we were served complementary biscuits before dinner. these things were impressively huge, but a bit too dense. i prefer a light and fluffy biscuit, but easily ate a half of one drizzled with honey.  for the main course, i ordered the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. this thing could have fed a family of four, with two boneless pieces of <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> served over a biscuit, <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, tomatoes, spinach and covered with scrambled eggs, bacon, mozzarella and chipotle cream sauce for $15.95.  overall the dish looked impressive, but didn't wow me on taste. it was good, but i expected bold flavors and didn't get it. of course i was happy to sample several other people's food at the table like the meatloaf pasta, the bbq ribs and the chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>.  i found the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> to be the best out of everything i tried. the meatloaf pasta was good, but the st. louis style ribs were disappointing, but of course i am spoiled being from st. louis. probably the most entertaining part of the experience was watching a drunk guy at a table nearby devour his platter of <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> without passing out in it.\n\noverall, i'd give this place 5 stars for friendly service and amazingly large and creative portions, but only 3 stars on taste that doesn't match presentation.  definitely worth a visit though just for the experience!",

            "delicious. the huge portions just blew me out of the water. now, they're not impossible portions; they're just a belt-snapping, belly-bursting kind of do-able. \n\ni especially loved the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict because the hollandaise sauce had that perfect tangy, creamy, almost spicy kick to it. just perfect. probably the best hollandaise i've ever had. the friend chicken and waffles? similarly delicious. the waffles were fresh, with that just-barely crispy outer layer with the soft, warm, steam-filled insides, topped with a healthy pour of maple syrup along with a giant portion of delicious <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>: not too much fried, and not only chicken, if you know what i mean. after this meal, i literally felt drunk. my head was light and my vision was lagging behind the movement of my head. i had to go sleep off this food-hangover right after i paid the bill. now that's class. \n\ni'll be honest, i haven't had anything else. but my friend said the mimosas were good. \n\nthe reason i didn't give this place 5 stars was because the hostess was kind of a sourpuss. i get that we can't be seated until our whole party is there, but they were literally coming up the escalator and as we pointed that out, she turned and helped someone else, only addressing us again 15 minutes later. i don't know; i expected some more friendliness? some more courtesy? she was definitely kind of rude in her demeanor as well. but the serving staff? wonderful! so friendly, so helpful, and so cheery. it made me (almost) forget the girl from the front. \n\nthe atmosphere was nice, definitely a diner kind vibe. overall, awesome, despite being kind of out of place at the imperial palace! thumbs up.",

            "this is the first hash house a go go that i've ever been to. i've came here march 2009 and was pretty hung over. a mimosa sounded really good so i got one of those, and for my breakfast i chose the chorizo hash. pretty simple decision. i wasn't really in the mood to read the whole menu. -__- i regret doing that. i wish i actually saw the whole menu that day. the food was still great none the less. the biscuit was so good! especially with their homemade compote that's already on the table waiting for you to use. a little tease. \n\nthen i went to the hash house a go go on sahara for the second time. that's another review hmm :)\n\nfor the 3rd time i came back to this one! and i was for sure hungry! hehe. i got the cinnamon roll coffee to start of with. and it was too freakin' good. it had a whole cinnamon stick in it. haha so i broke it in half and gave it to my other friends to put in thier coffees. tee hee. and my friend, a fellow yelper, allen n., and i decided to spit and share the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict and the salmon eggs benedict. both were huge and really delicious. i absolutely love their biscuit. man oh man. my girlfriend got the biscuits and gravy and a <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash. can't go wrong with <mark>Corned Beef</mark> though. haha that gravy though... damn..\n\nit's official, every time i go to las vegas, i'm going to a hash house a go go!", 
            "the food was pretty damn good and the portions enormous. i ordered the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> and the chicken was fried perfectly and the sauce was very creative and was a combination i never had.", 
            "insane meal. the portions make claim jumpers portions look like a little mid-morning snack. \n\nwe made our way to the imperial palace (hopefully the last time i ever say those words) on friday night at about 10pm. we were expecting a huge wait and no one was there. we were seated in the empty dining room. \n\nwe ordered our drinks and the cornmeal shrimp starter and <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles to share. the shrimp was okay, four shrimp but the cornmeal crust fell off with the first bite. the chicken and waffles were amazing. fried leeks, bacon cooked into the waffles, super good <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> ... we loved it. \n\ni think we tried everything we wanted to on the menu, so we probably won't go back, but we loved it for a one-time visit.", 
            "great breakfast place at the imperial palace. i ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles which is belgian waffles stuffed with bacon and topped with <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and fried leeks and maple syrup. was very excited to try this meal and it was good overall, although a little disappointing. the chicken was a little dry and i kept dousing my meal in maple syrup, but the chicken was absorbing it so it still was somewhat dry. however, it was good overall and the other people who got regular breakfast seemed to enjoy it a lot.", 
            "this place was amazing enough for me and my friends to go to twice in a row! the waiter was quirky and funny, and also very friendly :) he recognized us the second time we came too (\"oh, long time no see!\") we heard about the giant portions of hash house, and we starved ourselves accordingly. still, we could only order 3 plates for 6 people :\\ be warned that there it is $2.50ish for every extra plate they put on the table for sharing! so with both days, we ordered:\n\nchicken and waffles: amazing. a-maaaaa-zingggggg!!!!!! we ordered this twice because it was so good! big bacon strips cooked right into the waffle and sticking out at all sorts of delicious angles! not too sweet to overpower, yet not too salty to be weird. yum. i could eat a whole plate by myself! the chicken was not bad either, though alone i felt that it was a bit bland. the fried green onions around it also gave the dish a great zing!\n\n<mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>: not really a benedict, as there is no hollandaise sauce. instead, it is a creamy chipotle sauce that my friends loved. they actually ordered extra sauce ($1.95) and cleaned it completely. the benedict was very filling, but also good...i'm just not really sure what i ate aside from the chicken and the biscuit or something...\n\nmeatloaf: holy mother of pearl this was good! meatloaf was tender and held together just right! the potatoes were also very delicious and the green beans were cooked to a nice delicate crunchy perfection! carrots were meh, but no one's complaining with the rest of the dish! tip: meatloaf tastes orgasmic with the chipotle cream sauce!\n\nchicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>: this was very good as well. light and a teensy bland/plain compared to the other dishes, but still good in its own right. my friend busted out the tabasco to spice it up, and i put in a bit more salt and pepper. chicken was moist, and the chunks of potato and veggies were all cooked just right. only thing was that the biscuit was hard as a rock. i think i finally broke one with my teeth and a part of the biscuit flew out and near hit the person across from me. i don't mind too much though as the rest of the dish (and the other dishes) were so good.\n\npancake, scrambled eggs, potatoes: the pancake is giant! the godfather of all pancakes! it was probably 5 normal ihop pancakes (make that 6 or 7) clumped together and stacked with another 6 or 7 pancakes! not as delicious as the waffle imo, but definitely a wow factor. the pancake had a good taste, but at some points it did feel like it was way too thick for me (not what she said). not much to say on the eggs (they were normal?), but the potatoes had this weird crunchiness which made us wonder if it was leftover fried potatoes from breakfast/lunch...seemed to be re-fried or something. both <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> need more salt, but i honestly just wouldn't order this dish. why get pancakes when you got chicken and waffles?!?\n\noverall? mouthgasm. it was funny seeing my guy friends just put a bite in their mouth, sit back, and siiiiiiiiiiiiigh. definitely come here when you stop by vegas! oh, and as for pricing...this was essentially all-you-can-eat as there was so much food and you definitely need to share! total for both times (again, 5-6 people, 3 dishes) came out to be around $15 with tip/tax+2 extra sauces. great deal for delicious food in giant portions!", 
            "this place is amazing! come here hungry because the portions here are huge! i shared the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict and the salmon & asparagus eggs benedict. the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> one is simply great and is a must try if you can't decide what to order. they fry up a chicken breast which is crunchy on the outside but still tender and moist on the inside. the salmon comes with flaky salmon and grilled asparagus and is served with a killer chipotle cream sauce. i came here hungry and i finished everything, but these portion sizes are enough to fill you for a whole day. i had this on my last day in vegas and it was simply the best way to end my trip.", 
            "to say that the dishes here are gargantuan in size is an understatement.  they give you enough food to feed half of china. having a location right on the strip is a big plus.  the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> and <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict always remains a favorite.  \n\neven though the food is decent, the wait is horrendous.  plan about an hour to an hour  and half.  they give you the pagers but they dont work in the casino area - sucks!  the sheer volume of people that come through here has a huge impact on kitchen staff as food service is excruciatingly slow.  one of the dishes we ordered was the fried salmon sandwich and it came out 30 min after the chicken.  how does it take longer to fry fish than chicken?  the wait staff came by to check on us often and let us know that the fish would be coming out in 5 min. they must be on spanish time cuz it took 30 min and we had to take it to go.  the person who ordered that was nonetheless very displeased since everyone else was done with their entrees before it came out. i dont think hh should levy split plate charges since it would help them out a lot to have less entrees ordered.\n\nfor a better experience, although a bit out of the way, i recommend going to the location off of the strip.", 
            "tried the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, not amazing not even good.  chicken bland, mash bland, biscuit dry, quantity with no quality.\n\ntried the meatloaf skillet, pretty good but potatoes were fried to shit.\n\nalso the $2.50 per extra plate does not make sense at all, why would you charge to grab a plate from the kitchen and bring it to the table.  i understand if you charge me to split my plate which requires work to split everything in half, but this is just an empty plate.  wack!\n\noh one last thing, hash house does not have hash browns hahaha wack!!",

            "i was worried this location wouldn't be as good as the one in town but i was pleasantly surprised. we had a little wait (40 min for 7 people) but it was totally worth it. the food quality was spectacular. none of the other 6 people had ever eaten here before and they all can't wait to come back. the olives for the bloody mary was stuffed with jalapenos for extra kick. my <mark>HH Original</mark> benedict was as big as my head and sooo delicious. the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> is unreal and the biggest surprise was how perfect the quesadilla was. it was spicy with crunchy fresh jalapenos. i will be back my next trip for some more belly busting goodness!",

            "this is such a fun place to have breakfast. the food totally lived up to our expectations. my husband ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> of waffles of course which was so good. i ordered off their special menu for the day which was the crab cake ceasar salad. the portions were huge and the staff was pleasant and prompt. the first time we went, we became instant fans and took our friends out to breakfast here when arrived into vegas a few days later. we were so excited to bring them there but to our dismay, the line was so long and we saw several large parties of 8 get seated before our party of 4 even though they arrived after us. when we finally were seated, we were very honest and told our waiter that we only had 45 minutes left to order and get our food because we had a show to see at the mgm. we took a chance that he respond with an attitude given ours when we were finally seated but he remained so calm and understanding the whole time. it totally made up for the long wait. he took our orders, went straight to the kitchen and came out with our food about 15 minutes later (not bad seeing as how they make everything from scratch!). we made it to our show on time and with full tummies.", 
            "all hype?  honestly the only reason i wanted to come here was cuz i saw it on man vs food.  if you're a fan of huge portions you might like his place, but i prefer smaller portions with better flavor.  wow, i sound like a food snob, but i don't mean it that way.  i just felt the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> had too much going on.  and the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> didn't seem to complement the benedict.  it just added a heavier element to the already heavy ingredients.  we also got a salad and soup which i didn't mind cuz the flavors were there, just in a bigger bowl.  i didn't feel that way about the benedict.  i don't regret trying this place, but i don't think i'd come back.", 
            "**3 (2.5) stars -- downgrade from 4 stars** \n\nmade sure to come before the late menu kicks in. yay, made it!\n\nconfused? did i go to the wrong place? is my memory failing me already? my second time (9/10/11) here within 24 hours, can't be. \n\nservice: \ngoing to have to start with this vs. food. how can service differ so badly from one night to the next? absolutely the most dreadful service. \n\nwhen we got there, there was no host(ess) in sight. patiently waited for about 15 minutes by reading the news prints. then i started popping my head into the main seating area. seen but not acknowledged by several employees: bartender and 2 waiters(tresses). \n\nanother 5-8 minutes pass... now there is another party waiting with kids. finally, an older male waiter with glasses quickly announces that someone would be with us shortly. he also asks where the hostess is and answers his own question by saying \"she's around so wait.\" before we can say anything, he's gone. wth?!? \n\nif i wasn't dying to try their food, we would have left. darn you, taste buds and cravings. \n\nokay, another 5 minutes pass. two additional parties have joined at this time. now, i'm irritated and hungry. before, i could take action (my bf hates it when i do this), another gentlemen who just arrived about 2 minutes earlier walks into the main seating area and loudly states... \"is anyone going to help us?\" a different waiter says someone will be with us and ushers the man back into the line. \n\nafter another 2 minutes, a very apologetic waitress (old school glam girl, looks young with dark black hair) quickly seats us. she also makes excuses to us indicating the hostess must be in bathroom or something. \n\nabout 32+ minutes to get seated.... 30 minutes before getting acknowledged. \n\nour waitress didn't make up for it either. she was a tall, heavyset caucasian with glasses. our glasses were empty and never refilled. i had to ask a busboy 2x for refills. she was prompt with the check though. go figure. \n\nfood: \nwas it worth the wait? yes, yes, yes... almost an orgasm in the mouth. \n\n- <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> \nlarge portion, definitely 2-3 could share. very innovative dish form preparation to presentation. better than roscoe's, no doubt. just like the host said the first night we came. \n\nchicken was tender and flavorful. waffles were perfectly cooked, fluffy and bacon stuffed. green onions were deep-fried and surprisingly delicious... i couldn't stop eating them. \n\nthe kicker though is the garnish dressing. there were 3-4 bites that had this amazing spicy kick. the dressing with maple syrup and the spice... omg, to die for!! it was that good that i had to ask. i think the waitress was off though. she said it was the same as the rib place... soy-teriyaki sauce. but it wasn't, it was different in color and taste. i tried each drizzle multiple times to verify and it was definitely different. \n\n- ribs (small plate) \nthis was a just-enough serving. succulent, savory, and it fell of the bone. take note, this is the way ribs should be. \n\nit was accompanied with a simple potato salad with dill dressing. very tasty. \n\nparking: \nthere is a garage available for parking. \n\noverall \nfirst visit was waaaayyyy better than the first, service-wise. honestly, i am still in utter shock of what a big difference my experience. i'm big on service. i'm a reasonable person, if it was busy, i would understand the wait. but considering the situation, it wasn't. \n\nwould i go back? \nas much as the service sucked, i would have to say \"yes,\" but maybe i'd try a different location. the food was extremely good. if i had to rate the food alone, it would have gotten 4.5 stars. \n\nfor 5 stars, they need to make that spicy, maple garnish sauce for the chicken and waffles plate. \n\nno matter what... even if food is awesome, if service sucks, rating will suck.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**review based on service only... first visit**\n\non a recent vegas trip, everyone was raving about the food here and said it was a \"must go.\" then i saw it on tv when we were having some downtime, and the food just called to me. it actually made me salivate so we had to visit it.\n\nso the plan... get the chicken and waffles. \n\nlocation:\nthere are multiple locations, this is one of four. others are located at the m hotel, plaza hotel, and off the strip.\n\nmenu:\nbe warned, there are different menus.  we hit it up pretty late, around 11:30pm. so that means, we made it for the late menu. so what sucks is that only select items are offered. \n\nservice:\nthe host was pretty cool. he was down to earth and really informative. he said if i really wanted the chicken and waffles that we should come back because it was worth it.\n\noverall\nbased on the service, i'd come back again. trust me, i will to try the food.",

            "i was a bit skeptical about hash a go go when i first learned that it was located in imperial palace. the smell of stale cigarettes that greeted me at the entrance didn't make it any better. luckily, an escalator ride later, i stepped into the waiting area of hash house a go go realizing that it is practically a different world. while the decor is nothing special it's still a world away from imperial palace!\n\nback to the food-- please come to hash house a go go hungry. not a little hungry, not \"oh i can still eat\", come starving. the portions here are out of this world and even though we're usually pretty big eaters, not a single person finished their plate. between mr. dubs and i, we got the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles and the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. when they arrived, we were all so intimidated by the presentation and the hearty portions that we really didn't know where to start. once we started to dig in, it was a whole different story. eating at hash house a go go really took the terms \"stuffing my face\" to a whole new level. unfortunately, to my best efforts, i was only able to finish about 1/4 of my meal. \n\ni also ordered the wine spritzer and loved it. didn't taste a hint of alcohol. eva, denise and mr. dubs all ordered the bloody mary and it was delicious too but watch out-- they ask you what type of vodka you want in your blood mary but doesn't mention that there is an extra charge for the premium vodka! i guess it should've been a given since we are in vegas and it is \"premium\" but the way the options were given were very misleading. \n\nover all, hash house a go go was an experience. not sure if i'd want to go back but definitely glad i got to check it out!",

            "i was so excited to try this place out and hyped it up so much i didn't think it could disappoint. i saw this place featured on man v. food and on countless billboards around the strip. this location, inside imperial palace, had a huge line and fairly long wait. i was famished and didn't mind the wait as long as the food lived up to all the hype. before i even looked at the menu, i knew i wanted to order their signature dish...the chicken and waffles. while i waited for my order to arrive, i saw a wide arry of delicious dishes being zipped back and forth in front of our table. all looked craftly plated, with huge heaping portions. i salivated each time my beloved (or so i thought) chicken and waffles would zip in and out of my line of sight. finally it arrived, moment of truth. i bite into my deep <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breasts and was underwhelmed to say the least. batter was soggy, not crispy with the resounding crunch i had imagined. i gave them the benefit <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> and moved on to the waffles, hoping that hash house would redeem themselves here. but alas, i was disappointed yet again. the waffles were huge, and filed with bacon which made my eyes grow large with a childlike wonder, yet i lamented again when i found those waffles to be soggy and rather flat in flavor. \n\nneedless to say i walked away from this place pretty much disappointed. will probably not be returning anytime soon...at least not on my own accord.",

            "three of us arrived midday on a weekday. the wait was about 15-20 minutes.\n\nwe knew the portions were huge and a doggy bag was not an option. so, we decided to share two dishes. but because they frown upon that, we ordered an additional side so they had no issue with three people chowing down on two entrees.\n\nwe ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles, brown sugar banana flapjacks and a side of bacon. in addition, based on some other yelp reviews, we ordered the kiwi watermelon lemonade.\n\nthe lemonade was super potent and overly sweet. even after mixing thoroughly, it was way too much to drink straight. since i had an unsweetened iced tea, we added a lot of that to the lemonade which made it bearable. perhaps cutting it with a portion of water (or tea) would make it easier for most to drink.\n\nthe <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles was made to be a visual showstopper. that was all. i was disappointed because i had been worked up by veterans of this dish. sure, it was a monstrous pile of food with a huge steak knife and rosemary sprigs holding it together. sure, it had bacon in the waffles. sure, it had <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>. but my opinion went down as i started eating it. the chicken seemed overcooked and dry. i couldn't taste any sage. the waffles were more dense and the bacon didn't really add much. the bright note were the leeks which were very tasty, but not tasty enough to save this dish.\n\nthe brown sugar banana flapjacks was really a single flapjack that was so huge it hung over the sides of the plate, and it was already a huge plate to begin with. the flavor was good and a great size to share between three people.\n\ni think the most memorable thing was the side of bacon. i was afraid that it would be overkill because there was bacon in the waffles. but this was thick cut <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark> so it was crispy and juicy and super flavorful. probably some of the best, if not *the* best, bacon i've had.\n\nparking at the imperial palace was a bit tricky since there weren't easily visible signs indicating that we were entering the ip garage. if you're not comfortable with driving along the strip, i would recommend taking the tram from another hotel on the strip to the ip.\n\nthe amount of food you get is a plus, but if this is your first time, i would recommend going with a big group and ordering one chicken and waffles to share between everyone. that way you can try more things on the menu.",

            "tried the food here with two other friends, based on an absent friend's testimony, and the store's appearance on man vs. food. although there was no nearly wait time when we arrived around 11:30am, what one would think is near peak hours for a restaurant, the food that arrived was pretty terrible. \n\nordering <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark>, $12.95, i got a fairly large blueberry pecan pancake (flour, eggs, buttermilk cheap carbs) with two eggs and two slices of bacon. one of my friends later pointed out that the pancake alone was $7.95. ripoff combo? i think so. the quality of the pancake was on par with any ihop or instant mix and the blueberries were undoubtedly frozen and few and far in between along with the pecans.\n\nmy other friends ordered the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, $15.95, and a burger, $13.95. the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> being the restaurant's signature dish seemed like it should be the best dish. however, all that arrived was a heaping mound of mash potatoes (very cheap carbohydrates once again) covered by greens and a pair of biscuits with a <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breast steak. the chicken breast was so dry that the fibers were distinctly frazzled after a bite and tough enough to compete with jerky. the burger that came was clearly overcooked and consisted of low-quality ground beef and over-sized buns. \n\nincessant praise for large portions at this restaurant seem misguiding in that only the cheapest components of each dish are liberally given while the main components (the protein and pricier ingredients) are sparse and low quality. too many people are wowed by cheap filler and blind to the poor quality of the cooking here. would definitely not come back. just go to kfc or ihop. i'm not fans of either but both are leagues ahead of this joint.",

            "we were on vacation with friends and this was our last morning to eat something other than a buffet.  we were told about this place by a friend in california and boy were we glad.  it was a wonderful breakfast dining experience.  the food was very good, huge portions and the waitress was excellent (i forgot her name though).  she was fun and knowledgeable and there for our every need.  all four of us were happy were our selections.  i ordered the hash spinach mushroom scramble, which was a little dry, but when i ordered a side of the chipotle sauce from the andy's man vs food dish it was perfect.  i asked for just a little bit of the sauce because it was a little dry, but they still charged extra for the sauce.  we also ordered the \"andy's man vs food\" breakfast which was delish, although crazy carb loaded with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, angel hair pasta, <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, bacon and more.  our friends got the mango coconut pancake and also the <mark>French Toast</mark> and they absolutely loved both dishes.  the coffee was hot and very good and constantly refilled as it should be at breakfast time.  i think everything was definitely a bit overpriced for breakfast with drink, tax and tip probably around $16-20 per person.  i will definitely eat here again the next time i come to las vegas, but next time i will share a dish with someone.",

            "tired? haven't slept? hangover? this is the place you want to be. in a city filled with mountainous buffets and chef-endorsed eateries, sometimes what you really need is a place that serves hearty, down to earth grub. and that is pretty much what you get at hash house a go go. \n\ni had the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> and it was a monsterous plate of fried goodness. at first, i noticed a huge load of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> underneath everything else which made me a little cautious (didn't want to food coma before going on the 5 hour drive back to la). but surprisingly, the mash was rather light and went really really well with the rest of the dish. my chicken was cooked and fried perfectly with just enough batter for a nice little crunch. the bacon was a nice touch and the sauce they used brought the entire dish together. overall, the flavors were very harmonious but truthfully, the most amazing aspect is the power of this meal to cure hangovers/ aggravated stomachs. be it a night of cavalier partying or a low key drink fest, the food here will do more than enough to stop the room from spinning. \n\njust be ready to wait a bit and make sure all of your party is present when you put your name down because they won't give you a buzzer until everyone is there. there will definitely be a wait but they have a selection of magazines for you to dive into, assuming you're in a state to read. \n\ni will say that our waiter was rather rude at times and didn't seem too keen on earning his tip that day. one of my friends was very hungover and in obvious discomfort but the waiter still seemed to think it was necessary to poke constant fun at him; obviously he was joking (i hope) but there's a point where jokes get old and the waiter needs to learn when to stop. maybe he realized we were getting annoyed because he disappeared for a while and left us to tend to our empty glasses of ice. i don't think it's enough to justify docking any stars but it's worth mentioning. \n\njust be ready to come hungry and leave bloated. and make sure to get your poolside time in before you pay a visit because it is unlikely that your hard earned six pack will survive this episode.",

            "in the land of the dinosaurs, or at least those of us who eat like one, hash house would probably reign supreme. this city is overflowing with buffets designed to make your waist, well, overflow, and hash house can easily provide that feeling with a single item. the fact that very few things on their menu even exceed the $15 mark is pretty impressive, but maybe that's why everything presented looks ostentatious but winds up just rather banal... an embodiment of las vegas as a whole, perhaps.\n\nstyle over substance certainly seems to be the modus operandi for hash house, delivering mammoth sized meals you can't help but go \"wow!\" over, and yet very few people leave with empty plates, more likely because they simply got tired of eating surprisingly bland food, rather than being simply outmatched in the stomach capacity department. i watched multiple diners get up from the bar stools next to me leaving half or even three-quarters of a plate full of food behind. i guess when the prices are this low, in vegas, you figure that the minimal investment isn't really worth the excessive calories.\n\nthat's all in retrospect though... i came to hash house because i had heard tales of monolithic food combinations so loaded with flavor that they had attracted multiple food related television shows to their establishments, including a chicken and waffle dish stacked so high that it approached eye level. without going on too much of a rant about how these shows often lead so many people astray, i'll just say that the size (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1ybxklrzg652xt2kr5g?select=vdzuqyuetevjlxak4rwb2w#vdzuqyuetevjlxak4rwb2w) is definitely impressive, but we all know it's what you do with it that counts. somewhat ironically i had actually used their <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and bacon loaded waffles as inspiration for a recent brunch party i hosted, and i can honestly say that i put hash house to shame. what absolutely makes <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> is the skin, and if you've got limp, soggy skin, then your size doesn't much matter. this chicken could have been baked for all i know, as there was zero crispness to it. add to that waffles that, aside from the bacon slices inside, are generally bland, and one tiny ramekin of syrup to assist, and i can see why people literally just got tired of eating this. \n\ni also gave their blt bloody mary a try, thinking the ingredients would be well infused into the drink, considering that it was by far the most expensive on the menu, but instead i wound up with what essentially amounts to a sandwich shoved into a drink (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/f4x1ybxklrzg652xt2kr5g?select=vdzuqyuetevjlxak4rwb2w#sbnu2x4oggjkvrj5spqlra), with no clear way on the best way to either eat or drink it. i wound up having to sip and nibble like a freaking rabbit on what has to be the clumsiest cocktail idea i've ever seen executed. after having the variations prepared by brian, nicole, and gregg at my bloody mary battle, this seemed outright amateurish. i should have stuck with my original intuition, passed on the alcohol, and gave the s'mores latte a go... although if this was any indication it would have been the stay puft marshmallow man shoved into a teacup with a box of graham crackers on the side and someone who comes along and projectile vomits hershey's chocolate syrup in my face.",

            "the portions are just ridiculous! seriously ridiculous. my sister and i shared a plate of the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles and i don't see any other way to conquer that plate.  it comes with two large <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> (not chicken pieces, but a whole chicken) and 4 waffles.  all for $15, this was the best deal that we had in vegas.\n\nour concierge at the bellagio recommended this place.  she called it the strip's hidden little secret, but it's not a secret because in the middle of the day, the wait time was 30-45 minutes.\n\nthe hostesses were very impersonable and really had an air about them as if we were bothering them by wanting to be seat.  luckily, our waiter made up for the rude hostesses.  he was attentive and on point with the drink refills; always appreciated when the vegas weather is 115 degress outside.\n\nplease make this one of your stops when in vegas.  from the decor, various celebrities have endorsed and multiple food/cooking shows have featured this restaurant.", 
            "i love this place! great bargain considering how exorbitantly large the portions are. quality-wise, it just is what it is: yummy diner food.  and the servers have always been helpful and attentive.  initially i saw a crowd of people waiting just outside the entrance of the restaurant, so i was anticipating a long wait, but the hostess informed me that it would only be a 10-15 minute wait (awesome). there's a bartender that serves bloody mary's and such while you wait, so you can a head start on drinking (also awesome).  i got the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> (because it was featured on mvf) and it didn't disappoint. i barely finished a quarter of my food, but it tasted great as leftovers too. expect to feel a good 5 lbs heavier after your meal... maybe plan a walk down the strip to help digest.\n\nthis is just one of those places you have to experience so that you can say you went there. which is made obvious when you sit down at your table and look around to see everyone take a picture of their dish so that they can post it on facebook with some subtitle along the lines of \"hey guys, look at my huge plate of food!!!\"", 
            "this is one of the good eats in vegas.  the portions are not only enormous, but they either tower over your plate or skillet.  the corn beef hash is a signature dish, but there are plenty of variations of omelets, waffles and flapjacks to choose from.  if you're really hungry, you can even get biscuits with gravy on the side or toast with their homemade apricot jam.  i'll have to come back to try their version of <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles.  \n\nservice is fast, friendly and helpful especially when describing their specials.  the ambiance is casual and one of the hidden gems in the hotel, which is under construction.  parking is ample in lots nearby.", 
            "the food looks better than it tastes.  not to say it was bad, it just was ok.  i got the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breakfast and a bloody mary, and as many have said here, the chicken could use some seasoning as it was pretty bland.  the drinks were better than the food, i have to say.\n\ni'm not big on gigantic novelty meals that i won't finish, i'd rather the food taste great.  that all said, it's still a solid breakfast choice.", 
            "we had a heck of an adventure finding this place. the imperial palace (ahem) is the most confusing place i've been to yet! we got lost a few times, went up and down a few creepy elevators, and eventually found this place. wait time was about 30 minutes, bearable with the right people and bloody marys. \n\nfood is good, more appealing in presentation and size. the waffle was delicious, <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with sage was flavorful. i could have probably done without the hash and quesadilla but i was glad to try it. i recommend one order to share between two people. the portions are huge and i love it!!", 
            "i love this place. the portions, the service, and the atmosphere is just great. \nthe portion: beyond generous. the average plate can typically feed two people. the appetizer can feed one person. if you are daring like me try to eat the main dish by yourself. this place serves breakfasts all day so that's a plus. i ordered the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>...bomb. the chicken is crispy. the eggs is fluffy. mash potato is delicious. bacon...chipotle sauce and cheese. mmm mmm good\nthe service was excellent. made my visit even better. our waiter was very friendly and quick.",

            "heard this was a really good place for a heavy big plated breakfast or as one of my friend said \"denny's on steroid\" and usually there's a 3 hour wait because it is always packed. well i was already starving but since i wanted to try this place i decided to try it. luckily when we got there, there was no wait....and we got seated right away...and this was a saturday around lunch time. we all decided to kind of share since the portions were so big...so i ordered the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> which was featured on man vs. food as a favorite food of this restaurant. \n\nmmmmmm it was delicious indeed! the sauce was amazing and <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> of <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, egg, biscuit covered in an amazing gravy sauce was sensational and i probably could have finished the whole thing myself if i wasn't watching out for carb intake....however i totally wiped clean my half of the plate. hehe \n\ndefinitely a good place for very hungry people and for those that love a heavy amazingly delicious breakfast meal.", 
            "i came here hungry with a friend who said this place was great. it was supposed to have huge portions and it was right on. i was starving and left completely stuffed, and i didn't even finish my meal. i had the signature <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles. the chicken breast was juicy and crispy, with a sage and garlic batter, extremely tasty. they served two of them along with 4 waffles, with chunks of apple wood bacon cooked inside. i thought this was going to taste great, but it was a bit plain and doughy. it was served with reduced maple syrup for extra flavor. i couldn't even finish 2 waffles. i enjoyed it, but needed to walk off all that food, which took a while. i would go back to try their stuffed burgers next time. i saw someone eating one and it looked very tasty.", 
            "farm to table. and then another table. and another. so much food. \n\nwent in a group of 7 out-of-towners. despite the pleadings of one of our members that sharing might be a good idea, we each ordered individual dishes. we should have listened...\n\nthe <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles was the most popular dish at the table. 3 of us ordered it, myself included,  and everyone got a taste. the chicken was nicely fried, with perfectly crisp skin. i could have stood for it to be a little moister but that's nitpicking. you get two good size white meat pieces to go with your 4 bacon-belgium waffles. yes, the bacon is baked into the waffles. brilliant.\n\ni got to taste one of their giant flapjacks, as well (snickers flavored). fluffy and flavorful. that's the way to do it.\n\nthe server and other waitstaff helping out was very friendly and handled our large group well, including a late drink order change.\n\ndrinks, yes, we had some, a variety of mimosas, a strawberry margarita, a blt bloody mary. i wasn't overly impressed with my mimosa (i went with a lemonade one) but i ended up switching with someone who had a pineapple mimosa and we were both happier. the blt bloody mary literally comes with a mini blt. you just have to put it together yourself.\n\nand all of that food was not terribly expensive. this is a great value on the strip. you easily get at least two, if not 3, meals out of each dish, and, with reasonable prices to begin with, that means more money in your pocket to chase straights or split your eights.", 
            "ehh mixed feelings.\n\nso after having this place hyped up by one of my buddies, i was really excited since i like a good breakfast. and i love a good breakfast after a hard night of drinking..which is where this review will begin! lol\n\nso when we get to imperial palace, we find hash house and it's swarmed by people waiting to get in.  the hostess informs us that it's about an hour wait time to get seated..$10 and 5 minutes later, we were seated haha\n\ni know it was busy and all, but it took absolutely forever to take our orders, bring out drinks, and bring out our food.  so service you can was average at the best. our waitress was nice when we did see her, but that was rare.\n\ni opted for the world famous <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles. the chicken was really good! the batter was light and flavorful. the waffles had huge strips of bacon inside them. however, besides that there was nothing special about them.  batter they used was a little heavy, and the waffle itself was uneventful. \n\npricing is good for the strip. most dishes were around $15 and portions were huge and easily shared. \n\nmaybe i was expecting too much? but this place wasn't all that cracked out. the food was average at best. if i hadn't greased the hostess, this meal would have taken more then 2 hours if you include the wait time.\n\ni'd eat here again though, but maybe on a weekday and a different dish!",

            "perfect hangover food.\nwe waited approximately 45min before we were seated, there was about 12 of us, so it was understandable. i asked our server which was the best dish in his opinion and he said the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breast & waffles, so i ordered it. not disappointed at all. i love my friend chicken crispy not too oily, and this was perfect, the waffles were fluffy. i couldnt finish my dish, the portions were huge.\n\nservice was friendly and sweet. they talked to us while we waited to be seat. when you're hung over from a night out in vegas, this is the place to be. nom.",

            "i'd been dying to try the san diego location since friends keep posting pictures of these giant fancy plates of food from this place. we walked in about 9 am on a sunday morning. we saw lots of people sitting in the waiting area so we were expecting a wait but luckily the hostess just ushered us in. they have plenty of small tables available for 2- 4 people. guess there were large groups outside. but by the end of the meal, the place was packed, both inside and out. anyways, the first thing the waitress said was that the portions are huge. i already knew that and decided to split a dish with someone. the guys each ordered their own dish and ended up boxing up half of it. hahaha. so i split the house hash with chicken. it was served in a heavy iron skillet along with a biscuit, 2 eggs and fruit. we were starving but it was so much food. the two of us had trouble finishing it. it wasn't that amazing either. the food is just ok. i don't know if i love it or will crave it in the future. it's a little bit greasy. i think their gimmick is just huge portions and i guess their food presentation is pretty good. my friend got the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict (which is a man vs food fav) but man it's like almost a foot high, everything piled on top of each other. looked really good. i only tried a bit of the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and chicken and hollandaise sauce. it was tasty. that dish was like $16 though. everything is about $15 or more but i guess if it feeds you twice, it's ok. hard to have leftovers on vacation though and i'm guessing a lot of people that come here are tourists. oh and the other guy at our table got <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> with a waffle, eggs, sausage, and fruit. the waffle took up like  of the plate and half of the waffle went home with us as well. haha. oh and i have to mention service was horrible. our waitress liked to disappear for long periods of time. she was nice and polite but nowhere to be found. other people brought out our drinks and food. and we had to flag other wait staff to get an extra plate and boxes at the end. man, it would've been a much quicker meal if we had better service.", 
            "man o man.  what else is there to say other than bad ass!!!   this place was great.  my girl and i went hear for breakfast and we had a pleasant food experience.  she got this giant blueberry pan cake and i got the frien <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>.  it's not just a bunch of food thrown together, but also delicious as well.  all the flavors of the benedict were popping individually.  we will definetly be back for more !!!", 
            "kinda fun place. very good service and good music playing food came out looking like artwork and kinda tasted like it too. ha, not really, but it was not as good as it looked. chicken was over cooked and tough, several of the stacked ingredients were not hot or even warm. i had the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> and it was huge amount of food. i can see how if they were on their game it could be really good. never had a burning desire to eat there a second time but i would try it again. the guy next to me had a pancake that looked really good and was huge.", 
            "two days in, this is my favorite thing about vegas.  portion size is an amazing value when sharing (but a waste if you're trying to go it alone w/o \"man vs food\" appetite).  the pancake is the size of a medium size pizza!  not that we ordered one, just an observation of the table next to us where the woman ate a mere 1/8 of the pie, i mean, pancake.  our table split 3 types of hash (salmon, meatloaf and <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark>), which were all tasty, but the real star was the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles.  oh my goodness, that was heaven, even for someone like me who isn't really a <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> kinda gal.  but wow, so juicy and tasty!  and lord, the bacon inside the waffle is pure genius!  i can safely say, i'm going back ... maybe every day that i'm here?",

            "i have been to all the hhggs in town, and finally got to try the ip location when my folks were in town for the weekend.\n\nwe went on a saturday around noon, so i definitely knew there would be a wait. they quoted us 45 minutes, but it ended up being only about 25, which isn't bad. if you're at any decent breakfast place on the strip on a weekend, you'll have to wait. \n\ni typically enjoy going to the older properties to check them out and get a bargain drink, but with all the construction going on right now, the ip is hell to get in and out, plus the smokiness level is pretty high down in the casino. luckily, hhgg has its own mezzanine-kind of level, which is all smoke-free.\n\nsince i'm with child over here, i didn't order a drink, but i did sample the orange crush (kinda like a mimosa with vodka and a salt rim) and the bloody mary (super spicy and very strong) - i thought they were both great! the bloody mary, especially, reminded me of something i'm definitely looking forward to after the baby is born in may!\n\non to the food. i almost always get something with <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> at hhgg, so this time i went for the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. the chicken was excellent, as always - delicious sage breading, not too heavy, and no bones! they came on top of spinach, tomatoes, scrambled eggs, cheese, and a biscuit, with a kind of creamy chili sauce all over. oh, and underneath, was a huge block of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, probably the equivalent of 2 large potatoes! my one complaint about the dish was that the biscuits were kinda dry and bland. the others in my party got the vanilla waffle, blue cheese burger, and rueben sandwich (which is called the pub crawl). i seriously loved the waffle and the pub crawl. the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> and sauerkraut were so delicious and flavorful, they totally complimented the rye bread, and i usually hate rye bread. i thought the burger was good, but nothing too exciting.\n\nyes, there is too much food! we were all super hungry (and the waffle was only like a half meal, since it comes by itself), and together we ate about 3/4 of everything. no problem - i love leftovers!\n\nprices run from $8 for the waffle to $16 for the eggs benedict, which is all totally reasonable. the drinks are a little high at $14/ea for the specialty drinks, but that's definitely in line with typical strip prices.\n\nonly drawback was the service. while friendly, our server seemed super rushed, and the kitchen took a while to get our food out.", 
            "my second visit to the ip location.  on my first visit (may, 2012), i had no idea what to expect, with the word 'hash' in the name one is led to believe hash browns would be involved, when in fact, nothing comes with hash browns.  my friends ordered one of the large <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> 'breakfasts', i wasnt in the mood for a giant meal, so i ordered 'andys <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark>', which comes with coffee @ $8.95, it was more than i could finish, and ok, i'd call this the 'value play' on the menu here, everything else is gonna wring your wallet.\n2nd trip, we again visited the ip location on a monday morning; driving into the ip location at this particular time (10/22/12) is insane with the construction going on, and their parking garage is deplorable.  the wait was crazy long, luckily the beepers they give you work immediately downstairs where we could play video poker at the bar and drink 'free' coffees.\nwhen we got back upstairs to the waiting area, they called out our name instead of using the beepers (?).\nthe decor here is farmer-full-metal-jacket, with plate metal on the walls.  i think this creates sort of a faraday cage where no cell signal attempting to transmit yelp checkins or photos is possible! :) both times here checkins/photos failed to go thru.\nwaiter was fairly attentive, after we ordered he then warned us the kitchen was very slow and orders were running 30-40 mins.  oh goody.  i ordered the 'steak hash' and a v8.  wife got bacon/eggs and coffee.\nsteak hash, with sun dried tomatoes and topped with green beans <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, along with two eggs on the side, came served in a faux iron skillet (meaning, it wasnt used to cook in).  sometimes i think chefs add sexy ingredients that are going to sound good, without really thinking thru the flavor.  it was really quite dreary tasting and unappetizing, and the steak was overcooked slices of beef.\nafter tip we were out $40 for breakfast that i really didnt enjoy much.  \nso the two-star here is mainly due to the value, my opinion is overpriced 'just ok' food.\n\noh, i did notice there appears to be wi-fi here, but it needs a password, you might ask your server about it - i wont be back here.", 
            "i heard about this place on man vs. food. and i put it on my to eat list whenever i come to vegas. tried it for the first time and i absolutely love their <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> plate. i forgot the name of it. the portion is so huge that two-three people can share. their mimosas are the best. i love their tangerine mimosa. great and friendly service. get here early because the wait can be pretty long if you come late.",

            "the blt bloody mary was pretty much the best thing that has happened to my mornings, in a very long time. \n \nwas in vegas the past few nights and absolutely loved hash house a go go.  we could not get over how massive the portions were and how tasty the food was.  so much so in fact, that we visited two mornings in a row!  the first morning i had their take on an eggs benedict that featured griddled <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, a red pepper cream sauce with spinach, tomatoes and bacon.  to die for.  impossible to finish.  my boyfriend had the chorizo hash which was also delish, but my benny took the gold medal on that meal. \n\nthe next morning we re-visited and i had waffles with bacon, eggs and crispy potatoes.  the meal was pretty standard, but the waffles put this meal at 4 stars. this morning, my boyfriend tried the house favourite <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>.  un-be-liev-able. the chipotle cream sauce absolutely makes this dish, coupled with their famous <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>.  wow. \n\ni am a huge fan of this place, and fully intend on returning upon my next vegas vacation. even better than huge portions?  the extremely reasonable prices that go along with them.",

            "i was craving breakfast at 100pm so we decided to go to has house a go go at the m resort. we were there last year, and now i remember why we haven't been back since, service was bad! last time we were there, service was sooo slow, this visit wasn't any different. mind you, the place was not packed considering it was a saturday but maybe because of the time. my drink didn't come out right away (i had the tri colored lemonade (watermelon something)) but my husband got his immediately. for the main food, he got the famous <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> (as featured on man vs food) and i just ordered <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark>. i asked to have my eggs \"over medium\" as i hate to have runny whites (that's just me). it took forever for the food to come. the waitress never came back to say what the hold up was. so after what seems like an eternity, the food came. his food is good, but mine, well, i had to ask for new eggs. i told the waitress i wanted it \"over medium\". she gave me a lecture on how over medium means the yolk is still runny, i said i understand but the white part on my eggs were still runny (i showed it to her on the plate; when i cut the eggs, the white part were still liquid and this was practically over easy). she said she'll get me a new one. the waffle, on the other hand was good, except the little tin cup of syrup was placed on the waffle itself. not such a good hygienic practice; how do i know where that thing was before they stuck it on my waffle! when we were done paying, the waitress places the black bill container on our table, no thank you's, nothing! at that time, my husband and i just looked at each other and said, this is the reason why we haven't been back! now, we will never come back, ever! the food may be ok/good, but the service was horrible!", 
            "i finally got a chance to eat at the place that supposedly serves \"twisted farm food.\" it had been on my radar ever since i first saw it on man v. food. staying at imperial made it all the more tempting to just go there for each meal. in a rare showing of mercy to my wallet, i didn't do that.\n\nbefore going inside the dining area, you'll see a number of autographed portraits and menus. adam richman's is one of them. \n\ni decided to do takeout for dinner. while it was very tempting to just get the popular <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles, i was in a 1-pound stuffed burger mood. oh, that'd be one pound of meat. the entire burger was probably closer to 2 lbs., although not quite there.\n\nthe mushroom and swiss stuffed burger ($12.95) was amazing. extremely juicy and gargantuan. everything cooked perfectly. it was heaven just to see the melted swiss and sauteed mushrooms. it's served with the cold fresh veggies on one bun half and the stuffed patty on the other half. two big dill pickle slices in the burger. while the lettuce looked a bit wilted, that's probably only because everything stayed in the same closed takeout box for a few minutes.\n\ni'm guessing they used a brioche bun. very soft and inviting. i personally think it could have been better with a slight toasting on the flattop. this just felt like the juicy lucy i had in minnesota a couple years back, just in steroidal form. i think the burger could be too greasy and too imposing for some people. fork and knife might be required. i for one needed a larger mouth.\n\nburgers come with one side item of your choice. i got the basil pesto tossed crispy potatoes and enjoyed every bite. great job on the crispy potatoes. it also had some broken-down diced tomatoes in there. the olive oil from the pesto collected a bit at the bottom of the plastic takeout container.\n\ndessert is served all day here, and one of the servers mentioned that some items (like the <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark>) are for in-house dining only. might expect up to a 15-minute wait on that <mark>Andy's Famous Bread Pudding</mark>.\n\nbreakfast includes <mark>French Toast</mark>, flapjacks, and the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, all featured on the man v. food episode. i hope to get back there for some of those dishes.\n\ni saw the plating of the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles i spoke of earlier, and it's literally a tower of food. three or four waffles for the base, some <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> on top of that, and a large knife to hold it all in place.\n\neven with all the inflated prices on the vegas strip, i think it's well worth the price to come here. check this elite spot out the next time you're in the area.",

            "was told that the m hotel and casino had the best food so we went to the buffet the night before and had a great meal , probably the best buffet in town.  since the buffet was so great we decided to have breakfast at the hash house a go gp at the same hotel, big mistake.  i had the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles which wasn't bad and my wife and my wife had the basic breakfast which was scrambled eggs and biscuit .  the service was slow since they seem to be a little short on help, i guess i was just expecting more since the buffet the night before was so great.  my conclusion is to have the buffet but skip the breakfast there",

(perfect for sharing.)  even though it was huge, this didn't take away from its quality.  all the ingredients were still fresh! this seems pretty true about all other meals served there.  you get quantity and quality.",

            "so this place is located in an upstairs hidden corner of the used to be imperial palace (soon to be the quad). it is sorta tricky to find, but that does not seem to deter vegas tourists from visiting this totally fun place. \n\nwe tried to visit on a saturday morning but were greeted with a 45 minute wait. we were hungry, so we decided to pass this one up and try it again on monday morning. still a 35 minute wait, but we really wanted to try it. \n\nas others have said, once you are seated the service is excellent. the menu has all sorts of fun and unique offerings such as a banana latte and banana and maple sugar pancakes. my boyfriend and i are normally people who walk in and decide what we want fairly quickly, but hash house's menu boasts so many unique flavors that it took us a while to decide. \n\nwe finally decided that we wanted the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles (apparently a man vs. food favorite), some pancakes, and a side of crispy potatoes. the waitress took one look at us (we are not large people) and recommended we wait on the pancakes until we received the rest of our food, as the portions are so good. we appreciated her honesty, because the portions were huge and the chicken and waffles <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> were more than enough. \n\nthe flavor, texture, and presentation was superb. the sage as a bit of complexity to the chicken flavor that still mixes well with the waffles. the syrup was a little less sweet than most, which makes it perfect with the savory part of the dish. the chicken was also obviously high quality. one of the things i normally hate about <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> is the low quality chicken that places sometimes use. \n\nwe fully enjoyed our dining experience. the dishes are so large and tasty looking that it is fun to watch the servers take them to their respective tables and then watch the look on the people's faces as they begin to dig in. we are already planning to visit again on our next vegas trip, and even want to stop in late night after gambling just for one of their fun lattes.",

            "this place gets 3.5 stars from me, but i rate it as a 4 since you can't give half star ratings.  this place is located inside the quad (formerly imperial palace).  i went here with my wife last saturday for brunch.  the main reason i would give this place 3.5 stars is definitely not because of the food, but because of the atmosphere.  first off, it's located inside the quad hotel, which in general is dumpy and has a high population of riffraff.  when we went, the place was very busy (minimum 30 minute wait for 2 people) and loud.  they don't have a lot of seating, so we ended up just standing and waiting.  i'm not sure if it's because of where it's located in the hotel, but we got no cell phone service in this restaurant.  again, because it's so loud in here, it's not exactly the best place to hold a conversation.  that said, if loud music and good people watching is your thing, you'll probably enjoy this place.  the food here was actually very good, and they give you way too much of it.  my wife ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles with bacon, while i simply had a bacon sandwich with fries.  both were good.  i really wasn't in the mood for breakfast food that day, so my options were limited.  also, it seemed like we had to wait for a long time to get our food, mostly because they were busy.  overall, i wouldn't rush back here to eat, mainly because of the atmosphere, but the food was good.",

            "came here with my sister's bachelorette party, hungover and hungry before we headed back home.  we waited for about almost an hour.  it was super crowded and i had heard tons of rave reviews about this place so i just had to taste for myself.\n\nonce we were seated, the waitress explained that everything is made fresh to order so it might take some time for our food to come out.  actually, it didn't take long at all, even tho the place was packed with people.  \n\ni ordered the apple baked pancakes that had huge slices of green apple baked into the pancakes... delish!!  another person in our party ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffle and it looked like an artful masterpiece!  so tasty!!  my sis ordered the breakfast quesadilla that she loved.  portions are huge here so guaranteed you will not finish what you order.  but that's a good thing, cuz you get to have it again later (which you will definitely want again)\n\nthis place is so worth the wait!!  definitely stop here the next time you are in sin city.",

            "this is a must eat when in vegas and has been for every trip i have made. both times i have gotten the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, once atop an eggs benedict and most recently as the famous chicken and waffles. i highly recommend the chicken and waffles, it's all sorts of food goodness. there's bacon infused in the waffles, the chicken is juicy, fried with corn flakes and drizzled with a hot maple reduction, and topped with fried leeks. awesome!  a+ for the bloody mary blt which came topped with an actual make your own blt, which was a perfect snack while waiting for our food.", 
            "this is the place that i have been searching for all my life!!!! i wanted a place that offered a unique culinary experience and boy did we get it here!!! service was impeccable; steve was awesome and delivered great service. the wait was 40 min for our group of  9, but it was so darn worth the wait!!! i literally wanted to order everything on the menu; they're known for their hashes and benedicts. \n\nkeep in mind that you aren't going to get the traditional eggs benedict with hollandaise sauce.  instead, they create their own special sauce and everything we ordered was delicious! we ordered:\n\n<mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>: crispy sage infused chicken on top of a mountain of carbs (2 grape size biscuits and mash potatoes) smothered in a creamy chipotle sauce with sauteed spinach. one word: heavenly. \n\nmeat loaf hash: meat loaf was tender and well seasoned. best part, you didn't overdose from the salt because there was barely any! \n\nblueberry pecan pancakes are as gigantic as a large pizza and was crispy on the outside and moist and fluffy on the inside. \n\n<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>: this meal changed my life. i never understood the hype over roscoe's chicken & waffles or the new lays chicken and waffles potatoes chips, but this dish seriously was the best ever!! the sage not only elevated the super juicy and tender chicken, but the fried leeks seriously took the dish to the top level. i wish they had chopped bacon bits throughout the waffle rather than just one strip, but their homemade maple syrup wasn't overly sweet, so the juxtaposition of sweet and salty was like an explosion in your mouth.  \n\nwe are definitely coming back here every time we're in vegas.", 
            "if you're looking for bang for your buck and by that i mean huge portions, this is a quality place to eat.  while there are definitely other places on the strip with higher quality, more flavorful food, most of them aren't offering portions this size.\n\ni had  the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and a bloody mary.  the bloody mary was the first one i've ever tried and it was delicious.  peppery, with the perfect amount of vodka mixed in.  the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was average and the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> was a little disappointing.  they basically throw a bunch of full pieces of bacon into the batter, throw it in the waffle iron and call them <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>.  good try, but the waffles just didn't have the flavor that i was looking for.\n\nit wasn't a bad meal by any means though.  for the price, i definitely feel like i got my money's worth and i wouldn't be against coming back to this place next time i'm in vegas.",

            "huge portions!  had the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict.  eggs and <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> on top of biscuits, tomato <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> with a chipotle cheese sauce covering.  it was so good!  easily could have shared this, but i gave it a good effort and finished a bit over half.  pancakes and waffles also looked great.  make sure you go there very hungry!", 
            "we put our names on the list and were quoted a wait time of about 45 minutes. we probably weren't seated till an hour and a half later.\n\nall the reviews aren't lying when they say the portions are massive. i had <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with bacon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and a fried egg. the chicken was a bit dry and the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> were bland. i also ordered a side of fried potatoes and sausage gravy, which ended up being uneaten because there's already so much food for one entree. definitely don't recommend the fried potatoes though. they don't have much flavor to them.\n\nmy friends split the chicken and waffles and that was definitely a good idea. i really have no idea how one person can consume that much food in one sitting! the waffles were very soft and doughy, if you like that. i do so i really enjoyed them!\n\neveryone at our table seemed to enjoy their food. not sure if i would come back though because there's just so many places in vegas to try!", 
            "seriously, this place is heaven on earth... do not leave after you see the wait... it is worth it! wait the 45 min to an hour, you will not be disappointed. \n\ndefinitely ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles... the waffles have bacon in them. let me repeat myself...the waffles have bacon in them.  it was seriously amazing.  my dad got the same thing as me, my mom had the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>... also phenomenal, and huge.  my sister isn't as much of an \"eater\" that we are, an d she opted for oatmeal with fruit... well this was the biggest bowl of oatmeal i had ever seen, and she was extremely satisfied. \n\ndon't plan on finishing your food here, because it would just be near impossible, but don't split your food, its part of the experience.  the drinks are awesome as well.  do plan on having your camera, trust you are going to want to remember the moment you ate the largest plate of chicken and waffles you have ever seen! :)", 
            "even though the quad (formerly imperial palace) is unimpressive and their rooms are quite gross, they do have this one diamond in the rough. it is actually inside the casino and up an escalator so don't bother looking for it from the strip. you'll just get lost. \n\ni came here with about 20 people (yea. 20.) and knew about the long waits but we were all willing to eat here. the hostess quoted us a 45 minute wait but surprisingly we were seated in ~25 mins despite the large amount of people in the lobby. i felt bad for the waitress though as she had to yell across the three connected tables to all twenty of us to explain the menu. she sounded like she was losing her voice but she had a very cheerful attitude nonetheless. \n\nportions are ginormous so just share; i recommend it. i split the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> with my gf and it was way more than enough. we also split the snickers pancake with another couple with us. the benedict was very tasty and stacked high, about 7 inches in height, 12 inches if you include the rosemary sprigs sticking out of it. it could've been that we were starving and getting over our hangovers but it was an amazing combination <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> gravy spinach and bacon. i'm glad we shared the pancake because it was huge as well, probably at 12-13 inches in diameter with chunks of snickers everywhere. also very sweet so i only ate about 3-4 bites of it and had to stop.\n\nvery affordable assuming you split the dish with another person. fyi the bathroom is downstairs in the casino area.  definitely worth stopping to try it out unless you've been to the original one in sd.", 
            "one word, delicious! \n\nthis place is amazing and it's located upstairs in the quad. the quad is a new casino/hotel, previously the imperial palace. they're still renovating the place, but the restaurant is established.\n\ni was a little worried there would be a wait, but i guess we went early enough that we avoided any wait at all. yay! we were seated right away. our server was wonderful. he was enthusiastic about the food and making sure we had a good dining experience. \n\nthe <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> was overwhelming and so good. personally i never had chicken and waffles before. <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> just sounded weird to me, but damn this was good. hash house a go go has taken my chicken and waffles virginity. now i don't think anything else can compare. you must get this when you're here! \n\nwe also order a duck dish which was good too. all the food they offer is creative and flavorful. i did notice something though. does the own have some kind of obsession with rosemary? there's a sprig of rosemary on every dish. lol~", 
            "summary review: this place is worth a visit if you are hung over, really hungry, and looking for a square meal (a huge one) in vegas that tastes decent and doesn't cost a ton of money.\n\nenormous portions. definitely recommend splitting with someone or being ready to pack about half of it and take it home. definitely make sure you go hungry. there are reasonable prices given the quantity of food. i got the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> which was $15.95 and easily enough to feed two; this was one of the most expensive items on the breakfast menu. there were plenty of menu selections for the $9-15 range.\n\nthe <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> is apparently their signature dish (with man vs. food notoriety). i was really impressed with the way it was assembled and presented. however, every bite ended up being a gigantic mess of hollandaise sauce (which they refer to as \"chipotle cream\"; did not taste anything like chipotles and tasted everything like standard hollandaise), potatoes, biscuit, and chicken. had they made the dish slightly smaller and more manageable, it would have been a much higher-quality entree.\n\nin addition, call me a purist, but it is a travesty to call any dish without poached eggs a \"benedict\". the thin tasteless layer of scrambled eggs on top seemed more like an afterthought to the dish rather than a main component. why not call it a \"<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> scramble\" that happens to include hollandaise sauce?\n\nother complaints: drinks were really cool-looking but not very alcoholic. wi-fi didn't work and zero cell reception in the building.\n\noverall, the place wasn't bad, but unremarkable. it works in vegas, but that's about it.", 
            "tried hash house a go go based on yelp and frommer's guide recommendations. the smores hot chocolate was quite tasty- if a little weird when stray chunks of soggy graham cracker ended up in the swallow. vanilla waffles were very good, as was the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breakfast.  portions are gigantic- two could easily share one meal. prices very reasonable for such a large meal on the strip. definitely recommend coming here, but as another reviewer said, iphone map didn't work well. find the quad and follow signs once inside. no wait at 8:00 am for us.", 
            "sorry in advance for the ridiculously long post...\nim not sure where to start... the mediocre food or the mediocre service. we stopped by on a sunday night with a reasonably large group (10). since we wanted to see the bellagio show before is ends at 12am we stopped by hash house to check on the wait. we were told there was no wait and in fact they were slow. we asked to put our name down for a reservation and were told they dont take reservations (ok). we cam back round 11 and were promptly told it would be 20-25 minutes. we were not please but decided to wait because we where here and staying close by and all wanted toi tyr the food. after a 10 minute wait the greater came and told us it was going to be at least another 25 minutes because they only had one large table available and that table just received their food. annoying, i should have taken this as a sign, but the majority of the group was fine although a little annoyed. one friend decided to walk around and saw that they were in fact very slow (almost no tables occupied) and also had a back room with a large table available. he asked the receptionist if they could put tables together since almost the whole restaurant was empty or let us sit in the back. all we receive was a \"no, we cant do that\". cant or wont? still we waited on. 15 more minutes pass and surprise they open the table in the back section. so i guess they could do it. finally we are all sitting down starving and ready to go in on some delicious food... or were we. we placed our orders based on their \"late night menu\", which is lack luster at best (about 10 items). the waiter came round and although he was polite seems a little slow based on how unbusy they were. heres were it went south quickly. i ordered the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> and asked for the eggs poached, cause who the hell scrambles eggs and calls it eggs benedict?! the wait for the food again seemed long for how slow the place was, 20 minutes, but for good food i would gladly wait. first thing i noticed when they bring my food is eggs are not poached. i ask the waiter to fix it and he graciously takes my plate back. 10-15 minutes pass my whole party is eating (although one guy got his food alarmingly later then everyone else). the waiter brings back my plate and it looks disheveled and clearly reconstructed. i look at it and touch it to see if they remade the plate or just switched out the eggs. the waiter quickly snaps at me \"i had them remake the whole plate\" to which i reply \"i highly doubt that, because its not hot.\" the icing on the cake and what made it so blatant that the food was not remade was my poached eggs were not even on the dish... they came on the side in a sad lonely little bowl. they remade the whole plate... really? there was no apology no admission he just carried on as usual. we received the check (tip already included because of the size of our group) and he went on about his business with out offering anything to compensate for the poor service and blatant lie. his name was david btw, i was so pissed off i made sure to look it up so i could mention him, by name, in this review. the final nail in the hash house coffin, the food aint that good. its ok at best. its over sized and over sauced and the taste is underwhelming. its like they put extra portions of mediocre food on a plate cover it on bacon, <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and sauce and call it spectacular. i know good food and this is no where close. not a single person at the table seemed to be impressed, only one person even took left overs. the most impressive thing about the food at this restaurant other then the portion size was the huge branch of sage sticking out of their plate. that was pretty awe inspiring. total restaurant fail.", 
            "ate here on 12/12. the wife got the caramel all over my mocha very good and big! i got the smores coffee drink. very good. it had marshmallow fluff that was torched and served with graham crackers and lots of chocolate sauce. we shared the man vs food favorite <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>! very good and plenty of food for 2. service was great as well.",

            "this is the place to go if you're looking to get your money's worth on the strip. the best items are available all day and are large enough that you can split a single dish with someone or take your leftovers to get two meals out of it (i'm definitely okay with that in vegas). the bloody mary's don't quite live up to the marketing, but that only brings this place to a 4.5/5, and i'm willing to round up in this case.\n\ntheir <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> is fantastic, and while it's not as light as you would expect it to be... it really doesn't matter when it's gigantic and you're already drunk from watching some of the morning games down at the sportsbook bar in planet hollywood. each individual part of the benedict was delicious and the price for it made the entire meal a great value. i've been to several places in other casino resorts that charge more for the same \"quality\" of fare and give you a lot less in terms of taste, size, and price. the service staff when i went this last time was friendly and took care of me promptly despite a busy bar. i will always make it a point to visit here when i'm down in sin city.", 
            "like its sister restaurant in san diego, the food at this location doesn't disappoint. i shared a plate of the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles with my boyfriend during a trip. just like home. yum! i liked the fried scallions that came with the dish. i really enjoyed the play of sweet versus savory on the plate. may i suggest dipping your <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> in some maple syrup? we watched a neighboring table where each guy ordered a plate for himself. needless to say, they all left with doggie bags since the portions are so huge. \n\nthere were a few dings and that's why i rated this 4/5 stars. the restaurant was difficult to find and the hotel was undergoing some construction at the time. the service could have been better. the server did not check in with us to see how we were doing and was a little clueless as to the tip we left her. we chose this place to dine since we had a gift card to use. it was not valid at this location since it was purchased at the san diego location who has separate ownership.",

            "highly disappointed. was coming with super high expectations, and maybe that was my downfall. first off, we waited 55 minutes for a table. once getting seated our waiter informed us that it would be another 45 minutes for our food once we ordered. i wanted to leave right then and there but we waited out of sheer desperation. they should at least give you some bread or something to munch on if you're waiting that long. i got the first farm indiana special, which was <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, bacon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, eggs, and a biscuit.\nthe chicken was extremely dry, and the only hint of sage flavor was the dry rosemary they threw on top.\nthe bacon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> was just <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> with two slices of bacon on top. not horrible, but deceiving from the menu description.\ni got my eggs over medium. they were good, but how hard is it to mess up eggs?\nthe biscuit was good, but very dry and sucks up any ounce of moisture in your mouth without any butter or jam or syrup. \nthe display was elaborate and pretty, ill give them that. and the portions were massive. but overall i'd save the money for this expensive meal and go to denny's instead.",

            "solid place, great food, great service. we arrived at 8:30 on a wednesday morning and had a 10 minute wait. by the time our table was ready the lobby was filling up. definitely get there early if you don't want to wait long!\n\nthe menu has a wide range of items. i got one of the farm scrambles (bacon, avocado, onion, and swiss). it came with a biscuit <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. more than enough food. in fact, the portions here are insanely huge. one of my reasons for giving them four stars instead of five is because there is no need for portion sizes to be this large. it's pretty, and impressive, but ultimately it's just a waster of food. most people leave a good amount behind.\n\nthe other reason for giving them four stars is that the potatoes were not that great. they were not terrible but not worth any room in my stomach. i focused on my biscuit (excellent!) and scramble.\n\nmy brother had the chicken and waffles. it was insane! two pieces of <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and four or more waffles. the waffles had strips of bacon inside them. we thought the added bacon in the waffles was fun, but again, an unnecessary amount of food that went to waste. cut the chicken and waffles down to half the size and probably most people still couldn't eat it all.\n\nour server was fantastic - some of the best service we had in all of vegas (shout out to billy). the host was not super friendly and barely made eye contact, but he was efficient. \n\ni do recommend going for breakfast. price is very reasonable and food is delicious. it's prepared to order so expect to hang out a bit as they cook it. well worth it!", 
            "great food, service, and price!\n\nwhen i was planning my trip to vegas, i did some research on places to eat and this was very high on the list. one of the main reasons was because it was featured on man vs. food.\n\nmy friend and i decided to eat here for breakfast and i wasn't disappointed at all. i decided to try the \"<mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>\", mainly because this is what was featured on man vs. food. it had everything in it: <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, bacon, cheese, friend chicken, egg, tomatoes, spinach, and a sauce (i think i probably left some stuff out). the portion was huge! for $18, this single plate could feed about 2-3 people.\n\nwe also got the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> which were good. the waffles were light and airy with the bacon cooked in to it.\n\nlastly, the smore's hot chocolate was delicious! take my recommendation; it's amazing :)", 
            "i first learned about this place on man v. food and bacon paradise on the travel channel.  since the first time i tried this place, ive ate here about 3-4 times already.  i guess you can consider this as an accumulation review of all the times i have been here. \n\nlocation:  there are actually two hash house a go go in vegas...one off the strip and on on the strip (this one).  the one on the strip is a hidden gem located on the second floor of imperial palace now known as the quad.  prepare to wait anywhere from 15 mins to over an hour.   luckily they give you a pager so you can still wander inside the casino.\n\nfood: the food here in my opinion is actually pretty good.  the price is relatively cheap (most stuff are around $15 - $20) considering all the other places on the strip and the portion size are huge.  you can easily share one dish.  hash house is known for their \n\n<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> tower (bacon built inside the waffle).  everytime someone orders this the room tends to get quite and people stare going wtf. \n\nhash house farm benedict  (seen on man v. food);\n\nbblt (imagine if you let someone who hates lettuce and tomato but loves bacon to build his own blt with the only catch being there has to be at least one piece of lettuce and tomato...lol).\n\nthe only thing i didnt like too much was their 1lb <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, avocado & cheddar stuffed burger.  the burger was very bland and lacked flavor.\n\noverall this is a good place to go to if you don't want to spend too much money and wanna feel food preggo (if you dont share).",

            "guess the food is better when you eat in?\n\nstayed at the rio with my family and my dog so someone had to stay behind with the pup while everyone else procured breakfast. this seems to be the only real breakfast place in the hotel/casino so options were pretty limited.... kind of like the menu.\n\n if you want <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>, bloody marys garnished with a deconstructed sandwich, etc, then 4  stars are probably well deserved.\n\nmy parents ordered the basic breakfast (one with scrambled eggs the other with over easy, both with sausages) and i ordered the sun dried <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark>, & basil scramble with an extra side of chicken sausage.\n\nin all honesty, i was starving so didn't realize a the stuff i missed until we got our to go order to the room.  first of all, all our orders were supposed to come with biscuits and fruit and we received a total of 1 biscuit and no fruit.  second of all, i didn't even mind that there weren't enough biscuits because the giant hockey puck they tried to pass off as a biscuit was a dense mass that tasted like it was made yesterday.\n\nwe all chose fried potatoes which looked sad and possibly prepared at the same time the biscuit was made.  i didn't eat mine but my dog seemed to like it.\n\nalso i'm pretty sure (receipt confirmed it) that my chicken sausage (which they do admit is in a pork casing) was actually pork sausage and was a little over seasoned for my tastes.\n\nlastly, the eggs. had such high hopes for these. the scrambled eggs were either not seasoned and or not eggs? they were dense and oddly textured saved only a little by the sundried tomatoes, scant amount of fresh basil, and few crumbles of <mark>Sundried Tomato, Basil & Goat Cheese</mark>.  full disclosure, my dog wouldn't eat the eggs unless it had been touching sausage or had some cheese attached. \noverall our breakfast was disappointing. other than the forgotten items though the service was fantastic (hence the 2 stars rather than 1). all the staff members were so friendly and nice! the place was well decorated and very clean.\n\nif they can get the kitchen sorted out i may consider eating here again but this place is definitely out of rotation on any future vegas trips - even if we stay at the rio again.",

            "before leaving to vegas, my coworker insisted that i should eat at hash house. we have one in califonria, but she said that vegas is a lot better. well, since my coworker is so in love with this particular location, i had to try it out. my group of friends and i came on a busy summer saturday morning around 11am. the hostess told us the wait would be about an hour or more. go figure....because when we walked up the stairs (yes it is located upstairs of harris casino), we can see a large crowd of people, either standing or sitting. the waiting area is small and stuffy and full of hungover club-goers from the night before. \nwe waited for about 30 minutes and we were tired of waiting. so we asked the girl who took down my number if we can order something to go and she said yes and told us to order it with the bartender. so my boyfriend and i walked over to the bartender and tried to get our orders in, but no one acknowledged us....we were literally flagging down the bartenders and the waiters but they just ignored it. i understand that this place gets packed and busy, but please dayummmn rude.  about 20 minutes in, we were finally asked \"how can i help you?\" at that time, our name was called and we ended up dining in.\nwe ended up ordering 2 items:\n1. sage-<mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, which comes with layers of ooey-gooey goodness! the infamous sage-<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, fresh spinach, scrambled eggs, <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, tomatoes, and grilled mozzarella are served on a bed of grilled <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and fresh split biscuit, and lastly they top it with their homemade chipotle cream sauce!! this portion can feed up to 3 hungry people. for something that cost around $13-20 and that is shared with 2-3 adults, it's worth it! the plate came out pretty messy, but it tasted amazing. the chicken was crispy and juicy, and eggs and bacon can never go wrong together. i finished a little portion and had the worst food coma i've had in a while. \n2. of course we ordered the chicken and waffles.  the waffles were thick and fluffy and also stuffed with bacon inside! major plus for the bacon eaters! the chicken was surrounded with leek and a stick of sage that was pierced into the chicken. the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was delicious, perfectly made and so moist. it wasn't all greasy like the chicken you would get from popeyes or kfc\n\neverything was so delicious, and none of us finished out plates. there were 6 of us by the way. i will definitely come back, at an odd hour like 5am to avoid the wait. i hope the staffs can help us faster next time.. its worth checking out if you take it for what its worth.", 
            "my first time here. this is for the one at the quad hotel next to harrah's on the strip. ummm...i liked it. a lot. my wife, daughter and i had brunch here on saturday afternoon. the food here is what they call \"twisted farm food\". it really is a good description of what they serve. it's high quality food that is creatively and well prepared. \n      the restaurant itself is busy and bustling 24 hours a day. decorated in a farmhouse motif, the staff is constantly moving in and out of the kitchen delivering plates of very large portions of food. \n       our server, erik was friendly and accommodating. we perused the large and varied brunch menu while he brought our drinks. the menu has some really good sounding dishes. the signature dish here is the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> tower. it consists of 2 large <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breasts sitting on top of 3 homemade waffles. i saw a lot of people having it and it looks...really good. maybe next time on that one. \n        we each chose one of the \"scrambles\". i had the <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> scramble with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and a buttermilk biscuit. the scramble itself was good but not out of this world. nothing i couldn't make in my own kitchen. the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> were excellent. probably the best iv'e had. the biscuit is huge and has a hint of rosemary and also a large spring of rosemary sticking out of the top. it was excellent as well. my wife and daughter had basically the same thing except they had different ingredients in their scrambles and my wife had crispy potatoes instead of mashed. we all liked our dishes very much. \n        on this saturday afternoon, this place looked like the place to go to cure a hangover. more than a few people looked like they were in pretty bad shape.\n       this location is the only one that is open 24/7/365.  i can definitely see putting hash house a go go on our regular rotation. i can't wait to return to try the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> or one of the benedicts.\n        if you don't believe me, check out my kid's reveiw below..", 
            "wow! the first thing that comes to mind when we got our food! but first i must say that this was the number one place on my list to try when i went to las vegas a couple weeks ago. i saw it on the food network and travel channel. apparently there are multiple locations, but we went to the one that was on the vegas strip in the quad.\n\nupon entering the lobby from the escalators the fist thing noticeable are the numerous pictures of celebrities and their autographs along the wall. that being said, it had to good...because we had to justify the 30-45 min. wait for a table! worth it in the end though.\n\nas we sat down, the server was very upbeat and friendly given how busy the restaurant was. in my experience, the tone and vibe of a busy restaurant will reflect through the server. i felt very welcomed and excited to be trying this place out though. the first thing we asked was for recommendations and he gave us the top 3 most popular dishes. out of the six of us, we decided to order all 3 of them plus one! the ones were the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles, <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, big o' chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> and the chorizo house hash. full menus are online, but each dish was super! \n\nmy personal favorite was the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles. this was superb! the sage really was present in the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and was totally different from any other \"chicken & waffles\" i ever had. the taste was really \"upscale\" but very, very good! the other people in our party didn't like the unique taste because of the overwhelming taste of sage...but that was the reason it stood out for me so much. i am not picky and love new foods, especially new tastes that i had never had before. the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was juicy and of course tasted well with the bacon! the everyone loved the waffles! very soft on the inside but nicely crisp on the outside. and it all worked very well with the maple syrup reduction...such a dream! \n\nthe <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> was similar in taste as far as the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> portion, but was different in texture with the biscuit base, chipotle cream and griddled mozzarella. very rich and good.\n\nthe last two were the chorizo house hash and big o' chicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>. both were the favorites among the group as a whole. the chorizo was very good, not too salty, which i have come across on numerous occasions having the meat at various restaurants. a bit spicy with the jalape\\u00f1os, but i love spice personally. everyone devoured this dish as well as the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark>. the shell/crust of the <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> was mouthwatering. that part of the dish was gone in a flash! so flaky and buttery went well with the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> filling and gravy!\n\ni must say these dishes individually are large! just one of them can feed 2-3 normal individuals. and for the price, very worth it! each dish was presently superbly especially the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles. every time that came out of the kitchen to a different table people would be astonished and stare as the towering masterpiece found its home in a new customer.\n\nthis is a super recommendation if you are ever nearby or decide to take a trip to las vegas! go now!", 
            "portions!! wow. it's one thing to serve a lot but putting out awesome tasting food is a plus. i also love that the server tells us our plates might not come out together bc they don't use microwaves or heat lamps. fresh is king when it comes to food! i ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, which was a big battered chicken breast w/maple reduction, bacon, bacon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, eggs, and a biscuit. chicken was hot, juicy, and flavorful. the bacon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> i wish i could order by the tub, they were so good! sausage gravy i had on the side was good too, could have been a little better but it did have large sausage chunks which i liked. if i'm ever near a hash house again i have to stop in.",

            "checked this place out on the last day i was there in vegas, its right inside the quad hotel. you have go through the hotel take the escalators to get to the top and bam your there. now i want to gripe a little bit about the arrangement of taking in guests. the first thing you see is a line to your left at a counter, thats where you put your name down right? wrong thats where you can order a drink. \n\ni was so disappointed that i waited about an additional ten minutes than i needed to in a line i did not need to wait in. i saw a line that was getting larger at the counter i assumed this is where you put your name down but it wasn't it was just to order drinks if you wanted any during the wait. you have to pass up this counter to go to the front of the restaurant to put your name down. by the time i figured this out there were already about maybe ten or twenty names ahead of me so i had to wait a little bit longer. fix this guys this was very frustrating for me and a few luckily for some guests i saved them by pointing them to the front, thank god i was there. \n\nalright after about a twenty five minute wait i got myself a bloody mary just before getting called. the bloody mary was beautiful with its  green olives and pickled chili and man oh man does it have a lot of pepper, you can almost not tolerate it at first but after yo suck down all the pepper that settled at the bottom, the drink gets easier to finish. \n\nme and the wife got a booth and i have to say the industrial look was eeh dont really know how that connects to any theme but ok. there is like metal platform plates bolted everywhere and the tables are also covered in sheets of aluminum, very cold to rest your elbows on but ok lets get to the food. me and my wife shared a chicken and waffles breakfast, trust me everything in this place is share-able because of the huge amount of food they heep onto your plate. \n\nthe service was pretty good although because it was so busy here it was kind of hard to get the attention of our waiter. he eventually would come by and got us whatever we needed but you can't blame the guy the restaurant was at maximum capacity, i know he was trying to keep up as best as he could. \n\nwhen the chicken and waffles showed up it was a tower of <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> on top of bacon loaded waffles. it looked good but it didn't taste as good as it looked, the chicken and the waffles taste as if it was frozen bought and reheated. the only reason why anyone would forgive the taste is because you get so much food, seriously. my wife said it was good and then i asked her ok lets take away most of the food and give you one piece of chicken and one waffle would you still be happy and she said no and i asked why and she said because its not enough it doesnt taste that good that it can be on its own, and i said ah ha! see told you its really not that good. \n\nwe also ordered extra biscuits with gravy which was also ok but it was gigantic enough to satisfy our questions for taste. its really hard to say bad things about a restaurants in vegas because to be honest you have limited amount of choices, especially for breakfast. would i come here again? well i dont know we'll see. the prices where not that bad to be honest. the only thing redeemable here was the bloody mary which again was just ok.\n\nps: also forgot to mention if you need to go to the restroom you need to go back downstairs to the hotels restrooms. they do not have any restrooms inside the restaurant, really sucks when you just need to wash your hands.",

            "everything on the menu comes large and in charge. unless you are man vs food caliber, expect to share or bring home leftovers. i did exactly that and shared my <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict with my boo thang. all in all it was very satisfying. what i can tell is that their <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> is very good. the batt contains corn flakes in it and the chicken stays juicy and moist yet fully cooked. in some ways the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> is better than roscoe's (but that is up to debate, imo roscoe's) \n\nwhat was a pleasant delight was there blt bloody mary. containing a slice of bacon and lettuce (just because) and a side of toast.. honestly it probably was just the presentation of the bacon and toast added to the drink but it made the experience of drinking their bloody mary so much more enjoyable. getting all of the ooh and aahs when served to my table was also nice, and quite honestly, the attention you get is half of the payoff, am i right?\n\nour server had a crazy mohawk which was totally awesome, he was happy to answer questions about it also which was very nice of him. ive been here a couple times and it has never disappointed. \n\nif you don't know what to get, get the chicken and <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>. it seems to be their most popular dish. fyi, this place was on man vs. food, no challenge just giving credit where credit is due.", 
            "andys <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was the best dish i've had in my entire life!! i'm happy to hear i have one close to home in florida! congratulations to hash house to go go, for creating this amazing dish!", 
            "one of my most anticipated stops in vegas. huge portions & the food is delicious. i always get andy's safe <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. my boyfriend usually tries there burgers. & we always share a side the mac & cheese. it is so good!! if you go on a sunday morning be prepared to wait a little while, but it's gonna b worth every minute.",

            "what the frick. could the dishes be any bigger?!??!\n\nfashooo share with someone when you eat here. do not even doubt the size because anything you get will be good enough for 2 if not 3 people!! you definitely get your moneys worth, but the food is definitely not ideal to take to go when you can't finish your meal so try to find a dish wanted w your friend and just gooo for it.\n\nsomehow i finished all the toppings of my <mark>HH Original</mark> benedict only leaving behind half the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and a little bit of the biscuit (which is to die for btw the biscuit was ooooh lawdddd)\n\nbut everything else....\n\nchicken <mark>Sausage Gravy Pot Pie</mark> - the size of an actual freakin pie. looks like a pie that threw up its insides gracefully\n\n<mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> - huge pile of compost lookin food but bet it tasted good\n\nchicken rosemary hash plate - big square plated hash on a pan big enough to cook on\n\njust why. never again not listening to reviews. satisfying, but really hash house?? really???", 
            "i was thoroughly disappointed with the lack of service my friend and i received as well as the food. it wasn't as good as i've heard it to be. i had the andy <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with potatoes and my friend had the kokomo burger/sandwich. i had so much leftover that i took it to-go and gave it to a homeless person because i didn't want to waste the food... pretty disappointed.", 
            "a. ma. zing. the waiter suggested that my husband and i split the <mark>French Toast</mark> and the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> for a little sweet/salty mix and it was ridiculous!!! highly recommend!!", 
            "i ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>. it hit the spot. i like their food. i wish their portions were smaller. i have to share because i can't possibly eat that much.", 
            "being the billionth person to review this place, what could i say that hasn't already been said? how about praise for the terrific service? i got into vegas late and hungry,  walked over to hash house around midnight, and sat at the bar. the bartender/server's name was fonda, and she treated my half-awake, bewildered self as if i were the customer she had been waiting to see all day. she made me a blt bloody mary in no time flat, and it was great-- and so generous with the alcohol that it scared me a little. \n\ni ordered the famous <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> that everyone on yelp said were fantastic. i am here to tell you, everyone on yelp is telling the truth. it's delicious-- like, the kind of delicious where you try to commit the flavors to memory so you can attempt to vaguely duplicate it at home. two people can easily share this meal. both fonda and another (male) server were very attentive without being overbearing, and i felt very appreciative to feel so welcomed as soon as i arrived in las vegas. and this place is really perfect for vegas: mom's home cooking, but larger than life and more luxurious!\n\nthe place is cute. it was a little confusing to find at first, but it's upstairs in the quad, right next to the linq. if you are in the flamingo and walk out <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> that leads to the linq, it's more or less directly across the path. you just have to go into the building and follow the escalators upstairs.", 
            "we went for brunch and there was a wait, but the host staff got us seated very quickly. \n\nout group mostly had the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and one got the meatloaf sandwich. the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles is a must, you could probably split it between 3-4 people. the flavors go together very well and the price is very reasonable. the meatloaf sandwich was outstanding. \n\nour food did take a while to come out; however, it was appreciated that our server let us know ahead of time that it would be use everything was made from scratch and there were no heat lamps. \n\ndefinitely a great place to go to nurse your hangover!", 
            "got the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, which was highly recommended here on yelp and was featured on man vs. food and boy it did not fail to deliver! soo delicious - wish i could have eaten it all, but sadly there was just so much food and there was no fridge or microwave in our hotel. :( the giant serving comes with a huge piece of <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breast with egg, tomato, bacon, spinach, <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> all topped with a slightly spicy house bechamel sauce. if you get it to go, the sauce comes on the side, which is a nice touch and allowed me to adjust the amount of sauce i wanted (so you might want to ask for it on the side as well judging by how much sauce comes on it otherwise). the only thing i wish was that sage flavor on the chicken came through a little more. not too pricey given the portion size. i came here around 7 am on a saturday so it was not very full (there were maybe 4 parties are so sitting). my take out order came out in less than 10 minutes, which was certainly impressive. the restaurant is pretty small overall though so i can see how it gets insanely packed. my advice, come early. you won't regret it.", 
            "was told by many to try hash house. walked into the restuarant. i wasn't that impressed thought it just looked like any other place. but it didn't dissappoint. awesome bloody mary & the vanilla dipped <mark>French Toast</mark> wow i need to figure out how to make it this good at home. tried a bite of my friend's waffles & <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> mind blowing. if your are ever near one it's worth it.", 
            "definitely the place to go for breakfast when in vegas. portion sizes are huge. shared the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and still we had left overs. we both ordered oj and we could have shared those as well. biscuits with the meal were really good as well as the crust on the chicken! based on other reviews will have to go back and try the chicken and waffles.", 
            "if you want to gorge yourself on a shitton of food, then this hhagg is your place.\nlocated inside a maze of a hotel (i'll give them the fact that they're remodeling) we are seated in a strange room of booths. the interior is dim and uninviting.\n\nour waiter was alright, but seemed a bit frazzled. he kept repeating the items i was ordering with different names than what i was reading off the menu. he also gave an air of irritation because i was just listing off the orders for everyone at the table.\n\nthis place is the perfect example of quantity over quality.\n\nalthough the food wasn't bad, it wasn't stellar and definitely not food that i'd recommend to others or return for. sometimes having two huge heaping mounds of <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> on giant biscuits <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> is just too much. even when shared amongst two people.\n\nthe <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was moist, but lacking in flavor. there was nothing special about the dish. i didn't taste any sage, the syrup was regular ole maple syrup. \n\nthe style of hash was boring. shredded dry meat. potato cubes. it didn't hit the spot at all. and the gigantic looming biscuit was dry and brittle and really just a sponge to soak up any grease.\n\nfor our party of 7, we were seated within 10 minutes on a saturday morning around 9am.\n\nmaybe other locations in the chain are better, but this one i will not be returning to.", 
            "this restaurant is located on the 2nd floor of the quad. they're open 24hrs so if it's late in the night, this is one of the options you have. decor is rustic with a lot of farming decorations.\n\nour order:\n<mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>: ($16.99) <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> w/ fresh spinach, <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs served on a fresh split biscuit with griddled <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>\n<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> tower: ($17.50) <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> stacked w/ <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>, hot maple caramel reduction and crowned with fried leeks\nkiwi watermelon lemonade: $5.50\niced pistachio mocha: $6.99\n\nwarning: portions here are huge!! it wasn't on man vs. food for a reason! i totally forgot how large the dishes are here and ordered too much as we were starving. first thing that came out of my mouth as it was placed in front of us, \"omg. what did we just do?!\" as we were trying to tackle the dishes, we were watching other tables make the same mistake as we did and to hear their gasps were hilarious. we and most of the tables around us had to take the remainder of our orders to go. you have been warned!\n\ni wasn't a fan of the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> that they're so famous for as i didn't really taste the sage and the batter was really thick. since the chicken is covered in sauces, it's not going to be crispy so it's basically a bunch of mush when you dig into it. i had ordered the waffle tower and was surprised that the bacon was actually inside the waffle! i thought it would be layered between the waffles or bits sprinkled around.. but nope! very nicely toasted so it had the slight crunch that i enjoy in my waffles (but still soft and airy on the inside). i also liked the biscuit in the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> as it was quite flavorful, soft, and slightly crumbly. both dishes were merely ok in their entirety though.\n\nin the iced pistachio mocha, you're able to taste the pistachio but since i love the flavor, i would've liked it if it was stronger. it's mostly a sweet drink though so wouldn't say it's strong in the caffeine department. \n\nwhat i'd definitely would come back for is the kiwi watermelon lemonade. it's so refreshing and sounds like a weird combination, but it's so good! i had the non-alcoholic version but next time i'll try their alcoholic one (if it's not too early in the day though).\n\nthe waitress that assisted us was cheery and friendly. we came here on a friday afternoon around 2pm so it wasn't very crowded. fairly easy to flag someone down when we needed something.\n\nhaving tried their famous dishes, i wouldn't order them again as there are so many other options to try. hopefully i'll remember to share a dish the next time i come though!", 
            "we had a group of 15 for dinner!! the service was great with good banter and very helpful staff. \n\nthe meals are hugeeeeeeeeee i'm not exaggerating.  huge! my husband and i shared the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. we couldn't even finish it.  it was super tasty though! and it was so good even though we were stuffed we kept eating it. \n\nhighly recommend the cheese mash.... holy crap it's good.\n\nthe meatballs are sooooo flavourful. but if you want to challenge your friend to something they could never finish (like we did for a laugh)  the chicken and waffles are soooooooooooo big. god bless him he tried.... poor kid didn't stand a chance.  \n\nall in all it is reasonably priced. every meal i saw could of easily been shared with 2 if not 3 people. service with a smile. good location in the quad hotel.", 
            "there were a few things on my \"vegas\" bucket list, and this was one of them.  i was so excited...so it may boil down to i had a high expectation.  and truly, i vacillated between a 3 and 4*\n\n1)  there is always and hour or more wait, and there are no light up thingies to let you know - so you either go and make the res, then gamble and come back - or you sit outside on your phone in the wait area.\n2)  the food is touted on man v. food (the special i chose), new york times, and abc's nightline - but i think everyone brings their a-game for those folks...know whatta i mean?\n3)  it's pretty small - hence the wait.\n\ni ordered the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> style:  layered:  red skin <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, a large split homemade biscuit, soft style scrambled eggs, bacon, a chicken <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breast (andy sage style), fresh spinach, tomatoes, and topped with mozzarella (mine was burnt), and chipotle sauce.  what i learned is that you must cut through all the layers and attempt to form \"the perfect bite.\"  the first few of these were 1) unsuccessful 2) extremely delicious.  at this point, it began to turn into a huge pile of chipotle sogged biscuit, through which you dig to find nuggets of chicken <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, spinach, or bacon.  (my suggestion is to make a dish with those three and keep the chipotle on the side).  within minutes of eating a little less than half, i was very ill.  now, this could only be the food, and not the 17 or so vodka tonics from the night before...or the bloody mary i had while waiting.  be warned. \n\nmy companions had various versions of: flank steak, chunk hash browns, various veggies, and biscuit - and it all looked really messy and unappealing.  one friend had the bblt (just add bacon to bacon), which comes on huge texas toast, and she added a medium fried egg on the side.  that looked really good.  the service was outstanding and the time at the table, and getting out was pleasant, unrushed, and memorable (there were 7 of us).\n\nall in all, i'm so glad i had the experience, but i won't go through this kind of trouble for that kind of meal again.", 
            "we arrived around 9 am with a 15 min wait, the service is slow however it is we'll worth the wait. we ordered <mark>The Tractor Driver Combo</mark> which is a great amount of food, the waffles are large and fluffy, the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> are plentiful, however, the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> are the speciality. i would highly recommend at least one person in our party to order those items!! it's a must go go !!", 
            "located inside the quad hotel, it can be a little difficult to find, but it is so worth the search. after hearing that the portions here were pretty generous, we were hesitant about whether to order two separate dishes or split one between the two of us. \nwe ended up ordering <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> ($14.99), a plate that contained all of the food groups i can think of. a delicious concoction of crispy, double-<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with their delicious hash browns, a kick of chipotle with a biscuit, this plate can be easily shared by a very hungry couple.\nthe service was fantastic - our server billy was sincere, funny and attentive, showing us what true american hospitality is about.\ni highly recommended this gem of a brunch spot if you're in vegas - skip the pricey hotel buffet and get a fresh and delicious dish here. the coffee is small at $3 here, but it's super fresh with bottomless refills.", 
            "one of those places where there's a line to put your name on the waitlist - crazy! make sure you're not in a rush when you come here otherwise you won't be in a good mood to eat! put your name on the list then go enjoy the casino but make sure to come back a little early because i think they quote their wait time a little longer.\n\nmy friend and i split the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. i'm a sucker for all eggs benedict dishes. however, it's not a benedict because the eggs aren't poached, but the scrambled eggs were pretty good! it was a huge <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> w/ fresh spinach, bacon, tomato, mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs served on a biscuit with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>. i wasn't able to finish my half of the meal it was so large! \n\ni wasn't blown away by the taste of the food, but the size was pretty enormous. i'll be back to try their <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & Waffles</mark> next time!",

            "over hyped. there i said it. don't be hating, i just wasn't blown away and after seeing words like ''amazing'', ''exceptional'' and ''spectacular'' appearing in so many reviews i did expect more than the very average tasting chicken and waffles i had. ok, portions are huge but that is the exact reason why america has an obesity problem. half the portions, increase the quality and you're onto a winner hash house.\n\nlocated inside the quad this place is a bitch to find. it's on the 2nd floor and accessible from an escalator in a dark corner of the ground floor, you really have to be paying attention to the signs and directions.\nonce inside the place is large and the staff inviting. the menu consists of breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner with your usual american fare. knowing from the yelp pictures before we came the portions were big we decided to order just one entree to share and see how we go with that before ordering more.\n\n- <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles.

            "what a fun and unique spot for a late night breakfast!  there is a ton of construction on the quad in this area, so it can be a little confusing to find this upstairs eatery, but well worth it!  be aware that the portions are huge!  in hindsight, definitely would have shared.    they also have a full bar, which is always a nice touch.  our waitress was the sweetest and very patient, with one very intoxicated person in our group  clearly, not her first rodeo!\n\ni ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict (as seen on man vs. food), it was a beast and so so delicious...seriously the size of a loaf of bread filled with eggs, sauce, potatoes and crispy chicken- unbelievable!  the interesting twists they put on traditional breakfast items, is worth the trip alone.  prizes were reasonable considering it's a touristy area!", 
            "hash house a go go, a place to train if you want to get into competitive eating!\n\nmy cousin and i decided to walk from our hotel to hash house a go go. since this place had a reputation of serving large portions, we had to build our appetites. it was about a twenty minute walk from treasure island in the triple digit heat of vegas. no sauna suit needed!\n\nwhen we arrived, the waiting area was packed! those who were waiting for a table made use of the mini-bar by the host stand. the mini-bar served their famous bloody marys and screwdrivers, for a price. as i went to put my name down for a table, the wait was estimated for a thirty to forty-five minute wait. since we were famished, we were lucky enough to find seating at the bar.\n\nonce we sat at the bar our server/bar tender, jeanette, assisted us. she took our drink orders and i chose to get a screwdriver. after placing our drink orders, we started browsing through our menus. everything looked good on the menu, but due to stomach limitations, we ordered the following:\n\n- <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles that include, two <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breasts with hardwood smoked <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> tower, hot maple reduction and fried leeks\n\n- farm benedict with <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> with market yellow tomato, spinach, bbq cream and topped with scrambled eggs.\n\nthe screwdriver was pretty strong for my empty stomach and gave me a light buzz. as our food was brought to us, the medley of \"ain't no mountain high enough\", was playing in my head. these portions were ginormous! to make sure we experienced the best dining experience at hash house a go go, we switched off on eating our dishes. the tenderloin and <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> were both crispy. the waffles with the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> were kind of soggy due to the oil of the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>. the gravy, scrambled eggs, <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, and biscuits were a great blend of must have breakfast items.\n\nthese monstrosities destroyed our hunger pangs! the service from our server/bar tender jeanette was great! my first time here was a great experience.",

            "went here with a couple friends after hearing rave reviewsfrom a few sources. i got the #1 scramble and my friends got a buttermilkl pancake and the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles.  none of us were happy with our food.  the scramble came with fried potatoes and a buttermilk biscuit.  the potatoes were cooked well but, like most of the food we received, was bland.  the biscuit was somewhat dry and had no butter, gravy, or even jam. the scramble itself was quite runny wich was very odd and still fairly bland.  \nmy friend's waffles had bacon in then and were ok. the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> however had a heavy sage smell which overpowered everything else about it. had no flavor beyond that. \nthe pancake my other friend got was just a big pancake. nothing special.  the portions were large or average with bare minimal to no condiments (butter, jam, maple syrup).\ni do not recommend this place and will not be returning.",

            "yum! hash house a go go is definitely worth waiting for!! even though there is always a giant line, we are always seated in a decent time frame (once for just two of us, which is much easier, but the second time with seven of us - which i considered a miracle that we were seated in just over a half hour). \n\nhuge huge portions. my husband and i split the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> and still didn't finish it!! i even had to leave <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, my favorite thing on earth, on the plate because there was no more i could do without exploding! everything on the plate was giant but still super tasty and well made. i feel like places with huge portions always have middling food, but hash house definitely doesn't compromise flavor for size!! \n\nmy husband got a crazy overflowing giant coffee drink. it was good, but i preferred my grapefruit mimosa. they have lots of different juices you can order for your mimosa, so that is definitely a plus! one of our friends was concerned that his breakfast only came with one pancake... once it came out he was concerned that his breakfast came with a whole pancake. those things are not only giant, but thick and super filling (i don't think he made it through even half of it!). the pumpkin pancake that another friend got was amazing! so delicious. \n\ndefinitely make time for this breakfast. it is great if you are hungover, and if you aren't, you can order a drink while waiting. if you can split with someone, though, i highly recommend it - for your own safety!",

            "pretty great food. i can see being a local, getting one meal here and taking home enough for at least one more meal. my pumpkin pancake was wonderful. it took up the entire plate. i ate about half of it. the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> dish with the chipotle sauce was great, the sauce tasted bland at first then just a minor bit of heat followed and made it really nice. all the food was great. service was hit and miss. like any big place you have multiple workers coming to your table. we also saw other workers who were really personable. the server for our table was at times testy, maybe is the best word. at times he was really good, at other times he acted like he couldn't be bothered. all and all very glad we went here. \nmy best advice? bring lots of people and order 1/2 that number of meals.", 
            "there isn't a bad thing to say about this place. the place was packed and the wait was only 30 minutes which is great, and the service was fantastic. we shared the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and still couldn't finish it. the portions are huge and price is fantastic. it's a must try! i will be back!",

            "long wait at 1pm was offset by the fantastic bloody marys! olives were super tasty. once we were seated, we were able to order about 10 minutes later. out came huge portions about 4 times the size of your stomach.  we ordered the <mark><mark>Roasted Chicken</mark></mark> hash and the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash. we both did not really enjoy the hash, my chicken was fatty and a bit dry. the biscuit was amazing though!  that's all i ate and ordered a side of sausage gravy to go with it. do yourself a favor and order the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, it looked awesome, and get biscuits with gravy!", 
            "i was excited to try the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles but i couldn't justify ordering such a ridiculous amount of food. i wasn't in the mood for a burger but opted for the baby burger thinking it was a more appropriate amount of food. that wasn't the case. it was also served dry. i wanted to order the same breakfast potatoes with my burger that my friend ordered with her meal but was told i couldn't. i settled for bacon & cheese <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> instead. we wanted bloody beers but were told we couldn't get those either. strange because they serve both beer and bloody mary's. our server came off as friendly but then seemed somewhat annoyed and put out when i asked her questions. also strange since she said we were her first customers of the day. overall, i might go back. but only if i was sharing a meal with at least 1 more person because the meal sizes were just too enormous. a fresh baked biscuit with butter & their fresh strawberry jam with a cup of coffee would've been a better choice.",

            "i have to start by saying that it isn't actually opened 24 hours a day (at least not during the winter) which i learned the hard way after trying to go here at 4am after a legendary vegas night out. \n\nluckily i went here prior to the failed attempt mentioned above and this place was all that i had imagined during my extensive research prior to visiting. the experience starts with the super sweet, almost overly accommodating host (whose name i can't remember). we tried to get a table for 8 but couldn't because there were only four of us present which was a little irritating but also understandable. he told us we could either wait for the others before we were seated or get seated and then move to a larger table once they came. we opted to be seated and figured we could just be separate because the others were only planning on drinking anyway. \n\nthe drink that i got (champagne cocktail of some sort) was ok but nothing noteworthy. my friends had some of the other cocktails (one blue one and one with watermelon) and they raved about them. three of us ordered the chicken and waffles which was definitely a mistake because one order could have fed us all! ok, maybe not three people but it definitely could have fed two people with moderate appetites especially if you got something else like we did. i guess it's not the waiter's job to tell you that you're ordering twice the amount you need nor do i know if they would have allowed us to split it but i do wish the option was there. the food was absolutely amazing though! the chicken was super crispy like i like and the waffles were sweet and the bacon added to the taste. my friends ordered <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and they were good too. the next day one of my friends went back and ordered the signature <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> and said it was amazing as well but also too much for one person.\n\ni'd definitely suggest hash house if you're in the area\n.", 
            "was in vegas for just 1 night to get out and just hang out. and ended up going here to hash house. \nlet's start out by saying that i ordered probably one of the best options on the menu which was the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles, which were sooooo good! 2 big ol' pieces of chicken and about 4 waffles piled up.my buddy ordered the 2nd most popular dish which is the eggs benedict which was a giant mountain. now talking about portions let me move on to my first point portion size...now,  if you are all about going out to eat and love to share with your significant other or just anyone in general, well this is the perfect place for that. the portion size is huge!!! and is hard for any 1 person to eat their whole plate in one sitting. i was sitting there eating for a while and looked like i barely made a dent in any of my dish.\noh and they are also open 24/7, and so with only being there for the night we went there 2 times, once at about 7:30 pm and then again at about 2 am and got food to go and went back up to our room.\n\ni now see why this place has so many reviews and 4 stars! it was very worth it! the only no good thing is that the bathroom is not in the restaurant, it's down the escalator and around the corner in the casino.", 
            "the best breakfast i have had in my entire life. i had the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict and i was amazed at how good the chicken was perfectly fried and moist and how awesome the entire plate was. if your in vegas this is a must if you don't just don't bother living anymore!", 
            "this place is amazing with the pricing(compare to other vegas restaurants) and the portion! great for everyone but especially those who lost a lot of money in the casino and does not want macdonald or white castle as their meal. this is also good for people who wants to eat a lot and those who are really drunk (good food to have in the stomach for those nights)\n\nmy wife and i saw the reviews on yelp and everyone says that one plate can feed 2 people!!! they are correct!!! as the waiters are bringing out food for other patrons in the restaurant.. all of them were enormous. my wife and i would just laugh at the peoples reaction who ordered one entree for each person. \n\nmy wife and i ordered the popular <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breast ($19.99?) and the all blue crab cake pasta & salad (10.99?)  for dinner. both were very delicious! see the picture of food.. (the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breast meal is taller than the 24 oz cup of water)!! the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> comes with 2 large chicken breasts and 4 pieces of bacon fused waffles. as a tip, you can ask for extra syrup as the one tiny cup did not fulfill our needs. we had a tough time chowing it all down, but we did it. \n\ni would come back here again next time visiting vegas if i want to stuff myself up.", 
            "i had been wanting to try this place for a long time. we struggled with the hour+ wait to eat, but made it through. and it was worth it.\n\nwe ordered a lot, even though we were very aware of large portions this place was famous for. we just wanted to try everything. \n\nmy boyfriend had the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> and a side of pancake. the pancake was monstrous! biggest i've ever seen anywhere!\nhe liked his food, but wasn't as big of a fan as i was.\n\ni got this salmon scramble concoction with potatoes. i also got the famous <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark>. both were cooked perfectly and had so much flavor to them. the waffles were still sweet and buttery and the bacon only accented the flavor. the chicken was crispy in just the way you want it but super juicy on the inside. the salmon scramble had an interesting taste, different, but super good and rich.\n\nour server was also very nice. they were very busy so we had to wait a while for our food even once we got to the table, but we kind of expected that.\n\nmy only disappointment is that we couldn't bring the leftovers with us on the airplane.",

            "last weekend i was in vegas for an auction.   it was a whirlwind stay and i honestly didn't do or see very much.  i did get up a little early and had the desire to find myself the best breakfast, a breakfast away from all the commotion of the strip.   so i asked yelp for some guidance.  typed in \"best breakfast\"  up popped hash house a go-go. nope in a casino/hotel on the strip.  try again... typed in \"best eggs\"  again hash house, again i wouldn't accept that.  it happened over and over, no matter what breakfast item i search up would pop this same damn restaurant!  eventually i relinquished and took it as a sign.    glad that i did. \n\nas i was walking out of my own hotel (luxor) i passed the breakfast restaurant with three people inside.   it was early, 8:40am.   nobody gets up at that time of the morning in vegas so i was golden to get a good table, or so i thought.   \n\ni parked and did the 13 minute walk through the casino to find the restaurant.   things were pretty quiet.  found the little staircase that take you up to hash house and omg there were at least 125 people all waiting in line!!!!  damn, i wasn't going to have time. i realized then i might be on to something special.  fortunately i found the counter with an empty seat, felt pretty smug.   the guy next to me was there for hangover food, boy did he seem to need it.   \n\nthe menu is extensive and everything looked wonderful.  i decided to order the hash, they have quite a selection i went with the meatloaf hash.    as i was waiting for my food the people sitting around me started getting theirs.  first the guy three seats over.  he had chicken n waffles.  it was piled a foot high!  no exaggeration,  a freakin foot high!    next the drunkie next to me... a massive plate of pancakes with plantains on it, kind of looked like bananas foster.  his gf had the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, crap it was as big as the chicken and waffles plate.   looked delicious too.   \n\nwhen my skillet arrived it wasn't your denny's skillet.  i was more like a paul bunyan skillet.   i took a photo but really should have set a medium sized palm tree next it for scale.   the meatloaf was excellent and i think with a great deal of effort i was able to eat about half.    \n\ni am glad that i went and would most certainly go again.   i heard they have one or two other locations in vegas so i would probably try to find something off of the strip though.", 
            "the sage-<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> bomb with fried leeks is one of the best things i've eaten on earth. it's the most decadent, delicious, over-the-top, quintessentially vegas thing you could imagine. no hangover would stand a chance against it. it took me almost a full day to recover from it. and i may have gone temporarily diabetic from it. all good. first place i'd go to next time i hit vegas. it's when you find the bacon in the waffle after a couple bites of the perfect <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> that you realize you're high on food and that there might be a god. and he likes eating.\n\nonly drawback is it's kinda hidden, in the second floor of a casino and has no windows or a view, feels a little too boxed in. still not enough to even diminish the score.", 
            "ok after having been a hhagg fan for some time now, my last reviews to other locations had let me down and i had vowed to never return.  well, this weekend i am glad that we tried this location because they truly redeemed hhagg for for us.\nthe food (<mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, of course) was absolutely amazing. the service was outstanding, everyone here was really busting their butts, yet everyone was in a great mood and very friendly.\nmy only complaint of this location is the ventilation, i know that it is in a casino but the cigarette smoke is pretty bad.  kind of makes it hard to enjoy the wonderful food.  :-(", 
            "the portions here are too crazy. they serve giant portions that are surprisingly super flavorful. \n\nit was a pretty long wait but worth the experience. \n\ni came here with my grandma and fiance; fiance had a plain pancake (didn't even need syrup, it was so good just by itself), grandma had the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> & hash, and i had the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and biscuits. \n\nit was all so good.",

            "been here a couple of times. the first time i ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> salad and it was really good, only i felt bad that there was so much food and i barely made a dent in my plate. the salad could easily feed a starving family. \nthis last time i opted for the breakfast scramble, 3 jumbo eggs with cheese, avocado, onion accompanied with house potatoes and a jumbo rosemary biscuit. i thought my breakfast was just okay, the avocado in my scramble was oxidized and mushy so i wasn't too pleased with that. the eggs were not cooked as well as i would have liked them.  again, the plate was huge and i didn't finish it, i'm sure 2 hungry adults could have shared this breakfast.\nthe wait wasn't too long, we only waited 20 minutes to be seated. the dining room is fairly huge so they can get you in and out. service was nothing spectacular, just people working to work. the drinks are expensive here. for my breakfast and a mimosa i payed about $20-$25.",

            "don't think you can finish a dish by yourself unless you're that guy from man v. food.  the serving sizes here are huuuge, unless you stick to side orders. \n\non a monday morning at 11am, our group of 4 waited about 45 minutes.  this restaurant is located inside the linq hotel (formerly imperial palace).  this place is massive as we walked through several rooms just to get to our seats. \n\nwe started off with blt bloody marys which were awesome!  i had to order the chicken and waffles since the display always looks so ridiculous in everyone's pictures.  it comes with 4 waffles (!!!) topped with <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>.  my boyfriend was smart went with the basic: two eggs, country potatoes, sausage, fruit, and biscuit.   although it is very simple, you still get a lot but not as monstrous as the rest of their meals.  my friend ordered the salmon benedicts which came out as a mountain.  she didn't even eat a fourth. \n\nquality of the food wasn't anything too fantastic, but the service was great.  i'm not sure if i would return, but if i ever do, i'll be sure to share my meal with someone else!", 
            "i don't have too much to add as other reviews have pretty much hit the spot. this place is alright. not the best breakfast ever, but decent. but it's disappointing because the menu looks so good! but it comes in as just decent.\n\nfood: huge, huge portions. my husband and i split an order <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. we still didn't finish it. it's definitely good for 3-4 people. he also got a side order of biscuits & gravy. being from the south, he said the gravy was terrible & tasted burnt and didn't end up touching it the rest of the meal. the biscuits on both of the plates were unseasoned, bland, floury. i got a side order of the crispy potatoes, which i used to replace the mash & biscuit on the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. those were delicious.\n\nservice: we got there not too early on a thursday morning. maybe just around 8am. we got seated almost immediately. service was friendly (nothing special), but definitely very slow. when we left there was a huge line of people waiting.\n\noverall, i don't think it's worth it if you have to wait more than 15 minutes since service is already slow and it is damn pricey (but on par with the rest of vegas). if you do decide to eat here, beware of the portions. for the price, you should really just aim to split and if you're craving something else, get a side order instead of a separate meal.", 
            "went here based on a recommendation from a friend and the yelp reviews.    i ate at the linq casino location and made reservations ahead of time so i didn't have a wait.  of course i ordered the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> and was not disappointed.  we also ordered the strawberry lemonade and fries.  i didn't care for the lemonade but the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> was amazeballs and by far the best fries anywhere.  the chicken benny was a crazy concoction of biscuits, <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, scrambled eggs (which were not a good addition), melted cheese, tomatoes, some spinach thrown in for good measure and a spicy (not hot, just a nice warmth) benedict sauce.  my chicken was a tad overcooked so it was a bit like jerky on parts of it.  \n\nok so my biggest issue with this place was my server.  he was great and very attentive, but he was a complete meth head.  obviously he had been up too many days because we could not even understand the words coming out of his mouth and his eyes were darting all over the place.  my 11 year old was like \"what's wrong with this guy\".  it was completely obvious he was on drugs so i'm not sure why they let the guy stay for his shift, they were not even that busy.  i opted not to talk to management because my daughter was with me and the guy seemed nice.",

            "i visited for brunch on a saturday during a girls trip to vegas recently. the wait was quite long, over an hour i believe, but once we sat, service was quick and friendly. \n\nwe all had bloody mary's, which were really tasty and the spice level was perfect. we ordered and shared three dishes- chicken and waffles, the salmon 'benedict' and <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> 'benedict.' each dish was massive... i'm not exaggerating, no one human should consume all of this food unless you're literally starving! my favorite was the chicken and waffles, the waffle was really tasty and the bacon infused syrup was amazing. on the other hand, my chicken 'benedict' was a bit of a disappointment. i found absolutely nothing wrong with it, but it was't a benedict ( it was <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> onto of a huge biscuit <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>) and it was very one-note. especially given the size, i found it hard to even make a dent in it due to the bland nature of all elements. the chicken was ok, but a little dry and did't have any distinct kick. the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> just tasted like a baked potato that had been smashed with no flavor and the biscuit was good, just didn't really add anything to the big pile of blandness. there was a ton of sauce spread on top, i'm not entirely sure what it was, but it seemed like a gravy with some sort of spice added, but that too was surprisingly bland.\n\nthere was definitely the potential for this meal to be great, but there needs to be more flavor.. more textural variation.. a kick! i would rather be given a more reasonable portion and for the dish to have more of a flavor dynamic.",

            "we had a weird experience at this place.  first, i called around lunch time to ask about a dinner reservation for that same night.  the woman on the phone asked me what time and i said 5 to 5:30.  she took my info and said, \"okay, we have you down for 3 people at 5:00 to 5:30 tonight.\"  i just said thanks.  i wasn't too worried as we were eating early and i doubted we'd have to wait anyway.\n\nwhen we show up and i tell the guy at the front that i called earlier and made a reservation, he said, \"i don't think so as we don't take same day reservations.\"  then he checked the book and said, \"oh, here you are,\" and showed us to our table.\n\nwhen our server came to take our drink order, my friend asked for a rum-based cocktail and the server said that they didn't have rum, but that they have vodka cocktails.  we asked for a few more minutes and then asked her to switch the tv channel (the place was pretty empty and we pretty much had a tv to ourselves) to the women's world cup. \n\nafter she left i turned around and looked at the restaurant bar and noticed that they had every spirit under the sun, so my friend went up and talked to the bartender, who easily made her a mai tai.  with rum.\n\nthings perked up after that.  the tv channel was changed so we could watch the soccer game, we all ended up with delicious drinks; and the food was outstanding.  two of us ordered the spaghetti and meatballs.  the meatballs were delicious, but the pasta was a little heavy on the sauce.  otherwise, it was your pretty standard spaghetti and meatballs (though apparently they use a funky pasta that is hollow in the center, which you really couldn't discern while eating it).  my other friend ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> penne pasta and it was outstanding.  the chicken was perfectly cooked and the porcini mushroom cream sauce was to die for (and i hate mushrooms)!\n\nso, all in all, the food was really good, the drinks were good, the service warmed up and we had a good time.",

            "got the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> cause it was one of the waiter's faves and i enjoy a good egg benedict. this is not an egg benedict and shouldn't be called \"benedict\" anything. the egg isn't even runny (idk if it's supposed to be or not here, but it is for normal benedicts). this is basically a pile of carbs with a little bit of meat, little bit of veggies, and a ton of chipotle cream. there was way too much chipotle cream for my liking and it kinda makes me sick to think about it. all i could taste was chipotle cream. it was hard to find and taste my <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>...i mean, shouldn't it be a big part of the dish since it's in the name\n\nalthough most large quantity places don't have the greatest food, i think hh is slightly better than most large quantity type places. i'd give it 3 stars if it didn't make me sick to think about it...", 
            "i love everything about this place.  every time i'm in vegas, i make sure to have breakfast here. yes,  it's typically at least a 30-minute wait,  but the huge portions and delicious food is totally worth it.  a favorite is the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles, but the benedicts  and hashes are also amazing.  you get what you pay for here, and that's what keeps me coming back every year.", 
            "we were staying at the linq it was our first time since they remodeled. we got a really good deal on a room and we wanted some brunch so we came downstairs and there was about a 30 minute wait for the restaurant but i am a platinum total rewards member sooo guess what? no wait! they seated us right away and we bypassed the wait! yes! i ordered their coffee, pumpkin pancake and their <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. which was huge! i loved their food and their portions are crazy which is the fun part. their biscuits are bomb and so is their <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>. a great meal always", 
            "ate here last weekend inside the linx hotel (formerly imperial palace hotel). the portions are insanely large and a single order of any menu item can be shared with your entire table! \nmy boyfriend ordered an eggs benedict but it was not by any means a normal eggs benedict!  he ordered :<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> w/ fresh spinach, <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark>, market tomato, griddled mozzarella, chipotle cream and scrambled eggs. \nsince he ordered that i thought i'd get something a bit lighter and ordered: oatmeal and a side biscuit and gravy..about an hour after we ordered, we got our food. wow!! the portions are massive!! the food was very good but neither of us put a dent in our food because of the size of our meals!\ni gave this place 4stars instead of 5 because of the long wait to get a table and then the very long wait to get our food after we ordered it. our breakfast here took about 21/2-3 hours from when we put our name in until when we left.", 
            "came here last saturday for brunch. ordered the chicken and waffles. best chicken and waffles ever. reasonably priced for the portion size. i wish they had a stand alone <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> dish that came with <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and corn. my only complaint is with the ice water. definitely tasted like it came from a not so clean tap. the food is definitely worth the visit.", 
            "i don't have any complaints about this place. food was perfect. the service was great. drinks were tasty. the price was very generous considering the amount of food they serve. me and my friend split the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> (i posted a picture up) and we were beyond full. two of the dishes the had were on man vs food and he wasn't lying. the dishes were perfect. everyone should visit this place.", 
            "i know you're starving and don't want to wait. suck it up and go win some money while you do! i've been to the one outside of the strip so to find this gem in the linq was a great surprise. it was about an hour wait for 2 (not bad for this restaurant) and i sent my boyfriend off to gamble while i waited. staff was very friendly and while i was bummed we weren't in a super lively part of the restaurant, we didn't go there to socialize. i ordered the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> and he ordered the bbblt. my meal was so amazing! savory, creamy, crunchy, delicious. huge portion that we both ate a lot of and i still managed to take home more than half of it. i didn't try his sandwich and although he said it was really good, he couldn't keep his fork out of my dish. i've had the <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> before too so i highly recommend it as well!", 
            "huge portions. really... we shared <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> and probably had enough leftover for another person. but delicious and well worth the wait. great, friendly service.", 
            "as i was researching breakfast places prior to a vegas trip, hash house a go go came up plenty of times, so we gave it a try for a friday morning breakfast.  they're located on the 2nd floor of the linq, just off the casino floor.  it can get really crowded - we made it over for a (relatively) early breakfast, maybe around 8:30 or so and only had to wait a few minutes before being seated, but on our way out the entrance to the restaurant was packed with people waiting for the next table.\n\n3 of us split the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles and a hash with mushrooms, artichokes, tomatoes and spinach.  the chicken was a little on the dry side by itself, though it was great once the maple syrup was added, and the <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> were delicious.  i really liked the hash too, the ingredients were tasty and the potatoes were cooked perfectly.  portion sizes were huge, the three of us were stuffed, and the total bill came out to just over $30 - not unreasonable for a good breakfast anywhere, and a particularly good deal for a place in the middle of the strip.\n\nhash house a go go was a great place for breakfast - decent food and ginormous serving sizes coupled with good service.  go early or be prepared for a wait, but the food is definitely worth it.", 
            "ov-er-ra-ted! *clap clap, clap clap clap*\n\ni don't remember the dish i got the first time i came to hash house, but i do remember that it had too many different things going on.\n\nthis second time around, adam richman had coerced me via the wonderful world of television, to visit this place again and divulge in the wonders of the \"<mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>.\" oh adam, you deceive me yet again.\n\nit was a very mellow vegas sunday morning. we stayed at the linq so we had all our bags packed, and went downstairs for our breakfast, around 9am. i mean, it's 9am on a sunday in vegas. there couldn't be a wait, could there? behold, the packs of small parties waiting at the top of the escalator, looking annoyed and hungry. our wait wasn't too long, perhaps a good 20-25minutes or so? luckily, we had bags to load up in our car in the hotel parking lot, so we killed time pretty efficiently (go, girls!).\n\nthe three ladies and i were seated in a small and cramped circular table, much too small to occupy 4 large (and must i say, very large) dishes. each one of us ordered a dish; of course, adam had gotten into my head, so i got the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. another friend followed suit, and we also got a steak omelette and <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> hash.\n\n+ <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, famously known as the \"<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>\" somethin somethin. wayyy  too much going on again. the chipotle cream something sauce was too overpowering. my favorite part? the bed of chunky mashed potato at the very bottom of everything. the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was mediocre, and the biscuits were just wayyy too much.\n\n+ steam omelette. one of their weekend specials; probably one of the better dishes of this crowd because of its simplicity.\n\n+ <mark><mark>House Smoked Fresh Salmon</mark></mark> hash. my sister's plate, and to say the very least....she felt like she would've sent it back, if it didn't take so long to get our food already.\n\nall in all, i would much rather go to a different brunch place, for food that is cheaper, and much tastier.", 
            "so good, a must try. we stopped here for breakfast twice on our trip and we were only in town for 3.5 days! that should be an indication of how good this was.\n\nour first stop here, we ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles, <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> benny, and the banana/brown sugar flapjacks. all were delicious, but our second stop here, we just got the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> benny's to share.\n\nthe sauce was just amazing, a little bit of spice and not too creamy. \n\nthe dishes are a bit pricey, at around $18 per plate but the portions are gigantic here, even 2 people struggled to finish one plate. \n\nservice here was excellent as well. we were seating in the same section twice and had the same server. attentive, friendly, informative.. \n\noverall a great experience.", 
            "i really wanted to make sure we ate well in vegas and boyyy did hash house and go go help accomplish that on the breakfast end!! i found this place on google and after so many good yelp reviews i placed it on the \"to eat list\". the hubby and i woke up early friday morning and did our morning stroll of the strip (walking from mandalay all the way to this location to work up our appetite). this location is located in the back of the harrah's hotel which can be confusing because it notes on here that it is near the linq. the wait here on a friday morning at 9am was long! i guess i wasn't the only one that had done my research. i placed our name on the list and was told it would be a 25 to 30 minute wait. the hostess informed each guess that you could purchase a bloody mary while you waited. also, the restaurant doesn't have a bathroom for its patrons, so if you need to go i would suggest going before you eat-- you have to go down the stairs around the corner and through the woods (jk on the woods part) to get to the restroom. finally after waiting we were called and placed at a very nice looking booth. the breakfast menu looked so good the hubby and i didn't know where to start. the menu prices are also very reasonable-- so there is something on here for everyone. my husband ended up ordering the basic meal and the house strawberry shortcake, while i opted to try the famous chicken and waffles, a side of bacon, and a side of eggs. also what's being in vegas without ordering a drink for breakfast!?? i ordered the spiked kiwi watermelon lemonade, which was amazing!!! if i could i would start a lot my mornings with this drink! it took a little while for our food to come out (25 minutes or so) but i gave them the benefit <mark>O'Hare of the Dog</mark> since they had a packed house. my husband enjoyed every bit of his meal. my plate of chicken and waffles was massive. there was no way i was going to be able to finish it on my own. i enjoyed my waffles and chicken but i felt the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> could have been seasoned a little better. my husband really enjoyed his strawberry shortcake as well. our service was really good and when i am back in the vegas area, i will be back to this restaurant!", 
            "who can't love this place? everything they serve is over the top and tastes great. i tend to order the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles each time but i've tried tow or three other items and have never been disappointed. \n\nif you get there when it opens you'll likely have to wait but it's absolutely worth waiting for.",

            "took the escalator upstairs and saw quite a bit of people waiting. we figured it would take almost an hour, but only took about 20 minutes. this place has tons of seating. i got the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> which i thought was pretty tasty. did feel that the biscuit was a little dry. my wife got some <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> which were delicious and <mark>French Toast</mark>. she couldn't finish it because the portions are huge! would go back! our waiter with the tall mohawk was on it. great waiter!",

            "honestly, i am not a breakfast person. never liked pancakes because every time i eat them i feel like i am chewing styrofoamey nothingness that sucks so fucking bad that you must add aunt jemima and butter to it to make them somewhat edible.  \n\nhowever, the dilemma is that my better half loves breakfast and so, we compromise and usually have brunch... with bottomless mimosas and/or bloody mary's  to wash that styrofoam down. so, when we were in vegas recently and she suggested that we eat at hash house a go go (hhagg) at the linq before leaving las vegas like nick cage, i was like, \"of course honey\" because you know, happy wife... yadda yadda yadda. \n\nwhen we showed up at high noon like clueless morons that get shot by stray gunfire at a shootout, we were totally ambushed by the 45-minute wait. we should have thought it through that a lot of people would be grabbing a bite to eat before heading back to their not-so-sinful cities... damn that hangover...  speaking of hangover, if you get to the end of my review, i have a treat for you...\n\nanyways, i gave the server my name and after receiving a plastic laminated number card, we headed out to kill some time by exploring the stores at the linq promenade, which felt a lot like the grove in los angeles sans a trolley and actual worthwhile stores to spend money at. this place looks much better at night, kind of like that girl/guy from drai's or hakkasan that you somehow end up waking up next to. \n\nby the time we got back to hhagg, we waited another 5 minutes and then our number was called. then they do this weird fucking thing where they make you stand on a red rug in the middle of the restaurant. all i can say is that, it was weird just standing there. \n\nafter a few minutes we were seated and our awesome hipster-bearded server, andrew, served us. we ended up sharing the most popular dish that was purported to be a new york times favorite on the menu... the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles. \n\nlet me repeat - we shared this shit. \n\nthis thing was humongous. it came with two jurassic-sized <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breasts with waffles that had <mark>Hardwood Smoked Bacon</mark> cooked into them that was then topped with a hot maple reduction, and fried leeks... all this stuff was stacked into a giant tower that was all skewered together with a rosemary spear and a freaking steak knife. \n\ntruly amazing... all for less than $20! we ended up getting the tractor iced coffee for around $3 and this was always refilled promptly by andrew and he even gave us a to-go cup for our 4th helping of iced coffee when we were leaving. \n\ni've had chicken and waffles elsewhere. i've done the fancy at bouchon and of course the not-so-fancy at roscoe's. but honestly, i have never enjoyed chicken and waffles to the point that i literally sounded like i was having an orgasm as i ate and after i ate because i was moaning so much from the tasty food and from being so full. oooooh! ohhhhhhhhhh! oh gawd! \n\neverything was tasty. the batter of the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was perfect and adding bacon to the waffles made a world of a difference. and the leeks! holy smokes were they fucking delicious!\n\nlook, people that give hhagg a bad review are \"hhaggs\" that ended up not getting the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles. stick to what they are good at. that is like going to lawry's prime rib and complaining that their spinning salad sucks. of course it's going to fucking suck dipshit, that's why they spin it. \n\nlook, this place is open 24/7 so take a break from drinking, macking, gambling, bringing-your-homies-down-because-you-lost-all-your-wages-on-the-1st-night-like-a-chump-and-got-a-cash-advance-from-your-credt-card-with-28%-interest, and/or sucking-your-gut-in... and just go-go to hash house a go go. it will be the best decision you make. just anticipate a wait if you go during peak hours.\n\n* so i referenced the hangover earlier... the following is a true story. i went to the roscoe's chicken & waffles in south los angeles off manchester and a brother came up to me and literally said, \"hey i saw your hairy ass penis in that movie! too-da-loooooo...\"  damn that ken jeong. damn you!", 
            "i came here with high hopes after reading all of the great reviews.\n\ni ordered the hash house famous big o' <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> salad. i don't understand what makes it so \"famous.\" the portion was gigantic. great value, but it was lacking in flavor. it left much to be desired. also, there were old, soggy pieces of lettuce included in my salad. couldn't the kitchen at least pick these pieces out? i picked them out and continued to eat anyway.  i left feeling very full, but not satisfied. my date ordered the mushroom and swiss burger, and again, the portion was huge, but when i asked him how his meal was, he said it was just an ok burger. i might return, and if i do, i'll give breakfast a try.  \n\nno wait to be seated. service was great. but let's be real, it all comes down to the food. i'm a local and feel kinda disappointed, as i was hoping hash house would become a go-to. i think not.", 
            "had my first <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles ($17.50) so good! the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was delicious: extra crispy yet so moist. i recommend breaking down the tower when it comes to the table (after taking a photo to savor it for later) to prevent the bottom two <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> from getting all soggy. also, if you go make sure to bring a friend or two. no matter what you order, there's enough to feed 2-3 people...unless you're a polynesian linebacker :d\n\nwhen you get there, be prepared to wait. they have some interesting things to look at and they have wifi, but seating is at a limited supply. also, use the bathroom before you go up the stairs...i don't think they have one up there.",

            "wow. i got take out from here at end of june and it was super busy on friday morning at 11:30am. my friends and i originally had an 11am reservation during a bachelorette weekend but due to conflicting arrival schedules and dead phone batteries, we weren't able to make it and they couldn't confirm seats at noon. a few of us decided to take the monorail over to the linq and see what was so great about hash house. welp, they don't call the meals massive for nothing! the bride to be placed our orders at the front and the employee was super understanding when we realized the online yelp menu is a bit outdated and some items aren't offered anymore. \n\ni ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles. o.m.g. how could an ordinary chicken breast be so perfectly crisp and flavorful outside but be so dang juicy on the inside?! it was so good i picked up the whole piece and just bit right into it! and this is coming from a girl that removes the skin from her chicken. the fried pieces of sage weren't that bad either. not sure if i could actually eat those but i lived. when i first got my order i thought they gave me a pizza instead because it's a box of that size. huge. 2 white meat pieces and oh! almost forgot about the four waffle squares sliced with whole bacon stuffed in it. didn't care much for the bacon and the waffles got kind of soggy but they tasted like buttermilk. \n\nnot sure what everyone else ordered so i can't comment on other items. to go orders (in person only, no phone orders) take around 40 minutes to prepare when it's busy so it's convenient to go back down the escalator you came up from and explore the casino, grab some coffee from nook cafe, or maybe something stronger from purple zebra. whatever floats your boat.", 
            "get the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>!!! was cooked sooo well. the food is massive and recommended to split in my mind. not a biscuit fan and everything seems to come with one. in my opinion they were very dry, skip it of you can. the wait was long on a friday morning but they work their butts off and get people in and out without being rude.",

            "i tried this place out because of a good recommendation from my brother. \n\n\nthe only thing that was great about this place was that it came in big portions... and... thats pretty much it. \n\ni had the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> in penne pasta. the chicken was pretty much flavorless. i could not taste the sage flavor or even the chicken flavor in this <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>. the penne pasta was just a bland cream sauce that was nothing special. \n\nmy dad had the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash and he said that his food was flavorless. we saw that everyone else was taking their food home because they thought it was good however, we thought... no need to take some flavorless food home. \n\ni would have to say that the only thing that brings this restaurant to 3 stars was their cucumber dressing on one of their salads with the polenta croutons and their honey coated biscuits. that was enough for a meal in my opinion. no need for the entree :)", 
            "this was one of the best meals i had while in las vegas, and believe me, i ate a lot! \nthis is a southern, down home style of cooking. they're open 24/7, and were able to serve us quickly and efficiently at 4am. \nthe food was presented in a beautiful manner, with fresh rosemary and thyme poking out of the food. the food came quickly, and was hot, and there was plenty of it. \nthe decor was interesting. sort of a 70's style steakhouse with all the celebrities who ate there  tacked up by the entrance. \nthe service was friendly and efficient. they wished me \"good luck\" when i ordered the house specialty. the prices were a bit higher than what i'm used to paying for down home cooking, but for the portions, it was actually a good deal. i challenge anyone to walk away from this place hungry. it can't happen. i got the dish that was featured on man vs food, the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. i didn't see it as that big of a challenge, but it was a lot of food. my buddy got the hamburger, which he raved about. our other buddy ordered some sort of chicken dish, but had to leave suddenly when all the free booze from the casinos caught up with him. we attempted to eat his dish, but we couldn't make it. \nthe food was filling and delicious, and the fresh herbs were certainly appreciated. \nout of the entire trip to vegas, this was probably the culinary highlight of the whole trip. \nit can be a bit difficult to find this place, as it's tucked in the rear of the linq casino, but ask enough slot jockeys, and they'll point you in the right direction. \ni encourage you to check this place out.", 
            "the rosemary <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles. omg. it's tasty. it's huge. nobody finishes it in one sitting (read: share). the sage and rosemary flavor is delish!\n\ni've been to hash house a go go in both sd and vegas and both are great. \n\nman vs food has been here. the meals are all too big to finish, so either plan on boxing up and eating it at 4am when you're done with partying, or just order 1 entree per 2 people. but get the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> waffle.", 
            "this is my second time coming here. the first was when the restaurant was located at the m hotel (i believe). ever since they closed that location i was going crazy trying to figure out where the restaurant went. i just remembered that it was the best <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffle place i've ever had! so i went to linq to finally get my fix and it was not at all what i remembered! the chicken was dry and too much batter.  the waffle was also dry. doughy and heavy and not moist as i remembered. i think opening up a larger location just messed up the quality. or maybe i just got a different chef.  the biscuits was good though. \n\ni'm just so sad bc i had this idea of hash house and now it's all just a dream.", 
            "i had no choice but to try hash house a go go.  my co-worker highly recommended this place and it had pretty good reviews from my yelp friends.  the family and i arrived at noontime on a saturday where we were met by a long wait. we waited along with the masses in the front of the restaurant listening to the woman call out garbled sounding numbers over their pa system until it seemed close to our turn.  when it seemed close to our turn, i had to go up to the front to ask her what number she just called.  tired of seeing my face, they finally called out my number and sat the family and i in the back corner of the restaurant.\n\nwe sat there perusing the menu.  google hangout messages were sent by my friends who told me that i needed order their <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash and their chicken and waffles.  we were all ready to order.  missing was our waiter.  we kept looking at the wait staff, but, none of them stopped at our table.  we didn't know if we had a waiter or a waitress.  then i saw a nicely dressed man getting drinks for a table that was close to ours, and i heard the table behind me grumbling about the waiter not being there to deliver their check so that they could leave.  we were already seated for 20 minutes.  we needed to go home, back to los angeles.  so, i flagged down the nicely dressed man and asked him about our nonexistent waiter.  after a little bit of chit chat, we gave the nicely dressed man our order.  it wasn't until half an hour later that our waiter finally showed up and introduced himself.  too late...your manager had already taken our order.  \n\nthe food was good.  the portions were big and could have been easily shared by two people.  the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash came on a skillet with lots of cheese, <mark>Corned Beef</mark> on top of potatoes, an egg, and a biscuit.  it was good.  even my daughter who doesn't like to eat meat liked it.  the chicken and waffles was impressive.  the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> came in a tower held in place by a knife. the chicken was flavorful and moist.  it was a winner.\n\nthe nicely dressed man, the manager came back to check on us.  like the tables around us, he gave us a 25% discount.  the waiter finally showed up at the end, perhaps he was expecting some kind of tip.  good food, but, nonexistent waiter.  i might've given them more stars if the waiter showed up.", 
            "mouth watering food, fast service, polite servers and nice ambiance and great location!!!\n\nwe arrived in vegas at 2:30 and after checking in at mirage we went to hhgg for midnight breakfast (i.e, around 3 in the morning). the server greeted us very nicely and we were seated right away. the menu had very limited options for late night. we ordered \n-blueberry-pecan flapjacks\n-chocolate waffles\n-<mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & Waffles</mark>\n-indiana <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark>. \n\nthe service was super quick and in no time we were gorging on the food :) the portions were huge and the presentation...ohh my my!!! i loved my pancake which was fluffy and filled with fresh blueberries and also the chocolate waffles which were chocolicious and covered in ice cream!!! the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & Waffles</mark> had safe <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and crispy waffles on the bottom which was little dry for my hubby but taste was great. the <mark>Crispy Hand Hammered Pork Tenderloin</mark> was amazing and had delicious <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> on the side and topped with very thin and crispy onion. the waiter was nice enough to accommodate our second request for choco waffles as quickly as possible. \n\noverall the experience was memorable and i will definitely recommend checking this place out!",

            "from a foodie's perspective, this is a glamourized denny's diner with reason price and enormous portion that is sickening. i've heard about hash a gogo from the travel channel and recommendation from friends. nothing fancy, but quite ghetto there. there's no windows and i fell so contained. my banana latte was generous in size and was decent, but tad too sweet. \n\nthese platters are about 1 feet long by 6 inches that could be shared by 3 people! it's all about quantity over quality. \n\n<mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> - first couple bites were good until you devour more.. the platter has too much sauce going on that it no longer looks appetizing once you start eating it..i mean visually unappetizing with brown tan sauce over the chicken mashed with the herbs...\n\n<mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & Waffles</mark> - chicken is your typical <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, which could be juicier... waffle is your typical average waffle. it's soo enourmous that it covers my head and top part of my 5'4 body frame. it's wayy too much carb. \n\noverall, quality of flavor is quite lacking here...", 
            "this was great!!!  we had the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles; and the stuffed burger.", 
            "regretted this breakfast choice. they are making a name for themselves on the huge portions alone. or at least from the choices we made. my husband had the biscuits and gravy and i chose the adams <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. both were obscene, which don't get me wrong, we were expecting, however, they were missing flavor. they served both dishes on top of dry <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> (about 4 to 5 large potatoes worth of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>). the biscuits for both dishes were also very dry. the chicken was good and i enjoyed the hollandaise sauces (but there definitely wasn't enough sauce to moisten the family size portion of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> on my plate). my husband didn't enjoy his gravy at all and actually was sick afterwards.  the wait was long for a table and the food was slow to come to the table. overall, i really expected a better meal after an hour. next time we'll go back to guy's for his huge but also flavorful breakfast.", 
            "not sure what people were expecting, based on some of these reviews, but we got exactly what we came for. breakfast should be the biggest meal of the day, correct? hash house did not disappoint. okay, it's not easy to find, but if you ask someone in the casino, they'll stop you before you get hash out of your mouth, and get you right there. yes, the casino is smoky. yes, that can drift up to the restaurant. and yeah, it's dark and loud. is ambiance really why you're looking for at breakfast? not me. \nthe food... delicious. i had the save <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>, and it was nothing short of breakfast heaven. advice i received from our server, start from the top. very wise move. the biscuit is thick, and the potatoes are decadent. \nsomehow, the chicken stays crisp, even in that sauce, which by the way is perfect for the dish. even the bacon stays crisp. \ni highly recommend. and if a classic, hearty if not excessive, breakfast is what you crave, this is the spot.", 
            "located in the linq, and having come from the likes of the bellagio and mgm grand we were unprepared for the clouds of smoke, bumpin' music, and drunkenness that we somehow missed at the other hotels. \n\nmy friend got a strange pebble-looking object in her water and my peach tea left an odd taste in my mouth. when we were finally ready to order, i opted for the healthier farm scramble with bacon, avocado, and swiss- though i had my eye on the infamous <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark>. my food was as good as it could be, but my friend's chocolate waffle with ice cream was actually quite good (waffle still crisp after holding ample amounts of ice cream). wish i would have ordered something more exciting but i suspect my 2-hour later stomach would have disagreed.", 
            "i got food poisoning... from their famous <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>. \n\ni've always had good experiences but this has been an awful thanksgiving! i've been sick regretting dinner there. not sure i'll be back. probably not. just be aware!", 
            "travel to vegas on the regular, 45+ days in 2015.  hash house is a go-to spot every time i'm in town. <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> is off the hook, but be careful as your great meal can easily turn into a food coma and cut your day short. \n\n<mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> tips: don't eat the pre-meal biscuit, easy on the drinks, order the meal without the biscuit under the mash potatoes.  once the meal comes, focus on highest taste items first, chicken, veggies, eggs, sauce and so on.  if you can clear most of the plate and only have a pile of mashies left behind . . .  your a boss!   \n\ndo time your meal accordingly, if you cruise there after 9a expect to spend a long time in line. i have been to the hhagg's at linq, rio and across town and personally enjoy the \"off strip\" locations way more.", 
            "maple <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> and <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was so yummy good but need two to split this plate. 4 waffles and two chicken breasts for $18. bloody marys were the bomb.", 
            "had to make a visit here after seeing at least 100 infamous chicken and waffle pictures.  and of course, what else would i get here...chicken and waffles.  but don't be stupid like me and make the biggest two mistakes of my life:\n\n1) drinking fat tuesdays before eating because i got full before the food even got to the table and also buzzed.  plus the unhealthy amount of sugar in one of those is not very complementing to the oiliness of <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>.\n\n2) ordering one chicken and waffles plate for yourself.  everyone shared a plate with someone at the table except me and a friend who insisted we needed our own.  once we got our plates we knew we were idiots.  there's so much chicken and waffle that i'm sure it could last three meals.\n\nregardless, the food was aesthetically pleasing.  the waffle was alright, nothing too special.  i think there was bacon in it which i'm personally not a fan of.  the chicken had maple syrup downed on it which i'm also not a fan of.  there's a fried leek too.  i just prefer my sweet foods to be sweet (why is there bacon in the waffle....) and my savory foods to be salty and deep fried.  i think the chicken would've been better if it wasn't drowning in syrup.  but the fried leek was good.", 
            "this place has so much hype i don't even need to hype it up any more.. but it's good! \ni had the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> and it was delicious.. plus fed me for two meals! so even though some people complain about pricing, you could easily split a meal or eat your left overs later! my husband got the biscuits and gravy which also fed him for two meals. \nobviously the only downfall is the wait. we waited for about 45 minutes but it wasn't a big deal because we just went downstairs and did a little gambling before coming back upstairs.", 
            "i would like to say! damn! \n\nthis place is the epitome of american eating! the portion sizes are ridiculous and the prices are cheap for the amount of food you get. i like to think that i can put a decent size meal away but i couldn't even put a dent in this meal!!! i had <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> w/ maple reduction, 2 eggs, bacon <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> & biscuit!!\n\nman, it was big and flavorful. a nice spicy kick to and the chicken was nice and marinated. i couldn't put a dent in it but really really enjoyed it. the cheese sauce was epic too. i would highly highly recommend this place, if you like huge portion sizes!", 
            "i am in love! this place has humungous portions, and our group of five, got four entrees and shared, but we still had leftovers! i originally wanted to try the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> eggs benedict, but i was the size of the plate, and was immediately intimidated. i opted for the sausage gravy and biscuits, which came over a bed of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark> and some fruit. loved it! the beau had the <mark>Corned Beef</mark> hash, which was also really good. my twin sister had the chicken and waffles, and wow! the size of that dish! her bf went for the omelette with salmon(? not sure of the name), but that was also delicious and more on the healthier side. definitely worth the wait. must go, and must try!\n\nalso, our server billy was great! exceptional all around!", 
            "whenever we are in las vegas this is a must eat for  breakfast/brunch. here's my review:\n\n 1) service - 3 stars. it's my first time to dine in this location and it was packed! waited for 30 mins to be seated and another 30 mins for the food. our waitress was nice and deliver our drinks as fast as possible. \n\n2) food - 5 stars. for the price and the portion of the food that you get its so worth it! we ordered only 2 entrees for a group of 4. we all shared it and left the restaurant pretty stuffed! my favorite is the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with waffles! the chicken is crispy on the outside, soft and juicy in the inside, and then you drizzled it with the maple syrup that comes with it and it's heaven!  we also ordered the original benedict, it's loaded with carbs (biscuits on top of <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>), tomatoes, spinach and bacon. in case you were wondering the red strings that they put in a every dish is a deep fried angel hair pasta. not sure if it's just for decoration but it gives a nice crunch to the dish.\n\n3) ambience - 3 stars - nice atmosphere for breakfast and the place looks clean.", 
            "their food here is massive! the service here is superb! the food is good just a lottttt, you have to come really hungry and share share share. we seriously over ordered the food we couldn't finish it all.\n\nwe came here early for breakfast there was about a 20 minute wait which wasn't too bad. we were seated and served by a very pleasant woman i wish i knew her name because she was just the most patient and wonderful server i have come across.\n\ni had to order their famous <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, let's just say this bad boy was just too much i couldn't see myself ordering this again but it was good don't get me wrong. it had butter milk biscuits, bacon, spinach, tomatoes, <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark>, scrambled eggs, mozarella cheese and chipotle creme on top. it was really good but we weren't able to finish it between the 2 of us it just was a lot of food and the bacon was a little overkill for me.  this was featured on man vs. food. let's just say it won. :) \n\nwe also ordered the brown sugar pancakes which were really good they had bananas also. their kids menu their <mark>French Toast</mark> portion is so big too, they brought out 2 big pieces of <mark>French Toast</mark> topped with banana, butter and powdered sugar. their <mark>French Toast</mark> is really good. i really enjoyed their <mark>French Toast</mark>.\n\nall in all a wonderful experience, you definitely must try and like i said before come hungry!", 
            "the portions here are massive! my husband and i split the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles, and we still couldn't finish it. the chicken and waffles were a little above average, but nothing outstanding. the price was fantastic for that much food. we would come back again for a big breakfast after a night out in vegas.", 
            "mmm yummm!! my friend and i stopped by here for lunch on our last day in vegas and boy am i glad we did! there was a little of a wait to get seated but the wait probably only took about 15 minutes or so. so we originally wanted to order 2 entrees to share and good thing we didn't because after asking our server, he said we should definitely share. so we decided to get the <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> that everyone is highly raving about in the reviews. and apparently, this plate was showcased in man vs food! we also ordered a mint mocha latte to share. when our dish arrived, we just kind of stared at it in astonishment and relief that we did not order 2 plates! that <mark><mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> Benedict</mark> was massive in width and height. loll. the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was fried perfectly and tasted really good especially with the <mark>Sausage Gravy and Buttermilk Biscuits, 2 Eggs and Mashed Potatoes</mark>, eggs, tomatoes, bacon, and the thick sauce that the dish came with. such yummy goodness! even after splitting this dish, both my friend and i couldn't finish it. it was just so much food!! the mint mocha latte was really good also; just a perfect amount of mintiness! :) i need to bring my bf here next time!", 
            "this is inside the casino...  walking down the \"alley\" toward the ferris wheel thing won't get you there.  staff here was amazing.  as you'll see from photos, the serving sizes are obnoxiously large...  the kids meal we got was only $6 and also huge.  we ordered the meatloaf sandwich and a chicken pasta.  both were huge, but neither was super-delicious.  they were both just okay.  \nthe <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> was good and they served huge biscuits before the meal.\nwe got everything to go, asked for plastic silverware and gave it to some thankful homeless.  we had no way to eat leftovers ourselves but didn't want it to go to waste.\ni would come back.  prices were decent, location (once you find it) is pretty convenient.  i wouldn't order the same thing.",

            "chicken. and. waffles. that's all you need to know and all you need to get!! make sure you share it with someone because it is huge. think gourmet, fancy, over the top chicken and waffles. it comes with 4 huge waffles with bacon pressed right into it topped with 2 large pieces of moist, tender <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> with a knife through the center holding it all together. the whole dish is garnished with sage, fried green onions, cherry tomatoes and a side of their maple syrup! it's hands down the best <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> you will ever eat and will ever need.\n\ni saw other tables with dishes and everything is ginormous so please do your waistline and wallet a favor and share or be prepared to bring a lot of food home.", 
            "first spot i ate after my flight in because i knew i had to hit this place! the host was a little short with us and didn't explain well where to stand and why when we came in. after that the waitress was great and quick! very busy time, about 2 pm, but we did not feel rushed! we both got the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> and waffles and wow, huge portions but so yummy!! i will be back and plan to split this 2 chicken piece and 4 waffles. there's bacon in the waffles...bacon!"

            "okay another hungover morning, wait i mean another still drunk from last night morning, and im starving,with no energy to battle through a buffet me and my friend decided to hit the hashhouse, since i kept hearing about these chicken and waffles, it was bookmarked!\n\nwe got there and got seated right away place wasn't to full yet, i ordered some kind of spritzer cocktail, it was tasty, my friend ordered some kinda mojito champagne thing, she didn't like it but i did, because im a lush.\ni ordered the <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> & waffles which comes with,\ntwo <mark>Andy's Sage Fried Chicken</mark> breasts with hardwood smoked <mark>Bacon Waffle</mark> tower, hot maple reduction and fried leeks.\n\nthis thing was huge as you can see from the pic, i thought the bacon cooked into the waffle was g, the leeks where all over it, and there was a little bit of diced bellperes around the whole plate, the presentation was on point. i was surprised how much the flavors all balanced out together, i thought the leeks, & bell pepper would throw it off, but every bit of it all magically went together. my friend lanz had one of the house hashes the chorizo, jalapenos, cheddar cheese & fresh tomato.\nthis comes with tossed  crispy potatoes and is topped w/ 2 eggs, served with fruit and biscuit. \nt\nhis was really really good, and i thought it was gonna be super meh, no way this tasted better than most mexican spots in la that serve chorizo <mark>Two Egg Breakfast Any Style</mark>, with that said my friend was too out of it to eat it all, so i took the pleasures. this will be my breakfast of drunken champions spot from now on when i do vegas, or rather when vegas does me?", 
            "this restaurant is on the 2nd floor of the imperial palace - the idea is interesting - real big plates with real big food items - too much for someone normal to eat so lots of waste - i do not like it and had to send both orders back.  i ordered the pancake - you get one pancake for $7.00 but it is bigger than the plate - i am a pancake person and have ordered and reviewed pancakes for years still looking for the perfect one - this is not it.  it is rubbery, and tastes like nothing unless you smothered in it syrup and butter.  so sent it back and ordered the basic which is 2 eggs <mark>Two Egg Breakfast Any Style</mark>, biscuit, potatoes and fruit also for $7.00... ordered 2 eggs over medium with biscuit...what came out was 2 eggs over very runny hardly even cooked and a biscuit which had no taste and was worse than the pancake.. the orange slices were good.  the service was terrible as well so not a fan....this is the first time ever i had to send both orders back - will not return - they all seemed shocked i did not like there terrible food.",
