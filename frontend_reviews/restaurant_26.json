            "nye specials out of this world! best steak in the universe.\n===\n\nso we're wandering the endless halls of caesar's looking for a spot to chill for several hours before the countdown begins. the halls are a bustle of screaming children and many people. the host stand and its tailored dude greet you alongside the display menu and a few tables out in the mall for the noisy customers. the real restaurant is back two rooms behind the bar and is like a secret treasure room for the deserving. we were lucky!\n\nthe nye special surf and turf themed card included jumbo <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws (4), <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>, 3lb lobster and a \"side\" of 8oz <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark>. i won't say which one i didn't order, but the steak was the best steak in the universe, the lobster was huge and meaty and the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws (those poor babies!) were phenomenal. add to that a special price on the tattainger reserve and it was one heck of a way to bring in the new year.\n\nthe bread basket included several varieties but my favorite was the fennel seed, roasted sesame seed and parmesean lahvosh. <mark>Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms</mark> were excellent.\n\nthe service was prompt and professional and i loved how our server kept stopping by to ask us if he could bring anything for us _right now_; very fun. the menu tells the story of the restaurant, founded in florida, and i remember it well; this location honors the original in proper vegas style.", 
            "amazing sea food!  wow!  i felt my salmon was cooked with love!  the appetizers were killer, had some kind of <mark>Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>!  but the best part was dessert!!!!  geez, if you ever want to go off your diet and fulfill the craving for sweets, got for the banana cream pie!  amazing!  by far the best banana cream pie i have ever eaten.  this is a pricey place, i can't lie.  although i went on someone elses dime so i had a few glasses of wine!  the service was a little off when we first got there.  we waited about 30 minutes for our table, but sat down at the bar tables to have a pre drink.  it took awhile for them to help us, i figured it was because how busy they were.  once we sat down we got the servers full attention.  i can't wait to go back!", 
            "pricey, but the <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> and <mark>Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms</mark> are toooo dieeee forrrrr.", 
            "wow! this place was top notch! a friend referred it to me. i am so glad that she did. we had the large <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws, <mark>Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>, seafood <mark>Joe's <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark></mark>, fish tacos, potatoes lyonaise, <mark>Fried Calamari</mark> and everything was so fresh and perfected! the bread basket is awesome too!  i can't wait to go back next time i'm in vegas. i loved it! delicious! the special honey mustard sauce for the claws if off the hook!", 
            "the only negative here is the price. it is very pricey but the food is amazing. we started with the calamari, oysters, and <mark>Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>. i had the ahi tuna and it melted in my mouth. my hubby had a cheeseburger and it was huge. my buddy had the surf and turf and he said it was incredible. the mac'n'cheese was the best i have ever had. i was stuffed and still couldn't let it go to waste! this is must do on the strip!", 
            "our family of 7 went her friday night to celebrate a birthday. the food was excellent. we had calamari and <mark>Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms</mark> for appetizers. they both were excellent. the steaks had excellent seasoning and flavor. my steak was one of the best steaks i have ever had before. i highly recommend joe's to anyone that likes great food and service. our waitress was outstanding. she was friendly, helpful, and attentive.", 
            "yum! i was in town for a food expo and went with my co-workers who included some top of the line renowned chefs. they being chefs of course wanted to critique a few items especially the dessert, which i would have to agree with! but other then the desserts, the <mark>Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>, <mark>Ahi Tuna Tartare</mark>, <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>, jumbo alaskan sea crab, <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, new york strip and rib eye did not disappoint our palettes. yes i tried all of that happily and would do it again & again minus dessert here.", 
            "it's times like these when i truly enjoy writing a deserved review on a restaurant. we had actually planned to go to a crawfish place for dinner, but i really wanted to try something else for once...since we always go to the crawfish place when we come to vegas.\n\nmy first impression when walking toward this restaurant was....wow....this place looks really expensive, so it better be good! located in the forum shopping mall at caesar's, the restaurant looks like a long and well established classic american bar and restaurant. we were greeted at the entrance by a host who seated us right away....likely because we showed up early at around 5.30pm....but even then, the place was very busy. we were led to our table where we were introduced to our waiter itodd) who took very good care of us. both the host and todd were extremely polite and nice, courteous, and professional, and made us feel like the most important guests at the restaurant.....real class.\n\nin less than a minute, a fresh basket of yummy bread was placed on our table....and it looked gooooood! ....and after tasting it....wow, delicious. todd then came over and showed us the menu with the featured specials, which all sounded absolutely amazing.  everything on main menu looked absolutely delicious, but we couldn't order everything that looked good as we would not have been able to finish it all.....so we were very selective. as an appetizer we ordered the <mark>Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>.... and omg,...they were absolutely delicious! i can quite confidently say without a doubt that these were the best i have ever tasted! next, how could we have come to joe's without trying their 5-piece signature <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws. also absolutely delicious....and together with their special dipping sauce.....absolutely fantastic! $65 for 5 claws.....well, it better have been good! already cracked, todd was good enough to instruct us how they are supposed to be peeled and eaten....and afterwards, brought us some lemon to squeeze on our hands and wet towels to clean our hands of the fishy crab smell. and it actually worked!\n\nfor our entrees, we ordered their featured special grilled dover sole, which was de-boned at table side. simply squeezed lemon on top and you have one absolutely delicious fish meal. for myself, i ordered the roasted black cod as this is one of my favorite types of fish. it was cooked and served in a mild tomato broth with olives and herb oil. the cod was so fresh and perfectly cooked.....and the broth was mild enough as to no way overpower the fish.....every part of this dish complimented each other.....i absolutely loved it.....i thought the portion was a bit small, so thank goodness my friends and i shared everything. for sides, we ordered the <mark>Sauteed Broccolini</mark> and highly recommended roasted swee corn. both were also perfectly cooked and delicious. the serving of corn was good, but i think there should have been a bit more broccolini in the dish.\n\nall this together with a bottle of wine......wow.....life is good....and this restaurant qualifies as being one of the best restaurants i have ever tried! the service was excellent and attentive, and i will say that it was worth every dollar we spent on this dinner. i will definitely be back when i'm next in town. oh, we were brought the wrong check, but it's a good thing we normally check everything before paying.\n\ni love this place! :)", 
            "love love love this wonderful place\nabsolutely amazing place establishment! celebrated my husband's 40th birthday here and we were beyond impressed! our gracious full service specialist was awesome-suzanne/susan-love her! her recommendations were on point....\n<mark>Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>- so flavorful \nstella bay <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> - so fresh and tasty\n<mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark>- well seasoned and cooked just right\n<mark>Manhattan Clam Chowder</mark>-  was not brought to the table with the rest of the meal and suzanne brought us 2 on the house.. and it was also great..\ni know i know ..you can't trust a review where everything was good but it was! \nthe jumbo alaskan crab was precracked (of course) and steamed... as big as my 5 year olds arm.. and he's no small fry! \nthe lyonaisse potato- like a cross between home fries, a twice <mark><mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark></mark>, and a crispy outer layer topped with caramelized onions and it was enough for 6 people to share.. everything was in generous portions.\nthe birthday brownie!!! the brownie was soft and warm, the icecream was french vanilla and the creme' fresh was not a joke! \ni felt like i was cheating on my dinner when i ate breakfast... and my husband sat at the gates of food heaven for a little while!", 
            "this was an amazing restaurant!!! it's very pricey but worth it. if you have the choice, sit in the restaurant. you may want to get a reservation. the <mark>Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms</mark> were our favorite appetizer. we also sprung for the aged ribeye and the <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>. they shelled them for us!!!!  amazing experience.", 
            "we were a party of 5 sharing dinner at this fine establishment on a sunday evening to celebrate a birthday.  having made a reservation our table was available as soon as we got there.  server was very polite and helpful.  he took orders and expedited drink/food quickly. for appetizers, we had the <mark>Fried Calamari</mark> and <mark>Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>.  the assortment of fresh bread was very filling which came with meal.  my friends sampled the bisque which they said was good. we ordered different entrees, the salmon, branzino, seafood <mark>Joe's <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark></mark>, and steak.  all the dishes looked very well prepared and tasted just as good.  seafood was fresh and there was no food leftover after we finished meal.  they even brought out a birthday dessert which was a nice touch.", 
            "love joe's....though i think the miami location is only slightly better. the <mark>Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms</mark> app was wonderful. and the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was incredible...\"like butta!\" we had a private dinner party upstairs and the service was amazing. \n\nyou know you are at a fancy great restaurant when you ask for hot tea & they give you a fancy pot with fresh tea leaves & flowers...no bag.", 
            "extremely expensive for the quality of food.\n\nthe <mark>Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms</mark> we shared as an appetizer were excellent, but worth $15? not so sure.\n\nfor entrees we had the <mark>Crab Stuffed Shrimp</mark> and the medium snow <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>. they were decent but honestly nothing special, we've had similar quality from far less expensive places.\n\nfinally, $8 for a couple of scoops of vanilla ice cream covered in chocolate sauce. we expected much more from the waiter's description of the dessert than that!\n\noverall our waiter was pretty unattentive, albeit friendly and welcoming.\n\ni understand that everything is expensive in vegas (and we certainly came to realize that during our long weekend there) but i expected more in terms of quality for how much we paid. our bill came to $150 including drinks, which for us did not represent value for money.", 
            "they should change the name from joes seafood to joes pies, because while the seafood and steak are below average there pie(key lime) made in house, is just perfection.\n\ni am not sure why they have such a high rating. service was really good and the waiter knew his stuff the price-point is a bit high but quality of food is lacking!!!!!! \n\nthe bread they bring out as an appetizer was standard some pieces though tasted like hospital bread, you know the bread they serve in a plastic bag at the hospitals. not impressed. \n\ni ordered the filet mingon and i was not impressed more so disappointed ... i ordered it medium on the bone. half the steak was cooked well and the inside was cooked medium.the filet was chewy at the end and not packed with that juicy flavor you suppose to get out of a filet. the ends toward the bone were very very fatty. poorly cooked filet mingon.\nthe swordfish was not good. did not taste fresh and was a bit on the rubbery side. just so wrong. the sauce that comes on top was flavorless. \n\nthe <mark>Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms</mark> with spinach were very good and tasted great, perfect play between cheesy and crunchy.\n\ni believe there specialty is <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> but we didn't try it. its supposedly these crabs that they tear off one claw and throw them back into the ocean....\n\nmy suggestion though is with a bill close to 160 dollars for food the quality of two entrees 2 deserts and a cappuccino did not deliver great quality food for value. \n\nthe only reason i would go back is for there amazing pie. while the banana foster is good the key lime pie is just heaven on earth made by the key lime pie gds. its beyond amazing. i'm a huge fan of key lime pie and this is in the top two best key lime pies ive ever had in my life. go there and just ask for a slice of key lime pie. they have a baker that comes in every morning and specifically bakes the pies. it delivers freshness and this thick graham crust, its scary to say perfect. \n\n\nkey points to know about seating: \n\nif you are going there for dinner even after i suggest you look for another place with better quality food and you want the white tablecloth dark dinner feel, walk to the back......all the way to the back. if you speak with the man that sits you in front he will sit you at tables near the bar area or outside by the front which is great for lunch but i really didn't want the whole eat dinner overlooking mall shops experience for late dinner.  so just head all the way to the back.... the place is huge and there is more seating options than what you see. they have an upstairs and a romantic dim lit back room.", 
            "it's rare to find a restaurant that delivers 5 star quality food with 5 star customer service. came here tonight for thanksgiving dinner and they exceeded our expections by far! not only did this restaurant have some of the best <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> and <mark>Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms</mark> i've ever had, but our waiter perry was outstanding as well. he was friendly, polite, passionate about what he does and definitely showed that he cares. i will definitely be back before i leave vegas, and will be sure to return the next time i'm in town!!!", 
            "first of all, been dreaming of trying <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> ever since i saw a feature on a food show! so when i had a chance to try it in vegas at the very  restaurant i saw it on 5 years ago, (the original is in miami ) i did not hesitate. mind you this is my thanksgiving dinner,and expectations were quite high. we were greeted warmly and from the beginning treated like we were valued guests. our waiter whose name is perry deserves 6 stars because he was probably the best waiter i  have encountered in my life. he passion for food  and friendly advice made our experience unparalleled. now let actually talk about the food.  they started us of with a bread basket which contains 4 different selections, the  best in my opinion was the cracker bread followed closely by the pretzel roll. we ordered <mark>Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms</mark> and they are amazing! we both had the select <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> about  one pound,  and my god  are they delicious. being from san francisco i have always thought dungeness crab was the best . but as of right now i give the nod to the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>. it is served with joe's special mustard which is great, but i asked for some cocktail sauce,  which hands down the best i have ever had. for  our  side we tried the lyonais potatoes very good. i really had such a great experience here that i  just had to post a short story of a review to give them the props they deserve.  special shout out to perry's bosses your boy  is doing exceptional work and should be recognized! \n.", 
            "the service was on point.  i will say the best things to eat here is the steak, <mark>Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms</mark> and key lime pie.  i came here with a party of four and we ordered a lot of food.  the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> were our app which weren't worth the money paid for.  but i'm from maryland were we eat crabs all the time and it's hard to convince me that a place outside of the maryland area really has some good crabs or not.  we also had asparagus but those were the worst asparagus i've ever had.  the didn't even seem completely green either like true asparagus.  the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> was the worst.  not sure how they mess up on that.   the mash potato's were ok but i had better at outback.  we also has the apple, keylime and banana pie.  all of them were basic except the keylime which was good.  over all i don't see me coming back to this place and it's over rated.  if you want good crabs in vegas go to the super market and order you some.  or go spend your money at the caesar buffet which is well worth the money."

(no wonder the recipe is top secret!) all i know is it's made with skyy vodka, half & half or some other cream, i'm guessing a lime liqueur because it was sweeter than if it were just lime juice and it's served in a martini glass rimmed in a sugary graham cracker dust. bottoms up! it was deeeelicious. \n\nbefore i forget, too, i have to mention the bread basket! there is the omgah cutest mini loaf pretzel bread in that basket. i loves it!!!\n\neven though we all pretty much knew what we wanted as our entrees...we took our time looking over the menu to determine our starters and sides. in fact, i ordered well after appetizers were set on our table because i didn't think i was hungry enough to justify that and an entr\\u00e9e. however, once i caught sight of the jumbo <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> i knew i couldn't resist.\n\nthat jumbo <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> was so good... chunks of flaky, white crab meat. it practically melted in my mouth! the next time i'm at joe's i'm going to order the jumbo <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> dinner.

            "i went to joe's for the first time last night.  i was with a group of 14 people, 10 of whom were in from out of town and it was their pick.  as a local, who doesn't smoke or gamble i spend very little time on the strip and do my best to find great off strip bars and restaurants.  joe's is worth braving the traffic and tourists!   \n\nwe were given a private room with a fantastic server, thomas.  everything was absolutely fantastic.  we started with the appetizer called the second mortgage.  it has jumbo shrimp, lobster cocktail, alaskan king crab and shrimp & <mark>Shrimp & Scallop Ceviche</mark>.  the seafood was fresh, beautifully presented and delicious.  next i had the stone <mark>Crab Bisque</mark>, which was silky, flavorful and actually contained small pieces of <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>.  i ordered the <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> which were huge, amazingly tasty and probably 95% crab with just enough filler to keep them from falling apart.  \n\nmy bf had the bone in rib eye which was quite possibly the best steak i've ever tasted.  it was a beautiful, extremely high quality cut of meat that was cooked to a perfect medium rare.  others in my party had the bone in filet which was also high quality and cooked perfectly.  also, one other ordered the dover sole, which i highly recommend.  it was fresh and cooked perfectly.  it was also expertly and impressively deboned table side.  the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> are also very good.  they come pre-cracked so; all you have to do is peel back <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> pieces and savor the incredibly sweet <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> meat.  for dessert we tried the blueberry pie a la mode, the key lime pie and the banana cream pie, all of which are made fresh in house daily and were incredible.   however, the banana cream pie was a standout.  it was amazing!\n\neverything from the atmosphere, the service and the food were incredible.", 
            "i took my fiance here for his birthday lunch and both of us left joe's very satisfied. we each ordered their joe's classic (5 <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws, hash browns, <mark>Joe's Cole Slaw</mark>, and key lime pie), delicious shrimp and <mark>Shrimp & Scallop Ceviche</mark>, 1/2 dozen oysters which were too small for my preference. i had a grapefruit margarita and let me tell you, the best margarita ever!!! their bloody mary is yummy too, but don't order it if you have high blood pressure- sodium overload..hello...\n\np.s. \nif you ever want to eat here, make sure to make a reservation because this place is always busy.", 
            "i'd say my group ordered almost everything on the menu!  we walked out of there stuffed to the max that our stomachs were hurting.\n\nour dinner started out with complimentary bread, which came in different types.  they were delicious.  we ordered other items such as roasted sweet corn (bomb!), hash browns (can never go wrong w/ potatoes), lyonnaise (bomb!), <mark>Four Cheese Mac & Cheese</mark> mac & cheese (okay), <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> (i like seafood, but not a huge fan of this).  i also ordered the shrimp and <mark>Shrimp & Scallop Ceviche</mark> because i love ceviches, but i wasn't sure if i should order it because they only taste good by authentic mexican restaurants.  but because it was a fancy restaurant i went for it.  in the end, i was disappointed...never again.  the shrimp and scallop tasted like shrimp and scallop alright.  it had a hint of lemon on it and lame junk.  they made it worse by serving it with the cheap salt crackers!  what happened to the tostatas?? fail", 
            "after coming up in the casino, my boyfriend and i decided to binge on a nice dinner. joe's had great yelp reviews, so we decided to try it and boy am i glad we did!\n\ninitially, i wasn't so sure as it was a bit dark and the entrance is inside ceasars shopping area, but once your inside and begin to order, wow!\n\nour waitress was amazing - she recommended all the best items beginning with the cucumber martini (amazing drink, like heaven with seafood, just like she said and it got me tipsy) and my bf, being a whiskey man, ordered an extremely aged whiskey which he said was unbelievable. started out with the 2nd mortage featuring a little bit of everything ( their famous alaskan king crab, jumbo shrimp, lobster cocktail, shrimp & <mark>Shrimp & Scallop Ceviche</mark>) - holy moly, so worth the money!!! they are known for their crab for a reason- i could have had a giant plate of that alone and be satisfied! glad i didn't tho...\n\nwe also got <mark>Oysters Rockefeller</mark> which may be the best oysters i have ever had\n\nand for the main course, surf n' turf! so far, we are drunk, stuffed, and in heaven!\n\nwaitress is still very attentive and although we are so full, my sweet tooth could not pass up the dessert menu. the waitress was kind enough to offer a half slice of their home-made chocolate fudge pie. no good! literally could not stop eating. \n\nabsolutely recommend this place as a fine dining establishment in las vegas and will certainly be back for more :)", 
            "<mark>The Whale</mark> app was okay. wouldn't order it again. water was too heavily salted, shrimp was tough and <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> was not the best that you'd expect. scallop and <mark>Shrimp & Scallop Ceviche</mark> was good! \npetite filet and king crab was outstanding! i'm not even a filet fan and frown on people who order it for its lack of flavor... it was perfect withy the king! roasted cauliflower with sage brown butter a classic but very good. and the <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> were the best i've had!", 
            "so i am going to try to make this short but no promises. if this is your first time here like it was for us stick to the most popular dishes. we started off with the oyster rockefeller, it was delicious. then the shrimp & <mark>Shrimp & Scallop Ceviche</mark> which was okay. we did two orders of their select famous <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws and they were amazing. they had plenty of meat i got full before our entree even came. we both had the petite <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> & lobster tail. for sides  we had their <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> and mushroom mac and cheese. honestly we hardly even touched the sides so next time i don't think we will be ordering them. then we finished off with this really good havana dream cake. over all this place was really good and our serve jon p was great. can't wait to come back again.",

            "came here for a destination wedding 2 weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised.\n\nthe venue held on the second level of the restaurant which was away from the crowd downstairs. it was small yet warm and inviting. when we got there, there was a small menu for us to choose from for the entr\\u00e9e. \n\nthe appetizer was a platter of seafood including shrimp, lobster, crab and a shrimp/<mark>Shrimp & Scallop Ceviche</mark>. all the seafood was really fresh. this was then followed by a hearty <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>. \n\nfor the entr\\u00e9e, i decided on the ahi tuna filet on a bed of spinach/mushrooms topped with red wine bordelaise. it also came with some potato cakes as well. additionally, we also had asparagus and <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> on the side with our meal. i must say the side of <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> was definitely my favourite of the night. it was so creamy and flavourful. of course, the main itself was absolutely delicious! the tuna literally melted in my mouth. my boyfriend had the steak which he mentioned was only alright - he definitely liked my tuna better! \n\nfor the dessert i had the chocolate marquise pie. it was okay, nothing too special. i was too full after the main course to even eat the dessert. overall a very good place to dine at."

            "first of all, lunch. surprisingly there aren't that many nice places to have lunch on the strip: joe's is one of the best choices, particularly if you are unsure of your companion's dining preferences or looking to find something moderately priced and moderately fast (there are small salads, sandwches and burgers on the bar menu). \n\na spin-off of the miami legend, joe's offers three distinct environments --a bustling patio in the elegant forum rotunda, a very large casual bar, and a huge 40s-50s era dining room that is classic (i also discovered they have two round function rooms overlooking the strip and a elegantly old school \"boardroom\" for private dining/meeting).\n\ncoat and tie not required, but common, esp. in dining room--and large parties seem to be common. it isn't surprising to run into both casino heavy hitters (even those from competing properties, who could eat elsewhere for free) as well as visiting celebs. tuxedoed waiters  provide detailed service...though when things get very busy, they may run by you a bit too quickly.\n\nthe menu is full of surprises--beyond the expected <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws, shrimp, oysters rockafeller, <mark>Shrimp De Jonghe</mark> (basically breaded scampi, but made with impressively tender prawns), <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> and fish dishes, there is an excellent chopped vegetable salad, good garlic <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> and roasted corn.\n\nthe bone-in <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> was among the very best i've had in vegas. and i have to tell you that i have sampled virtually all of the best steakhouses here.\n\nour dover sole was lightly breaded and gorgeously saut\\u00e9ed to a golden hue; the waiter deftly deboned it at the table and served it with a slightly carmelized lemon butter (it didn't need it).\n\nthe <mark>Joe's Fried Chicken</mark> was another unexpected surprise, a hefty four pieces, lightly battered and deep fried, the crispy crumb batter giving way to moist flavorful meat within. savory but light.\n\nin season, the <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> here are far and away the best i've had: sweet, juicy, light with none of the mealy taste you get from lesser crab. \n\ntheir pies are offered in half portions-a great option should you want to sample more than one. i have had uneven experiences with the signature key lime pie--one time it was perfect, another time, it was rock-solid frozen, and the waiter neither apologized nor replaced it when i complained. \n\ngenerally speaking, prices are on the high side but the quality reflects that. order with care.",

            "i love joe's. i was here last year on a business dinner and came back around for a repeat with a girlfriend from work. the service and food are both wonderful. obviously, we came for surf n' turf and we both left stuffed and happy (and, for being on the las vegas strip, the prices are the same as you would find at any higher-end steakhouse - nothing on the menu seemed outrageously inflated).\n\nour charming server (\"steven\" or \"stephen\", he-of-the-awesome-bulgarian-accent) suggested we start off with the <mark>Shrimp De Jonghe</mark> appetizer (i.e., a fancy name for scampi): six plump shrimps, basting in a super-garlicky sauce. delicious. joe's also provides a very ample basket of mixed breads (soft pretzel, dinner roll + a savory bacon-y ciabatta that my friend loved). \n\nwe both ordered surf 'n turf: petit <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> (i chose the alaskan king crab and my friend had lobster). we also split an order of the <mark>Hashed Brown</mark> potato and the grilled asparagus with romesco sauce. my steak was a little overcooked in the interior and a little ash-y charred on the outside. however, the <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> were delicious (and already split down the middle for me), so i flaked and dunked those bad boys in the clarified butter.\n\nthe presentation and texture of the <mark>Hashed Brown</mark> was awesome: a golden brown and crusty mound of fluffy-on-the-inside starchy goodness (but a little lacking in flavor). but the grilled asparagus was absolutely delicious (and i don't really like asparagus that much), and the cherry tomato romesco sauce was truly the star of the dish (we both loved the delectable tomatoes - sweet, chunky, delicious). the generously-portioned sides could easily be shared between 2-3 people.\n\nwe finished off with two desserts (we were both veritable piggies that night): wedges of lemony cream cheese pie with strawberry sauce (my friend's favorite), and fudge pie (my favorite!). they were both about as good as dessert can get.\n\nto reiterate, our server was excellent: he looked like a possible secret agent assassin, had a fabulous accent, provided attentive (but not smothering) service with a flourish (he snapped our photo), and we never felt rushed or like a nuisance (and we lingered over dinner for close to three hours, chatting, sipping and and forking around - hehe). service nailed a 5-star rating as perfect."

            "first night on our honeymoon, we got to joe's around 10:15pm right before closing at 10:30.  we sat at a table near the bar.  our waitress came over and got our drink order, and about 10 minutes later they finally arrived with some bread selections.  other people have commented that their bread was warm, but ours was cold.  the selection of different choices was a treat, and the lavashe covered with melted parmesan cheese went well with my bacardi and tonic.  for our meal my wife and i decided to share an order of 7 large <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws, <mark>Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail</mark>, <mark>Oysters Rockefeller</mark>, and the aged 16 oz ny steak.  everything, and i mean everything was top notch.  the oysters were filled with bacon, cheese, and spinach; the <mark>Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail</mark>, while not quite morton's grade, was  tasty and had nice sized shrimp, the steak was thick, juicy, and cooked to a perfect medium rare, and the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>.....words cannot explain how good these were.  growing up in a pan-asian setting in hawaii, there are very few sea foods that i haven't tried.  from jellyfish salad, to raw squid, we have it all there.  i've had dungenous, maryland blue, king, snow, and last night finally, i got to cross <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> off my list.  while pricy at about  $60 for 7 large pieces, they are divine.  huge fatty pieces of perfect claw meat await you after taking off the pre-cracked shell.  follow that up with a dip in joe's famous mayo sauce, and you have the food that the gods were suckled on.  and oh yeah, we ordered a bottle of bubbly to compliment the sea food, and  cut the fattiness of the of the steak.  overall, a great meal, and a great start to our honeymoon in vegas.  i would eat here every week if i could, but at $300 including tip, i wouldn't be able to make my car payment.  that being said, the service, although very friendly was slow, and i know that it was because it was so late, and we were literally the last seating, but i have been to places in ny and chicago that were the same caliber of food, had a late res, and they took care of us the entire way.  last night it felt like a great meal, but a little rushed.  never a good feeling when you drop 3 bills for a meal.  so a little our fault, a little theirs.  next time we come, i'll make an earlier res, and hopefully the service will be a little sharper.",

            "we've been coming to joe's <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> for years.  every menu item is excellent, but a few are worth mentioning.  the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> are fantastic, when in season.  when they aren't in season, they are frozen, and the decline in quality can't be overstated.  \n\non more than one occasion, we have skipped seafood and had burgers.  the burgers are highly recommend, particularly when you add <mark>Chopped Lettuce, Tomato, Onion & Blue Cheese</mark>.  they don't always have mac n cheese, but when they do it's a very good representation of this dish.  the <mark>Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail</mark> are huge and the sauce is fantastic.  good bar, nice beer and liquor selection. \n\nfor dinner, i recommend reservations.  even lunch can take awhile at this place due to its popularity.", 
            "pros\n<mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> were really great. they crack them at the table for you and one order is a lot so i would share between 2 people. very meaty. it's served cold which was different than what i'm used to, but it was still great. it says market price but it was $79 last night and i couldn't tell you the poundage, but we also ordered scallops, <mark>Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail</mark> and a cup of soup, all to share, and couldn't finish the crab! \nthe scallops were very delicate and melt in your mouth yummy. one did have some sand in it, crunch crunch, but i guess that's expected sometimes. \n\nthe lobster bisque was delish! we shared it, it's very rich but yummy. would be awesome on a rainy day (still good with 115 degrees outside) \n\nif there has to be a con... the <mark>Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail</mark> was really really good.., but each shrimp is basically $4 each! but fresh, cold and meaty. haha funny i'm ok spending $80 on crab but not $16 for shrimp. \n\nmaybe i watch too many gordon ramsay shows, but i agree that the tuxedo attire for wait staff is a little funeral home. our server was super sweet and very great at her job though. a little stuffy overall but elegant. \n\nservice was fast and friendly, we would go back if we're wanting great seafood and paying for it ($140 before a tip for 1 soup, 1 <mark>Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail</mark>, 1 order scallops, 1 order <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>) the bread basket was amazing too!! carb heaven!", 
            "the 20oz. dry aged ribeye cooked med. rare was so good, they offer the 24oz. as well which i also tried but i think it cooks differently when you ask for it med. rare cause i guess the cut is thicker and with the bone in you would just have to cook it a little more for the flavors of it to come out. (good tip that i got from my friend holly) best <mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark> fries in town, kusshi oysters and <mark>Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail</mark> are great for starters. havana dream pies and chocolate fudge pies are always a treat for dessert. the apple pie a la mode's crust is awesome but the apples are usually on the bland side. trust me all the pies are a treat just chose one to your liking. for service, they always greet you with a smile and linda and joey are the best servers, they're really awesome, sit with linda if you want the most sweet and charming british lady and joey if you want a down to earth no hassle good ol city joe. i hope this helps. enjoy!", 
            "joe's offers good value for the meals they serve. prices are fair, portions are generous, and the atmosphere is fun without being too loud. the two of us have dinner at joe's on each of our vegas trips. this is at least our 10th time dining there and we have yet to be disappointed. we had an 8pm reservation and were seated by 8:05. service was prompt and friendly, as usual. bread basket is delivered to the table before any food orders are placed.\n\nwe each ordered <mark>Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail</mark> as an appetizer. it was very good. the cocktail sauce has a dollop of horseradish which gives it more than the usual kick. my wife had the copper river sockeye salmon special. salmon was cooked as she requested and she rated the dish as excellent. \n\nmy favorite dish has always been the parmesan crusted halibut with lemon butter sauce. the dish has been changed on the menu but our server told me he could have the halibut prepared as it was previously. the dish was as i remembered and was also excellent. we will continue to make this a must stop on our next trip in october.",

            "this is one of my favorite restaurants ever!! i have been 3 times now and each was amazing. the service has been consistently wonderful. servers are attentive and have a sense of humor which is nice, especially in a restaurant that could be too \"stuffy\" if it wanted to be. the <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> are to die for (i combine their mustard sauce and butter for dipping, try it!), the <mark>Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail</mark> contains some of the biggest and best i have ever had, and the corn side dish is a must. i don't even really like corn, but will still find myself craving joe's sweet corn like i'm pregnant or something!! go get your crab on at joe's, you won't be sorry.", 
            "it was restaurant week once again, and as usual, course for course, joe's featured one of the best rw menus.  so, off diane and i went for dinner, this time with a different couple in tow.  and, while the food was mostly well prepared as usual, this time the service was not.  it was rather perfunctory, and i had to ask for several iced tea refills, although they arrived quickly after i did.  even though i had requested a booth when making our reservation, we were initially led to a table.  and, our waiter did not mention or show me the restaurant week menu until i requested it.\n\nthe shrimp in a <mark>Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail</mark> were large and very meaty, but not sweet or that flavorful.  this appetizer came with a good, strong horseradish-based cocktail sauce.  a bowl of <mark>Crab Bisque</mark> was very smooth and very good--a better tasting preliminary except for the piece of shell i found in it.  \n\ngrilled halibut was moist and great tasting, accompanied by very good sweet roasted corn and <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>, a type of mashed potato that is a staple here.  two large scoops of peppermint ice cream covered by rivulets of hot fudge were refreshing, and a nice end to the meal.",

            "stopped by for lunch. place was busy, but we were still seated right away. we had the ahi tun tartare (ok, albeit a bit bland) and the <mark>Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail</mark> (4 shrimp - 3 terribly overcooked, the fourth just barely edible). continue on to the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws, which were ok, but nothing special at $45 per order, and the seared ahi tuna, which was cooked nicely. best thing we ate was the grilled asparagus. had a chardonnay and a riesling that were fine.\nservice was spotty, appetizer plates and some cutlery were cleared and not replaced. had to ask for a knife and fork again. took a while to locate our server and get the bill to show up.\nall in all we left severely underwhelmed. $200 lunch for two should at least have the main proteins cooked to an edible state.",

            "my favorite steak house that i have been to, great service, great food, good decor, good prices. \n\nfirst off the crab claws are awesome and meaty and the serve them with a creamy spicy mustard sauce and it all works real good. \n\nok now the reason i gave this place 5 stars is because they serve the best steak i have ever had (three times), it is there signature cut 16oz aged bone in prime filet. i mean big, super tender, and a great aged flavor. being bone in it is more flavorful than others. their sides are all the standards but all are excellent and of course plenty big enought to share. \n\nby todays strip standards this place has pretty good prices.  sides are between 5 and 8 bucks and the signature bone in steaks between 42 and 49  so all considered this place is about as reasonable as a steak house gets nowadays.  they have a selection of regular steaks for under 40 plus other chops, chicken, and seafood i have never tried.\n\nthis is not some hoity toity steak house that serves duck fat fries or <mark>Ahi Tuna Tartare</mark> taco appetizers, this is a great traditional classic american steak house. \n\nthey have some 24 dollar steak or crab lunch specials that are worth checking out, i did and it was real good.  \n\nwe went to the one in chicago and it was too excelent.",

(no wonder the recipe is top secret!) all i know is it's made with skyy vodka, half & half or some other cream, i'm guessing a lime liqueur because it was sweeter than if it were just lime juice and it's served in a martini glass rimmed in a sugary graham cracker dust. bottoms up! it was deeeelicious. \n\nbefore i forget, too, i have to mention the bread basket! there is the omgah cutest mini loaf pretzel bread in that basket. i loves it!!!\n\neven though we all pretty much knew what we wanted as our entrees...we took our time looking over the menu to determine our starters and sides. in fact, i ordered well after appetizers were set on our table because i didn't think i was hungry enough to justify that and an entr\\u00e9e. however, once i caught sight of the jumbo <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> i knew i couldn't resist.\n\nthat jumbo <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> was so good... chunks of flaky, white crab meat. it practically melted in my mouth! the next time i'm at joe's i'm going to order the jumbo <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> dinner.

            "i went to joe's for the first time last night.  i was with a group of 14 people, 10 of whom were in from out of town and it was their pick.  as a local, who doesn't smoke or gamble i spend very little time on the strip and do my best to find great off strip bars and restaurants.  joe's is worth braving the traffic and tourists!   \n\nwe were given a private room with a fantastic server, thomas.  everything was absolutely fantastic.  we started with the appetizer called the second mortgage.  it has jumbo shrimp, lobster cocktail, alaskan king crab and shrimp & <mark>Shrimp & Scallop Ceviche</mark>.  the seafood was fresh, beautifully presented and delicious.  next i had the stone <mark>Crab Bisque</mark>, which was silky, flavorful and actually contained small pieces of <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>.  i ordered the <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> which were huge, amazingly tasty and probably 95% crab with just enough filler to keep them from falling apart.  \n\nmy bf had the bone in rib eye which was quite possibly the best steak i've ever tasted.  it was a beautiful, extremely high quality cut of meat that was cooked to a perfect medium rare.  others in my party had the bone in filet which was also high quality and cooked perfectly.  also, one other ordered the dover sole, which i highly recommend.  it was fresh and cooked perfectly.  it was also expertly and impressively deboned table side.  the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> are also very good.  they come pre-cracked so; all you have to do is peel back <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> pieces and savor the incredibly sweet <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> meat.  for dessert we tried the blueberry pie a la mode, the key lime pie and the banana cream pie, all of which are made fresh in house daily and were incredible.   however, the banana cream pie was a standout.  it was amazing!\n\neverything from the atmosphere, the service and the food were incredible.", 
            "went to joe's on tuesday, june 28th with two frends.  we were seated promptly.  we ordered a few glases of wine, an appetizer and a few entrees.  i had blackend scallops with a side of fried green tomatoes, my friends ordered scallops wrapped in bacon and a miso glazed bass.  the bacon wrapped sallops and the miso glazed bass were excellent  - juicy, cooked perfectly.  my scallops.....  not so good.. they were smaller and dryer than the bacon wrapped scallops.  the fried green tomoatoes were thick and heavily breaded - almost looked like <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark>.  for dessert i had banana creme pie - which was excellent! (had i ordered the fish or scallops i would have had a great meal.)  my three stars is based on previous visits where i ordered to joe's strenghts as well as the strenghts of my friends dishes.", 
            "all i can think about from my vegas trip is joe's seafood!! it wasn't about all the partying, drinking, gambling or any of that it was just how darn good this place was !! \n\nthe night was started off by looking for a seafood place to go and eat at. mainly looking through yelp to find one. i didn't really want to get a buffet but i wanted a nice classy sit down and order your food ! i got what i wanted and called joe's seafood up. \n\nthey said they could take us in a few hours and indeed they did. while walking through this place you will notice that every server is wearing a nice black suit and it seems formal but hey we are in vegas and i saw many patrons wearing just flip flops and t shirts. \n\ni did call about the dress code but they said they do prefer business but doesn't matter if you are dressed in casual. so off we went on this find adventure!!\n\nthe order: \n<mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark>- it is one large <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> which is cooked or pan fried lightly for a little bit of crisp on the outside. the inside is nice and soft with a hint of mayo. the taste is amazing and i would say this is on my top 10 list of <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark>. \n\n<mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claw- had two of these and they are served chilled with a wedge of lemon but you really don't need anything. just try it without and you can tell that this is really good crab. the flavor is nice and and amazing. i wish i could just eat more...but we wanted to try everything!\n\n<mark>Crab Bisque</mark>- not my favorite thing on my meal. i didn't even finish it because it just had a very bad buttery flavor. it tasted way too fatty for me and i just didn't like it. \n\nparmesan crusted halibut- need to order this, the crust was just perfect amount of crispiness in each bite with the fish. also the fish was not at all dry and it just had an awesome flavor. love love it!! must order if you come here. \n\nhalf order of <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>- on the top of it was some very crispy cheese topping. i can tell you the half order was huge. we didn't even finish most of the sides because we were just stuffed with food!!\n\nhalf order of mac and cheese- i see mushrooms yeah !! :) i liked how the texture of the pasta is and also how they did the mac and cheese, it is defiantly a different style. not from kraft and it does taste a whole lot better. \n\noverall the meal was perfect, the server that we had was a very nice lady and she didn't hassle us about what we ordered or if we needed to order more. i know some places might be a little bit on the mad side if you only order one meal but seriously..i can't eat a whole lot and the portion size is out of this world!! most places feed you a very large size and this is one of them!! everything was large and good !! the only thing i would suggest not getting is the <mark>Crab Bisque</mark>. \n\nbut my experience at joe's has made me want to come to vegas more often to get a nice meal in!! see you soon joe!",

            "i was in vegas for vacation of course! i took my family here for my mom's birthday. now i must preface this review by saying my mom is the pickiest eater i know. i've taken her out to eat at many places. i was so happy to hear her saying that this was the best place i've ever taken her and the best sea food she's ever had! she went home and told my dad all about it and got him all jealous he missed out--he's allergic to shellfish!\n\nwe ordered 4 servings of <mark>Manhattan Clam Chowder</mark>, 1 <mark>Grilled Seafood Platter</mark> , 1 pound of the smallest <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws, some brocollini for a side, and 2 kids meals. the <mark>Grilled Seafood Platter</mark> came with scallops, lobster tail, and madagascar shrimp. wow, this is the first time i've actually liked scallops! they were big and meaty! the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws were cold but the meat was sweet and even the small ones had lots of meat! it was like a classier version of the atlantic blue crab that i am so used to eating on the east coast. i was not a fan of the mustard dip that it came with but the crab meat in itself had great flavor. just some lemon juice was enough!\n\nwhat i love about this restaurant is their affordable kids menu so you can bring your kids here and have them eat nice stuff, too! if they can't finish it, you can just get more food for yourself because these kids meals are basically slightly smaller portioned adult meals at like less than half the cost. sure the selection is not as extensive, but if you want <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> or <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark>, these meals are a great price! i brought two younger siblings and one ordered a 6oz <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> and the other mac and cheese. joe's have $17 kids meals with steak and <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> and $9 meals with some kind of starch or chicken nuggets, etc, you know the usual kids stuff. stay away from the $9 meals. the mac and cheese was total crap. easy mac would have been better!! it was more like hard, dry pasta shells and butter. my sister couldn't finish it. the steak however was the same quality as the adult version and cost 1/3 the price for a slightly smaller portion! each kids meal also came with a free side. one sibling picked broccolini and it was the same serving size as the appetizer portion i paid $9 for if not bigger!! seriously (look at the picture i posted). the only difference was the brocollini that came with the kids meal was steamed and the other off the menu was grilled with olive oil. each kids meal also came with the brownie sundae, which i'm pretty sure is the exact same thing they charge adults $8 for on the dessert menu! needless to say, the sundae was delicious. seriously, if you have kids, just use that as an excuse order some stuff for less than half the price on the regular menu.\n\nas for the more adult stuff, i don't think you can go wrong ordering shellfish here. everything tasted amazingly exotic and fresh. you must get the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws! i didn't know that they harvested the claws by taking one claw and throwing the crab back in the ocean! the claw regenerates! gasp! do they rotate which claw they take from the crab? is it the left or right one? i digress. i tried my other sister's steak and it was good but not something amazing (nothing i can't cook at home with a good cut of meat), so i can't say i would recommend the steak over the seafood. stay away from starches like pasta because based on the mac and cheese my sister had, i don't have faith in those dishes. why would you pray premium prices for starch dishes anyway? \n\noh and the complimentary bread was crap. olive garden probably has better. again, i don't think they know how to cook their carbs here.\n\nservice was good. our waitress, mindy, was very knowledgeable about the menu, had good recommendations and checked on us often. she didn't seem super accommodating, however. my mom didn't like her wine and she didn't offer to comp it or take it back. it wasn't that expensive glass of wine either, $8. usually nice restaurants just take stuff you really don't like off the bill and offer to replace it with something else.\n\noh, and don't worry about how to dress at this restaurant. my family showed up in hoodies and jeans and there was no problems getting service. this is touristy vegas!\n\nin the end my bill after tax and tip was over $230. it was worth it though because we left stuffed as a party of 4 (2 adults and 2 teens) and it included alcohol, dessert, and coffee, too! yum!", 
            "this place is descent, the chicken isn't as flavorful as it could be, steak is just okay. the <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> and pumpkin pie are very good. service is good. i think this place is a bit over priced for there quality.", 
            "i am sitting here with three of my co-workers in shock!  room temperature <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> sent back to the kitchen and returned after my guests were finished with their main courses.  the crispy brussel sprouts had no seasoning, the potatoes au gratin were undercooked by a lot, and the final blow---a sea of oil floating on top of my coffee.  cafeteria service and a complete lack of enthusiasm and love of food  by servers and managers.  apathy in abundance and poor quality of food can be expected.  my least favorite las vegas dining experience in 40 years!", 
            "amazing meal. from the bread basket delivered as we were seated to the best <mark>Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail</mark> for an appetizer. we were in awe by the entrees and side dishes. my husband ordered the filet and i had the <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark>. both were excellent choices. side dishes included 4 cheese macaroni and <mark>Crispy Brussels Sprouts</mark>. you will not be disappointed! and to top it all off coffee with key lime pie, we will be back!!!", 
            "amazing!!  for just a bit more than a vegas buffet you can eat at this fabulous restaurant.   the food is high end, not oily and incredibly delicious. we had the <mark>Grilled Seafood Platter</mark> and <mark>Marinated Skirt Steak</mark>, with <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> as an appetizer.  the <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> was the best i have ever had, the <mark>Grilled Seafood Platter</mark> was big and not over done with sauce or oil, just perfect natural taste.   the <mark>Marinated Skirt Steak</mark> was lightly seasoned and perfectly grilled.  for dessert the chocolate mouse cake was rich and delicious. a must stop place when you are in vegas, just make sure you make a reservation!", 
            "omg.  the <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> here are absolutely the best.  loads of crabmeat and cooked to perfection.  the side of <mark>Crispy Brussels Sprouts</mark> were perfect as well. yum. yum.", 
            "joe's has the best surf and turf on the las vegas strip! amazing filet, unbelievably delicious lobster. and it doesn't stop there, as you can imagine with the other reviews. everything from the <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark>, to phenomenally fresh salads, and all the pies and cakes, joe's has it all. service is always top notch, as is the atmosphere. it's always an amazing experience, whether you go in for a quick lunch or have a nice big family dinner and awesome wine.", 
            "omg yes. as vegas locals and major foodies we rarely eat the same place twice, this place is so serious the food is amazing. dover sole is out of this world, best <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> and whale. you would never think the price is so great especially with the impeccable service. thomas the maitre d' is beyond kind and makes the experience great. love it here."

            "joe's is a staple for us in vegas--we just cannot get <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> this tasty anywhere back home.  on our most recent visit, i tried my very first whole lobster!!!  it was beautiful and buttery and delicious.  we also had one of the suggested dinners with the large <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, and some kind of potatoes i think.  with the tasty pumpernickel raisin bread (and others), giant lobster, crab claws, and the obligatory slice of their award-winning key lime pie, we were stuffed to the brim! (sorry sides.)  \n\non past visits we've also had steak (well executed), the <mark>Fried Oysters</mark> (super delish!) and lobster bisque (also delish, but they didn't have it this last time).  \n\nas their name implies, you seriously can't come here without getting yourself some sweet, meaty <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws with the sweet mustardy sauce that they have perfected!!!  we settle for truluck's all you can eat <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> on mondays sometimes when we have a real hankering, but no one does it like joe.", 
            "five stars for the food, three stars for the waitress who was efficient but unfriendly. \n\neverything a la carte. ordered the <mark>Fried Oysters</mark> for appetizer which was great because they used fresh oysters. my <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> was a perfect medium rare and my friend's <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was awesome.... but they could lighten on that sweet sauce they use. he scraped most of it off the surface. the saut\\u00e9ed garlic spinach was good.\n\ni made a reservation, came a bit early so decided to take the first available table in the lounge area. high tables with higher chairs... should've waited for the main dining area. anyway i made the reservation on open table via yelp but they didn't check me in so i received an email about not honoring my reservation. \n\njust fyi, make sure they check you in so you get credit on your open table account.", 
            "after roaming around aimlessly for a good hour looking for a place to dine we came upon joe's, and i'm super glad that we did. \n\natmosphere was pretty classy. all the servers in suits and bow ties. fancy.\n\nservice was excellent! our waiter, i believe his name was dave, was on point with his description of the menu as if he wrote it himself, attentive, and funny.\n\nfood: \n-<mark>Fried Calamari</mark> - cooked perfectly, batter was amazing. 5/5\n-<mark>Fried Oysters</mark> - ^^^ the same. 5/5\n-clam chower - 5/5 wish i had more space in my belly.\n-large <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> - they weren't joking about the claw size. meaty, and sweet 5/5\n-<mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> bone-in - was kinda charred, and a little dry. 3/5\n-key lime pie - this was the best key lime pie i've ever had in my life. i would totally order this again. 5/5+\n-1.5lb alaskan king crab - now this was the jewel of my meal. the biggest <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> i've ever had the pleasure of shoving in my face hole. 5/5++++\n\nwhat made my dinning experience a bit better was that we had a party of 8 and when they sat us, they took us to a private room dinning room away from all the \"commoners.\" lol. honestly, felt like we had a private dinning experience. super vip status. want to dine here again the next time i'm in town, but may just stick with the seafood.", 
            "we were addicted, the <mark>Fried Oysters</mark> kept us coming back for more.  the steaks are not too bad either.  above all, the service was outstanding.  great vibe at the bar and selection of wine and cocktails are excellent. my only complaint, is why are you not in new york?", 
            "what can you say about joe's besides they do crab right. it was a great lunch here at joe's at caesars palace in vegas. we got the ceviche, <mark>Fried Oysters</mark> and <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws. the ceviche was good but a little too spicy for my wife. the <mark>Fried Oysters</mark> were excellent. the crab was amazing as it always is at joe's. the service was very good and it was a great place to sit, eat and relax right after a 5.5 hour flight."

            "first night on our honeymoon, we got to joe's around 10:15pm right before closing at 10:30.  we sat at a table near the bar.  our waitress came over and got our drink order, and about 10 minutes later they finally arrived with some bread selections.  other people have commented that their bread was warm, but ours was cold.  the selection of different choices was a treat, and the lavashe covered with melted parmesan cheese went well with my bacardi and tonic.  for our meal my wife and i decided to share an order of 7 large <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws, <mark>Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail</mark>, <mark>Oysters Rockefeller</mark>, and the aged 16 oz ny steak.  everything, and i mean everything was top notch.  the oysters were filled with bacon, cheese, and spinach; the <mark>Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail</mark>, while not quite morton's grade, was  tasty and had nice sized shrimp, the steak was thick, juicy, and cooked to a perfect medium rare, and the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>.....words cannot explain how good these were.  growing up in a pan-asian setting in hawaii, there are very few sea foods that i haven't tried.  from jellyfish salad, to raw squid, we have it all there.  i've had dungenous, maryland blue, king, snow, and last night finally, i got to cross <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> off my list.  while pricy at about  $60 for 7 large pieces, they are divine.  huge fatty pieces of perfect claw meat await you after taking off the pre-cracked shell.  follow that up with a dip in joe's famous mayo sauce, and you have the food that the gods were suckled on.  and oh yeah, we ordered a bottle of bubbly to compliment the sea food, and  cut the fattiness of the of the steak.  overall, a great meal, and a great start to our honeymoon in vegas.  i would eat here every week if i could, but at $300 including tip, i wouldn't be able to make my car payment.  that being said, the service, although very friendly was slow, and i know that it was because it was so late, and we were literally the last seating, but i have been to places in ny and chicago that were the same caliber of food, had a late res, and they took care of us the entire way.  last night it felt like a great meal, but a little rushed.  never a good feeling when you drop 3 bills for a meal.  so a little our fault, a little theirs.  next time we come, i'll make an earlier res, and hopefully the service will be a little sharper.", 
            "we had heard of joe's and their famous <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> on the food network's \"best thing i ever ate\" so of course it was something we had to try! being that they \"regenerate\" their claws i also felt like we were being eco-friendly haha :)\n\nonce we sat down it was clear the place was classy. the table setting, the server, geez even the bread - everything was high quality. we didn't want to waste our tummy space on bread but each one (there were at least 5 different kinds) was yummy. next i had <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> (which was funny cuz we were at caesar's palace) and a chardonnay, while my husband had <mark>Oysters Rockefeller</mark> and a \"fat tire\" (since we don't have this beer where we live) - all were pleasant. but then the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> came and we dug in! they crack them perfectly so it's very easy to get the meat - and boy there's alotta meat in those suckas. we shared a small order and it was plenty. i know everyone raves about the special sauce but i would've preferred the option of just plain drawn butter to enjoy the true flavor of the crab.\n\nall in all, it's a must try. i dined in shorts and a tank top but felt like a million bucks at joe's!", 
            "this was my first visit to joe's and i had the <mark>Oysters Rockefeller</mark> for appetizer. unbelievably delicious! i also had the bacon wrapped scallops and they were also very very tasty and cooked perfectly. the service was also superb. i will come back here everytime i'm in vegas. this is one of the best seafood restaurant's i've ever been to. i was really amazed with the prices also. not overly expensive compared to other seafood places.",

            "i usually have to stop here at least once every time i make the trip out to las vegas.  came in on the first night of a 6 day trip and decided to have joe's for dinner.  for a saturday night there was no wait and we were seated immediately.\n\nthe usual variety bread/pastry basket is brought to the table at the beginning of the meal.\n\nfor the entree i decided to have the select <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws.  according to our waiter, the select <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> are a bit larger than the medium and <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> are less \"grainy\".  for our side dishes we had the garlic spinach, lyonnaise potatoes, and a <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>.\n\nselect <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> - 6 claws per order and they were delicious as usual. the crab meat a has a very light and sweet taste to it. served with their signature mustard sauce.  if you don't know about <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> then you're really missing out.  these are from the gulf of mexico where they harvest remove one of the claws from the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> and throw it back in the water for it to re-generate its missing claw.  \n\ngarlic spinach - sautee'd with a lot of garlic.  i am a garlic lover myself but the garlic was a little too overpowering to go with the sweet flavor of the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>.  this is probably a good dish if you order a red meat dish.\n\nlyonnaise potatoes - these are one of my favorite side dishes of any restaurant.  the potatoes are soft and somewhat scalloped, lightly seasoned, and browned for a crispy upper crust.\n\ncreamed corn - the corn has sweet taste to it with just the right amount of cream and just the right amount of corn.\n\nall in all a great dining experience and a perfect start to any vegas trip for me.", 
            "this version of joe's <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> must be the more, well to do brother of the original location, as the decor and atmosphere is so opposite of the south beach restaurant.  having dined at both,  i was a little disappointed to find the las vegas branch more \"corporate\" - the typical look and feel for an upscale steakhouse.\n\nthe fillet itself was not particularly memorable and having not been particularly impressed with the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> at the miami location, i figured that i would give it another try.  i was more impressed with the thickness of <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> of the crab, dumb i know, but i came away with this experience realizing that i did not have an appreciation for <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>, i simply can't tell the difference between it and it's more simple sibling, the crab.\n\nthe only real highlight was the crab and artichoke gratin appetizer - quite rich and gooey and i would order it again if i opted to try <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> for a third time, but honestly, i think i'll pass on them for something tastier.", 
            "didn't your mom ever tell you not to play with your food?\nwell, that rule does not apply here!\nso roll up your sleeves, pick off <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> (while sucking every ounce of flavor off from every single piece!) and devour yourself into these heavenly tasting <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>!!\nyou will not forget but crave for more and more!\n\nwhile you're there, i also recommend the <mark>Oysters Rockefeller</mark>... it was so good i wanted to lick the remaining off <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark>... the best i ever had. and chopped lettuce, tomato onion & bleu cheese... it had real bacon crisped to perfection, flavored oil of some sort (maybe from bacon) was definitely a positive addition!\nand please don't forget the key lime pie!! like everything we had for dinner, this too was full of flavors! yum!\n\nnot only the was the food excellent, but staff also seemed to have been perfected! highly recommended!", 
            "after my first visit to joe's in chicago, i was hooked, yet also saddened that there was no manhattan location.  so, imagine my pleasant surprise when i saw the las vegas destination listed on opentable.  i made a note of this exciting fact and convinced my friend to try it during our trip to the crazy city.\n\nthe lunch hour brought a substantial crowd to the outpost at casear's palace, and we had to wait quite a while only to grab two stools at the packed bar.  our busy and bland waitress/bartender did little to speed up our dining adventure.  we dug through our varied bread basket, each new roll or flat bread an exciting discovery.  \n\nwe each ordered the seafood <mark>Joe's <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark></mark>, the dish that joe's had won me over with.  the large bowl of mixed greens was topped with slices of hard-boiled egg, cubes of cheese, and various fresh vegetables.  large succulent shrimp, flavorful lobster claw meat, and chunky alaskan king crab were scattered throughout the plate.  <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> tasted fresh from the sea, perfectly crisp and tender.  in terms of dressing, i had requested the joe's vinaigrette on the side, but was told that it usually comes with the creamy italian instead.  however, the waitress offered to bring me a cup of each, which i was so thankful for.  the house dressing was more like an oily, garlicky salsa with chunks of ripe tomato.  the italian vinaigrette was also delicious, with a light-bodied seasoning.  since the joe's version contained vegetable pieces, you could basically spice up your salad with drizzles of each.  this fresh meal was what health food dreams are made of, and the bread basket alone is reason enough to dine here.  \n\njoe's is a fantastic chain seafood house that far surpasses expectations.  for all of its touristy, casual dining attributes, it will blow you away with its high-quality ingredients and traditional preparations.", 
            "this is not your average joe. the food here is pretty spectacular. \n\ncame here for the famous <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> and enjoyed them. i hear that <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> are a florida thing so i bet they are better fresh there but these were pretty darn good. they give you a plate full of just the claws bingo or should i say keno since it's vegas.  it's my favorite part of the crab and the meat has a nice sweetness to it.  to top it all off the crabs come already cracked for you. no more man vs. crab, a battle i've lost many times. you practically just slide <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> right off.   i left with no chipped teeth and without any scratches yea-ah. \n\nalso had a nice ahi salad and the <mark>Crab Bisque</mark>. both were delicious.  a nice light lunch except for the bloody mary. \n\nthe bloody mary here was the best i've ever had and i don't normally like bloody mary. it was like a meal in itself. came with a large stalk of celery and these excellent tomato olives.  asked for it spicy so it had a nice kick to it. very flavorful and went well with the crab. no cocktail sauce needed after drinking that cocktail.\n\nall in all a good place. it's not a hole in the wall type of place but it does burn a hole in your pocket. it's a bit on the pricy side but that's to be expected. i mean hey i don't see crab growing anywhere near vegas. it's expensive to ship them in and i'll gladly pay anyone to crack my crabs for me.", 
            "i am all for joe's.\ni came here for dinner during a business trip to las vegas and was not disappointed.  the service was terrific and the food was great. the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> did not disappoint and i appreciated that they cracked <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> before serving it to you! i really enjoyed the horseradish dipping sauce that accompanied the crab and the <mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark> fries. \ni also enjoyed a couple of dirty vodka martini's and the bartender made them perfectly! i would go back for the drinks alone.", 
            "i am a huge seafood fan, so when it comes to seafood i want the best quality.  i will pay good money for that quality too!  \n\nthe seafood here is too good to be true.  i went there this past weekend for my valentine's dinner.  we had the medium order of <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>, and the order of <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>.  the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> is kind of tedious to eat since the meat really sticks to <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark>, but it tastes so fresh, you will want to make sure you get every single piece of meat off the claws.  the sauce it comes with is very flavorful too.  mm hmm..to die for!  the king crabs....are definitely king.  they're huge!  they are not your average size <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> you find in the buffet.  these are like 1 inch in diamater thick <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>.  they come pre cracked so you don't have to deal with cracking them yourself.  instead, enjoy them with your bowl of drawn butter.  so fresh, so good, so meaty, and well worth the $60 you'll pay for them.  \n\nfor sides, we had the <mark>Steamed Asparagus</mark>, and the pan roasted corn. the asparagus was bland, but the corn was delicious!  i've never had pan roasted.  i like the texture!\n\nfor dessert we had the havana dream pie and a cappucino.  the pie was super tasty and yummers.  a little too much custard, but i like the white cake it lays on.  so good!  cappucino was of course excellent. \n\nnice atmosphere as well, with nice wait service.  the maitre'd was super nice too.  i recommend this place for a fancy date dinner if you both love seafood.  i had a great time there! =)", 
            "love the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws and the king crab here is excellent as well.  <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws might be difficult to eat and <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> is very thick but the flavor is very mild and the sauce is a perfect compliment.\n\nthe new york steak is one of the better steaks i've had.  not as good as mastro's or the sw steakhouse at the wynn but very good.\n\nhaven't been in a year so i need to head out to vegas soon and stop by.", 
            "i was very disappointed.  i have been wanting to dine here for a while -  it has been years since i first tried <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> in florida.  i finally had the opportunity and was going to splurge a bit, but what a waste of money.\ni ordered the medium plate of <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws (their smallest choice @ $34.95) and also got the cup of <mark>Crab Bisque</mark> to start.  \nthe soup tasted nice, but the texture was off.  it looked like the fat was starting to separate out of the cream soup.  i know bisque is fattening, but i really don't want to see the oil slick at the top of the bowl.\nmy main disappointment was in the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws.  the texture of the crab meat was wet.  now, i probably should have guessed that they would have been previously frozen, but somehow i expected them  to have a way of doing this that wouldn't hurt the texture of the crab so noticeably.  \n<mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> on <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> is quite thick, so they pre-crack the claws for you.  i don't remember ever having this problem before, but  with about every other bite, i was getting small bits of shell in my mouth  that i was then trying to discreetly spit out.  it just wasn't worth the $50 for my lunch.  about half way through the meal i grew tired of the crab and didn't even finish it.  that hurts me just to type it.", 
            "loved it!  had the select <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> which were awesome and so was <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> oysters.  do not get the mac and cheese though.  it was dry and not very cheesy at all.  we also had the bacon wrapped scallops which were yummy.  i was so full i didn't get to eat any desserts but next time i will try to key lime pie.",

            "i went to joe's for the first time last night.  i was with a group of 14 people, 10 of whom were in from out of town and it was their pick.  as a local, who doesn't smoke or gamble i spend very little time on the strip and do my best to find great off strip bars and restaurants.  joe's is worth braving the traffic and tourists!   \n\nwe were given a private room with a fantastic server, thomas.  everything was absolutely fantastic.  we started with the appetizer called the second mortgage.  it has jumbo shrimp, lobster cocktail, alaskan king crab and shrimp & <mark>Shrimp & Scallop Ceviche</mark>.  the seafood was fresh, beautifully presented and delicious.  next i had the stone <mark>Crab Bisque</mark>, which was silky, flavorful and actually contained small pieces of <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>.  i ordered the <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> which were huge, amazingly tasty and probably 95% crab with just enough filler to keep them from falling apart.  \n\nmy bf had the bone in rib eye which was quite possibly the best steak i've ever tasted.  it was a beautiful, extremely high quality cut of meat that was cooked to a perfect medium rare.  others in my party had the bone in filet which was also high quality and cooked perfectly.  also, one other ordered the dover sole, which i highly recommend.  it was fresh and cooked perfectly.  it was also expertly and impressively deboned table side.  the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> are also very good.  they come pre-cracked so; all you have to do is peel back <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> pieces and savor the incredibly sweet <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> meat.  for dessert we tried the blueberry pie a la mode, the key lime pie and the banana cream pie, all of which are made fresh in house daily and were incredible.   however, the banana cream pie was a standout.  it was amazing!\n\neverything from the atmosphere, the service and the food were incredible.", 
            "i was looking forward to finally trying joe's <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>. i have seen on it tv shows, heard great things from others who have been there, and thought i was going to be in for a treat. unfortunately i was sadly mistaken. i went with the big <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> and we had the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, pan roasted sweet corn, <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>, lyonnaise with some <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark>. the oysters and sides were good and so was the wine (rioja) but the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> was a flop. now maybe it was because they weren't in season and if that was the case i will research and try them again when they are in season. what will make me seek out a different restaurant to try them in was the service. we had two tables with a total of 15 people. for the two tables we were given one waitress who was very slow. forget about the fact it took forever for us to get a drink order in, it took even longer for the drinks to finally arrive. overall it was a disappointing experience at what should have been an excellent restaurant. my company is in vegas twice a year and i was hoping this would be a restaurant that would be on our annual list, but it was so bad we skipped dessert and had cigars and after dinner drinks somewhere else instead.", 
            "had a great birthday dinner here, the food and the service were superb.  first, you start off the dinner with an amazing basket of bread, there's a great variety and everything was yummy, but my favorite was the flatbread.  they make it fresh at the restaurant, and it is super crispy and tasty.  <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> - amazing!  i loved all the sauces that accompanied it and the miniature tabasco sauce was super cute.  also loved the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> but felt like it was a bit overpriced, the best thing about them was the sauce.  their <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was cooked perfectly.  the only thing mediocre was the pork chop.  i guess you should stick to seafood here.  overall, great dining experience, i'd definitely come back.", 
            "restaurant week is in full swing, and we are now 4 for 4! last night diane and i dined at joe's, and it was another great meal! \n\nwe arrived for dinner on thursday at 5:45 p.m., 15 minutes before our reservation, and were seated right away. by 7:00 p.m. the main dining room was almost completely full. we had never been here before, and i was a bit intimidated at first as i approached the high reception stand where a man in a jet black tuxedo with jet black hair towered over me. but he was friendly and professional, as were all of the other black bow-tied, black tuxedoed, and white aproned restaurant personnel we encountered during our visit. i had only seen the bar and mall dining areas before, and thought they comprised the whole restaurant. not so! we were ushered through a curtain to a very elegant dining room that had decorative lights on the wall and a decidedly new york city clubby steakhouse feel to it, with much dark wood and brown leather, white tablecloths, and several tables surrounded by comfortable booths along both main walls. it was very sophisticated but not pretentious, as were the several servers who moved briskly about like busy bees. it was interesting just watching them in action. \n\nwe went with the restaurant week menu, but augmented it with a two-claw appetizer of <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws and king crab mac & cheese. i always wondered whether i would be able to eat <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws because their ends look like elongated fingers painted with black nail polish. but it was easier than i thought, since that part of the claw is left alone. the claws arrived from the kitchen already largely crushed by a mallet, so it was not that difficult to pry apart the porcelain-like shell casing to get at the meat underneath. but there seemed to be less meat than found in alaskan crab claws. the thin morsels of crab meat tasted fine either dipped in drawn butter, the mild mustard sauce that was provided, or just eaten straight out of <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark>. yet i noted that they were not as sweet or satisfying as king crab claw meat. and, at about $22 for two claws, they were not cheap. so, for me, it is now \"been there, done that!\" but i will definitely return to joe's for its other fine fare, including lobster and king crab. \n\nalthough this was hardly needed, an assortment of bread products tasted good with the soft pats of butter provided. and a bowl of stone <mark>Crab Bisque</mark> was sweet and smooth--simply exquisite in taste and texture. i liked it better without the garnish of tiny cuts of carrots and zucchini that we asked to have served on the side, since diane's yelp nickname is \"veggie hater\" for a reason. but i picked the delicate morsels of <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> out of the garnish and tossed them in the wonderful soup, which avoided an inexcusable wasting of fine crab particles and made the soup even tastier. \n\na large <mark>Joe's <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark></mark> of lettuce, tomato, onion, and <mark>Chopped Lettuce, Tomato, Onion & Blue Cheese</mark> crumbles with a fine vinaigrette dressing was quite satisfying. my 8 oz. <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> with drinkable bearnaise sauce was simply divine. it was well seasoned on top, perfectly medium rare inside as ordered, and did literally melt in my mouth. i liked it better without the house seasonings, which i tried on a couple of bites. it was one of those steaks that kept getting better and better as slices of beef moved toward the rarer center. \n\ndiane's moist halibut had a tasty parmesan crust, augmented by a buerre blanc-like sauce that was provided. it was notably flatter than many servings of halibut experienced at other restaurants, but of ample portion size. the king crab mac & cheese, made with white shells, hunks of king crab, and bechamel sauce, tasted good, but was not nearly as noteworthy as the sumptuous <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> that were covered with a mix of baked asiago cheese and breadcrumbs. and, few lobster chunks were included in the dish. <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> was creamy as billed, and quite tasty. \n\njoe's signature key lime pie arrived ultra cold and almost frozen. after trying one bite, i let my slice sit for 5 minutes, and then it was just right, having lost its icy taste. it was very tart and delicious. \n\npeppermint gelato with hot fudge was not as memorable as the key lime pie, but the melted hot fudge was delicious. it had the strong taste of peppermint, and every now and then surprised the palate with peppermint candy chips. i would have preferred this dish during the christmas season! \n\nall in all, a wonderful five-star meal!", 
            "these <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> are expensive as hell.  its like eating gold from a crab claw.  the meat is sweet and tender.  <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> are very thick.  never seen anything like it.  $50 for 5 large claws is crazy.  i opted for the select or medium size claws for $36.  you get 6 of them i believe.  its def worth trying.  the bisque here is super creamy.  if you want fatty thighs like me eat a bowl of this.  it was like eating a bowl full of butter.  yumma.", 
            "ok so when my buddy tells me \"don't even think of coming home without going to this place\"\nwell not much convincing being that i love seafood and steak...\nlet me tell you something... it really doesn't get much better than this place. the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> is out of this world, cooked to perfection and the bring it to you with <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> already cracked so there is no fight when it comes to getting to the meat- you just basically peal the broken pieces off and ohh man.... it just melts in your tongue and their mustard sauce is the icing on the cake. i also tried the fillet mignon which was amazing!", 
            "i am far from a steak and/or seafood connoisseur but as a food fanatic - i know a good steak and a good seafood joint when i eat at one. despite all the great reviews joe's received i'd have to say i'm rather disappointed. i'd rather give joe's 2.5 stars if i could but it was a touch below a-okay and i indeed have experienced better. but the prices were rather fair (steak and lobster wise). \n\nambiance was rather lively and loud. i would recommend this place more so for a fun date or a night out with the boys but not for romance due to noise levels. the host stand was very professional but gave a bit of a condescending presence as they tower over you and look down at you when being assisted. \nthe wait staff was full and plenty as we sat by what seemed to be the kitchen door. like worker ants they would file out of one door with food and in another door with empty plates. i don't recall our servers name but when we sat right around 7 o'clock service was top notch. there was other tables around us and we all seemed to have the proper amount of attention. food was brought out in a timely manner as were drinks. but the minute a large group sat next to us - we were no longer top priority. i understand this concept as i used to be a waiter myself - but it doesn't justify the action. after our main courses were dropped off - we ate. but with the larger group near by - we no longer got service. no one checked to see if we needed anything else. or if everything even tasted okay. we finished off our wine and our water and no refills were offered either. instead we ate our food and waited. when my brother asked for tabasco or steak sauce - we were told it was coming. but no one came. he asked a second time but again we were no longer a priority. \n\nthe food itself was mediocre. coming from seattle we have an abundance of steak houses and seafood so my standard is set high. the <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> i had was good. but far from great. tender and juicy and a very basic seasoning (i'm guessing just salt and pepper) nothing about it to set it above the rest. could have made the same dish buying a package of prime grade beef at costco. the lobster tail was a little under cooked for my taste. a little bit of a slimy texture in the center. and it was served in the tail (cut in half) on my plate which made it a little harder to eat as i'm used to (steak houses i go to), the waiter usually removes the tail from <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> before i consume it. i had no extra plate to place <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> on and i didn't find it appropriate to leave it on the table. so i worked around it. but i will say for $59.95 it was a fairly priced meal. my brother on the other hand had the <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> and <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>. we were \"sold\" that they were huge legs and delicious. fresh and great! when they came out... there was a measley (maybe) one leg cut into three pieces. not much bigger than snow crab. not huge, barely delicious... and if it wasn't for the melted butter - i wouldn't consider it very great.\ngiven that i have had true <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> before - a single leg about 2 feet in length and about 3 inches in diameter with claws the size of my hand... so yes my idea is skewed. but can i be blamed for expecting the best at a restaurant that self proclaims itself as the best in vegas?\n\nas we finished our meal - we had to waive a busser down to find our waiter to close our tab out. in the end... after rockerfeller oysters, kumoto oysters, <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>, <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> with lobster and king crab, and two glasses of wine. i can say... meh - i've experienced better.", 
            "i used to go to joes fairly often but the last few years i haven't been at all since a few weeks ago where i had dinner with my girlfriend and another couple and everything was superior.  my girlfriend and i have pretty much been to every high end steakhouse in town joe's is here new favorite spot!  the bone-in filet started at joe's and is the still the best @ joe's. we had a <mark>Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail</mark> that was great. all the sides are great, all the pies and desserts are great, especially the banana cream pie!  also, for what we got the prices are fairly reasonable compared to comparable places like the palm or morton's---they do get you <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> but that is common!  def give this place a try but make a reservation way ahead of time because it is a fairly small place and usually books up!",

            "i have passed this restaurant on every visit to the forum shoppes.  never thought once to eat there, as i have never been a fan of eating in the mall.  after reading all of the positive comments from fellow yelpers and on opentable, i finally decided to give it a shot.  \n\nthe host/maitre'd was such a friendly fellow that made you feel so welcomed.  he is perfect for his position.  he welcomed us in and offered us an inside seat or an outside seat - we chose inside, as i was  not into watching all of the shoppers on the outside.  cozy setting on the inside.  \n\nwas i wrong about this place.  it was so freakin' good.  the first offer you 5 different kinds of breads - who would think a place like this  makes their own breads?!  there was a ciabatta, lavosh, olive bread, pretzel roll and a dinner roll.  i was impressed.  \n\nwe had to try the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> - pricey - $10 a crab, we had the large size - server's recommendation.  you can order as many as you want.  don't have to go by what's printed on the menu.  she said it fell off <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> better.  it was really tasty and the mustard sauce was really good.  i am not a saucey person, but it certainly complemented the crab.  \n\nwe had the <mark>Manhattan Clam Chowder</mark> and the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> next.  both were also very good.  i had the salmon next and it was outstanding.  it was a special of the day.  it was cooked to perfection.  \n\nthe best part of the meal was dessert - the blueberry pie with vanilla ice cream was soooo good.  you can order a 1/2 slice of pie - my recommendation.  but the best dessert was the peppermint ice cream with the hot fudge.  hot dang!!!!  this was the best ever.....  this hit the spot and made this my favorite place to dine.  \n\nservice was very attentive.  waters and lemonade always filled.  dirty dishes removed promptly and the server was nice and friendly.  i am so happy i finally tried this place out.  it took me long enough, but i will be going back again.",

            "this was quite a unexpected surprise - there are so many great restaurants in las vegas and i've been fortunate enough to have experienced a fair share of them over the years. one of my associates made a reservation for the six of us attending a trade show at the convention center and picked joe's for dinner one night. i really never had the chance to read the reviews so i really walked in blind. we arrived a little late for our scheduled time but we were immediately seated and from that moment on it was incredible. \n\nour server greeted us and took our drink orders and interacted with our entire group like she had known us for years. i started with my usual ketel one martini up, a little dirty with cheese stuffed olives it came out ice cold and filled to the brim. although it's a rather simple drink to make some struggle, so by no means are they all created equal. the way i see it the difference between the okay ones and the outstanding ones are some are just poured and some are crafted it was apparent after the first sip this was definitely a crafted one that was executed by a professional mixologist. i validated this by enjoying several more and they all were outstanding as the first.\n\ni ordered raw <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> for my appetizer from a impressive selection of oysters that are flown in daily, they came out very clean with most of the natural liquor retained requiring nothing but a slight dash of tabasco and a hint of horseradish. there was plenty of time to enjoy these along with our first round of refreshments since they we're delivered and eaten before our salads orders were taken absolutely no rush here our server's timing was impeccable.  we had our second round of cocktails delivered while we place our second course selections - i chose the pork belly wedge salad with ranch dressing, a hint of balsamic vinegar, vine ripened tomatoes and may-tag <mark>Chopped Lettuce, Tomato, Onion & Blue Cheese</mark> crumbles. again i can't stress enough this salad was a creation in itself perfectly assembled on a chill plate with exact portions of each ingredient. the pork belly was crisp, succulent and plentiful this is nothing remotely similar to the typical <mark>Blt Wedge</mark> salad so common at so many restaurants. \n\nonce we had a few moments to enjoy these wonderful salads we were advised to put in our entree orders. the steak and seafood selections are amazing and i'm sure anything i'd pick would be wonderful but the prime cut bone-in filet was taunting my palette and having this special cut prepared a few degrees over rare was impossible to resist, this accompanied by grilled verse steam asparagus my experience was only going to improve by leaps and bounds if that was possible after experience the first two courses. it's such a treat to have a server who understands her clientele and being this was a business meeting she was very attentive but was able to break in at precisely the right times to explain the specials, take the drink orders or to simple ensure our evening was proceeding as we had hoped and update us on the delivery of our food. \n\nthe entrees arrived fresh from the kitchen warm and accurate the portions were extreme, we also had multiple sides to share amongst the 6 of us and really there was more food than any of us could have eaten no matter the time frame. i decided to pass on the shared sides and focus my attention on the bone-in filet which was prepared to my exact specifications (if you've never experience this cut its a bucket list item for sure) fortunately i've been able to have this cut many times over the years even though it not a common cut you can find at just any steakhouse. \n\nthese bone-in, prime grade, <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> are at the top of my list when it comes to that magical blend of tender, juicy, and flavorful.\rtrimmed perfectly and generously portioned, this steak is begging for a rare to medium rare preparation. unlike a <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> on it's own, this steak is best cooked slow to maximize the flavor that comes from a bone-in steak and this was one of the best examples i've ever cut into. after experiencing this grand finale of a steak it would be pointless to continue, joe's far exceeded any expectations i had and this meal will surely be mentioned in future conversations with my small group of associates when we're looking for our next exquisite dining adventure...enjoy!"

            "great food & great service!! even though we were about 15-20 minutes late, we were greeted warmly and got seated right away. \ncrabs at joe's are to die for...and so are their bone-in steaks. i got the bone-in <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> and it was cooked perfectly and super tasty. oh don't forget about their potato dishes! i am not a big fan of potato but i just can't get my fork off the plate! and i don't mean ordinary potato dishes like <mark><mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark></mark> or mashed potato, try lyonnaise potato or jennie's potato! and considering how big the portions are with great flavors, it definitely worth every penny. one thing about the <mark>Manhattan Clam Chowder</mark> though...is that it's not the white-creamy chowder that you get, it was more like...borshch-tomato style soup. besides that, everything else was perfect and i will definitely go back again when i visit vegas next time!", 
            "i am very familiar with the original joe's on south beach and just happend to stumble on this one in vegas while looking for a place for lunch...i was not disappointed. \n we were greeted with a basket of warm fresh breads including their delicious pretzel bread. i ordered the <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark> that was loaded with shrimp, crab and lobster  and it was great. others on the table had the lobster, <mark>Manhattan Clam Chowder</mark>,  oysters and <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> and all raved about it. we finished the meal by sharing thier keylime pie....it too was super yummy. \nthis might be the best lunch in vegas", 
            "we went to joe's with an extremely large group.  we had some drinks at the bar and each of us was charge a gratuity of 18% on our tab.  after our bar drinks, we received no service from the waitress on beverages.\n\nwe ordered all of the sides, soups and salads on the menu and especially lots of snow crab.  we heard great things about the restaurant and unfortunately our experience did not match other's experiences.  the snow crab was significantly smaller than del frisco's double eagle steak house, where we ate the previous night.  we recommend del frisco.  the snow crab seemed to have been frozen for a very long time; it was fishy, grainy, and not well cooked.  the frozen taste was strong throughout our entire order of crabs.  it was so far from fresh and tasted terrible.  even the horseradish sauce could not hide the low quality taste.\n\nthe artichoke and crab dip appetizer was excellent.\n\nthe <mark>Manhattan Clam Chowder</mark> soup was tomato based, salty, and tons of dirt grains.  it was difficult to consume with every taste full of grains. this was the worst soup on the menu.  the <mark>Crab Bisque</mark> was great.  \n\nthe plain potato hash browns were good.  they are boiled potatoes that are placed in a baking dish and toasted on the top.  not great but good.  the lyonnaise however, was not pleasant.  it was overfilled with caramelized onions, which were so overpowering you could not taste the potato.  \n\nthe <mark>Joe's Cole Slaw</mark> had an interesting unique tangy taste.  the texture of the <mark>Joe's Cole Slaw</mark> seemed prepackaged, over shredded, soggy consistency, and poor preparation.   again, the taste was very unique.  our group ate the least of this item.  the corn was not sweet; it had several bell peppers and way too much seasoning.  the spinach had too much cream.  the other sides were all very standard.\n\nthe key lime pie had a nice strong, sour, and thick creamy filling.  the gram cracker crust was over sugared and too thick.   \n\nworst of all, after such a disappointing dinner, our waitress made the mistake of charging our group the entire tab multiple times.  several of us were charged the entire bill.  we brought this to the manager's attention and he had no idea as to how to handle the situation.  we had to break it down to the waitress and explain to her the billing error.  she had a difficult time understanding how to correct and reverse the charges.  we're still waiting on verification from our banks of the reversals, since the restaurant clearly cannot be relied on.  \n\noverall we would not recommend this restaurant.  perhaps, at one time the vegas location was of comparable quality to their other chains, but unfortunately this is no longer true.", 
            "came here just to try the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>.  \n\ntried the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>, <mark>Manhattan Clam Chowder</mark>, and the stone <mark>Crab Bisque</mark>.  <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> is not as easy to eat as they do on tv.  a lot of cartilage and broken shells to contend with.  by itself, the flavor was fine but the mustard sauce really made it.  i think i'd rather have dungeness crab, more economical.  <mark>Manhattan Clam Chowder</mark> was ok,  bisque was a bit rich and a bit salty for my taste.  what else do you expect from something that came from the sea, you ever drank seawater?  \n\nwe sat in the bar area which made the atmosphere busy.  service was quick.  it is a good place to try, but i won't repeat.  i'm wonder if it didn't appear that great to me because of the hype and expectation i was given, with this restaurant and especially <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>.  i would be great to try it again but there are a lot of places left to try in vegas.  not enough time and not enough money.", 
            "i have passed this restaurant on every visit to the forum shoppes.  never thought once to eat there, as i have never been a fan of eating in the mall.  after reading all of the positive comments from fellow yelpers and on opentable, i finally decided to give it a shot.  \n\nthe host/maitre'd was such a friendly fellow that made you feel so welcomed.  he is perfect for his position.  he welcomed us in and offered us an inside seat or an outside seat - we chose inside, as i was  not into watching all of the shoppers on the outside.  cozy setting on the inside.  \n\nwas i wrong about this place.  it was so freakin' good.  the first offer you 5 different kinds of breads - who would think a place like this  makes their own breads?!  there was a ciabatta, lavosh, olive bread, pretzel roll and a dinner roll.  i was impressed.  \n\nwe had to try the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> - pricey - $10 a crab, we had the large size - server's recommendation.  you can order as many as you want.  don't have to go by what's printed on the menu.  she said it fell off <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> better.  it was really tasty and the mustard sauce was really good.  i am not a saucey person, but it certainly complemented the crab.  \n\nwe had the <mark>Manhattan Clam Chowder</mark> and the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> next.  both were also very good.  i had the salmon next and it was outstanding.  it was a special of the day.  it was cooked to perfection.  \n\nthe best part of the meal was dessert - the blueberry pie with vanilla ice cream was soooo good.  you can order a 1/2 slice of pie - my recommendation.  but the best dessert was the peppermint ice cream with the hot fudge.  hot dang!!!!  this was the best ever.....  this hit the spot and made this my favorite place to dine.  \n\nservice was very attentive.  waters and lemonade always filled.  dirty dishes removed promptly and the server was nice and friendly.  i am so happy i finally tried this place out.  it took me long enough, but i will be going back again.", 
            "i never liked eating crab or lobster because i thought it was too much work, but joe's has changed everything. \n\ni was so full from the bread basket, oysters, lobster, and <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> -- and that was just our appetizers.  we also got the <mark>Manhattan Clam Chowder</mark>, which is tomato based fyi, the <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark> was a surprising portion and very light.  for my entree, i got the dover's tail special (?).  i might have spelt that wrong but everything was delicious.  so delicious - i didn't have room for dessert which is absolutely ridiculous for me.  service and food are exceptional -- and it puts quite a dent in your wallet.  without a doubt worth it.  \n\ni would definitely come back to joe's every time i am in vegas now.  \n\nnext time though, i'll order dessert first.", 
            "i cannot believe this place is called joe's <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> just like the one in miami ? it has absolutely nothing to do with the original one, i have been more than 30 times to the original in miami and the only thing i can say is that the one in las vegas is horrible in every way, for example in vegas the <mark>Manhattan Clam Chowder</mark> was not only cold but we had to return it because it tasted like dirty laundry, then we ordered the wedge salad where in miami they bring you a huge portion witch most of times you have to share because it is so big, in vegas they brought me a 1/3 of a half, i returned it telling them that there most be a mistake on the portion, 10 minutes later they brought me the exact same portion telling me that in vegas is a different portion, then we ordered the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>, incredibly they didn't had the most common size witch is the large and told us that they only had the jumbos that were priced about $ 85dls per order,  20 minutes later another person came and told me that they had ran out of the jumbo's but now suddenly they had the large ! so we ordered the large, it was not surprised that when the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> came they were frozen and not good at all,  a fresh <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> should not stick to <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> and this ones were a disgrace for what they charge, the <mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark> fries are completely different as well, and the signature key lime pie is also not made the same way and tasted nothing like the original. if you plan to go to joe's do not consider by any means to go to the one in vegas, it has nothing to do with the original in miami,  i keep asking me why would they change a great menu like the one in miami to make a worst one? please some one tell me ! they should be ashamed to be called joes <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>.",

            "where do i even begin?! i can't say i love this restaurant enough. i've only had the opportunity to eat here three times, and oh my! it is definitely going to be on my to-do list whenever i visit las vegas.\n\nto start off, it's fancy. don't show up in random clothes. the staff is formal, proper, polite, and extremely informative. they all know what they're talking about and help in every way. i would recommend this place to everyone, however, it's not cheap. you definitely pay for what you get! a good meal, at a good spot, with some great company. make a reservation, save some time since they can get swamped with people. i ate here on my birthday and they even threw in some dessert no charge!\n\nat this place, i've had many things but only listing what i can remember:\n\nbread: they serve bread once you sit. don't over-stuff yourself with it. i know it's beyond yummy but save your appetite, it gets better!\n\nnew england <mark>Manhattan Clam Chowder</mark>: i'm not a fan of seafood whatsoever but i don't think this was bad. my bf loves this and orders it all the time. it's a nice portion and fulfilling. \n\n<mark>Caesar Salad</mark>: by far one of the best salads i've had. they split it to share if you ask and it's extremely light. the dressing isn't over-powering which i love, and they never drench it either. \n\ncrab claws: personally, i don't like them but that's only cause i don't like seafood too much. once again, my bf loves them. they come with lemon to add onto them and bring you everything you need to eat them. i love how they bring out hot towels once you're done to clean your hands with. big plus!\n\n<mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark>: ordered a medium piece of meat. wow! soo good and they cooked it just the way i like it. it wasn't dry at all, very similar to medium rare, without all the blood oozing out.\n\n<mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>: omg! this is to die for! i ordered a half order, the portion is quite large with the rest of my meal. they layer them with cheese which gives it a little extra umph!\n\nparmesan crusted halibut: win! i love this dish, everyone should try it. the crisp in each bite is to die for. my favorite thing to get!\n\ni never know the name, but ladies, if you want some alcohol without it being overpowering and overwhelming, try ordering one of their special martini drinks. i always tell the server that i want their \"special peach martini..but i can't think of the name\" and they always know what i'm talking about. the rim is covered in sugar and it is beyond refreshing and tasty. you can't even tell there's alcohol in there... based on the taste! i always get two when i eat here!\n\ni cannot wait to visit this place again. it's a must if you're in vegas!", 
            "- the <mark>Manhattan Clam Chowder</mark> was average \n\n- the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> was nice and meaty\n\n- the king crab was the best i've ever had.  rich and  buttery and that was before i dipped it in butter\n\n- the rib eye was cooked perfectly at medium rare. it was a perfect center cut, with mostly eye and just a sliver of ny strip.  the seasoning made it perfect\n\n- fast, efficient, and friendly service",

            "oh my gosh i love their <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws, it is so fresh you can taste the sweetness from the crab meat, and we ordered the raw oysters, they have different type of oysters but now i can't remember their name, but must try the smaller one, oh my gosh you will feel like you have taste the heaven, i always though that big oyster is the best, not until the waitress recommended me to try the smaller size one, and realize they are actually the best!!! i love their <mark>Manhattan Clam Chowder</mark>, and i love their <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>.   there's many more dishes i would like try, but since i live in l.a., when i have a chance to be there, my top choices are still their <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws and oyster :)", 
            "i had to admit that the atmosphere was nice and the <mark>Manhattan Clam Chowder</mark> was completely exceeding my expectation, however the main dish rib eye and spinach was very disapponiting. we asked for medium, it ended up with at least medium well level and was a bit too salty according to my friend. we obviously did not finish the meat. probably i'm gonna try the crab leg next time, but definitely not the steak.", 
            "all i can say is wow. <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> are the bomb. my first <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> experience did not disappoint. it had the familiar flavor of crab and yet there subtle wonderful new flavors. crab lovers must try thus. also had the manhattan style <mark>Manhattan Clam Chowder</mark>. the acidity of the tomatoes in the chowder was delightful. also had a <mark>Joe's <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark></mark> which served as the perfect acid component to our rich meal. will be back soon.",

            "i was in vegas for vacation of course! i took my family here for my mom's birthday. now i must preface this review by saying my mom is the pickiest eater i know. i've taken her out to eat at many places. i was so happy to hear her saying that this was the best place i've ever taken her and the best sea food she's ever had! she went home and told my dad all about it and got him all jealous he missed out--he's allergic to shellfish!\n\nwe ordered 4 servings of <mark>Manhattan Clam Chowder</mark>, 1 <mark>Grilled Seafood Platter</mark> , 1 pound of the smallest <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws, some brocollini for a side, and 2 kids meals. the <mark>Grilled Seafood Platter</mark> came with scallops, lobster tail, and madagascar shrimp. wow, this is the first time i've actually liked scallops! they were big and meaty! the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws were cold but the meat was sweet and even the small ones had lots of meat! it was like a classier version of the atlantic blue crab that i am so used to eating on the east coast. i was not a fan of the mustard dip that it came with but the crab meat in itself had great flavor. just some lemon juice was enough!\n\nwhat i love about this restaurant is their affordable kids menu so you can bring your kids here and have them eat nice stuff, too! if they can't finish it, you can just get more food for yourself because these kids meals are basically slightly smaller portioned adult meals at like less than half the cost. sure the selection is not as extensive, but if you want <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> or <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark>, these meals are a great price! i brought two younger siblings and one ordered a 6oz <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> and the other mac and cheese. joe's have $17 kids meals with steak and <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> and $9 meals with some kind of starch or chicken nuggets, etc, you know the usual kids stuff. stay away from the $9 meals. the mac and cheese was total crap. easy mac would have been better!! it was more like hard, dry pasta shells and butter. my sister couldn't finish it. the steak however was the same quality as the adult version and cost 1/3 the price for a slightly smaller portion! each kids meal also came with a free side. one sibling picked broccolini and it was the same serving size as the appetizer portion i paid $9 for if not bigger!! seriously (look at the picture i posted). the only difference was the brocollini that came with the kids meal was steamed and the other off the menu was grilled with olive oil. each kids meal also came with the brownie sundae, which i'm pretty sure is the exact same thing they charge adults $8 for on the dessert menu! needless to say, the sundae was delicious. seriously, if you have kids, just use that as an excuse order some stuff for less than half the price on the regular menu.\n\nas for the more adult stuff, i don't think you can go wrong ordering shellfish here. everything tasted amazingly exotic and fresh. you must get the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws! i didn't know that they harvested the claws by taking one claw and throwing the crab back in the ocean! the claw regenerates! gasp! do they rotate which claw they take from the crab? is it the left or right one? i digress. i tried my other sister's steak and it was good but not something amazing (nothing i can't cook at home with a good cut of meat), so i can't say i would recommend the steak over the seafood. stay away from starches like pasta because based on the mac and cheese my sister had, i don't have faith in those dishes. why would you pray premium prices for starch dishes anyway? \n\noh and the complimentary bread was crap. olive garden probably has better. again, i don't think they know how to cook their carbs here.\n\nservice was good. our waitress, mindy, was very knowledgeable about the menu, had good recommendations and checked on us often. she didn't seem super accommodating, however. my mom didn't like her wine and she didn't offer to comp it or take it back. it wasn't that expensive glass of wine either, $8. usually nice restaurants just take stuff you really don't like off the bill and offer to replace it with something else.\n\noh, and don't worry about how to dress at this restaurant. my family showed up in hoodies and jeans and there was no problems getting service. this is touristy vegas!\n\nin the end my bill after tax and tip was over $230. it was worth it though because we left stuffed as a party of 4 (2 adults and 2 teens) and it included alcohol, dessert, and coffee, too! yum!", 
            "back we went to introduce a california couple to joe's seafood prime steak & <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> in the forum shops, with its classic clubby steak house chi-town or nyc ambiance punctuated by black tux-clad waiters, white tablecloths, and black leather booths, coupled with a dash of miami elegance underscored by black-clawed <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> legs.  this elegant restaurant even has a coat check service!\n\ni began with a meaty <mark>Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail</mark> and very good <mark>Manhattan Clam Chowder</mark>, followed by an excellent <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> with anchovies quickly brought forward when i requested them.  this time i concentrated on the sea, and enjoyed an entree of delicious steamed <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> along with some of diane's poached jumbo lobster dipped in drawn butter.  a large side of juicy yet crispy <mark>Hashed Brown</mark> potatoes was particularly noteworthy (and no doubt fattening!).   \n\nservice was very good except diane received unwanted char on her filet and was erroneously told that no vegetables or onions were included in the <mark>Crab Bisque</mark> after she asked for no char and vegetable-free soup.  our guests seemed pleased with the food, service, and ambiance, as was i.\n\nonce again 4 stars overall, and this time almost 5!"

            "i tend to favor restaurants with foofoo menus, the kind of stuff i'd never make at home, with ingredients you'd have to have sent from outer mongolia.  that said, joe's was fantastic.  it's basically <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>, steaks and seafood, but anything but basic.  first of all, i'd give 5 stars just for the best mojitoes i've ever had in my (long) life.  then the meal:  we shared <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws appetizer with a delicious mustardy sauce.  i had stone <mark>Crab Bisque</mark> (seems the thing to do here is enjoy <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>) which was ethereal.  my husband had <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> which were blue crab meat barely held together in a \"cake \" form, there being little or more likely no breading.  just sublime crabmeat.  i had a fantastic idea in menu offerings -- lobster tail tempura.  lobster meat -- 2 large tails.  deep fried in tempura batter.  what in the name of all that is right and holy could be better than that?!  and did i mention the mojitoes?  we also shared their highly touted, rightfully so, <mark>Joe's Cole Slaw</mark> and <mark>French Fried</mark> <mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark> and still managed to save room for dessert.  husband couldn't decide between the coconut cream pie or banana cream pie with foster sauce, so awesome server brought both (for price of one).  i had peach pie with melba sauce.  great location, ambiance and friendly, knowledgeable server.  a great time.",

            "i was very disappointed.  i have been wanting to dine here for a while -  it has been years since i first tried <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> in florida.  i finally had the opportunity and was going to splurge a bit, but what a waste of money.\ni ordered the medium plate of <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws (their smallest choice @ $34.95) and also got the cup of <mark>Crab Bisque</mark> to start.  \nthe soup tasted nice, but the texture was off.  it looked like the fat was starting to separate out of the cream soup.  i know bisque is fattening, but i really don't want to see the oil slick at the top of the bowl.\nmy main disappointment was in the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws.  the texture of the crab meat was wet.  now, i probably should have guessed that they would have been previously frozen, but somehow i expected them  to have a way of doing this that wouldn't hurt the texture of the crab so noticeably.  \n<mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> on <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> is quite thick, so they pre-crack the claws for you.  i don't remember ever having this problem before, but  with about every other bite, i was getting small bits of shell in my mouth  that i was then trying to discreetly spit out.  it just wasn't worth the $50 for my lunch.  about half way through the meal i grew tired of the crab and didn't even finish it.  that hurts me just to type it.", 
            "my husband and i added this restaurant to our registry at honeymoonwishes.com as a gift. our guests paid for our meal. i added this restaurant based on what other yelpers had to say about this restaurant, and this place is a pleaser. make sure you make a reservation. to do this you'll visit the person inside the restaurant who sits in a cubby hole work office outside the host's desk. \n\nonce we arrived our seat was not ready (we didn't wait long 10 minutes), so the host suggested we grab a drink at the bar. the drinks hook you! i had about 4 lemon drop martinis. \n\nthe host is awesome...watch him as he greets people as if he's known him for a long time. the host on shift during our visit was an older guy, tall, whitish hair. he's fabulous. \n\nokay so now the food. short and sweet-<mark>Crab Bisque</mark> (yum) and great presentation. i had scallops wrapped in bacon. each bunch of 4 scallops were wrapped in bacon-so delicious. my husband had rib eye...and he wasn't disappointed. and, of'course the crabs...these were awesome! we had them as an appetizer, but i suggest ordering a full order (we had never had them so we ordered just an appetizer)...if you like crab at all...order a full order...and i would order the medium size-get more meat. and the mustard sauce is yummy!. \n\nstop by this place, the food won't disappoint. \n\noh yeah-the waiter was great too...even let us take a corny love shot while we were there!", 
            "great food! perfectly sized portions! excellent service! you can't go wrong coming here. i took my hubby here for his 30th birthday, and we will definitely be back. we paid about $180 with tip for soup/salad (stone <mark>Crab Bisque</mark> and a salad), entrees (i had the filet and lobster; he had the filet and <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>), side dishes (<mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> and creamed corn), and a couple glasses of wine. not too bad for a special occasion meal!",

            "4 words:  terrible service, great food.\n \nwell, i don't stick to 4 words very well, so here's a few more.\n \nthe restaurant itself is very nice.  we dined in the main dining room, which was comfortable and cozy.  we had a reservation and on a saturday night, we did not wait one minute to be seated.  unfortunately, that's where the good service ended.  our female server was haughty and condescending, and reluctant to offer any suggestions whatsoever.  \n \nso we decided on the stone <mark>Crab Bisque</mark>, bacon-wrapped scallops and select <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws, with a side of mac n' cheese, which seems to be my current obsession.\n \nwith the exception of the mac n'cheese, the food was great.  the bisque was better than great, it was amazing!  lick-your-bowl amazing.  the scallops were perfect, as was the crab.  \n \ndessert?  who knows?  it was never offered and we couldn't catch our server.  this seems to be happening to me a lot in lv, a less confidant (or less thin, hahahaha) woman would start to assume that the servers think i don't need dessert.  whatever, there is dessert available elsewhere, in the form of cocktails served a little later during the really great matt goss show over at cleopatra's barge. *separate review posted*\n \nanyway, not bad value for great food, except for that bad service thing.  i wrote a less than flattering comment about it on open table, and received an e-mail from the manager.  i provided him with the requested phone number to reach me, and he did call.  left a voice mail, which i returned and it ended there.  not too impressed. \n \nsoooo, once again, a 5 star review becomes a 3 star review due to the bad service.", 
            "love joe's!!!\n\ni've been there about 6 times, and has never been disappointed yet once...(knock on wood)\n\nthe las time we were there was actually this past monday, i usually get my usual entree petite filet + <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>, but i decided to change it up a little... we started with \n\noysters-phenomenal... they were kushi(sp?)oysters, small similar to my favorite oysters kumamoto\n\nstone <mark>Crab Bisque</mark>-wonderful as usual...\n\nmy entree petite filet oscar style-i can't stop thinking about it... it's a petite filet, with dungeness crab and asparagus on top w/a wonderful b\\u00e9arnaise sauce drizzled on top...it's not on the menu, if you catch your server while he specials you, you might catch them say oscar style!\n\nmy bf's entree crab stuffed sole-...it was better the first time we had it...maybe it was just cause we thought my entree was sooo amazing. =)\n\nstuffs mushrooms- yummm...\n\nover all, joe's never disappoints...",

            "the food and the service here is great to say the least.  \n\nwe started the night off with the lobster tempura and joe's famous scallops as appetizers.  both were unbelievable.  the lobster tail was succulent and sweet and the coating was delicious and crispy.  the scallops are seasoned and poached in clarified butter.  if you do not like scallops, this is the dish to change your mind imo.\n\nthe <mark>Crab Bisque</mark> is great.  i am usually not a soup bisque person but i would definately have this when i come back.\n\nand finally the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws.  we got a few of the large orders steamed and we were very satisfied.  i could eat the claws alone but combined with that clarified butter it was excellent.\n\ni have eaten here a few times before but this time was better than my previous experiences.", 
            "i would have given this 3.5 stars, but i will go with the 4 stars. the 3.5 was based on my other parties experience. \n\nfirst we had to try the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>, so we got two <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> and for two is was $22.95. but they were unlike any crab i have ever had, the texture was a little more solid then other crabs and they serve it with this chilled mustard sauce, which is ummmmmmmmmm so good. we even saved the sauce to try it with the petite <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark>. \n\nmy wife ordered the <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> which i had a bite and it was very good, she ordered it with a creamy horseradish sauce, but combine the mustard and the horseradish sauce together and you have a match made in heaven.\n\ni ordered the stone <mark>Crab Bisque</mark>, which was very rich, but very tasty. \n\nsince everything is al carte, we ordered the lyonnaise potatoes, which these portions are big enough for 3 to 4 people to share. the potatoes where crispy and the onions on top were cooked to perfection great side.\n\nother people in our group ordered the prime bone-in dry aged ribeye, i didn't try it but both people who ordered it didn't like it. but the two people in our group who ordered the <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark>, both loved it.", 
            "one of my favorite restaurants for a nice night out in vegas. everything i've had there is delicious, but my favorites are the <mark>Crab Bisque</mark> and the pan-roasted sweet corn.  i'm not a huge fan of cold crab, which is how they serve the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>, but there are so many great things on the menu that that doesn't really matter. it's always a bit crowded, so i recommend making a reservation.", 
            "we eat at joes every time we come to vegas which is at least twice a year. one of the best steaks you will find anywhere. and the staff is super friendly, ralph is our favorite waiter, unfortunately on this trip it was his day off. this time i had <mark>Crab Bisque</mark> for an appetizer and it was amazing. of course the steaks were wonderful as usual. save room for key lime pie if you can!", 
            "we went to joe's with an extremely large group.  we had some drinks at the bar and each of us was charge a gratuity of 18% on our tab.  after our bar drinks, we received no service from the waitress on beverages.\n\nwe ordered all of the sides, soups and salads on the menu and especially lots of snow crab.  we heard great things about the restaurant and unfortunately our experience did not match other's experiences.  the snow crab was significantly smaller than del frisco's double eagle steak house, where we ate the previous night.  we recommend del frisco.  the snow crab seemed to have been frozen for a very long time; it was fishy, grainy, and not well cooked.  the frozen taste was strong throughout our entire order of crabs.  it was so far from fresh and tasted terrible.  even the horseradish sauce could not hide the low quality taste.\n\nthe artichoke and crab dip appetizer was excellent.\n\nthe <mark>Manhattan Clam Chowder</mark> soup was tomato based, salty, and tons of dirt grains.  it was difficult to consume with every taste full of grains. this was the worst soup on the menu.  the <mark>Crab Bisque</mark> was great.  \n\nthe plain potato hash browns were good.  they are boiled potatoes that are placed in a baking dish and toasted on the top.  not great but good.  the lyonnaise however, was not pleasant.  it was overfilled with caramelized onions, which were so overpowering you could not taste the potato.  \n\nthe <mark>Joe's Cole Slaw</mark> had an interesting unique tangy taste.  the texture of the <mark>Joe's Cole Slaw</mark> seemed prepackaged, over shredded, soggy consistency, and poor preparation.   again, the taste was very unique.  our group ate the least of this item.  the corn was not sweet; it had several bell peppers and way too much seasoning.  the spinach had too much cream.  the other sides were all very standard.\n\nthe key lime pie had a nice strong, sour, and thick creamy filling.  the gram cracker crust was over sugared and too thick.   \n\nworst of all, after such a disappointing dinner, our waitress made the mistake of charging our group the entire tab multiple times.  several of us were charged the entire bill.  we brought this to the manager's attention and he had no idea as to how to handle the situation.  we had to break it down to the waitress and explain to her the billing error.  she had a difficult time understanding how to correct and reverse the charges.  we're still waiting on verification from our banks of the reversals, since the restaurant clearly cannot be relied on.  \n\noverall we would not recommend this restaurant.  perhaps, at one time the vegas location was of comparable quality to their other chains, but unfortunately this is no longer true.", 
            "we come here for lunch on every vegas trip.  the lunch menu is cheaper and you're getting pretty much the same items as dinner.  \n\nthe crab claws were good, but we prefer the  <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> ($14.95) because it comes with the same tasty mustard dipping sauce and you don't have to get your hands all messy.  \n\nthe seafood <mark>Joe's <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark></mark> ($16.95) a great salad to split with someone else, just let your waiter know you'll be sharing it and it comes out with 2 huge portions.  \n\nour absolute favorite is the stone <mark>Crab Bisque</mark> ($6.95 a bowl) i want to lick the bowl clean everytime i get this.  \n\nthey open at 11:30am daily, get there as soon as you can for really quick service!", 
            "i went to joe's for the first time last night.  i was with a group of 14 people, 10 of whom were in from out of town and it was their pick.  as a local, who doesn't smoke or gamble i spend very little time on the strip and do my best to find great off strip bars and restaurants.  joe's is worth braving the traffic and tourists!   \n\nwe were given a private room with a fantastic server, thomas.  everything was absolutely fantastic.  we started with the appetizer called the second mortgage.  it has jumbo shrimp, lobster cocktail, alaskan king crab and shrimp & <mark>Shrimp & Scallop Ceviche</mark>.  the seafood was fresh, beautifully presented and delicious.  next i had the stone <mark>Crab Bisque</mark>, which was silky, flavorful and actually contained small pieces of <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>.  i ordered the <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> which were huge, amazingly tasty and probably 95% crab with just enough filler to keep them from falling apart.  \n\nmy bf had the bone in rib eye which was quite possibly the best steak i've ever tasted.  it was a beautiful, extremely high quality cut of meat that was cooked to a perfect medium rare.  others in my party had the bone in filet which was also high quality and cooked perfectly.  also, one other ordered the dover sole, which i highly recommend.  it was fresh and cooked perfectly.  it was also expertly and impressively deboned table side.  the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> are also very good.  they come pre-cracked so; all you have to do is peel back <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> pieces and savor the incredibly sweet <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> meat.  for dessert we tried the blueberry pie a la mode, the key lime pie and the banana cream pie, all of which are made fresh in house daily and were incredible.   however, the banana cream pie was a standout.  it was amazing!\n\neverything from the atmosphere, the service and the food were incredible.", 
            "all i can think about from my vegas trip is joe's seafood!! it wasn't about all the partying, drinking, gambling or any of that it was just how darn good this place was !! \n\nthe night was started off by looking for a seafood place to go and eat at. mainly looking through yelp to find one. i didn't really want to get a buffet but i wanted a nice classy sit down and order your food ! i got what i wanted and called joe's seafood up. \n\nthey said they could take us in a few hours and indeed they did. while walking through this place you will notice that every server is wearing a nice black suit and it seems formal but hey we are in vegas and i saw many patrons wearing just flip flops and t shirts. \n\ni did call about the dress code but they said they do prefer business but doesn't matter if you are dressed in casual. so off we went on this find adventure!!\n\nthe order: \n<mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark>- it is one large <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> which is cooked or pan fried lightly for a little bit of crisp on the outside. the inside is nice and soft with a hint of mayo. the taste is amazing and i would say this is on my top 10 list of <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark>. \n\n<mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claw- had two of these and they are served chilled with a wedge of lemon but you really don't need anything. just try it without and you can tell that this is really good crab. the flavor is nice and and amazing. i wish i could just eat more...but we wanted to try everything!\n\n<mark>Crab Bisque</mark>- not my favorite thing on my meal. i didn't even finish it because it just had a very bad buttery flavor. it tasted way too fatty for me and i just didn't like it. \n\nparmesan crusted halibut- need to order this, the crust was just perfect amount of crispiness in each bite with the fish. also the fish was not at all dry and it just had an awesome flavor. love love it!! must order if you come here. \n\nhalf order of <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>- on the top of it was some very crispy cheese topping. i can tell you the half order was huge. we didn't even finish most of the sides because we were just stuffed with food!!\n\nhalf order of mac and cheese- i see mushrooms yeah !! :) i liked how the texture of the pasta is and also how they did the mac and cheese, it is defiantly a different style. not from kraft and it does taste a whole lot better. \n\noverall the meal was perfect, the server that we had was a very nice lady and she didn't hassle us about what we ordered or if we needed to order more. i know some places might be a little bit on the mad side if you only order one meal but seriously..i can't eat a whole lot and the portion size is out of this world!! most places feed you a very large size and this is one of them!! everything was large and good !! the only thing i would suggest not getting is the <mark>Crab Bisque</mark>. \n\nbut my experience at joe's has made me want to come to vegas more often to get a nice meal in!! see you soon joe!", 
            "wow, delicious. our group decided to split everything including: <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>, <mark>Crab Bisque</mark>, <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> (we liked that better than the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>), corn, <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>, broccoli and steak and everything was delicious. they prepare all of the crab for you so all you have to do is scoop the meat out. delicious, definitely on the pricey side, great service.", 
            "restaurant week is in full swing, and we are now 4 for 4! last night diane and i dined at joe's, and it was another great meal! \n\nwe arrived for dinner on thursday at 5:45 p.m., 15 minutes before our reservation, and were seated right away. by 7:00 p.m. the main dining room was almost completely full. we had never been here before, and i was a bit intimidated at first as i approached the high reception stand where a man in a jet black tuxedo with jet black hair towered over me. but he was friendly and professional, as were all of the other black bow-tied, black tuxedoed, and white aproned restaurant personnel we encountered during our visit. i had only seen the bar and mall dining areas before, and thought they comprised the whole restaurant. not so! we were ushered through a curtain to a very elegant dining room that had decorative lights on the wall and a decidedly new york city clubby steakhouse feel to it, with much dark wood and brown leather, white tablecloths, and several tables surrounded by comfortable booths along both main walls. it was very sophisticated but not pretentious, as were the several servers who moved briskly about like busy bees. it was interesting just watching them in action. \n\nwe went with the restaurant week menu, but augmented it with a two-claw appetizer of <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws and king crab mac & cheese. i always wondered whether i would be able to eat <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws because their ends look like elongated fingers painted with black nail polish. but it was easier than i thought, since that part of the claw is left alone. the claws arrived from the kitchen already largely crushed by a mallet, so it was not that difficult to pry apart the porcelain-like shell casing to get at the meat underneath. but there seemed to be less meat than found in alaskan crab claws. the thin morsels of crab meat tasted fine either dipped in drawn butter, the mild mustard sauce that was provided, or just eaten straight out of <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark>. yet i noted that they were not as sweet or satisfying as king crab claw meat. and, at about $22 for two claws, they were not cheap. so, for me, it is now \"been there, done that!\" but i will definitely return to joe's for its other fine fare, including lobster and king crab. \n\nalthough this was hardly needed, an assortment of bread products tasted good with the soft pats of butter provided. and a bowl of stone <mark>Crab Bisque</mark> was sweet and smooth--simply exquisite in taste and texture. i liked it better without the garnish of tiny cuts of carrots and zucchini that we asked to have served on the side, since diane's yelp nickname is \"veggie hater\" for a reason. but i picked the delicate morsels of <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> out of the garnish and tossed them in the wonderful soup, which avoided an inexcusable wasting of fine crab particles and made the soup even tastier. \n\na large <mark>Joe's <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark></mark> of lettuce, tomato, onion, and <mark>Chopped Lettuce, Tomato, Onion & Blue Cheese</mark> crumbles with a fine vinaigrette dressing was quite satisfying. my 8 oz. <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> with drinkable bearnaise sauce was simply divine. it was well seasoned on top, perfectly medium rare inside as ordered, and did literally melt in my mouth. i liked it better without the house seasonings, which i tried on a couple of bites. it was one of those steaks that kept getting better and better as slices of beef moved toward the rarer center. \n\ndiane's moist halibut had a tasty parmesan crust, augmented by a buerre blanc-like sauce that was provided. it was notably flatter than many servings of halibut experienced at other restaurants, but of ample portion size. the king crab mac & cheese, made with white shells, hunks of king crab, and bechamel sauce, tasted good, but was not nearly as noteworthy as the sumptuous <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> that were covered with a mix of baked asiago cheese and breadcrumbs. and, few lobster chunks were included in the dish. <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> was creamy as billed, and quite tasty. \n\njoe's signature key lime pie arrived ultra cold and almost frozen. after trying one bite, i let my slice sit for 5 minutes, and then it was just right, having lost its icy taste. it was very tart and delicious. \n\npeppermint gelato with hot fudge was not as memorable as the key lime pie, but the melted hot fudge was delicious. it had the strong taste of peppermint, and every now and then surprised the palate with peppermint candy chips. i would have preferred this dish during the christmas season! \n\nall in all, a wonderful five-star meal!", 
            "service is always great here. i'm not a \"chain\" kind of person but there are a few that are worth visiting. joe's <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> is one. the seafood <mark>Joe's <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark></mark> is one of my top 10 favorite salads. its a hand full of romain lettuce chopped with asparagus, red and yellow bell pepper, hearts of palm, red onion, cucumber, carrots, green onion, celery, cherry tomatoes, topped with shrimp, crab, lobster, avocado and croutons and lightly tossed with a vinaigrette for $13 at lunch. \n\ni have had the king crab, super yummy, and the <mark>Crab Bisque</mark> which they actually serve hot unlike most places.\n\ndefinitely worth a trip!",

            "a high class restaurant to say the least. this is comparable to mastro's or boa steakhouse. \n\nthe atmosphere of this place just exudes class. as soon as i walked in, i felt like i was transported to a beautiful ballroom in the titanic where all the upper class elite are dining. \n\nthe service here is impeccable and the food is the epitome of what every restaurant should aspire to be. \n\ni started off with a peach flavored martini rimmed with sugar that was delicious. i could barely taste the alcohol and it went down so smoothly.\n\nour first appetizer was a 12-piece rockefeller oyster rack. i am in awe at how fresh and tasty it was! i feel like they had just plucked the oysters from the ocean and brought it right to my plate. all of the oysters were perfectly chilled and the mix of sauces it came with made my mouth water. this was definitely the highlight of the night. \n\nthe <mark>Crab Bisque</mark> is a must have! i loved every second of this soup. the flavors were so complex and at every corner i tasted a different flavor. it is creamy and hearty all in one. \n\ni ordered the pan saut\\u00e9ed branzino fish with lemon and capers. i enjoyed it. it's a healthy option and the sauce they use is drool worthy. \n\nwe ordered the key lime pie for dessert and it was bomb! tart and sweet with a kick ass crust. i salute joe's for creating the best key lime pie in california. \n\noverall, this was an amazing meal and i am so happy we came here for dinner! with all of the options in vegas, i think we definitely made the right choice."

            "a little pricey but worth it.  the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws are delicious and match perfectly with the sauce they offer.  i usually order they lunch special which includes 4 claws, hash browned potatoes, <mark>Joe's Cole Slaw</mark> and a slice of key lime pie.  it's the best overall deal for lunch.  the potatoes are pretty bad however.  too salty and dry.  everything else is great especially the key lime pie.  the key lime pie is the best i've ever had.  perfect blend of sweetness and tart.  they somehow manage to serve this at the perfect temperature also, just below freezing.   definitely worth the visit.", 
            "i've never been to the original and we went here on a lark. my friends c and j and i went in looking for lunch. i had heard of joe's and j's parents had been a few weeks before and loved it. so we knew it was probably pretty darned good.\n   the menu is pretty big and the prices can be off putting if you're expecting something from the old vegas ($15 for fish and chips could freak some people out). c had a cheeseburger and asked for it to be medium but it came out a little closer to medium rare which i know he wasn't happy about. j and i had the joe's classic lunch which is five <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws, hash browns, <mark>Joe's Cole Slaw</mark> and key lime pie. the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> were sweet and didn't really need the dipping sauce that came with it. the hash browns were super crispy outside and flavourfully tender inside. the <mark>Joe's Cole Slaw</mark> was less successful despite the tableside dressing it got from our waiter - it was better than kfc but still a bit underwhelming. i wasn't a fan of key lime pie before but that little sliver with it's massive dollop of not overly sweetened whipped cream was really wonderfully tart with a great buttery crumbly crust. \n   our service was slow to start with but picked up half way through. i will come back next time i'm in vegas.", 
            "i had the lunch special which was $19.99 for 5 crab claws, <mark>Joe's Cole Slaw</mark>, hash browns and a slice of key lime pie.  oh my goodness, so good.  i've never had <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> before but it was succulent and buttery.  they provided a spicy honey mustard sauce to go along with the crab and it was such a great match to the sweetness of the crab!  the server made the <mark>Joe's Cole Slaw</mark> right at the table, fresh and it was quite good.  i opted for no hash browns as i had had hash browns the previous evening in my drunken state at treasure island.  just the crab and <mark>Joe's Cole Slaw</mark> was enough to fill me but wasn't heavy at all.  if you're a dude, you have to get the hash browns to fill your tummy.  the key lime pie was tasty, quite chilled (frozen, i think) but good with fresh whipped cream.  all-in-all, it was a great lunch for $20.  i totally recommend it.", 
            "i tend to favor restaurants with foofoo menus, the kind of stuff i'd never make at home, with ingredients you'd have to have sent from outer mongolia.  that said, joe's was fantastic.  it's basically <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>, steaks and seafood, but anything but basic.  first of all, i'd give 5 stars just for the best mojitoes i've ever had in my (long) life.  then the meal:  we shared <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws appetizer with a delicious mustardy sauce.  i had stone <mark>Crab Bisque</mark> (seems the thing to do here is enjoy <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>) which was ethereal.  my husband had <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> which were blue crab meat barely held together in a \"cake \" form, there being little or more likely no breading.  just sublime crabmeat.  i had a fantastic idea in menu offerings -- lobster tail tempura.  lobster meat -- 2 large tails.  deep fried in tempura batter.  what in the name of all that is right and holy could be better than that?!  and did i mention the mojitoes?  we also shared their highly touted, rightfully so, <mark>Joe's Cole Slaw</mark> and <mark>French Fried</mark> <mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark> and still managed to save room for dessert.  husband couldn't decide between the coconut cream pie or banana cream pie with foster sauce, so awesome server brought both (for price of one).  i had peach pie with melba sauce.  great location, ambiance and friendly, knowledgeable server.  a great time.",

            "we went to joe's with an extremely large group.  we had some drinks at the bar and each of us was charge a gratuity of 18% on our tab.  after our bar drinks, we received no service from the waitress on beverages.\n\nwe ordered all of the sides, soups and salads on the menu and especially lots of snow crab.  we heard great things about the restaurant and unfortunately our experience did not match other's experiences.  the snow crab was significantly smaller than del frisco's double eagle steak house, where we ate the previous night.  we recommend del frisco.  the snow crab seemed to have been frozen for a very long time; it was fishy, grainy, and not well cooked.  the frozen taste was strong throughout our entire order of crabs.  it was so far from fresh and tasted terrible.  even the horseradish sauce could not hide the low quality taste.\n\nthe artichoke and crab dip appetizer was excellent.\n\nthe <mark>Manhattan Clam Chowder</mark> soup was tomato based, salty, and tons of dirt grains.  it was difficult to consume with every taste full of grains. this was the worst soup on the menu.  the <mark>Crab Bisque</mark> was great.  \n\nthe plain potato hash browns were good.  they are boiled potatoes that are placed in a baking dish and toasted on the top.  not great but good.  the lyonnaise however, was not pleasant.  it was overfilled with caramelized onions, which were so overpowering you could not taste the potato.  \n\nthe <mark>Joe's Cole Slaw</mark> had an interesting unique tangy taste.  the texture of the <mark>Joe's Cole Slaw</mark> seemed prepackaged, over shredded, soggy consistency, and poor preparation.   again, the taste was very unique.  our group ate the least of this item.  the corn was not sweet; it had several bell peppers and way too much seasoning.  the spinach had too much cream.  the other sides were all very standard.\n\nthe key lime pie had a nice strong, sour, and thick creamy filling.  the gram cracker crust was over sugared and too thick.   \n\nworst of all, after such a disappointing dinner, our waitress made the mistake of charging our group the entire tab multiple times.  several of us were charged the entire bill.  we brought this to the manager's attention and he had no idea as to how to handle the situation.  we had to break it down to the waitress and explain to her the billing error.  she had a difficult time understanding how to correct and reverse the charges.  we're still waiting on verification from our banks of the reversals, since the restaurant clearly cannot be relied on.  \n\noverall we would not recommend this restaurant.  perhaps, at one time the vegas location was of comparable quality to their other chains, but unfortunately this is no longer true.",

            "joe's is pretty much at the top of the list when i'm looking for a restaurant that has both quality steaks and seafood. i've never had a bad experience. the food has always been delicious and there's nothing that i've ordered that has been bad. service has always been outstanding.\n\ni came here on a thursday afternoon for a lunch date with my mother. we walked up to the host stand and were seated  immediately in the \"patio\" area. jon was our server and i do not have enough positive superlatives to describe his service. he was friendly, helpful, efficient, and funny. without a doubt, five stars.\n\nmake sure you take a good look at the market card that the server hands you at greeting. it has the market prices for oysters and <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> plus any seasonal entrees and sides that are available. we both ordered from the card with my mom receiving a generous, nicely cooked portion of alaskan halibut ($28.95) and a side of white asparagus ($9.95) which my mother consumed so fast that i did not even get a taste. i started with 6 stellar bay oysters ($16.95) followed by the classic two course lunch ($34.95) which consisted of 5 <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws, hash brown potatoes, <mark>Joe's Cole Slaw</mark> which was mixed table side by jon, and key lime pie for dessert. the two course lunch is a steal in my book.\n\ni've been here for dinner also and their steaks are just as satisfying as the seafood. yes, it's pricey, but well worth it to pay extra for fresh seafood in the middle of the desert.",

            "i have passed this restaurant on every visit to the forum shoppes.  never thought once to eat there, as i have never been a fan of eating in the mall.  after reading all of the positive comments from fellow yelpers and on opentable, i finally decided to give it a shot.  \n\nthe host/maitre'd was such a friendly fellow that made you feel so welcomed.  he is perfect for his position.  he welcomed us in and offered us an inside seat or an outside seat - we chose inside, as i was  not into watching all of the shoppers on the outside.  cozy setting on the inside.  \n\nwas i wrong about this place.  it was so freakin' good.  the first offer you 5 different kinds of breads - who would think a place like this  makes their own breads?!  there was a ciabatta, lavosh, olive bread, pretzel roll and a dinner roll.  i was impressed.  \n\nwe had to try the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> - pricey - $10 a crab, we had the large size - server's recommendation.  you can order as many as you want.  don't have to go by what's printed on the menu.  she said it fell off <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> better.  it was really tasty and the mustard sauce was really good.  i am not a saucey person, but it certainly complemented the crab.  \n\nwe had the <mark>Manhattan Clam Chowder</mark> and the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> next.  both were also very good.  i had the salmon next and it was outstanding.  it was a special of the day.  it was cooked to perfection.  \n\nthe best part of the meal was dessert - the blueberry pie with vanilla ice cream was soooo good.  you can order a 1/2 slice of pie - my recommendation.  but the best dessert was the peppermint ice cream with the hot fudge.  hot dang!!!!  this was the best ever.....  this hit the spot and made this my favorite place to dine.  \n\nservice was very attentive.  waters and lemonade always filled.  dirty dishes removed promptly and the server was nice and friendly.  i am so happy i finally tried this place out.  it took me long enough, but i will be going back again.", 
            "my husband was very happy with their lobster and steak combo meal, definitely worth the $65 he says, well, everyone is entitled with his or her opinions.  i tasted it.  they are good but not phenomenal.   \n\nmy 9 year old had 3 of their <mark><mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark></mark> with chives and butter, they are good but then what doesn't taste good with load of butter? \n\nmy older son scored!  his <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> was the best to me.  it had the perfect balance of flavors, delicious.  \n\ni was the least lucky one for the night.  i had a terrible time!  all because i started with the half-dozen oysters, which were not what i had expected.  first of all, they tasted bitter! the flavor didn't improve after i dipped them in the sauce it came with.  as a seasoned oyster sampler, i know the good fresh oysters don't need any sauce or dipping, they are good on their own.\n\nsecondly, they were tiny. i'm talking about the actual meat part.  one of them was the size of my thumb nail, no kidding.  \n\nand worse of all, i had a very bad tummy ache right after i ate the oysters.  ouch, ouch!\n\nat this point i ordered their lobster bisque, thinking it might ease my tummy ache.  but the bisque tasted so weird, it was too salty, and too sweet at same time.  and my tummy ache got worse now, i had to let my son get up so i can lay down.  that didn't help, so i asked for some very hot water. then another pot, and another.  i was sweating profusely after 3 pots of hot piping water by now, and i was a royal mess regretting ordering that wretched oysters.  but at least i could get up and walk back to our room at the end, thank god, we are not staying at augustus tower this time, or i have to walk more.\n\ni am thankful to that nice bus boy who brought me hot water. god bless u for ur sweet tender heart.  all this time, our waitress, a well-weathered one, witnessed my pain with such an indifference as if she has seen the world of suffering.  i think she was afraid if she admit i got ill from their oysters we may not pay her.  i know there are people who do that, but not us.  the bill was almost $200 with the wine, nothing was comped even with  my terrible plight.  she was very glad to take the hefty tip from us though.  \n\ni have never had reactions like this to the oysters before, and oysters are my favorite food if u read my profile.  it was just not my night.\n\nsince the rest of my family did have good meal, i am giving them a very generous 3 stars.  i would have rated them higher if the waitress didn't retort me bitterly after i gave her my feedback of the oysters and the lobster bisque each time.  hey, waitress lady, everyone else may prefer ur tiny bitter taste oyster but i don't, is that a crime?  also, please don't look aghast when i tell u i didn't care the lobster bisque as if i am not refined enough to appriciate ur \"fine\" dinning.  a decent and graceful hostess would have taken it back right away.",

            "restaurant week is in full swing, and we are now 4 for 4! last night diane and i dined at joe's, and it was another great meal! \n\nwe arrived for dinner on thursday at 5:45 p.m., 15 minutes before our reservation, and were seated right away. by 7:00 p.m. the main dining room was almost completely full. we had never been here before, and i was a bit intimidated at first as i approached the high reception stand where a man in a jet black tuxedo with jet black hair towered over me. but he was friendly and professional, as were all of the other black bow-tied, black tuxedoed, and white aproned restaurant personnel we encountered during our visit. i had only seen the bar and mall dining areas before, and thought they comprised the whole restaurant. not so! we were ushered through a curtain to a very elegant dining room that had decorative lights on the wall and a decidedly new york city clubby steakhouse feel to it, with much dark wood and brown leather, white tablecloths, and several tables surrounded by comfortable booths along both main walls. it was very sophisticated but not pretentious, as were the several servers who moved briskly about like busy bees. it was interesting just watching them in action. \n\nwe went with the restaurant week menu, but augmented it with a two-claw appetizer of <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws and king crab mac & cheese. i always wondered whether i would be able to eat <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws because their ends look like elongated fingers painted with black nail polish. but it was easier than i thought, since that part of the claw is left alone. the claws arrived from the kitchen already largely crushed by a mallet, so it was not that difficult to pry apart the porcelain-like shell casing to get at the meat underneath. but there seemed to be less meat than found in alaskan crab claws. the thin morsels of crab meat tasted fine either dipped in drawn butter, the mild mustard sauce that was provided, or just eaten straight out of <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark>. yet i noted that they were not as sweet or satisfying as king crab claw meat. and, at about $22 for two claws, they were not cheap. so, for me, it is now \"been there, done that!\" but i will definitely return to joe's for its other fine fare, including lobster and king crab. \n\nalthough this was hardly needed, an assortment of bread products tasted good with the soft pats of butter provided. and a bowl of stone <mark>Crab Bisque</mark> was sweet and smooth--simply exquisite in taste and texture. i liked it better without the garnish of tiny cuts of carrots and zucchini that we asked to have served on the side, since diane's yelp nickname is \"veggie hater\" for a reason. but i picked the delicate morsels of <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> out of the garnish and tossed them in the wonderful soup, which avoided an inexcusable wasting of fine crab particles and made the soup even tastier. \n\na large <mark>Joe's <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark></mark> of lettuce, tomato, onion, and <mark>Chopped Lettuce, Tomato, Onion & Blue Cheese</mark> crumbles with a fine vinaigrette dressing was quite satisfying. my 8 oz. <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> with drinkable bearnaise sauce was simply divine. it was well seasoned on top, perfectly medium rare inside as ordered, and did literally melt in my mouth. i liked it better without the house seasonings, which i tried on a couple of bites. it was one of those steaks that kept getting better and better as slices of beef moved toward the rarer center. \n\ndiane's moist halibut had a tasty parmesan crust, augmented by a buerre blanc-like sauce that was provided. it was notably flatter than many servings of halibut experienced at other restaurants, but of ample portion size. the king crab mac & cheese, made with white shells, hunks of king crab, and bechamel sauce, tasted good, but was not nearly as noteworthy as the sumptuous <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> that were covered with a mix of baked asiago cheese and breadcrumbs. and, few lobster chunks were included in the dish. <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> was creamy as billed, and quite tasty. \n\njoe's signature key lime pie arrived ultra cold and almost frozen. after trying one bite, i let my slice sit for 5 minutes, and then it was just right, having lost its icy taste. it was very tart and delicious. \n\npeppermint gelato with hot fudge was not as memorable as the key lime pie, but the melted hot fudge was delicious. it had the strong taste of peppermint, and every now and then surprised the palate with peppermint candy chips. i would have preferred this dish during the christmas season! \n\nall in all, a wonderful five-star meal!", 
            "the best steak and salmon i've had in vegas. the steak was so good and juicy and the salmon was near perfection. the <mark>Chopped Lettuce, Tomato, Onion & Blue Cheese</mark> wedge was very good and the portion was quite a bit. the almond green beans were a very good side. i think we paid $84 for the whole meal for two of us. the waitress was very nice and was so helpful. highly recommend.",

            "this was quite a unexpected surprise - there are so many great restaurants in las vegas and i've been fortunate enough to have experienced a fair share of them over the years. one of my associates made a reservation for the six of us attending a trade show at the convention center and picked joe's for dinner one night. i really never had the chance to read the reviews so i really walked in blind. we arrived a little late for our scheduled time but we were immediately seated and from that moment on it was incredible. \n\nour server greeted us and took our drink orders and interacted with our entire group like she had known us for years. i started with my usual ketel one martini up, a little dirty with cheese stuffed olives it came out ice cold and filled to the brim. although it's a rather simple drink to make some struggle, so by no means are they all created equal. the way i see it the difference between the okay ones and the outstanding ones are some are just poured and some are crafted it was apparent after the first sip this was definitely a crafted one that was executed by a professional mixologist. i validated this by enjoying several more and they all were outstanding as the first.\n\ni ordered raw <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> for my appetizer from a impressive selection of oysters that are flown in daily, they came out very clean with most of the natural liquor retained requiring nothing but a slight dash of tabasco and a hint of horseradish. there was plenty of time to enjoy these along with our first round of refreshments since they we're delivered and eaten before our salads orders were taken absolutely no rush here our server's timing was impeccable.  we had our second round of cocktails delivered while we place our second course selections - i chose the pork belly wedge salad with ranch dressing, a hint of balsamic vinegar, vine ripened tomatoes and may-tag <mark>Chopped Lettuce, Tomato, Onion & Blue Cheese</mark> crumbles. again i can't stress enough this salad was a creation in itself perfectly assembled on a chill plate with exact portions of each ingredient. the pork belly was crisp, succulent and plentiful this is nothing remotely similar to the typical <mark>Blt Wedge</mark> salad so common at so many restaurants. \n\nonce we had a few moments to enjoy these wonderful salads we were advised to put in our entree orders. the steak and seafood selections are amazing and i'm sure anything i'd pick would be wonderful but the prime cut bone-in filet was taunting my palette and having this special cut prepared a few degrees over rare was impossible to resist, this accompanied by grilled verse steam asparagus my experience was only going to improve by leaps and bounds if that was possible after experience the first two courses. it's such a treat to have a server who understands her clientele and being this was a business meeting she was very attentive but was able to break in at precisely the right times to explain the specials, take the drink orders or to simple ensure our evening was proceeding as we had hoped and update us on the delivery of our food. \n\nthe entrees arrived fresh from the kitchen warm and accurate the portions were extreme, we also had multiple sides to share amongst the 6 of us and really there was more food than any of us could have eaten no matter the time frame. i decided to pass on the shared sides and focus my attention on the bone-in filet which was prepared to my exact specifications (if you've never experience this cut its a bucket list item for sure) fortunately i've been able to have this cut many times over the years even though it not a common cut you can find at just any steakhouse. \n\nthese bone-in, prime grade, <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> are at the top of my list when it comes to that magical blend of tender, juicy, and flavorful.\rtrimmed perfectly and generously portioned, this steak is begging for a rare to medium rare preparation. unlike a <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> on it's own, this steak is best cooked slow to maximize the flavor that comes from a bone-in steak and this was one of the best examples i've ever cut into. after experiencing this grand finale of a steak it would be pointless to continue, joe's far exceeded any expectations i had and this meal will surely be mentioned in future conversations with my small group of associates when we're looking for our next exquisite dining adventure...enjoy!"

            "ehh....\n\nquite overrated for what it is, a mall restaurant in an upscale mall. i'm not big into <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> to begin with, but it was ok... they pre cracked them well so that was a plus (not too many shell injuries), but the mustardy-sauce for dipping was bland and tasted like hellman's dijonaise. there's not a ton of meat on the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claw, and i personally don't see what all the hype is about. \n\nperhaps it stems from the fact that when <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> are harvested, they just rip their arm off and throw it back to live on in the sea and re-generate another one in time. i suppose that makes it less cruel (though i don't agree, sounds like virtual hell to me).\n\ni didn't eat the steak though the fillet looked decent. i got <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> and they were mediocre at best.\n\nbiggest disappointment, when eating a $300 dinner for 3 (with a mediocre 4x markup wine), i don't like sitting at high-rise bar tables, even if they are disguised with a white table cloth and a napkin ring. \n\nif you need <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>, try del frisco's instead! it's not a far cab-ride from caesars, and the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> (which is not their specialty) comes with a way better version of the mustard sauce. plus it's way classier for your money and not much if at all pricier.", 
            "i'll keep it simple. if you got the money, you gotta eat here at least once. we had the money, so we ate here once...so far.\n\nexcellent service (the waiter washed our hands in fresh squeezed lemon and ice water) and the food was as good, if not better, than the service. \n\nfor appetizers, we had the \"2nd mortgage\" : <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws, jumbo shrimp, lobster cocktail, shrimp and <mark>Shrimp & Scallop Ceviche</mark>.  \nfor our entrees i had the 22 oz. lobster tail and the wife had the rib eye. both were excellent, steak seared a perfect medium and lobster was as good as lobster gets! we had the garlic <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>  and lyonnaise potatoes for our side dishes and they were great! for dessert we had the boston cream pie and that was rich, but very good. we'll definitely come back and dine here...when we re-finance the house!", 
            "everything from the service down to the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> is just amazing. \n\ni love crab, and <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> - while it was the first time i've ever eaten it, was simply, amazing. the claws of these suckers are huge because the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws were huge.\n\nthe restaurant is sorta on the high side price wise, but seriously, if you are looking for a quality meal in between your bar hopping while on the strip, this place is worth checking out.", 
            "this is part of a small chain, based in miami beach.  i had lunch here.  service was inconsistent.  the initial greeting was friendly, and i was seated quickly.  water was quickly offered, and a very good bread basket arrived shortly thereafter.  however, the server took a long time to bring me a menu, and seemed in a hurry.  this slow-to-return then in-a-hurry attitude would recur.  oh yeah, i was never even offered dessert, just handed the check.  isn't this place famous for its key lime pie?\n\ni had never had <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>, so i gave them a try as an appetizer.  they were ok, but i guess i'm not a fan.  also, i thought joe's was known for its mustard sauce.  none was provided.  one nice touch: after i was finished, an assistant came by with a lemon, and squeezed the juice over my hands into a waiting bowl.  he then gave me a hot, wet towel.  much appreciated.\n\ni had glazed black cod as an entree.  it was a big piece of wonderfully moist, flaky fish.  the glaze was excellent.  a trifle sweet, it began to cloy after a few bites.  not to worry - half a lemon was provided; the juice made the sauce perfect.  on the other hand, i could have done without the pedestrian <mark>French Fried</mark> <mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark>.", 
            "<mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> that's all i can say.  it makes me drool when i say it because it was pretty good.  service was excellent, wine was picked to the tastebuds delight as it was the houghton cab/shiraz 06.  i had the ribeye steak and it was cooked perfect and the sauce for the steak was very different than what i have had for steaks and i really liked it.  my girlfriend had the halibut and it was cooked very good as well.  the main thing that made it appetizing were the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>, they are served cold but the claws are definitely worth a try.  if you love those little crustaceans which are different from the dungeness crab, they are worth it.", 
            "i usually adhere to the rule \"if the restaurant has a type of food in their name, then that's what you must order.\" common sense would tell you that bob's beef palace is not the place to order tofu, for example. for joe's, however, i made a rare exception and took our waitress's advice to order the <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> rather than the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>. talk about a good choice: 20 ounces of the most delectable, savory crab meat you could find south of juneau. i'm afraid todai will just never be the same for us...sniff, sniff.\n\ntop that off with great bread & sides (we opted for the garlic <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>), and amazing pies for dessert (try either the banana cream or the key lime), and it made our trip to vegas. no wonder this place was packed solid.\n\none word of warning: be careful about ordering drinks at the bar. the bartender working the saturday shift likes to vary the price of drinks based on how much he likes the cut of your jib.",

            "what a disappointment!!!! we went on christmas night to joe's, and it couldn't have been worse. for a place that claims to be known for their seafood and steak, both were mediocre at best. the shrimp and <mark>Shrimp & Scallop Ceviche</mark> was chewy, hard, and almost bitter. the $40 <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> which i ordered as medium rare came way over cooked, and when i asked for a replacement (at $40 for a piece of meat, it better come the way i ordered it), not only did the second steak come undercooked, it was completely cold inside...they took a steak from the fridge, threw it on a grill that was way too hot, and served it rare and cold. who is in charge of this kitchen? our waiter was not only unapologetic about it, but acted put out by their mistake and hurried us out. the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> was not worth the money either. we highly recommend avoiding this restaurant.",

(the sucker was bloody!) yes, she sent it back twice, but for the price we were paying, the waiter mightve exercised the \"customer is always right\" policy rather than rudeness. now she's never going back and ill have to think twice.\nbut hopefully,hopefully, he was just having a really bad day and the 3rd times not the charm. maybe its changed to the 4th!

            "first night on our honeymoon, we got to joe's around 10:15pm right before closing at 10:30.  we sat at a table near the bar.  our waitress came over and got our drink order, and about 10 minutes later they finally arrived with some bread selections.  other people have commented that their bread was warm, but ours was cold.  the selection of different choices was a treat, and the lavashe covered with melted parmesan cheese went well with my bacardi and tonic.  for our meal my wife and i decided to share an order of 7 large <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws, <mark>Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail</mark>, <mark>Oysters Rockefeller</mark>, and the aged 16 oz ny steak.  everything, and i mean everything was top notch.  the oysters were filled with bacon, cheese, and spinach; the <mark>Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail</mark>, while not quite morton's grade, was  tasty and had nice sized shrimp, the steak was thick, juicy, and cooked to a perfect medium rare, and the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>.....words cannot explain how good these were.  growing up in a pan-asian setting in hawaii, there are very few sea foods that i haven't tried.  from jellyfish salad, to raw squid, we have it all there.  i've had dungenous, maryland blue, king, snow, and last night finally, i got to cross <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> off my list.  while pricy at about  $60 for 7 large pieces, they are divine.  huge fatty pieces of perfect claw meat await you after taking off the pre-cracked shell.  follow that up with a dip in joe's famous mayo sauce, and you have the food that the gods were suckled on.  and oh yeah, we ordered a bottle of bubbly to compliment the sea food, and  cut the fattiness of the of the steak.  overall, a great meal, and a great start to our honeymoon in vegas.  i would eat here every week if i could, but at $300 including tip, i wouldn't be able to make my car payment.  that being said, the service, although very friendly was slow, and i know that it was because it was so late, and we were literally the last seating, but i have been to places in ny and chicago that were the same caliber of food, had a late res, and they took care of us the entire way.  last night it felt like a great meal, but a little rushed.  never a good feeling when you drop 3 bills for a meal.  so a little our fault, a little theirs.  next time we come, i'll make an earlier res, and hopefully the service will be a little sharper.",

            "we came here on a saturday night in december, a party of 6.  we made reservations for 5 since the only other time was at 9.  it ended up working out well because we had a nice relaxing long dinner before returning back to our hotel for a nap and getting ready for the evening.\n\ndecor: 4.5/5  clean, beautiful dark wood paneled walls.  we sat in the back circular room, the seats and tables were arranged a little strangely in that i noticed later the seats weren't evenly distributed (minor) but not in a logical way.  the seats were up against other seats from adjacent tables.  poor planning and made getting in and out difficult.\n\nservice:  5/5 service here was fantastic.  the waiters (i didn't see any waitresses) were all in tuxes and very professional but more importantly friendly.  plates and dishes were cleared promptly and the waiter chatted and joked with us.  amusingly enough, we stopped a bus boy (who was also dressed in a tux) if he could bring us a jus -- he either misheard or didn't know what it was, but he did his best and we were brought some other sauce.  (some white gravy stuff that turned out to be pretty tasty)\n\nsurf: 4/5 i didn't try the oysters but the table seemed to enjoy them.  the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> pretty much just tasted like crab to me.  the mustard sauce didn't have much flavor in my opinion.  i was underwhelmed by the crab but it was neat trying them.  i wouldn't feel the need to order that again.\n\nturf: 4/5 the meat was good.  4 of us ordered the petite <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> -- strangely i think only one of us finished it.  i guess we got filled up with the delicious bread (5/5!).  the meat itself wasn't bad but not amazing.  i think it was worth the money but sadly not memorable.  the fresh horseradish was not very spicy, their special mix of spices/seasoning was tasty (but very salty)\n\nside dishes: 3/5 we tried a few of their dishes.  ranked from least favorite to favorite.  1) the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> could have been entirely skipped.  it was flavorless.  2) the mac n cheese was ok, they used spiral noodles.  if you're in the mood for mac n cheese you'd probably be satisfied, but it also wasn't memorable.  then again i think i've started expecting bacon and maybe gouda in my mac n cheese now... 3.  <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  the crusty crumbly bits on top were yummy and the melted cheese inside was great.  it was strangely dry though.  my idea <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> have chunks of firm potato and then soft creamy potatoes in it... this was just a little dry but great flavor.  worth ordering  4) the sweet corn was surprisingly great!  i usually like corn plain, but this was really delicious.  i think we were all surprised with how good this was -- that was the only side plate that was entirely finished.\n\ndessert 5/5: we ordered the key lime pie.  all their desserts are made fresh daily and since this is originally a florida restaurant -- we decided on the key lime pie.  it was thankfully not green and was very light and at least for me, the best key lime pie i've ever had.  i finished most of the pie even though i couldn't even finish my steak (and lemme tell ya what a steak person i am!).  the coffee was also excellent according to my friends, but i think starbucks is good so i wouldn't know.  sorry!\n\noverall, it was a great meal.  if i went back to vegas i'd probably want to try a different restaurant but i certainly recommend this place to anyone who hasn't been there.  the meal ended up being a final cost of  $78/person (that includes a $40 bottle wine). \n\ni'd recommend coming here with at least 4 people (we had 6) since the side dishes family style.  apparently, you can get joe's delivered to your house.",

            "first of all, lunch. surprisingly there aren't that many nice places to have lunch on the strip: joe's is one of the best choices, particularly if you are unsure of your companion's dining preferences or looking to find something moderately priced and moderately fast (there are small salads, sandwches and burgers on the bar menu). \n\na spin-off of the miami legend, joe's offers three distinct environments --a bustling patio in the elegant forum rotunda, a very large casual bar, and a huge 40s-50s era dining room that is classic (i also discovered they have two round function rooms overlooking the strip and a elegantly old school \"boardroom\" for private dining/meeting).\n\ncoat and tie not required, but common, esp. in dining room--and large parties seem to be common. it isn't surprising to run into both casino heavy hitters (even those from competing properties, who could eat elsewhere for free) as well as visiting celebs. tuxedoed waiters  provide detailed service...though when things get very busy, they may run by you a bit too quickly.\n\nthe menu is full of surprises--beyond the expected <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws, shrimp, oysters rockafeller, <mark>Shrimp De Jonghe</mark> (basically breaded scampi, but made with impressively tender prawns), <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> and fish dishes, there is an excellent chopped vegetable salad, good garlic <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> and roasted corn.\n\nthe bone-in <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> was among the very best i've had in vegas. and i have to tell you that i have sampled virtually all of the best steakhouses here.\n\nour dover sole was lightly breaded and gorgeously saut\\u00e9ed to a golden hue; the waiter deftly deboned it at the table and served it with a slightly carmelized lemon butter (it didn't need it).\n\nthe <mark>Joe's Fried Chicken</mark> was another unexpected surprise, a hefty four pieces, lightly battered and deep fried, the crispy crumb batter giving way to moist flavorful meat within. savory but light.\n\nin season, the <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> here are far and away the best i've had: sweet, juicy, light with none of the mealy taste you get from lesser crab. \n\ntheir pies are offered in half portions-a great option should you want to sample more than one. i have had uneven experiences with the signature key lime pie--one time it was perfect, another time, it was rock-solid frozen, and the waiter neither apologized nor replaced it when i complained. \n\ngenerally speaking, prices are on the high side but the quality reflects that. order with care.",

(btw, there were other children dining there, i tried to find some logical reason for this crap) was is a racist thing? heck if i know, it doesn't matter what it was, it was wrong and the end result: because of that, even if i love their food, they get a 1-star rating. this situation really upset me, i cringe every time we go there and i see that db.\n\nneedless to say, this particular night, we ate at another restaurant and it goes to show, bad service can leave a bad impression that can last for years.",

            "let's face it.  if you want a steak in vegas, a seafood place wouldn't be your first pick.  however, joe's combines the best of both worlds. made a reservation for a monday night while attending a conference in vegas.  the place was crowded.  seating in the front (outside in the forum shops), in the middle of the restaurant with the bar, and more intimate dining in the back.  \n\nordered the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> to start - nothing fancy (which is a tad ironic considering the place is located in caesars palace.)  since the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> is so famous, also ordered some to try.  some roasted corn on the side was a recommendation from the waiter.  and for the main course, a dry-aged bone in rib eye steak.  \n\nthe <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> was good - not as sweet as i had imagined.  then again, being from the san francisco bay area, i get spoiled by dungeness crab.  but good nevertheless.  the steak was fantastic!  cooked perfectly.  seasoned perfectly.   the bone-in adds so much flavor.  superb quality.  and the corn was really delicious with a smoky, peppery flavor.    \n\nto top off the meal, i had to try their key lime pie which someone had said they fly in from florida.  not having been to florida and not sure if this rumor was true, this was still the best key lime pie i've ever tasted.\n\nwould really love to come back to joe's someday.  great experience and excellent food.", 
            "i would have given this 3.5 stars, but i will go with the 4 stars. the 3.5 was based on my other parties experience. \n\nfirst we had to try the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>, so we got two <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> and for two is was $22.95. but they were unlike any crab i have ever had, the texture was a little more solid then other crabs and they serve it with this chilled mustard sauce, which is ummmmmmmmmm so good. we even saved the sauce to try it with the petite <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark>. \n\nmy wife ordered the <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> which i had a bite and it was very good, she ordered it with a creamy horseradish sauce, but combine the mustard and the horseradish sauce together and you have a match made in heaven.\n\ni ordered the stone <mark>Crab Bisque</mark>, which was very rich, but very tasty. \n\nsince everything is al carte, we ordered the lyonnaise potatoes, which these portions are big enough for 3 to 4 people to share. the potatoes where crispy and the onions on top were cooked to perfection great side.\n\nother people in our group ordered the prime bone-in dry aged ribeye, i didn't try it but both people who ordered it didn't like it. but the two people in our group who ordered the <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark>, both loved it.",

            "i really like the steak here. as a resident of la, i still haven't found a place that serves a great steak other than this place in vegas. although i do have a somewhat limited steak repertoire since i haven't tried many of the midwest steakhouses, my parents make a fabulous steak so i feel that i'm qualified to judge a great steak.\n\ni've tried mastros and i thought it was merely adequate. \n\ni like the steak at joe's.\nwe also had the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws which were delicious.\nwe also had the key lime pie and the peanut butter dessert. i thought they were really good.\n\none nice option is that you can have them give you half portions of the desserts.\n\nall in all, this is one of my favorite places so we really want to come back here all the time.", 
            "i went to joe's for the first time last night.  i was with a group of 14 people, 10 of whom were in from out of town and it was their pick.  as a local, who doesn't smoke or gamble i spend very little time on the strip and do my best to find great off strip bars and restaurants.  joe's is worth braving the traffic and tourists!   \n\nwe were given a private room with a fantastic server, thomas.  everything was absolutely fantastic.  we started with the appetizer called the second mortgage.  it has jumbo shrimp, lobster cocktail, alaskan king crab and shrimp & <mark>Shrimp & Scallop Ceviche</mark>.  the seafood was fresh, beautifully presented and delicious.  next i had the stone <mark>Crab Bisque</mark>, which was silky, flavorful and actually contained small pieces of <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>.  i ordered the <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> which were huge, amazingly tasty and probably 95% crab with just enough filler to keep them from falling apart.  \n\nmy bf had the bone in rib eye which was quite possibly the best steak i've ever tasted.  it was a beautiful, extremely high quality cut of meat that was cooked to a perfect medium rare.  others in my party had the bone in filet which was also high quality and cooked perfectly.  also, one other ordered the dover sole, which i highly recommend.  it was fresh and cooked perfectly.  it was also expertly and impressively deboned table side.  the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> are also very good.  they come pre-cracked so; all you have to do is peel back <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> pieces and savor the incredibly sweet <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> meat.  for dessert we tried the blueberry pie a la mode, the key lime pie and the banana cream pie, all of which are made fresh in house daily and were incredible.   however, the banana cream pie was a standout.  it was amazing!\n\neverything from the atmosphere, the service and the food were incredible.", 
            "all i can think about from my vegas trip is joe's seafood!! it wasn't about all the partying, drinking, gambling or any of that it was just how darn good this place was !! \n\nthe night was started off by looking for a seafood place to go and eat at. mainly looking through yelp to find one. i didn't really want to get a buffet but i wanted a nice classy sit down and order your food ! i got what i wanted and called joe's seafood up. \n\nthey said they could take us in a few hours and indeed they did. while walking through this place you will notice that every server is wearing a nice black suit and it seems formal but hey we are in vegas and i saw many patrons wearing just flip flops and t shirts. \n\ni did call about the dress code but they said they do prefer business but doesn't matter if you are dressed in casual. so off we went on this find adventure!!\n\nthe order: \n<mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark>- it is one large <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> which is cooked or pan fried lightly for a little bit of crisp on the outside. the inside is nice and soft with a hint of mayo. the taste is amazing and i would say this is on my top 10 list of <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark>. \n\n<mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claw- had two of these and they are served chilled with a wedge of lemon but you really don't need anything. just try it without and you can tell that this is really good crab. the flavor is nice and and amazing. i wish i could just eat more...but we wanted to try everything!\n\n<mark>Crab Bisque</mark>- not my favorite thing on my meal. i didn't even finish it because it just had a very bad buttery flavor. it tasted way too fatty for me and i just didn't like it. \n\nparmesan crusted halibut- need to order this, the crust was just perfect amount of crispiness in each bite with the fish. also the fish was not at all dry and it just had an awesome flavor. love love it!! must order if you come here. \n\nhalf order of <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>- on the top of it was some very crispy cheese topping. i can tell you the half order was huge. we didn't even finish most of the sides because we were just stuffed with food!!\n\nhalf order of mac and cheese- i see mushrooms yeah !! :) i liked how the texture of the pasta is and also how they did the mac and cheese, it is defiantly a different style. not from kraft and it does taste a whole lot better. \n\noverall the meal was perfect, the server that we had was a very nice lady and she didn't hassle us about what we ordered or if we needed to order more. i know some places might be a little bit on the mad side if you only order one meal but seriously..i can't eat a whole lot and the portion size is out of this world!! most places feed you a very large size and this is one of them!! everything was large and good !! the only thing i would suggest not getting is the <mark>Crab Bisque</mark>. \n\nbut my experience at joe's has made me want to come to vegas more often to get a nice meal in!! see you soon joe!",

            "i wanted to bring my boyfriend to a nice dinner for his birthday - he of course wanted to go back to mastro's but i told him we had to try somewhere new. after leaving joe's the was happy with this choice and that's all i can ask for since it was his birthday and i wanted to make sure it was special. i on the other hand left unsatisfied but it was my own fault because i didn't order what i actually wanted for my entree. we decided to opt out of getting an appetizer because we never finish our entrees and my main plan was to get the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> appetizer and scallops as my entree but because we decided on no appetizer i got the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> as my entree. every review talks about the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> so i figured we couldn't miss out on trying it. they were really good, the meat was sweet but i do recommend only getting them as an appetizer unless you want a cold entree. my boyfriend of course got the <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> and lobster and the filet was cooked perfect and as well as the lobster. and luckily he is a generous person and let me take a few bites of his plate since he could tell i wasn't so happy with mine. \nthe service was great - once we walked in and gave our names the host right away turned to cam and wished him a happy birthday. we had reservations so we were seated quickly. drinks were never empty and our table was cleaned before they brought out the birthday cake (that is a huge pet peeve of mine - don't bring out the cake until our table is cleaned off. nothing like a bunch of dirty empty dishes on the table as we sing happy birthday! maybe i'm weird but it does bother me.)", 
            "eat at joe's! this place is really top notch people. i was lucky enough to go here for my birthday in june. i had the select <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> and a filet. it was one of the best seasoned and perfectly cooked(medium rare) steaks i've ever had. this is from a guy who has had ruth's chris and mortons countless times. the service was perfect, we sat in the good fellas booth in the corner and felt like some og's for sure. it's def pricey, that comes with the territory and is all well worth it. check it out, unless you have trouble getting a table i doubt you'll find any reason to dislike this place.",

            "i know this is a place for seafood but trust me, the bone in ribeye is one of the best in the valley and yes, i've been to ruth chris, the steakhouse at circus circus and sw steakhouse at the wynn. \n\nmy server james definitely knew the menu and suggested some great items but for the most part, all of the servers are friendly, attentive and know the menus and the sommliers know their wine.  i've been a loyal customer for a few years now and dine in this place for lunch and dinner about once every four months. \n\nfor appetizers, i like the huge grilled madagascar shrimp with the lemon sprayed on it. when the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> is in season, it is always good to order, especially because it gives you an excuse to get some of that tasty tartar/mustard sauce it comes with. \n\nthe place has a front section that is casual but a back dining area for more intimate settings as well as an upstairs area for private parties. they touch all the bases.", 
            "yum.  so good.  their <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark> is excellent.  and of course the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>.  even the steak, scallop and king crab was good.",

            "i was looking forward to finally trying joe's <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>. i have seen on it tv shows, heard great things from others who have been there, and thought i was going to be in for a treat. unfortunately i was sadly mistaken. i went with the big <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> and we had the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, pan roasted sweet corn, <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>, lyonnaise with some <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark>. the oysters and sides were good and so was the wine (rioja) but the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> was a flop. now maybe it was because they weren't in season and if that was the case i will research and try them again when they are in season. what will make me seek out a different restaurant to try them in was the service. we had two tables with a total of 15 people. for the two tables we were given one waitress who was very slow. forget about the fact it took forever for us to get a drink order in, it took even longer for the drinks to finally arrive. overall it was a disappointing experience at what should have been an excellent restaurant. my company is in vegas twice a year and i was hoping this would be a restaurant that would be on our annual list, but it was so bad we skipped dessert and had cigars and after dinner drinks somewhere else instead.", 
            "we decided to go here for dinner before the show at caesars that night. everything is a la carte, so when you order a steak, that's all you get. sides are ordered separately, but each side will easily serve two people. i was in a party of five so everyone ordered their entrees and we had three side dishes, which was more than enough for my table. our server was spot on and courteous. i would probably put him near or at the top of the list of the servers i have had. \n\nwe ordered a <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> appetizer for all of us to share. it was the first time for me having <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> and i didn't think it was the greatest. but i knew what i had coming, so nothing was going to compare anyway. it probably isn't something i would order again. i absolutely had to order the table-side chilled <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> with melted butter. i died and went to heaven several times over! i normally prefer my crab meat warm instead of chilled, but who am i to complain if they're going to do all the work for me? it was so delicious i'm about to start drooling just thinking about how good it was. i normally make fun of my sister about being stingy with food, but i made the most food aggressive dog look tame with my <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>. the side dishes were good too, which ranged from <mark>French Fried</mark> to <mark><mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark></mark> to macaroni and cheese to green beans. it was a fairly good list so i don't remember all of them. \n\nit is a bit on the expensive side (my <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> were well worth the $60, though) so be prepared drop some bucks. if you're lucky enough, you'll be able to pay for the entire meal with casino winnings. if you like alaskan king crab, this is definitely the place for you.",

            "restaurant week is in full swing, and we are now 4 for 4! last night diane and i dined at joe's, and it was another great meal! \n\nwe arrived for dinner on thursday at 5:45 p.m., 15 minutes before our reservation, and were seated right away. by 7:00 p.m. the main dining room was almost completely full. we had never been here before, and i was a bit intimidated at first as i approached the high reception stand where a man in a jet black tuxedo with jet black hair towered over me. but he was friendly and professional, as were all of the other black bow-tied, black tuxedoed, and white aproned restaurant personnel we encountered during our visit. i had only seen the bar and mall dining areas before, and thought they comprised the whole restaurant. not so! we were ushered through a curtain to a very elegant dining room that had decorative lights on the wall and a decidedly new york city clubby steakhouse feel to it, with much dark wood and brown leather, white tablecloths, and several tables surrounded by comfortable booths along both main walls. it was very sophisticated but not pretentious, as were the several servers who moved briskly about like busy bees. it was interesting just watching them in action. \n\nwe went with the restaurant week menu, but augmented it with a two-claw appetizer of <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws and king crab mac & cheese. i always wondered whether i would be able to eat <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws because their ends look like elongated fingers painted with black nail polish. but it was easier than i thought, since that part of the claw is left alone. the claws arrived from the kitchen already largely crushed by a mallet, so it was not that difficult to pry apart the porcelain-like shell casing to get at the meat underneath. but there seemed to be less meat than found in alaskan crab claws. the thin morsels of crab meat tasted fine either dipped in drawn butter, the mild mustard sauce that was provided, or just eaten straight out of <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark>. yet i noted that they were not as sweet or satisfying as king crab claw meat. and, at about $22 for two claws, they were not cheap. so, for me, it is now \"been there, done that!\" but i will definitely return to joe's for its other fine fare, including lobster and king crab. \n\nalthough this was hardly needed, an assortment of bread products tasted good with the soft pats of butter provided. and a bowl of stone <mark>Crab Bisque</mark> was sweet and smooth--simply exquisite in taste and texture. i liked it better without the garnish of tiny cuts of carrots and zucchini that we asked to have served on the side, since diane's yelp nickname is \"veggie hater\" for a reason. but i picked the delicate morsels of <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> out of the garnish and tossed them in the wonderful soup, which avoided an inexcusable wasting of fine crab particles and made the soup even tastier. \n\na large <mark>Joe's <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark></mark> of lettuce, tomato, onion, and <mark>Chopped Lettuce, Tomato, Onion & Blue Cheese</mark> crumbles with a fine vinaigrette dressing was quite satisfying. my 8 oz. <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> with drinkable bearnaise sauce was simply divine. it was well seasoned on top, perfectly medium rare inside as ordered, and did literally melt in my mouth. i liked it better without the house seasonings, which i tried on a couple of bites. it was one of those steaks that kept getting better and better as slices of beef moved toward the rarer center. \n\ndiane's moist halibut had a tasty parmesan crust, augmented by a buerre blanc-like sauce that was provided. it was notably flatter than many servings of halibut experienced at other restaurants, but of ample portion size. the king crab mac & cheese, made with white shells, hunks of king crab, and bechamel sauce, tasted good, but was not nearly as noteworthy as the sumptuous <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> that were covered with a mix of baked asiago cheese and breadcrumbs. and, few lobster chunks were included in the dish. <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> was creamy as billed, and quite tasty. \n\njoe's signature key lime pie arrived ultra cold and almost frozen. after trying one bite, i let my slice sit for 5 minutes, and then it was just right, having lost its icy taste. it was very tart and delicious. \n\npeppermint gelato with hot fudge was not as memorable as the key lime pie, but the melted hot fudge was delicious. it had the strong taste of peppermint, and every now and then surprised the palate with peppermint candy chips. i would have preferred this dish during the christmas season! \n\nall in all, a wonderful five-star meal!", 
            "classy atmosphere, wine, tasty <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>, and succulent steak. joe's is top notch, the service is fantastic, and the food is delicious. if you're willing to throw some money down on a worthwhile meal, head here immediately.",

            "i am far from a steak and/or seafood connoisseur but as a food fanatic - i know a good steak and a good seafood joint when i eat at one. despite all the great reviews joe's received i'd have to say i'm rather disappointed. i'd rather give joe's 2.5 stars if i could but it was a touch below a-okay and i indeed have experienced better. but the prices were rather fair (steak and lobster wise). \n\nambiance was rather lively and loud. i would recommend this place more so for a fun date or a night out with the boys but not for romance due to noise levels. the host stand was very professional but gave a bit of a condescending presence as they tower over you and look down at you when being assisted. \nthe wait staff was full and plenty as we sat by what seemed to be the kitchen door. like worker ants they would file out of one door with food and in another door with empty plates. i don't recall our servers name but when we sat right around 7 o'clock service was top notch. there was other tables around us and we all seemed to have the proper amount of attention. food was brought out in a timely manner as were drinks. but the minute a large group sat next to us - we were no longer top priority. i understand this concept as i used to be a waiter myself - but it doesn't justify the action. after our main courses were dropped off - we ate. but with the larger group near by - we no longer got service. no one checked to see if we needed anything else. or if everything even tasted okay. we finished off our wine and our water and no refills were offered either. instead we ate our food and waited. when my brother asked for tabasco or steak sauce - we were told it was coming. but no one came. he asked a second time but again we were no longer a priority. \n\nthe food itself was mediocre. coming from seattle we have an abundance of steak houses and seafood so my standard is set high. the <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> i had was good. but far from great. tender and juicy and a very basic seasoning (i'm guessing just salt and pepper) nothing about it to set it above the rest. could have made the same dish buying a package of prime grade beef at costco. the lobster tail was a little under cooked for my taste. a little bit of a slimy texture in the center. and it was served in the tail (cut in half) on my plate which made it a little harder to eat as i'm used to (steak houses i go to), the waiter usually removes the tail from <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> before i consume it. i had no extra plate to place <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> on and i didn't find it appropriate to leave it on the table. so i worked around it. but i will say for $59.95 it was a fairly priced meal. my brother on the other hand had the <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> and <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>. we were \"sold\" that they were huge legs and delicious. fresh and great! when they came out... there was a measley (maybe) one leg cut into three pieces. not much bigger than snow crab. not huge, barely delicious... and if it wasn't for the melted butter - i wouldn't consider it very great.\ngiven that i have had true <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> before - a single leg about 2 feet in length and about 3 inches in diameter with claws the size of my hand... so yes my idea is skewed. but can i be blamed for expecting the best at a restaurant that self proclaims itself as the best in vegas?\n\nas we finished our meal - we had to waive a busser down to find our waiter to close our tab out. in the end... after rockerfeller oysters, kumoto oysters, <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>, <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> with lobster and king crab, and two glasses of wine. i can say... meh - i've experienced better.",

            "ok, this is a review for their seafood - as i've never eaten steaks there before.\n\ni used to love this restaurant. the last time i was in vegas, i stayed for 3 month - i take a long vacation every year,,, about 2 years ago. i went to joe's probably 5 times to eat king/<mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> and shrimps and such. it was amazing. 5 stars back then.\n\nthis time i have been staying in vegas for over 2 month already, eating out everyday and night - spending a lot of $$$$. sadly enough, i have found quality of vegas restaurant business has gone pretty bad. maybe it's because of the depression. maybe they've found easier way to get more money - like night club. well, whatever the reason was, i decided to go to joe's to refresh myself,,,, hopefully not to waste money anymore.\n\nservice - outstanding. they are the professionals.\n\natmosphere - 3 stars as always. not so special but it is all ok with me.\n\nfood - \n\ncrabs - not good anymore. they are pretty much tasteless. i don't know what happened to them. simply tasteless. not worth eating it even if it's $5.\n\nceviche - terrible. it was amazing last time, tho, this time it was like stuffing out of a cheap seafood taco made by hole in the wall type of place in la. they don't even use cilantro and red onion. they made it with some sort of salsa. shrimps and scallops didn't have any flavor. they were just chewy thing without any taste. terrible.\n\nlobsters - flavorless again. it doesn't even smell like a lobster. \n\noysters - it is ok. 2 years ago, it was much better, tho.\n\nwe have to walk away as soon as we finished drinking wines. all we order was just appetizer - ended up paying more than $100 for these small items. \n\ni was gonna rate it 3 stars for the service, but no,,,, i have to be honest because i don't want you to be disappointed. don't get crabs and shrimps this year (they were saying it was very seasonal, fresh, and good. turned out to be pretty crappy). maybe next year, they may able to find good seafood. \n\n\ni was looking forward to eating here for a while - so it was very disappointing.",

(asians just naturally look younger, but we are legal!!) \n\nthe food itself is definitely high quality and somewhat small portions; on top of the fact that it is vegas, the prices were definitely price-y. the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> was sold out (tip: come early if you want to try), so we settled for the king crab, six oysters, and salt and pepper shrimp. what i enjoyed was that with the crab, there was someone who would open the crab in front of you. served with butter and lemon, the crab had a nice, sweet flavor with great texture. the oysters were creamy and came with a vinegarette and tabasco sauce. lastly, our salt and pepper shrimp was fried and paired well with the creamy lemon aioli dip and lemon juice.\n\nthe ambiance is extremely classy and has an upscale vibe. the interior decor is beautiful and seems slightly antique. suited for both groups or dates; it's both intimate and comfortable. it is dimly light, but somehow the room glows; i'm assuming the light bounces off the decor. \n\noverall, would return to try <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> and steak, in addition to their seafood selection; although when i do come back, i hope service to be better considering their reputation is of high quality.",

            "went here with the hubby on tuesday night last week, and dinner was wonderful! i am a huge seafood lover, and this is probably one of the best seafood places i've had in ca or nv.  the food is fresh and very good, though a bit pricey.\n\nit's located at the very end of the forum shops at caesar's palace on the bottom/street level.  if you are coming from caesar's, it'll be in the right wing at the very end.  you'll need to take the escalator down one level.  \n\ni tried to make a reservation the day before on open table, but nothing was available for the entire evening for even just 2 people.\n\nso i called to ask what the wait would be for 2 people w/o reservations.  they said they don't like to give estimates on the phone because the wait times can change so quickly.  so i asked them what the average wait time would be overall, and they said anywhere from 10 - 45 minutes.\n\nso we walked over there to do a walk-in to see if they could accommodate.  at first, we got there at 6:45 pm and they told us it would be a 45 min wait.  but seeing there weren't a lot of people waiting around, we walked back up to check in on the wait at 7:05, and they were able to seat us at that time.  so our wait was just 20 minutes.\n\nsince i'm from so cal, i can get <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> pretty easily at the fisherman's wharf in redondo beach or even at 99 ranch supermarket.  they are fairly cheap to buy whole (santa barbara <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> are about $5/lb depending on the season), and the wharf or supermarket will steam them for free for you.  so that's why i didn't get <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> at joe's.  but if you haven't had <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> before, you should definitely get them because they are probably one of my favorite types of crab to eat (and i've had all kinds).  they are meaty, easy to break because of the stone-like shell, and have a sweet flavor.  \n\nhalf-dozen oysters (1 order):\n- i forgot what kind they were, but they were delicious.  even my husband who isn't a fan of oysters liked these.  i think what really made it good was their fresh tasting vinegar sauce that we used with it.  the oysters were very fresh tasting with no fishy taste.  i could've probably eaten a whole dozen by myself easily.\n\nfisherman's platter - grilled:\n- i got this and loved it.  it was a fair amount of food, though not a whole lot.  the server told me ahead of time when i asked how big the plate was that the amount of seafood added up to about 8 oz - the size of fish that they would give you on a fish plate.  with the mashed potato side we got, it was definitely enough food.  my husband tasted the scallops and remarked that they were probably some of the best he's ever had.  the seafood was very fresh, grilled with butter and maybe a bit of parsley and a bit of seasoning.  the shrimp were big and crunchy.  the squid pieces didn't taste rubbery or fishy.  the flavor was overall very good.  i would definitely get this dish again.  \n\nlobster-stuffed sole:\nmy husband got this and loved it.  in fact, i was debating getting this in the beginning, and upon tasting it was kinda wishing that i had.  the sauce was like a hollandaise sauce, but not as heavy.  the fish was very tender and the sauce with the lobster was really good.  \n\n<mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>:\nthese were special <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> that were very good!  they had a crunchy, cheese bread crumb type topping on them that was amazing.  the combination of the <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> with the crunchy topping was absolutely delicious.  it went perfectly with our meal, and i would definitely get these again.  i don't think i've run into any other place that makes their <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> like this.  very good and filling!\n\noverall, this is a great seafood place.  if there was one of these places in so cal, i would probably frequent it for most special occasions.  it's a bit pricey, but well worth it if you're wanting a nice good meal.  the service was great and the food was great.  the only thing was that we were seated at a table near the bar and there was a huge group of like 20 people that came in and were standing around by the bar (and hence our table).  our poor server had to squeeze by them each time she walked over to us.  so it got pretty loud in there, though we were still able to enjoy our food.",

            "i hate giving this restaurant a poor review, but i feel like it's justified, as my overall expectations were not met. \n\ni went to joe's this past weekend to celebrate my girlfriends birthday.  she loves crab, so i thought the perfect restaurant would be joe's <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>. neither of us have ever had <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> before.  we had a 9pm reservation on saturday night. after ordering, the waiter came back and informed us that they had run out of <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>. at first i thought he was joking, but then i realized he was completely serious.  i was initially shocked and then thoroughly disappointed that the special plans i made were now ruined.  so we canceled the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> we had ordered, and the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> that were in the \"whale\" appetizer were substituted with a small piece of alaskan king crab (i felt they could have done a lot more than that).  is a 9pm dinner in las vegas on a saturday night really that late of a dinner - should i have anticipated this shortage? i don't think i should have. let this be a warning to all that come for the claws - come early or else!\n\ni understand that the logistics of flying in a perishable product fresh every day. i do get that - i'm a rational/logical person. it doesn't change the fact that i was initially very upset, which just turned into major disappointment on this special occasion.  i mean, it's called \"joe's <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>\".  it's in the freaking name!  how can you run out of the very product you're named after? (that's a tongue in cheek, rhetorical question by the way - i've already acknowledged understanding the logistics.)\n\nfor what it's worth, the food and service were good. although my lobster was a bit dry on the edges (especially given the price), the sides and dessert were very good. the other food that i had sampled (ny strip) was good as well, but if you can't cook a steak properly in vegas, you may just as well shut your doors.  my friends all enjoyed their food and drink (although since i was footing the bill, they wouldn't have said otherwise so, who knows!). the highlights were the loaded roasted corn (excellent), hashbrowns, and the peanut butter pie (skip the banana cream pie).  they were nice enough to bring my girlfriend a dessert at the end for her birthday (although this was after we had ordered two desserts to share among five of us). i guess it was a nice gesture, but why didn't they offer that before we ordered dessert? we just took it with us, and it wasn't very good the next day.\n\nthe service was friendly and unobtrusive.  the waiter deterred us from getting two different versions of the hashbrowns as they portions are very large, and we were very glad he did. the restaurant added an automatic gratuity of 18% for our table of five, which i'm glad the waiter pointed out to me. i found this a little odd, because i think in the long run, automatic gratuity for small parties doesn't favor the waitstaff. i typically tip about 20% on the pre-tax subtotal because it's easy to calculate, so i wasn't taken back by it either.\n\ni feel like i could have had the same steak and lobster type dinner at one of two dozen restaurants in vegas, without the long walk through the caesar's mall (ten-fifteen minute walk from taxi to restaurant) and the bitter disappointment at the beginning of the meal.  would i have gone to this restaurant knowing they didn't have <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>? certainly not.  will i attempt to dine there again in the future?  probably not at that location. i will wait until i make it to miami so i can have reasonable assurance they will not run out of <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>.",

            "it's times like these when i truly enjoy writing a deserved review on a restaurant. we had actually planned to go to a crawfish place for dinner, but i really wanted to try something else for once...since we always go to the crawfish place when we come to vegas.\n\nmy first impression when walking toward this restaurant was....wow....this place looks really expensive, so it better be good! located in the forum shopping mall at caesar's, the restaurant looks like a long and well established classic american bar and restaurant. we were greeted at the entrance by a host who seated us right away....likely because we showed up early at around 5.30pm....but even then, the place was very busy. we were led to our table where we were introduced to our waiter itodd) who took very good care of us. both the host and todd were extremely polite and nice, courteous, and professional, and made us feel like the most important guests at the restaurant.....real class.\n\nin less than a minute, a fresh basket of yummy bread was placed on our table....and it looked gooooood! ....and after tasting it....wow, delicious. todd then came over and showed us the menu with the featured specials, which all sounded absolutely amazing.  everything on main menu looked absolutely delicious, but we couldn't order everything that looked good as we would not have been able to finish it all.....so we were very selective. as an appetizer we ordered the <mark>Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>.... and omg,...they were absolutely delicious! i can quite confidently say without a doubt that these were the best i have ever tasted! next, how could we have come to joe's without trying their 5-piece signature <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws. also absolutely delicious....and together with their special dipping sauce.....absolutely fantastic! $65 for 5 claws.....well, it better have been good! already cracked, todd was good enough to instruct us how they are supposed to be peeled and eaten....and afterwards, brought us some lemon to squeeze on our hands and wet towels to clean our hands of the fishy crab smell. and it actually worked!\n\nfor our entrees, we ordered their featured special grilled dover sole, which was de-boned at table side. simply squeezed lemon on top and you have one absolutely delicious fish meal. for myself, i ordered the roasted black cod as this is one of my favorite types of fish. it was cooked and served in a mild tomato broth with olives and herb oil. the cod was so fresh and perfectly cooked.....and the broth was mild enough as to no way overpower the fish.....every part of this dish complimented each other.....i absolutely loved it.....i thought the portion was a bit small, so thank goodness my friends and i shared everything. for sides, we ordered the <mark>Sauteed Broccolini</mark> and highly recommended roasted swee corn. both were also perfectly cooked and delicious. the serving of corn was good, but i think there should have been a bit more broccolini in the dish.\n\nall this together with a bottle of wine......wow.....life is good....and this restaurant qualifies as being one of the best restaurants i have ever tried! the service was excellent and attentive, and i will say that it was worth every dollar we spent on this dinner. i will definitely be back when i'm next in town. oh, we were brought the wrong check, but it's a good thing we normally check everything before paying.\n\ni love this place! :)",

            "joe's is exactly what you would expect when you think of fine dining. the service was 10/10. the waiters kept your beverage glass full at all times, the food came ridiculously fast, and every worker was beyond pleasant. \n\nfor appetizers we ordered calamari and <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark>. both of the appetizers were fantastic! even the bread basket was delicious! this included various types of bread such as dinner rolls, pretzel bread, and a type of onion bread. \n\nas for the main dish, i ordered the filet oscar which consists of a 6 oz <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark>, asparagus, and <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>. the only reason i give them 4 stars instead of 5 because i was disappointed with the <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>. on the menu it says alaskan king crab \"legs\" not \"leg\". it was very disappointing that they only gave one leg, especially since the crab was so appetizing! \n\nwe also ordered the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> legs. this was my first time trying <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> legs and i didn't know what to expect. i thought the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> legs were pretty good. it was just really different from what i'm used to. it has a bitter kind of taste, i can't exactly pinpoint it. \n\nanother reason why i deducted a star was because on the bill they automatically add 18% for tip. before we got the bill we were planning to tip more than 18%, but we were kind of disappointed when got the bill. i feel that a person should tip at least 10%, and if the service is excellent then that determines how much more a person should tip.",

            "i'll admit, this place is extremely pricey but if you have the money it is well worth it. we ordered the seafood sampler appetizer for two which came with ceviche, shrimp, and <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>. i think that came out to be around $23 per person. we also ordered <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> legs. these were amazing... my only complaint is that there wasn't more :/ we went during the off season i think so the legs were pretty expensive. overall, it was a pretty good time.",

            "this is an old time favorite for me from my numerous visits to the original location in south beach. this most recent visit at caesars did not live up to this establishment's reputation for one reason and one reason alone: the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws were sub-par mostly because these bad boys are not in season and what was served was probably of the frozen variety which just does not live up to the billing. i would have expected the server to at least have reminded us that this was an off season item so i could take that into account in selecting my entree. everything else was as good as it always is.",

            "having walked by joe's many times in the past six years and intrigued by the camaderie of the restaurant, i finally decided to make a reservation here for my pop's birthday dinner. after having our dinner here, i have decided joe's is actually a 3-star restaurant hidden behind their parade of waiters in suits and their famous <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>. \n\nin a city bustling with celebrity chef restaurants, joe's fails to scratch at the surface of the upper echelon that consists of places like sw steakhouse or joel robuchon. there's no single bad element that defines joe's, but it was a combination of little miscues that diminished my experience here. \n\n1) mac & cheese was too runny for my liking. i thought gourmet mac & cheese would have more texture, but this side dish was slathered in kraft-like liquid cheese.\n\n2) most upscale joints have their waiters/assistants scrap off bread crumbs off the white tablecloth onto a pan. details like that are supposed to enhance your fine-dining experience. but this particular evening, the assistant to our waiter just scraped the breadcrumbs onto the ground. i felt that small detail made my dinner less-than-memorable. \n\n3) the complimentary bread was less than stellar. i have had better bread at lower $$ establishments. i liked that there was variety to the bread basket, but some of the choices tasted stale. \n\npops and i both ordered the steak & lobster dinner. dinner tasted delicious, but it fails to distinguish itself from previous steak and seafood joints i have eaten at. is joe's worth visiting once in your lifetime? yes, it has some good qualities. the <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> were very good and i enjoyed the custom-inked cloth napkins in the upstairs restroom. i just don't find myself rushing back here anytime soon.", 
            "i was in vegas for vacation of course! i took my family here for my mom's birthday. now i must preface this review by saying my mom is the pickiest eater i know. i've taken her out to eat at many places. i was so happy to hear her saying that this was the best place i've ever taken her and the best sea food she's ever had! she went home and told my dad all about it and got him all jealous he missed out--he's allergic to shellfish!\n\nwe ordered 4 servings of <mark>Manhattan Clam Chowder</mark>, 1 <mark>Grilled Seafood Platter</mark> , 1 pound of the smallest <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws, some brocollini for a side, and 2 kids meals. the <mark>Grilled Seafood Platter</mark> came with scallops, lobster tail, and madagascar shrimp. wow, this is the first time i've actually liked scallops! they were big and meaty! the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws were cold but the meat was sweet and even the small ones had lots of meat! it was like a classier version of the atlantic blue crab that i am so used to eating on the east coast. i was not a fan of the mustard dip that it came with but the crab meat in itself had great flavor. just some lemon juice was enough!\n\nwhat i love about this restaurant is their affordable kids menu so you can bring your kids here and have them eat nice stuff, too! if they can't finish it, you can just get more food for yourself because these kids meals are basically slightly smaller portioned adult meals at like less than half the cost. sure the selection is not as extensive, but if you want <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> or <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark>, these meals are a great price! i brought two younger siblings and one ordered a 6oz <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> and the other mac and cheese. joe's have $17 kids meals with steak and <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> and $9 meals with some kind of starch or chicken nuggets, etc, you know the usual kids stuff. stay away from the $9 meals. the mac and cheese was total crap. easy mac would have been better!! it was more like hard, dry pasta shells and butter. my sister couldn't finish it. the steak however was the same quality as the adult version and cost 1/3 the price for a slightly smaller portion! each kids meal also came with a free side. one sibling picked broccolini and it was the same serving size as the appetizer portion i paid $9 for if not bigger!! seriously (look at the picture i posted). the only difference was the brocollini that came with the kids meal was steamed and the other off the menu was grilled with olive oil. each kids meal also came with the brownie sundae, which i'm pretty sure is the exact same thing they charge adults $8 for on the dessert menu! needless to say, the sundae was delicious. seriously, if you have kids, just use that as an excuse order some stuff for less than half the price on the regular menu.\n\nas for the more adult stuff, i don't think you can go wrong ordering shellfish here. everything tasted amazingly exotic and fresh. you must get the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws! i didn't know that they harvested the claws by taking one claw and throwing the crab back in the ocean! the claw regenerates! gasp! do they rotate which claw they take from the crab? is it the left or right one? i digress. i tried my other sister's steak and it was good but not something amazing (nothing i can't cook at home with a good cut of meat), so i can't say i would recommend the steak over the seafood. stay away from starches like pasta because based on the mac and cheese my sister had, i don't have faith in those dishes. why would you pray premium prices for starch dishes anyway? \n\noh and the complimentary bread was crap. olive garden probably has better. again, i don't think they know how to cook their carbs here.\n\nservice was good. our waitress, mindy, was very knowledgeable about the menu, had good recommendations and checked on us often. she didn't seem super accommodating, however. my mom didn't like her wine and she didn't offer to comp it or take it back. it wasn't that expensive glass of wine either, $8. usually nice restaurants just take stuff you really don't like off the bill and offer to replace it with something else.\n\noh, and don't worry about how to dress at this restaurant. my family showed up in hoodies and jeans and there was no problems getting service. this is touristy vegas!\n\nin the end my bill after tax and tip was over $230. it was worth it though because we left stuffed as a party of 4 (2 adults and 2 teens) and it included alcohol, dessert, and coffee, too! yum!",

            "the skinny : come for lunch as the prices are much more reasonable - get the 2 course lunch for a great deal.  the <mark>Roast Turkey & Avocado</mark> sammy is my fav(3.5) service is solid (4) value: depends on what you order.  stick to the sandwiches and the 2 course lunch and you should make out fine (3.5 bump up to 4)\n\njust to preface this review -  <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> is not all that for me. neither is crab in general. but we still make our way to joe's for lunch to catch some of their other menu items. \n\nwe usually go during the summer when lettuce entertain you club members receive coupons to dine in their local joints. usually there is a coupon for joe's which is a major score (yay!). \n\nwe've tried different iterations of things but the true stand outs for us is the lunch menu which is way easier on the wallet than dinner. \n\nmy perennial favorite is their <mark>Roast Turkey & Avocado</mark> sandwich. served with real roasted moist turkey and a nice thick slice of bacon, it is a simple dish done really well. love the combination of alfalfa sprouts, tomato and avocado. the fried <mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark> fries are pretty solid but nothing special. for $16, this is as affordable for a place like joe's gets. \n\nthe hubs loves their sliced rib eye french dip with saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms and onions and a side of fries. ($22) it's messy/juicy but oh so good sandwich served on a ciabatta roll. the <mark>French Fried</mark> again are nothing special. \n\nthe two course lunch is a good deal if you consider how much they charge for sides and dessert. between the two options of alaskan king crab vs.  the steak,  i would opt for the crab. \n\nreally,  the crab is only okay in my books. portion size for this is pretty small -  about 5 small legs. where it stands out is the lyonnaise potatoes and roasted sweet corn. the lyonnaise potatoes is kind of like a large mound of hash browns topped with caramelized onions. greasy but very tasty. the roasted sweet corn with a hint of lime is great too. both portion sizes for the sides are really a lot for one person and easily shared. it comes with havana dream pie which is essential a boston cream pie minus the chocolate topping and instead dulce de leches with a hit of cinnamon. if you decide you want banana cream pie or key lime pie instead (both are pretty good) ,  they will accommodate you. all of this for around $28-29.\n\nthe steak option is okay - just the <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> are boring while the saut\\u00e9ed spinach is nothing special. \n\nservice is prompt generally during lunch hours due to all the power lunches that go down here. as soon as you are seated,  they make sure the water glasses are filled and a basket of warmed bread is placed while you peruse the menu. the bread basket is okay but i find myself partial to the parker roll and the lavosh -  both are kind of guilty pleasures.\n\noverall, joe's is nothing particularly innovative. but it is good food executed well generally. value is largely during the lunch hours with decent eats for a more reasonable price point. 3.5 starred review with bump up to 4.",

            "pretty much all i can say is wow. this place blew us away with only a couple of small things i wish could have been different. \n\nwhen i finally narrowed down where we would be going for my birthday dinner, i easily made a reservation via opentable and requested a table in the back (got this info from other yelp reviews) and said it was going to be my birthday. \n\nwe took a cab to caesar's after getting a very late start to the day, did a little gambling and then walked through the forum shoppes to the restaurant. we were escorted to the host desk for the back of the restaurant and were seated in a large booth looking onto the rest of the back room. everyone was friendly and worked together as a team seamlessly. \n\nour waiter was very reserved while still having a nice sense of humor. i ordered a cosmo which was perfectly balanced and with a perfect punch. the bread basket was yummy with lavash to devour and an assortment of breads. our favorite was a cheese and shallot ciabatta. we started with a medium order of  the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> (less sweet than dungeness but more meaty and tender). it came with a mayo based dipping sauce, but i asked for cocktail sauce and they also brought clarified butter). the cocktail sauce was awesome and had a nice kick on  its own, but what was so cool is that there was a dollop of horseradish on the side like a garnish, but to allow each guest to make their cocktail sauce a spicy as they want it. it was something i had never seen before and quite memorable.\n\nwe shared a <mark>Joe's <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark></mark> which was kindly split in the kitchen. it was underdressed and one of the items we wished we hadn't ordered. for our mains, the husband opted for the beef wellington (as rare as possible) and i ordered the bone in ribeye- medium rare. for sides to share, we opted for the greenbeans ammadine (not almandine) and the special of augratin potatoes. my steak was beautiful. it was perfectly cooked, seasoned and truthfully probably the best rib eye i have eaten in a restaurant of any caliber (and i have had many). the wellington was too rare for me to taste, but the husband loved it and we really liked the green beans. the only \"miss\" here were the potatoes as they were pretty unremarkable and missing cheese and proper seasoning.\n\ni had been looking forward to the key lime pie i had been reading about as my birthday dessert, so when the waiter brought out a very rich chocolate brownie sundae with a candle, i was a bit disappointed. i am a peasant when it comes to chocolate (i consider milk see's the fancy kind i like), this brownie was so rich even my husband could only muster a few bites. when our waiter came by, i inquired about a slice of the key lime pie, and he asked if i wanted a half slice (who knew they could do that?). i was glad i spoke up and my half slice arrived promptly and was the perfect way for me to end a rich and satisfying meal. \n\nwinner winner birthday dinner and seriously look forward to coming back here someday.  \n\n  .",

            "the service was on point.  i will say the best things to eat here is the steak, <mark>Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms</mark> and key lime pie.  i came here with a party of four and we ordered a lot of food.  the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> were our app which weren't worth the money paid for.  but i'm from maryland were we eat crabs all the time and it's hard to convince me that a place outside of the maryland area really has some good crabs or not.  we also had asparagus but those were the worst asparagus i've ever had.  the didn't even seem completely green either like true asparagus.  the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> was the worst.  not sure how they mess up on that.   the mash potato's were ok but i had better at outback.  we also has the apple, keylime and banana pie.  all of them were basic except the keylime which was good.  over all i don't see me coming back to this place and it's over rated.  if you want good crabs in vegas go to the super market and order you some.  or go spend your money at the caesar buffet which is well worth the money.",

            "while i'm not normally a fan of restaurants transplanted from their original location, i must say that joe's in las vegas is one of my favorites.  there are pictures in the restaurant from miami beach, fl however their website only mentions a sister restaurant in chicago so i'm not sure if this is truly related to the miami beach location.  regardless, i love it there and i eat there almost every time i visit las vegas.  i usually get a <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> appetizer assuming its the proper season.  the crab is always delicious although this past visit there were a few small pieces of shell that i had to pick out as i removed the meat (maybe this is normal?)  for my main course i usually have some type of fish and whatever i've had always tastes fresh.  my dining companions had <mark>Crispy Fried Shrimp</mark> which was crispy and yummy and another companion had a steak which was also up to fine steakhouse standards.  side dishes were corn (among the best corn i ever had) and two types of potatoes.  i had key lime pie for desert which tasted like what i've had in key west.  i was told it was made with genuine key limes which isn't the case with most restaurant versions.  while ordering, our server gave us the option of having two 1/2 sides of two different kind of potatoes when she saw we were indecisive of which to order.  a small touch like this goes a long way.  on that note, something that differentiates this restaurant from the rest is the service.  the service here is always top notch.  each time i eat here i feel welcome, and enjoy how the staff is efficient without hovering over us.  this is by far one of my favorite restaurants in las vegas.  great food and great service.",

            "if i could only eat everything on this entire menu, i would! anything you order here will exceed your expectations. i have to say, thank you joe's for coming to las vegas.....but i hope one day you will come to los angeles!\n\ni came here with my family for dinner and had such a great experience. with superb customer service and top notch seafood, i wish i could give this restaurants 10 stars!\n\n<mark>Crab Bisque</mark>- smooth buttery soup filled with crab pieces. just perfect to share.\n\n<mark>Ahi Tuna Tartare</mark>- chunky pieces of ahi that were not overwhleming or too puny. perfect in size. the ahi just melted in your mouth; not overly seasoned. \n\n<mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>- how can you not get <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> here? it is famous...you almost want to bypass it, but you just can't resist. we got the select size since it wouldn't be too small nor too pricey! you must try this!  the crab piece just fell apart and it tasted so flavorful. \n\n<mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark>- this has got to be the best <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> or just in par with boston's legal seafood <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark>. i don't even know what to say, but it is just tons of crab pieces and not much of a filler. you hardly ever get that anywhere. \n\n<mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>- you can technically buy this at any grocery store, but i wanted to see how different it would be in a restaurant. it is basically the same, serve chilled with a complementary dipping sauce. \n\n<mark>Seared Sea Scallops</mark>- huge scallops seared perfectly with a slight crust on top! bam. the potato puree was the perfect addition.\n\n<mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> with bok choy- you can never go wrong with <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>. <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>' texture is always flaky and buttery. the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> probably literally melted in my mouth with every bite. \n\n<mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark>- you definitely can't go wrong with the filet mingon! perfectly grilled. just enough tenderness and a smooth cut everytime you poke your knife in it! flavor was on fleek!\n\nkey lime pie- basically couldn't decide on which dessert. we heard raving reviews on the key lime pie, but their signature was the boston cream pie. the key lime flavor had the perfect balance of sweet and sour. not one side was more overpowering than the other! i can just imagine eating another slice right now. \n\nboston cream pie- i usually hate all that creamy stuff, but this you will not regret! the cream was light and fluffy, the cake could have been smoother but all in all, every bite was consumed\n\nwe were a hungry family and ate literally everything on this menu! my favorite spot in vegas and would love to come back again."

            "my 2nd time here. i recommend their <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>. this time i ordered 6 blk <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> $40 again as an order. we asked for it to be steamed and served warm, & with lemon on the side since it was a little bland but tasted fresh!! they pre cracked it for us prior to serving which i thought was nice. we only had to peel <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> off easily. \n\nthey gave us salt and pepper on the side for the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> and complimentary bread when first seated. \nthe bread consisted of parmesan bread, salted pretzel bread, and other crispy wonton looking bread. \n\nalso ordered the 24 oz. bone-in ribeye $60 it was juicy, tender, and flavorful. i asked for medium well. it was delicious. this serves 2 people so i shared this also with an order of the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> and an order of mash potatoes.  3 entr\\u00e9es was enough. \n\ntheir jenny mash potatoe's $10 has bits of crispy onion or was it parmesan on top. it was also good. no complains.\n\nwith tax was $118 including 18% tip it was about $138 . not bad for a dinner date. \nmy only complaint was the server was on the side talking to her co-worker a couple of times when we needed to get her attention. also when we asked her opinion for which mash potatoes to order since there is 2 on the menu, she said both of them tasted good. the lyonnais and the jenny mash. hmm i would expect them to be more helpful. \n\nits okay, i would still come back for the great food! \n_______________________________________________\n\nthe 1st time i came here, feeding 3 people including me, we had ordered one order of <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> (6), <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>\n\n an order of \"<mark>Grilled Seafood Platter</mark>\" with <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, scallops, clams, and baby octopus, it tasted so good. \n\nand an order for asparagus on the side and salmon with grilled onion mash potatoes.",

            "we went to joe's on a very rare day that my husband and i were off on the same day; while the kids still had school. after walking through the forum shops at ceasar's we decided on joe's. the wait to be seated was about 10 mins...that was for a tall table in the bar area, not the outer patio seating which was packed with lunch customers. we expected the wait as all the reviews warned of how busy the restaurant usually is. \n\nonce seated, we were greeted immediately and our drink orders were taken. i had the amazing bloody mary while my husband had a stella. everything came in a timely manner...my bloody mary had a gigantic shrimp in it which was fantastic. the waitress then took our order and was very helpful in explaining the menu items and seasonal pricing. my hubby decided on the fishermans platter (he chose grilled, you can also get fried) while i had to have the signature crab claws. we both also ordered the side ceasar salad and a cup of lobster bisque.\n\nthe ceasar salad was good. not amazing or anything but a well put together well dressed salad. now, the lobster bisque was epic. velvety and creamy...my hubby and i were licking our spoons and wanting more. i definitely recommend the lobster bisque to anyone (besides those with shellfish allergies of course). the main courses then came out and they were nicely presented, just simple seafood and simple condiments. my husbands <mark>Grilled Seafood Platter</mark> was fresh, light, and delicious. the stand out star being the scallops which were super sweet and grilled perfectly. my crab claws we're delicious...definitely a bit of work to get to the meat but well worth it. i wasn't a big fan of their mustard sauce they serve with the claws, so i requested lemons and clarified butter. no issues. all in all in was a delightful lunch that i would definitely do again.", 
            "staff was great.  food was excellent. we had the <mark>Grilled Seafood Platter</mark> and the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> (select).  excellent choices.  we also had the saut\\u00e9ed oyster mushrooms.  again, great.  we go to joe's every time we are in vegas and love it.  wish we had one in colorado.  wine is pricey and the food is pricey.  but good.  we even bought the cookbook.",

(yes i repeated delicious purposely)\n\nthe staff is very professional and friendly. great ambiance. \n\ni can go on and describe how much i enjoyed my dinner, but i'd rather have you experience that yourself. go to joe's when you're in vegas... it's well worth it.", 
            "this is a very popular place for my family and mostly for wealthy business people, i have eaten here for lunch, dinner with my husband son and family and also had a large event dinner for the holidays for our family business. the food is amazing, bone-in filet, the different types of oysters, the fresh cold <mark>Grilled Seafood Platter</mark>, all to die for and i would definetely return for those items, but its hit or miss with service and staff, if they \"know\" you meaning you come often and tip well, i notice you get the best of the best service and interaction, but i've eaten there on other occasions and its clear that the servers treat you differently based on their initial impression of you and how you'll tip. prime example, eating there with a frequent diner and the female server suggests we get a platter of each type of oyster raving about where they're from and why she loves them each differently, but that same server at our large company party sadly suggested we stick to one type, i want to say maryland and gave a look of disgust towards some of the others on the menu, it was disappointing because i told guests how amazing they were and then it was a total let down.", 
            "my boyfriend and i had dinner here on feb 19th to celebrate an anniversary. this is by far one of the best meals i have ever had and was probably the best meal we ate in vegas during our stay. our server (i forget her name) was fantastic! super friendly and professional, made suggestions when appropriate but wasn't overly pushy. we started our meal off with the calamari to start which was great. for entrees i had the 8oz <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> and my boyfriend had the <mark>Crab Stuffed Shrimp</mark>. he initially was not sure about whether or not to get the <mark>Crab Stuffed Shrimp</mark> or the <mark>Grilled Seafood Platter</mark> but our server recommended the <mark>Crab Stuffed Shrimp</mark> and i am glad he followed her recommendation because they were delicious! for our side we had <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> which were also great. food was amazing, well cooked and well presented and very flavourful. service was professional and on point. will definitely recommend to others and will definitely return next time we are back. highlight of the night was our server bringing us out a complimentary brownie dessert for celebrating our anniversary which was so thoughtful and appreciated!\ndinner for two with drinks was around $115 which was not bad at all given the high quality in both food and service.",

            "i've had lawry's, ruth's chris & mastro's and this place does not compare to those steakhouses. \n\nmy sister & i wanted to eat a nice steak for dinner but since our mom wanted seafood, we settled for joe's (we were debating between lawry's & joe's). \n\nordered the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tartare</mark>, <mark>Grilled Seafood Platter</mark>, <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark>, bone-in ribeye, creamed corn & <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>. the portions were a lot smaller than anticipated. definitely incomparable to lawry's prime rib & sides. \n\n<mark>Ahi Tuna Tartare</mark>- 3/5 the appetizer was tiny with mediocre pieces of fish. the cracker? used for the tartare was a bit like pork rinds without the pork. was a good combo with the fish but definitely wouldn't order again. \n\n<mark>Grilled Seafood Platter</mark>- 4/5 came with maybe 6 pieces of scallop, 2 shrimp, and 3 lobster tails? this was a lot smaller than was expected as well. the buttery sauce it came with was delicious but nothing spectacular. my mom, however, was satisfied so thus we were as well. \n\n<mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark>- 2/5 we asked for a medium rare but instead we got more of a medium, which was quite chewy. the steak was seasoned well but some parts were very salty. definitely wouldn't order again. \n\nbone-in ribeye 4/5 the best part of the meal. asked for medium rare plus and got exactly that. it was juicy, flavorful & tender. since we shared all our plates, this was the first to go. \n\n<mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> & creamed corn! 4/5 \nboth tasted very good but again, small portions. the <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> contained some cheese and was topped with some kind of flakes that were amazing. the creamed corn was just absolutely phenomenal. definitely will order both again.\n\n finally, dessert! key lime pie & banana cream pie. 4/5 key lime pie was sour but the crust was delish! and the banana cream pie had a lot of cream in it but it was good as well. had to order it since it's like. only my favorite dessert ever. also ordered the coffee (from intelligentsia!) but it was so watered down & weak. asked for an espresso instead. \n\nservice 2/5 our server was not very friendly and was quite slow to tend to our needs. he kept saying he would get back to us but seemed uninterested in serving us. \n\nprobably will never come here again.", 
            "i was in vegas for vacation of course! i took my family here for my mom's birthday. now i must preface this review by saying my mom is the pickiest eater i know. i've taken her out to eat at many places. i was so happy to hear her saying that this was the best place i've ever taken her and the best sea food she's ever had! she went home and told my dad all about it and got him all jealous he missed out--he's allergic to shellfish!\n\nwe ordered 4 servings of <mark>Manhattan Clam Chowder</mark>, 1 <mark>Grilled Seafood Platter</mark> , 1 pound of the smallest <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws, some brocollini for a side, and 2 kids meals. the <mark>Grilled Seafood Platter</mark> came with scallops, lobster tail, and madagascar shrimp. wow, this is the first time i've actually liked scallops! they were big and meaty! the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws were cold but the meat was sweet and even the small ones had lots of meat! it was like a classier version of the atlantic blue crab that i am so used to eating on the east coast. i was not a fan of the mustard dip that it came with but the crab meat in itself had great flavor. just some lemon juice was enough!\n\nwhat i love about this restaurant is their affordable kids menu so you can bring your kids here and have them eat nice stuff, too! if they can't finish it, you can just get more food for yourself because these kids meals are basically slightly smaller portioned adult meals at like less than half the cost. sure the selection is not as extensive, but if you want <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> or <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark>, these meals are a great price! i brought two younger siblings and one ordered a 6oz <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> and the other mac and cheese. joe's have $17 kids meals with steak and <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> and $9 meals with some kind of starch or chicken nuggets, etc, you know the usual kids stuff. stay away from the $9 meals. the mac and cheese was total crap. easy mac would have been better!! it was more like hard, dry pasta shells and butter. my sister couldn't finish it. the steak however was the same quality as the adult version and cost 1/3 the price for a slightly smaller portion! each kids meal also came with a free side. one sibling picked broccolini and it was the same serving size as the appetizer portion i paid $9 for if not bigger!! seriously (look at the picture i posted). the only difference was the brocollini that came with the kids meal was steamed and the other off the menu was grilled with olive oil. each kids meal also came with the brownie sundae, which i'm pretty sure is the exact same thing they charge adults $8 for on the dessert menu! needless to say, the sundae was delicious. seriously, if you have kids, just use that as an excuse order some stuff for less than half the price on the regular menu.\n\nas for the more adult stuff, i don't think you can go wrong ordering shellfish here. everything tasted amazingly exotic and fresh. you must get the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws! i didn't know that they harvested the claws by taking one claw and throwing the crab back in the ocean! the claw regenerates! gasp! do they rotate which claw they take from the crab? is it the left or right one? i digress. i tried my other sister's steak and it was good but not something amazing (nothing i can't cook at home with a good cut of meat), so i can't say i would recommend the steak over the seafood. stay away from starches like pasta because based on the mac and cheese my sister had, i don't have faith in those dishes. why would you pray premium prices for starch dishes anyway? \n\noh and the complimentary bread was crap. olive garden probably has better. again, i don't think they know how to cook their carbs here.\n\nservice was good. our waitress, mindy, was very knowledgeable about the menu, had good recommendations and checked on us often. she didn't seem super accommodating, however. my mom didn't like her wine and she didn't offer to comp it or take it back. it wasn't that expensive glass of wine either, $8. usually nice restaurants just take stuff you really don't like off the bill and offer to replace it with something else.\n\noh, and don't worry about how to dress at this restaurant. my family showed up in hoodies and jeans and there was no problems getting service. this is touristy vegas!\n\nin the end my bill after tax and tip was over $230. it was worth it though because we left stuffed as a party of 4 (2 adults and 2 teens) and it included alcohol, dessert, and coffee, too! yum!",

(the sucker was bloody!) yes, she sent it back twice, but for the price we were paying, the waiter mightve exercised the \"customer is always right\" policy rather than rudeness. now she's never going back and ill have to think twice.\nbut hopefully,hopefully, he was just having a really bad day and the 3rd times not the charm. maybe its changed to the 4th!

            "i was looking forward to finally trying joe's <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>. i have seen on it tv shows, heard great things from others who have been there, and thought i was going to be in for a treat. unfortunately i was sadly mistaken. i went with the big <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> and we had the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, pan roasted sweet corn, <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>, lyonnaise with some <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark>. the oysters and sides were good and so was the wine (rioja) but the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> was a flop. now maybe it was because they weren't in season and if that was the case i will research and try them again when they are in season. what will make me seek out a different restaurant to try them in was the service. we had two tables with a total of 15 people. for the two tables we were given one waitress who was very slow. forget about the fact it took forever for us to get a drink order in, it took even longer for the drinks to finally arrive. overall it was a disappointing experience at what should have been an excellent restaurant. my company is in vegas twice a year and i was hoping this would be a restaurant that would be on our annual list, but it was so bad we skipped dessert and had cigars and after dinner drinks somewhere else instead.", 
            "we decided to go here for dinner before the show at caesars that night. everything is a la carte, so when you order a steak, that's all you get. sides are ordered separately, but each side will easily serve two people. i was in a party of five so everyone ordered their entrees and we had three side dishes, which was more than enough for my table. our server was spot on and courteous. i would probably put him near or at the top of the list of the servers i have had. \n\nwe ordered a <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> appetizer for all of us to share. it was the first time for me having <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> and i didn't think it was the greatest. but i knew what i had coming, so nothing was going to compare anyway. it probably isn't something i would order again. i absolutely had to order the table-side chilled <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> with melted butter. i died and went to heaven several times over! i normally prefer my crab meat warm instead of chilled, but who am i to complain if they're going to do all the work for me? it was so delicious i'm about to start drooling just thinking about how good it was. i normally make fun of my sister about being stingy with food, but i made the most food aggressive dog look tame with my <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>. the side dishes were good too, which ranged from <mark>French Fried</mark> to <mark><mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark></mark> to macaroni and cheese to green beans. it was a fairly good list so i don't remember all of them. \n\nit is a bit on the expensive side (my <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> were well worth the $60, though) so be prepared drop some bucks. if you're lucky enough, you'll be able to pay for the entire meal with casino winnings. if you like alaskan king crab, this is definitely the place for you.",

            "i am far from a steak and/or seafood connoisseur but as a food fanatic - i know a good steak and a good seafood joint when i eat at one. despite all the great reviews joe's received i'd have to say i'm rather disappointed. i'd rather give joe's 2.5 stars if i could but it was a touch below a-okay and i indeed have experienced better. but the prices were rather fair (steak and lobster wise). \n\nambiance was rather lively and loud. i would recommend this place more so for a fun date or a night out with the boys but not for romance due to noise levels. the host stand was very professional but gave a bit of a condescending presence as they tower over you and look down at you when being assisted. \nthe wait staff was full and plenty as we sat by what seemed to be the kitchen door. like worker ants they would file out of one door with food and in another door with empty plates. i don't recall our servers name but when we sat right around 7 o'clock service was top notch. there was other tables around us and we all seemed to have the proper amount of attention. food was brought out in a timely manner as were drinks. but the minute a large group sat next to us - we were no longer top priority. i understand this concept as i used to be a waiter myself - but it doesn't justify the action. after our main courses were dropped off - we ate. but with the larger group near by - we no longer got service. no one checked to see if we needed anything else. or if everything even tasted okay. we finished off our wine and our water and no refills were offered either. instead we ate our food and waited. when my brother asked for tabasco or steak sauce - we were told it was coming. but no one came. he asked a second time but again we were no longer a priority. \n\nthe food itself was mediocre. coming from seattle we have an abundance of steak houses and seafood so my standard is set high. the <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> i had was good. but far from great. tender and juicy and a very basic seasoning (i'm guessing just salt and pepper) nothing about it to set it above the rest. could have made the same dish buying a package of prime grade beef at costco. the lobster tail was a little under cooked for my taste. a little bit of a slimy texture in the center. and it was served in the tail (cut in half) on my plate which made it a little harder to eat as i'm used to (steak houses i go to), the waiter usually removes the tail from <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> before i consume it. i had no extra plate to place <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> on and i didn't find it appropriate to leave it on the table. so i worked around it. but i will say for $59.95 it was a fairly priced meal. my brother on the other hand had the <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> and <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>. we were \"sold\" that they were huge legs and delicious. fresh and great! when they came out... there was a measley (maybe) one leg cut into three pieces. not much bigger than snow crab. not huge, barely delicious... and if it wasn't for the melted butter - i wouldn't consider it very great.\ngiven that i have had true <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> before - a single leg about 2 feet in length and about 3 inches in diameter with claws the size of my hand... so yes my idea is skewed. but can i be blamed for expecting the best at a restaurant that self proclaims itself as the best in vegas?\n\nas we finished our meal - we had to waive a busser down to find our waiter to close our tab out. in the end... after rockerfeller oysters, kumoto oysters, <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>, <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> with lobster and king crab, and two glasses of wine. i can say... meh - i've experienced better.",

            "we visited again on our last trip, but this time for lunch, and had an even better experience than the last.  \n\njohn, our maitre d, was back again and was his usual funny self.  he sat us inside the main dining area, and there was no wait for lunch on a saturday.  call ahead if you know you're heading there and he'll set you up.  \n\non my last visit, the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws were a bit disappointing, but we tried them again because it was a first for my friends, and this time, they were delicious.  sweet, tender, and a better deal if you order the select variety with an order of 6 for $45.  \n\nof course i had to get the <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>, and they did not disappoint.  lunch prices were $55 for 1 pound as opposed to 1 1/2 pound for $80.  if you want the dinner serving, they're more than happy to give it to you.  \n\nour party tried the ahi tuna sandwich, lobster tail tempura, <mark>Oysters Rockefeller</mark>, <mark>Fried Asparagus</mark>, sweet corn, and hash brown loaf.   all were delicious, except the hash browns.  i thought they were a bit overdone, and too salty.  they are topped with a ton of caramelized onions which at first sounded perfect, but they were way too oily.  that we wouldn't order again.  \n\nwe each finished our lunch with half slices of their pies. the flavors on the table were key lime, chocolate peanut butter, havana dream, and another flavor i can't remember.  if you like key lime, theirs won't disappoint.  but we were in absolute awe of the havana dream.  our waitress described it as a tres leches pie, and it was amazing.  i even considered taking a whole pie home.  it's that good.  don't be fooled by the \"half\" slice.  it's actually a very generous size.", 
            "i have been interested in joe's for years but never have made it there until my most recent trip to vegas.\n\nwe did a late lunch on a sunday and were presented the lunch menu as it was around 3 pm. i asked about the lunch special that i had read about before, and our server greta informed us of the two options of tenderloin or <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>. we ordered one of each, and i couldn't wait for some claws. greta told us that there were only jumbos available, $75 for 3 was just too much for me.\n\nwe did the 3 course lunch and it was phenomenal, possibly the best meal i have ever enjoyed! i had the king crab with lyonnaise potatoes and roasted corn. my sweetheart had the tenderloin with the jennie's special potatoes. the lunches came with pie that we took back to the room but it didn't survive the night unfortunately. the service from greta and team was right on the money. all this awesome food with a tequila and grapefruit type specialty drink and a soda came in under $70! can't wait to go back again!!!!!!",

            "i am a lover of <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>, and after watching an episode of bizarre foods, i've always wondered what the fuss about crab claws was. so when i found a <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> restaurant i was excited to finally get to try it. i had passed this restaurant while in the caesars palace. it's not in the actual hotel, but in the adjacent terrace building, so it might be a little hard to find. i made a reservation because in passing i noticed it was a little crowded. our waiter was friendly, and knew the menu backwards and forwards. i ordered the select 6 florida <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws, a side of saut\\u00e9ed garlic spinach, and roasted asparagus. there were a lot of extra dishes on the table, and after ordering the waiter decided he was going to reach over me and remove them.... bad idea!!! the poor guy knocked over my water all over the table... and not so importantly, all over me :( luckily it was just water, and i'm in vegas having am awesome time, so no biggie!!! our food came out, and it was pretty amazing. my boyfriend had half a slice of their signature  key lime pie and half a slice cheesecake and his face led me to believe it was nothing short of amazing. my only complaint about this restaurant is that it was filled with tables of rich douchebags who were being extremely rude to the waiters and busboys... oh and leaving with soaking wet pants :(",

            "i'll admit, this place is extremely pricey but if you have the money it is well worth it. we ordered the seafood sampler appetizer for two which came with ceviche, shrimp, and <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>. i think that came out to be around $23 per person. we also ordered <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> legs. these were amazing... my only complaint is that there wasn't more :/ we went during the off season i think so the legs were pretty expensive. overall, it was a pretty good time.",

(5 stars)\n\n<mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claw (2 stars)- our waitress actually suggested we don't order this because of the season they aren't as fresh as normal, my brother really wanted to try one since they're known for it, he did, and i def liked the legs better, so she was on fireeeeee!\n\ni ordered the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> with the miso glaze (4.5 stars)- divine. the flavors were all there- my only mark off was that it was slightly overcooked. my brother got the same thing and even said so, too bad they made a mistake on mine. it wasn't chewy or anything so i ate it, but i do like my fish almost medium. \n\ndover sole (4 stars)- my dad and brother got this, they served this table side, i enjoyed the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> more, but this was still pretty good, the sauce does the trick ;)\n\nsides:\n\nroasted corn (2 stars)- this is one thing i didn't enjoy- tasted way better before, they need to add something to make this stand out more. my brother makes a creamy kind of corn dish at home which is fantastic, wish i had that!\n\n<mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> (4 stars)- good some crunch goodness on the top too, wish there was some garlic in there though ;)\n\ndessert- it was all pies! i'm not a huge pie person, but you can order halves, which my brother did of the banana creme pie, pretty good and i think she gave us a whole slice and charged us for half which was nice and we tipped her very well :)\n\nword of advice- they have valet right outside the restaurant so do not valet in the lobby, it's a long horrendous walk in heels, trust me. wish we knew that ahead of time!",

            "my friend had her lunch wedding reception at joe's this past weekend. she rented out the private area on the second floor of this restaurant. it was very nicely decorated. appetizers consisted of mushrooms(sooo juicy and delicious), crab dip (omg to die for), variety of bread (yummy) and calamari. i ordered the swordfish, string beans and <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>. the swordfish melted in my mouth. i normally don't eat fish, but this was so delicious. the the potatoes had bread crumbs on it which made it different from regular <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>. bf ordered the <mark>Salmon Au Poivre</mark> i had a lil bit and it was too fishy for my taste. i will definitely be coming back! maybe try some steak or <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> next time around.", 
            "my husband and i has reservations here on a wednesday night at 7:00 pm.  we got there promptly at 6:45 pm and was seated right away.  the service was impeccable from the host, to the waitress, and the bus boys.  they immediately gave us a good selection of some tasty bread to munch on.  \n\nso far, so good right?  we order a nice white wine since we planned on having seafood and the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> appetizer and 1/2 a dozen oysters.  <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> was nothing special to me.  i prefer king crab in all its butteryness.  oysters were delicious but there's not much the chef has to do there.  for main entrees, i ordered the <mark>Salmon Au Poivre</mark> and the hubby had the swordfish.  here's where i found the taste and texture lacking.  salmon was not that tasty and too lemony.  the swordfish was too tough.  we order their <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> on the side and it was ok for me but their grilled corn was amazing.  \n\nthe bill was about $160 which included tax and tip and not worth it for just ok food.  i wish i could give them more stars because the staff was really nice.", 
            "i want to start off by saying that this is really more of a 3.5 than a straight 3 (silly yelp and it's refusal to allow for half-stars...)\n\ni really enjoyed our evening at joe's. i had never had <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>, and the claws we ordered were good, and the dipping sauce was completely addictive.\n\ni ordered the <mark>Salmon Au Poivre</mark>, and it was truly lovely. the fish was perfectly cooked, and the fennel and radish salad was refreshing and the perfect complement to the salmon. other dishes at our table included two filets (perfectly cooked and seasoned) and one liver-and-onions. there's not a lot to be done about the texture, but the flavor of the liver and sauce was nice.\n\nwe decided on the pan roasted sweet corn, <mark>Joe's Cole Slaw</mark>, and celery root au gratin for the side dishes. the best part of the corn was all the smokey flavor of grilled corn without all the crap that gets caught in your teeth. the <mark>Joe's Cole Slaw</mark> is bright and vinegary, something i appreciated since i don't love mayo. the au gratin was a nice change from potato.\n\nwe concluded our meal with a slice of the signature key lime pie, which had one of the best graham cracker crusts i've ever had. \n\nit was a nice meal, and everything was satisfying, so why three stars? overall, it was a delicious meal, but a few things stuck out. for one, the crabs were great, but i'm not sure i felt like they were worth the $60. the au gratin was definitely under-seasoned, and i suspect that the pie was previously frozen because it certainly seemed frosty in the middle. our server was nice, but he seemed to be reading from a script at times, and i was a little frustrated in his answers at points. \n\ni would consider coming back to joe's, but there are other places i'd rather try in the meantime.", 
            "from the obvious <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws to the always popular <mark>Joe's Fried Chicken</mark>, joe's never disappoints, regardless of whether you're dining at the original in miami or newer locations in vegas. make sure to get the <mark>Joe's Cole Slaw</mark> and <mark>Salmon Au Poivre</mark>, and then finish with the peanut butter pie or key lime pie (which we didn't get this time because my wife's is better) but skip the chocolate fudge pie which was disappointing.", 
            "when i saw that joe's was participating in restaurant week and specifically for lunch i knew we had to try it out. \n\nthe bread basket had a nice variety of breads, but the onion bread was my favorite. for my appetizer i had the calamari on a bed of couscous. this was a very generous portion and had a very fresh taste. i'd surprisingly never had calamari that wasn't fried and really enjoyed that joe's serves their calamari fresh without frying. my husband started with mussels which were plentiful and flavorful. the broth they were in was delicious. my entree was the steak <mark>Salmon Au Poivre</mark> which had a nice peppery topping with tasty <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>. my husband's copper river salmon was perfectly prepared and delicious. the corn on the plate was amazing, i have no idea what they did to it, but i couldn't stop stealing his corn. we wrapped up with key lime pie and blueberry pie. i liked the key lime filling flavor, but the crust was kind of bland. my blueberry pie wasn't amazing, but satisfied my sweet tooth. \n\nwe'll definitely be back as my husband has declared this his favorite seafood restaurant in town."

            "what a disappointment!!!! we went on christmas night to joe's, and it couldn't have been worse. for a place that claims to be known for their seafood and steak, both were mediocre at best. the shrimp and <mark>Shrimp & Scallop Ceviche</mark> was chewy, hard, and almost bitter. the $40 <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> which i ordered as medium rare came way over cooked, and when i asked for a replacement (at $40 for a piece of meat, it better come the way i ordered it), not only did the second steak come undercooked, it was completely cold inside...they took a steak from the fridge, threw it on a grill that was way too hot, and served it rare and cold. who is in charge of this kitchen? our waiter was not only unapologetic about it, but acted put out by their mistake and hurried us out. the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> was not worth the money either. we highly recommend avoiding this restaurant.", 
            "if i could, i would rate this place with  3 1/2 stars...but since i can't, here's how this place stacked up:\n4stars for the food. sampled the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> and <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> - both the crab and the dipping sauce are amazing! =) had the <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> - medium well - and happily finished the entire thing (and im not a steak girl). key lime pie and chocolate cake a la mode - again, very, very happy.\nnow the 3stars-the service. usually the staff is amazing.  from the ma\\u00eetre d' , to the reservation desk to the waiters, everyone is usually great. this last visit; however, not so hot. our waiter seemed very rushed - he practically flung silverware at us, forgot drinks,  sloshed drinks and sauces to the point that we were worried it would end up on us, and the killer: one of our friends wasn't too happy with her steak and asked that it be sent back for additional grill time. (the sucker was bloody!) yes, she sent it back twice, but for the price we were paying, the waiter mightve exercised the \"customer is always right\" policy rather than rudeness. now she's never going back and ill have to think twice.\nbut hopefully,hopefully, he was just having a really bad day and the 3rd times not the charm. maybe its changed to the 4th! ('cuz that crab was pretty good!)", 
            "when you're in vegas, do not assume that you shouldn't consume mass amounts of seafood since there are no bodies of water around you. \n\nwhen you're in vegas for work, and your business colleagues say they want to treat you to joe's, do not, do not, i repeat do not assume you're going to joe's crab shack.  do not dress down because you're afraid the crab shells on the floor will stick to your heels and you bring your sunnies with you because you're afraid the neon lights will hurt your eyes.  \n\nyes, that happened to me and my boss, because we are such geniuses.  \n\nback to the crab, this was my first <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> experience, and it was enlightening.  i am from sf so crab is something i know, but <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>...yummm, uncharted territory.  so sweet, so indulgent, so tasty, and coupled with that tangy mustard sauce?  oh sweet heavens!  i also ordered the scallop dish that's wrapped in bacon...you really can't go wrong with that combo.  the scallops were of a monstrous proportion, and they wrapped the bacon around the scallops to make the whole dish look like a <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark>.  weird, but good.  my colleague had the <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark>, and it took all of my will power to not eat her food when she went to the bathroom.  there were 8 other people sitting around the table, but still, it took a lot of strength.", 
            "great food & great service!! even though we were about 15-20 minutes late, we were greeted warmly and got seated right away. \ncrabs at joe's are to die for...and so are their bone-in steaks. i got the bone-in <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> and it was cooked perfectly and super tasty. oh don't forget about their potato dishes! i am not a big fan of potato but i just can't get my fork off the plate! and i don't mean ordinary potato dishes like <mark><mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark></mark> or mashed potato, try lyonnaise potato or jennie's potato! and considering how big the portions are with great flavors, it definitely worth every penny. one thing about the <mark>Manhattan Clam Chowder</mark> though...is that it's not the white-creamy chowder that you get, it was more like...borshch-tomato style soup. besides that, everything else was perfect and i will definitely go back again when i visit vegas next time!", 
            "nye specials out of this world! best steak in the universe.\n===\n\nso we're wandering the endless halls of caesar's looking for a spot to chill for several hours before the countdown begins. the halls are a bustle of screaming children and many people. the host stand and its tailored dude greet you alongside the display menu and a few tables out in the mall for the noisy customers. the real restaurant is back two rooms behind the bar and is like a secret treasure room for the deserving. we were lucky!\n\nthe nye special surf and turf themed card included jumbo <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws (4), <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>, 3lb lobster and a \"side\" of 8oz <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark>. i won't say which one i didn't order, but the steak was the best steak in the universe, the lobster was huge and meaty and the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws (those poor babies!) were phenomenal. add to that a special price on the tattainger reserve and it was one heck of a way to bring in the new year.\n\nthe bread basket included several varieties but my favorite was the fennel seed, roasted sesame seed and parmesean lahvosh. <mark>Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms</mark> were excellent.\n\nthe service was prompt and professional and i loved how our server kept stopping by to ask us if he could bring anything for us _right now_; very fun. the menu tells the story of the restaurant, founded in florida, and i remember it well; this location honors the original in proper vegas style.", 
            "i ate here with my family and future in-laws for a nice new year's eve dinner. i think it was a great place to spend the last night of 2008. as in most restaurants they start with some bread. they give different varieties of bread, which is all really good. i ordered <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> with <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark>, which was a new year's eve special. i was worried that the <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> were going to be small, but they were huge! i like big servings so i was so happy that the portions were very good. i tried a little bit of everyone's food and i can't complain, everything was good! i loved the stone <mark>Crab Bisque</mark> and <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>.", 
            "excellent wine list, we started with a chilean sangiovese wine that was simply delish and not too spicy or everlasting. i ordered the <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> and <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> dinner. crab claws were supposedly fresh, i couldn't really tell. to be honest, i think i still prefer the northern californian dungeoness crabs (more meat and much sweeter). filet was alright, well cooked and pleasantly not fatty at all. we sided with a mashed potato topped with asagio cheese, good taste and balanced out the meal. bring your black chips to eat here.", 
            "if you aren't looking to save money, and you are looking to eat the best steak/seafood ever, then this is the place to go.  i was fortunate to go with the in-laws so i wasn't picking up the tab.....(thank god!).  the bad part now is i'm hooked, so next time i go to vegas, i'm going to have to fork down my own money for this place.  i will do it though, because i had the best meal of my life when i went.  i started with a ceasar salad which was fresh, flavorful and prompt.  followed by a bone-in <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> that was the best steak i'd ever had in my life (and this coming from a person who is a meat eater and loves her fancy steakhouses....ruth chris' doesn't compare!).  i also had rice pilaf that was tasty.  the rest of my party had the crabs / lobster and they said it was wonderful (\"the best they ever had\"!).  didn't order any drinks (didn't want to put the in-laws in the poor house), but i'm sure they would have been good too.  service was sufficient and knowledgable.  highly recommend, but be prepared to take out a small loan to pay for this meal.  my bone-in filet came with a $50 price tag (that's just for the meat, not the sides and etc) and the lobster rolled in at $69.95 (wow).  well worth it though!", 
            "woohoo what a gem! if you're looking for a superb restaurant on the vegas strip, look no more, this place is it!\n\nswung by on a saturday night with reservations (recommended), greeted by the awesomest of hostesses and servers who know their food. kicked off the night with a small bottle of chianti wine, recommended by server. appetized the dinner with the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> cocktail, which is a must-get, amazing texture with a nice hint of lemon and their mustard sauce ..yumm.\n\nfor our main courses, we had the <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> which was cooked to near perfection with a <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark>, a generous portion of lobster, crab and shrimp with their house dressing (again, highly recommended). side dish included <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> breaded and cheesed on top, a great compliment to many of their main courses. \n\nfinished the night with ridiculously melt-in-your-mouth are-you-kidding-me key lime pie. i should have bought a whole pie....\n\ntruly, as good as it gets!", 
            "i love the crab claws...delicous goodness.  i would recommend getting the large claws instead of the medium...so much more meat.  i went for lunch and got the 3 large claws with hash brown, salad & dessert.  the hash brown was ginomous...don't see how anyone can finish that by themselves.  i had a piece of their <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> and it was very good.  can't wait to go back =)",

            "we came here on a saturday night in december, a party of 6.  we made reservations for 5 since the only other time was at 9.  it ended up working out well because we had a nice relaxing long dinner before returning back to our hotel for a nap and getting ready for the evening.\n\ndecor: 4.5/5  clean, beautiful dark wood paneled walls.  we sat in the back circular room, the seats and tables were arranged a little strangely in that i noticed later the seats weren't evenly distributed (minor) but not in a logical way.  the seats were up against other seats from adjacent tables.  poor planning and made getting in and out difficult.\n\nservice:  5/5 service here was fantastic.  the waiters (i didn't see any waitresses) were all in tuxes and very professional but more importantly friendly.  plates and dishes were cleared promptly and the waiter chatted and joked with us.  amusingly enough, we stopped a bus boy (who was also dressed in a tux) if he could bring us a jus -- he either misheard or didn't know what it was, but he did his best and we were brought some other sauce.  (some white gravy stuff that turned out to be pretty tasty)\n\nsurf: 4/5 i didn't try the oysters but the table seemed to enjoy them.  the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> pretty much just tasted like crab to me.  the mustard sauce didn't have much flavor in my opinion.  i was underwhelmed by the crab but it was neat trying them.  i wouldn't feel the need to order that again.\n\nturf: 4/5 the meat was good.  4 of us ordered the petite <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> -- strangely i think only one of us finished it.  i guess we got filled up with the delicious bread (5/5!).  the meat itself wasn't bad but not amazing.  i think it was worth the money but sadly not memorable.  the fresh horseradish was not very spicy, their special mix of spices/seasoning was tasty (but very salty)\n\nside dishes: 3/5 we tried a few of their dishes.  ranked from least favorite to favorite.  1) the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> could have been entirely skipped.  it was flavorless.  2) the mac n cheese was ok, they used spiral noodles.  if you're in the mood for mac n cheese you'd probably be satisfied, but it also wasn't memorable.  then again i think i've started expecting bacon and maybe gouda in my mac n cheese now... 3.  <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  the crusty crumbly bits on top were yummy and the melted cheese inside was great.  it was strangely dry though.  my idea <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> have chunks of firm potato and then soft creamy potatoes in it... this was just a little dry but great flavor.  worth ordering  4) the sweet corn was surprisingly great!  i usually like corn plain, but this was really delicious.  i think we were all surprised with how good this was -- that was the only side plate that was entirely finished.\n\ndessert 5/5: we ordered the key lime pie.  all their desserts are made fresh daily and since this is originally a florida restaurant -- we decided on the key lime pie.  it was thankfully not green and was very light and at least for me, the best key lime pie i've ever had.  i finished most of the pie even though i couldn't even finish my steak (and lemme tell ya what a steak person i am!).  the coffee was also excellent according to my friends, but i think starbucks is good so i wouldn't know.  sorry!\n\noverall, it was a great meal.  if i went back to vegas i'd probably want to try a different restaurant but i certainly recommend this place to anyone who hasn't been there.  the meal ended up being a final cost of  $78/person (that includes a $40 bottle wine). \n\ni'd recommend coming here with at least 4 people (we had 6) since the side dishes family style.  apparently, you can get joe's delivered to your house.", 
            "first of all, lunch. surprisingly there aren't that many nice places to have lunch on the strip: joe's is one of the best choices, particularly if you are unsure of your companion's dining preferences or looking to find something moderately priced and moderately fast (there are small salads, sandwches and burgers on the bar menu). \n\na spin-off of the miami legend, joe's offers three distinct environments --a bustling patio in the elegant forum rotunda, a very large casual bar, and a huge 40s-50s era dining room that is classic (i also discovered they have two round function rooms overlooking the strip and a elegantly old school \"boardroom\" for private dining/meeting).\n\ncoat and tie not required, but common, esp. in dining room--and large parties seem to be common. it isn't surprising to run into both casino heavy hitters (even those from competing properties, who could eat elsewhere for free) as well as visiting celebs. tuxedoed waiters  provide detailed service...though when things get very busy, they may run by you a bit too quickly.\n\nthe menu is full of surprises--beyond the expected <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws, shrimp, oysters rockafeller, <mark>Shrimp De Jonghe</mark> (basically breaded scampi, but made with impressively tender prawns), <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> and fish dishes, there is an excellent chopped vegetable salad, good garlic <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> and roasted corn.\n\nthe bone-in <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> was among the very best i've had in vegas. and i have to tell you that i have sampled virtually all of the best steakhouses here.\n\nour dover sole was lightly breaded and gorgeously saut\\u00e9ed to a golden hue; the waiter deftly deboned it at the table and served it with a slightly carmelized lemon butter (it didn't need it).\n\nthe <mark>Joe's Fried Chicken</mark> was another unexpected surprise, a hefty four pieces, lightly battered and deep fried, the crispy crumb batter giving way to moist flavorful meat within. savory but light.\n\nin season, the <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> here are far and away the best i've had: sweet, juicy, light with none of the mealy taste you get from lesser crab. \n\ntheir pies are offered in half portions-a great option should you want to sample more than one. i have had uneven experiences with the signature key lime pie--one time it was perfect, another time, it was rock-solid frozen, and the waiter neither apologized nor replaced it when i complained. \n\ngenerally speaking, prices are on the high side but the quality reflects that. order with care.", 
            "for my 100th review, i figured i can't just write about anything.  i have to write about something life altering.  i needed to share with the rest of the world my experience at joe's.  \n\nwe begin the dinner with an appetizer of <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>.  if you have never eaten <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> before...think crab with a hint of sweetness.  the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> are cracked, so you just have to peel away with ease and enjoy.  for our main entrees husband and i are all business and get steaks.  please note that all menu items are a la carte, so any kind of side must be ordered seperately.  my husband opts for the ribeye cooked medium, and i get the <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> (also cooked medium).  i took one bite of my steak, closed my eyes, and i swear the restaurant went quiet. it was one of those moments. for our sides we share a serving of <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> and <mark>Sauteed Spinach</mark> with garlic.  both were very delicious and complimented the steak really well.  lastly for dessert we were unsure of what to choose from because they had such a long list of pies.  our waiter ben suggested we share a slice of banana creme pie with fosters sauce (apparently his favorite).  ben..if you are reading this review...you are a genius!\n\nif i lived in las vegas i would be totally broke.  not because i would gamble my savings away.  it would be because i would have a permanent seat at joe's.  the food is on another level, and the service is incredible.  if you're ever in vegas and want a real good meal without the legassi or flay name stamped onto it, dine at joe's...you won't regret it.", 
            "i get so scared to eat in vegas. everything can be so clich\\u00e9, and over hyped for tourists to fall prey to. joe's was beautiful. they start you out with an assortment of breads. pretzel bread.. cheesy bread... flat bread. all tasted spectacular. we then got the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> appetizer. it comes pre-cracked to your table, with a slightly sweet mustard sauce. oh-em-gee. i can't wait to go back. our server suggested that we share a <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark>, that came with two sides. why not share!? so, we got our <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> cooked to a glistening medium. holy smokes. the most perfect steak- ever. melt in your mouth, no sauce needed. divine. \n\nthat's all i need to say. it was perfect. just go. go now.",

            "restaurant week is in full swing, and we are now 4 for 4! last night diane and i dined at joe's, and it was another great meal! \n\nwe arrived for dinner on thursday at 5:45 p.m., 15 minutes before our reservation, and were seated right away. by 7:00 p.m. the main dining room was almost completely full. we had never been here before, and i was a bit intimidated at first as i approached the high reception stand where a man in a jet black tuxedo with jet black hair towered over me. but he was friendly and professional, as were all of the other black bow-tied, black tuxedoed, and white aproned restaurant personnel we encountered during our visit. i had only seen the bar and mall dining areas before, and thought they comprised the whole restaurant. not so! we were ushered through a curtain to a very elegant dining room that had decorative lights on the wall and a decidedly new york city clubby steakhouse feel to it, with much dark wood and brown leather, white tablecloths, and several tables surrounded by comfortable booths along both main walls. it was very sophisticated but not pretentious, as were the several servers who moved briskly about like busy bees. it was interesting just watching them in action. \n\nwe went with the restaurant week menu, but augmented it with a two-claw appetizer of <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws and king crab mac & cheese. i always wondered whether i would be able to eat <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws because their ends look like elongated fingers painted with black nail polish. but it was easier than i thought, since that part of the claw is left alone. the claws arrived from the kitchen already largely crushed by a mallet, so it was not that difficult to pry apart the porcelain-like shell casing to get at the meat underneath. but there seemed to be less meat than found in alaskan crab claws. the thin morsels of crab meat tasted fine either dipped in drawn butter, the mild mustard sauce that was provided, or just eaten straight out of <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark>. yet i noted that they were not as sweet or satisfying as king crab claw meat. and, at about $22 for two claws, they were not cheap. so, for me, it is now \"been there, done that!\" but i will definitely return to joe's for its other fine fare, including lobster and king crab. \n\nalthough this was hardly needed, an assortment of bread products tasted good with the soft pats of butter provided. and a bowl of stone <mark>Crab Bisque</mark> was sweet and smooth--simply exquisite in taste and texture. i liked it better without the garnish of tiny cuts of carrots and zucchini that we asked to have served on the side, since diane's yelp nickname is \"veggie hater\" for a reason. but i picked the delicate morsels of <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> out of the garnish and tossed them in the wonderful soup, which avoided an inexcusable wasting of fine crab particles and made the soup even tastier. \n\na large <mark>Joe's <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark></mark> of lettuce, tomato, onion, and <mark>Chopped Lettuce, Tomato, Onion & Blue Cheese</mark> crumbles with a fine vinaigrette dressing was quite satisfying. my 8 oz. <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> with drinkable bearnaise sauce was simply divine. it was well seasoned on top, perfectly medium rare inside as ordered, and did literally melt in my mouth. i liked it better without the house seasonings, which i tried on a couple of bites. it was one of those steaks that kept getting better and better as slices of beef moved toward the rarer center. \n\ndiane's moist halibut had a tasty parmesan crust, augmented by a buerre blanc-like sauce that was provided. it was notably flatter than many servings of halibut experienced at other restaurants, but of ample portion size. the king crab mac & cheese, made with white shells, hunks of king crab, and bechamel sauce, tasted good, but was not nearly as noteworthy as the sumptuous <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> that were covered with a mix of baked asiago cheese and breadcrumbs. and, few lobster chunks were included in the dish. <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> was creamy as billed, and quite tasty. \n\njoe's signature key lime pie arrived ultra cold and almost frozen. after trying one bite, i let my slice sit for 5 minutes, and then it was just right, having lost its icy taste. it was very tart and delicious. \n\npeppermint gelato with hot fudge was not as memorable as the key lime pie, but the melted hot fudge was delicious. it had the strong taste of peppermint, and every now and then surprised the palate with peppermint candy chips. i would have preferred this dish during the christmas season! \n\nall in all, a wonderful five-star meal!", 
            "a must stop everytime in vegas!  the food is beyond words. the seafood is devine, scallops, fresh fish of the day, <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark>, whatever you get is great!  key lime pie the best and coldest!  always busy, great place to watch people.  the staff is professional and great service always.  can't miss this in vegas.  nice views of the forum mall.", 
            "i didn't find anything too special about the place.  it's like any steakhouse i feel like.  i do enjoy the idea of having shared sides but my steak was a-ok.  we had the <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> as appetizers which was meaty with crabs and raw oysters were fresh.  i had the <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> and like i said, nothing too special.  we all shared the garlic <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>, and the roasted corn.  i liked the corn the most. that's all there was to it really.", 
            "overpriced bad food.\n\ni had the pleasure of coordinatiing the office xmas party as did every year.  the firm decided to take the staff and their spouses to lv for the weekend.  i decided to book the dinner party at joe's.  the photos on the website is oh so mouth-watering.  everyone couldn't wait to taste the food.  we decided on a pre-fix menu.\n\ncourse 1:  the 2nd mortgage\nit's probably the best course, but it was just so so.  it was a medley of 2 inch <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>, 1 jumbo shrimp, half of a very small lobster, and a ceviche of shrimp and scailop.  i am used to having at least 3 sauces with my seafood medley.  it came with just cocktail sauce.\n\ncourse 2:  vegetable <mark>Joe's <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark></mark>\na mix of celery, <mark>Chopped Lettuce, Tomato, Onion & Blue Cheese</mark>.....  it was flavorless.\n\ncourse 3:  <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark>\nmy was medium rare and hers was medium.  i came close to choking to death on the first bite bc it was so dry.  i decided to cut down the center and saw that it was red and not overcooked.  i started eating it from the inside.  it was dry and powdery with no beef flavor.  i left a third of it bc i couldn't take it anymore.  her steak was dry and she left half uneaten.  the sides were mash and grille tomatos.  both were mediocre.\n\ncourse 4:  dessert\nafter all that, i decided to play safe.  i got the chocolate fudge pie.  you can't go wrong with chocolate.  with that said, it was nothing to write home about.  she got the banana cream pie.  that was just okay.\n\ni would not go here again.  i discourage anyone to go there.  at close to 80 bucks per person(food only), i can eat a lot better than that.  i was so very disappointed.  the staff will have to wait a year for me to make up to them.",

            "i am far from a steak and/or seafood connoisseur but as a food fanatic - i know a good steak and a good seafood joint when i eat at one. despite all the great reviews joe's received i'd have to say i'm rather disappointed. i'd rather give joe's 2.5 stars if i could but it was a touch below a-okay and i indeed have experienced better. but the prices were rather fair (steak and lobster wise). \n\nambiance was rather lively and loud. i would recommend this place more so for a fun date or a night out with the boys but not for romance due to noise levels. the host stand was very professional but gave a bit of a condescending presence as they tower over you and look down at you when being assisted. \nthe wait staff was full and plenty as we sat by what seemed to be the kitchen door. like worker ants they would file out of one door with food and in another door with empty plates. i don't recall our servers name but when we sat right around 7 o'clock service was top notch. there was other tables around us and we all seemed to have the proper amount of attention. food was brought out in a timely manner as were drinks. but the minute a large group sat next to us - we were no longer top priority. i understand this concept as i used to be a waiter myself - but it doesn't justify the action. after our main courses were dropped off - we ate. but with the larger group near by - we no longer got service. no one checked to see if we needed anything else. or if everything even tasted okay. we finished off our wine and our water and no refills were offered either. instead we ate our food and waited. when my brother asked for tabasco or steak sauce - we were told it was coming. but no one came. he asked a second time but again we were no longer a priority. \n\nthe food itself was mediocre. coming from seattle we have an abundance of steak houses and seafood so my standard is set high. the <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> i had was good. but far from great. tender and juicy and a very basic seasoning (i'm guessing just salt and pepper) nothing about it to set it above the rest. could have made the same dish buying a package of prime grade beef at costco. the lobster tail was a little under cooked for my taste. a little bit of a slimy texture in the center. and it was served in the tail (cut in half) on my plate which made it a little harder to eat as i'm used to (steak houses i go to), the waiter usually removes the tail from <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> before i consume it. i had no extra plate to place <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> on and i didn't find it appropriate to leave it on the table. so i worked around it. but i will say for $59.95 it was a fairly priced meal. my brother on the other hand had the <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> and <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>. we were \"sold\" that they were huge legs and delicious. fresh and great! when they came out... there was a measley (maybe) one leg cut into three pieces. not much bigger than snow crab. not huge, barely delicious... and if it wasn't for the melted butter - i wouldn't consider it very great.\ngiven that i have had true <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> before - a single leg about 2 feet in length and about 3 inches in diameter with claws the size of my hand... so yes my idea is skewed. but can i be blamed for expecting the best at a restaurant that self proclaims itself as the best in vegas?\n\nas we finished our meal - we had to waive a busser down to find our waiter to close our tab out. in the end... after rockerfeller oysters, kumoto oysters, <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>, <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> with lobster and king crab, and two glasses of wine. i can say... meh - i've experienced better.", 
            "went to joe s with my finance\\u00e9. hands down it is one the best restaurants i ve been in vegas. every thing was perfect. ordered the surf n  turf: petite <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> and brolied lobster tail, with a side of <mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark>. i felt like a king after eating that :) \n\nas an appetizer, we had some <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws. i have to say, the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>, although tasty and highly publicized, was not the best part of dinner. the <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> was perfectly cooked. the lobster was delicious. \n\nfor dessert you can order half slices so we had the key lime and havana pie.\n\nthe whole experience made me a fan of this place!", 
            "i thought about stealing the container of salt from overseas so i could bathe myself in it later that night. i know that doesn't sound appealing, but if you sprinkled that happiness onto your perfectly cooked <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark>, you'd want to bathe every inch of yourself with it too. don't believe me? try it. you won't complain.\n\nwe received a large gift certificate for being frequent diners at lettuce entertain you restaurants (see my review of mon ami gabi), so we decided to try joe's. since we were starving, and all i could think of was cow and things that crawl on the bottom of the ocean, we dove straight in and ordered entrees...after 2 glasses of wine of course. the red malbec was fantastic and went very well with my cow and sea creatures. my fiance ordered the fisherman's platter, fried, and i ordered the petite <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> and jumbo king crab. our orders were perfection.\n\nfried seafood is difficult to make and to cook it well enough to maintain the freshness of the seafood and not the dry, overcooked nature of cheap frozen grocery seafood. joe's doesn't fry their seafood. they lightly dip scallops, shrimp cod and calamari in an airy batter and then after brushing them through an oil bath they place them ever so delicately on your entree plate. they may as well just pop each piece in your mouth because that's what happens when the plate hits the table. this was not fried seafood, this was seafood done right with a blatant disregard for calories. i didn't even have to eat it to know that the look of content on my fiance's face had nothing to do with me.\n\nnow onto the filet. oh that filet. i love rare cow. if i am at a steakhouse, i will order the steak rare to see if they are truly a steakhouse. oh yes, my friends, this is a steak house...more like a steak heaven. this petite filet was cooked perfectly. no chewiness here, just soft, tender <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> drizzled in the salt mix (please see first paragraph for further loving of the salt mix). even the waiter was doing a side glance of my cow, knowing that my senses were on overload. the crab? there's a reason they're known for snow crab, but their king crab made me want to do the snoopy dance in the middle of the restaurant. no butter needed, absolutely no butter needed for this crab...but i did use some anyways because i can never decline butter. the crab was juicy, they cracked the crab for you so you didn't have to cut your hands open doing it yourself, and it melted in my mouth. that dinner was worth every penny we spent and then some. the service, hands down some of the best service i have ever received at a restaurant. superb.\n\nso while you go and go bananas on some <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> and filet at joe's now, i will go to bed and have sweet, sweet dreams of cow and crab. this can only end deliciously.",

            "i picked this restaurant specifically for two reasons. one is because i felt this would be a \"people pleaser\" in terms of a solid steakhouse for a larger group. the other because it was a three dollar sign joint. i realize steakhouses can get pricey, so i wanted to find something that wasn't going to break the bank, but still be \"fine dinning.\" \n\nthe service is very good, i'll note right away. but please be wary, our server was a totally up-seller. she knew exactly what she was doing.... \"oh, if you're going to get a couple glasses of wine, get a bottle\" or \"what appetizers can i start you with\" almost as soon as we sat down. i kinda feel like they're probably all trained that way. not necessarily annoying, but be wary!\n\nalso, the food is all a la carte. so you'll get up there in price with what you order. we had a table of 8 and ordered 4 different sides and they were all gone by the end of dinner. but it was the perfect amount. the good: garlic roasted spinach, the lyonnaise, and my fave <mark>Joe's Grilled Tomatoes</mark> (wonderfully red tomatoes with pesto and melted mozzarella on top aka yum!). the okay: broccolini. \n\ni ordered a special, which was <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> with crab on top. i really wanted both the filet and crab, and the regular menu listed large pieces of both for much more. this was the perfect amount for $36. plus asparagus! it was cooked to a perfect medium rare and very flavorful. the crab was fantastic and i almost wished there was more. maybe a bit more, but the portion was good still. \n\nbest part is they brought the birthday boy, my dad, a free brownie sundae! all in all, a really excellent meal. ended up being perfect for what i was looking for!", 
            "our family dined at joe's and had a great experience. the ribeye is awesome. my wife had the <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> and gave it a 5 star rating. service was excellent but let you enjoy your meal with minimal interruption. wine selection was vast and our server was helpful and well versed in assisting with selections.", 
            "i can't say anything bad about this place it's been almost a week since i ate here and i'm still thinking about this place... the waitress was amazing, the atmosphere was amazing, and the food was breathe taking. i had the shrimp dinner and i was blown away. fresh large shrimp cooked to perfection. my best friend who was celebrating her birthday had the <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> and she is also still talking about it. the mac n cheese and potatoes were also amazing! the brownie ice cream combo that was served for my friends was amazing as well. i seriously would return to vegas just for this place!", 
            "nom nom nom. \ni started with the wedge salad that was pretty tasty, even with the bleu cheese crumbles! i also had babe start with the <mark>Crab Bisque</mark> - it' comes in a tiny bowl. like, it's totally small. i'm not sure if they have other sizes or not but our server didn't ask us if we wanted a bowl or a cup but anyways it was quite good. \nfor my entree it was between the two scallop meals. i chose the <mark>Seared Sea Scallops</mark> with braised pork belly, cabbage and kale. the scallops were fantastic and the pork belly was melt in your mouth delish!!! \nfriend ordered the 8oz petite <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> and it was cooked a perfect medium rare. he was actually ranting and raving about how delicious his steak was for days after and he's had some good steaks in his time! \nwe also had a side order of <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> which were delightfully cracked already and delicious! i don't usually like cold crab but it was so good. \nnom nom nom!!\n\ni just wanted to update that i was here again and sat in the dining room as last time we sat in the bar... the service was phenomenal and i especially loved the lemons and towels they provided at the end of our meal!\nthe food was fan-freakin-tastic as usual especially the giant <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>! so. much. meat.!!!",

            "five stars for the food, three stars for the waitress who was efficient but unfriendly. \n\neverything a la carte. ordered the <mark>Fried Oysters</mark> for appetizer which was great because they used fresh oysters. my <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> was a perfect medium rare and my friend's <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was awesome.... but they could lighten on that sweet sauce they use. he scraped most of it off the surface. the saut\\u00e9ed garlic spinach was good.\n\ni made a reservation, came a bit early so decided to take the first available table in the lounge area. high tables with higher chairs... should've waited for the main dining area. anyway i made the reservation on open table via yelp but they didn't check me in so i received an email about not honoring my reservation. \n\njust fyi, make sure they check you in so you get credit on your open table account.", 
            "decent service but good seafood and meat to satisfy your needs. make reservations so you don't have to wait long to get seated. i made reservations and though i was about 10 mins late, we were still seated right away. be sure to use the valet parking where the forum shop is near las vegas blvd. easier to navigate right to joe's. \n\nfirst came the free bread. none are the same and you get 5 different types to try. in my opinion, all were great. the one with sesame i liked the most. we started with a half dozen order of oysters and though the oysters were good, i've had better. we then ordered 7 <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws to split with my wife. great part about this is that they come cracked already and i definitely recommend getting it. great tasting and fresh, you can't go wrong with this.  for the main, i got their bone-in <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark>. priced around $55, this is definitely worth it. nice huge sized <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> that's cooked perfectly and they give you additional steak seasoning on the side if you need it. bad thing is that the $55 doesn't come with any sides which i don't think any of those do. you will have to order their sides separately. good thing is that it's a large portion so it isn't too bad if you're sharing. i recommend ordering the <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>. one of the best i've had and yet it was so good and great serving, we couldn't finish it. place is a bit expensive but it's worth the price. service could be a bit better but wasn't too bad. just that we waited for about 20-30 mins before our main dishes came out. i would probably come back again and try something else on their menu but can't go wrong with the bone-in <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark>, <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws and mash potato.",

            "i love joe's. i was here last year on a business dinner and came back around for a repeat with a girlfriend from work. the service and food are both wonderful. obviously, we came for surf n' turf and we both left stuffed and happy (and, for being on the las vegas strip, the prices are the same as you would find at any higher-end steakhouse - nothing on the menu seemed outrageously inflated).\n\nour charming server (\"steven\" or \"stephen\", he-of-the-awesome-bulgarian-accent) suggested we start off with the <mark>Shrimp De Jonghe</mark> appetizer (i.e., a fancy name for scampi): six plump shrimps, basting in a super-garlicky sauce. delicious. joe's also provides a very ample basket of mixed breads (soft pretzel, dinner roll + a savory bacon-y ciabatta that my friend loved). \n\nwe both ordered surf 'n turf: petit <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> (i chose the alaskan king crab and my friend had lobster). we also split an order of the <mark>Hashed Brown</mark> potato and the grilled asparagus with romesco sauce. my steak was a little overcooked in the interior and a little ash-y charred on the outside. however, the <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> were delicious (and already split down the middle for me), so i flaked and dunked those bad boys in the clarified butter.\n\nthe presentation and texture of the <mark>Hashed Brown</mark> was awesome: a golden brown and crusty mound of fluffy-on-the-inside starchy goodness (but a little lacking in flavor). but the grilled asparagus was absolutely delicious (and i don't really like asparagus that much), and the cherry tomato romesco sauce was truly the star of the dish (we both loved the delectable tomatoes - sweet, chunky, delicious). the generously-portioned sides could easily be shared between 2-3 people.\n\nwe finished off with two desserts (we were both veritable piggies that night): wedges of lemony cream cheese pie with strawberry sauce (my friend's favorite), and fudge pie (my favorite!). they were both about as good as dessert can get.\n\nto reiterate, our server was excellent: he looked like a possible secret agent assassin, had a fabulous accent, provided attentive (but not smothering) service with a flourish (he snapped our photo), and we never felt rushed or like a nuisance (and we lingered over dinner for close to three hours, chatting, sipping and and forking around - hehe). service nailed a 5-star rating as perfect.", 
            "located inside the forum shops inside caesar's palace, it is a cute place with outside seating if you want to have a nice meal by the water fountain and secretly people watch. not to mention, it is conveniently located right next to vosges haut chocolat (i highly recommend their boxes of truffles). \n\nmy dining experience can be best described as mediocre. great intentions, questionable execution. i really wanted to like this restaurant but my expectations were not met. two of the things i absolutely love is steak and seafood. when you have a restaurant that is known for both, you'd think this is food heaven. unfortunately, i was quite disappointed. \n\nbread basket- i usually don't talk about the bread but this one deserves it's own review. it is delicious. the variety is great. the pretzel mini loaf is really cute. \n\n<mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark>- sadly, it is unimpressive. it had a slight off flavor to it and too salty. and a pet peeve of mine at steak houses is when i asked for steak to be on the rare side, it comes out dry and well done. \n\nalaskan king crab- also quite salty as well and nothing special. served with lemon and butter. \n\n<mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>- not too bad but it also wasn't memorable either. \n\nlyonnaise potatoes- pretty good. i enjoyed eating it. \n\nkey lime pie- signature dessert was okay. not my personal preference. \n\nhavana dream pie- yum. this one is delicious. might be a bit too sweet but still good. served with slices of strawberries. it is soft, creamy, and sweet. \n\nbanana cream pie- this one is my favorite dessert. it is delicious. not too sweet. great banana flavor. light and airy. \n\nthe service here is friendly and efficient. a tad bit unrefined and awkward at times. slapping a spoon on a plate and served our side dishes cafeteria style. an elbow almost knocking someone out. and taking someone's eating utensils while they were still using them. maybe i'm being overly picky but i'm comparing the service with other $$$ restaurants and it does lack a certain refinement. \n\nwould i come back again? i might just to give this place one more chance. i really wanted to like it but it was way below expectations.",

            "after roaming around aimlessly for a good hour looking for a place to dine we came upon joe's, and i'm super glad that we did. \n\natmosphere was pretty classy. all the servers in suits and bow ties. fancy.\n\nservice was excellent! our waiter, i believe his name was dave, was on point with his description of the menu as if he wrote it himself, attentive, and funny.\n\nfood: \n-<mark>Fried Calamari</mark> - cooked perfectly, batter was amazing. 5/5\n-<mark>Fried Oysters</mark> - ^^^ the same. 5/5\n-clam chower - 5/5 wish i had more space in my belly.\n-large <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> - they weren't joking about the claw size. meaty, and sweet 5/5\n-<mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> bone-in - was kinda charred, and a little dry. 3/5\n-key lime pie - this was the best key lime pie i've ever had in my life. i would totally order this again. 5/5+\n-1.5lb alaskan king crab - now this was the jewel of my meal. the biggest <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> i've ever had the pleasure of shoving in my face hole. 5/5++++\n\nwhat made my dinning experience a bit better was that we had a party of 8 and when they sat us, they took us to a private room dinning room away from all the \"commoners.\" lol. honestly, felt like we had a private dinning experience. super vip status. want to dine here again the next time i'm in town, but may just stick with the seafood.", 
            "calling all tourists!!!\n\njoe's seafood prime steak & <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> really is just a tourist trap with a few great options and a lot of okay items you are privileged to pay strip pricing for...\n\nif you do find yourself here just ignore the inflated prices and stick to what they're know for: <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws, <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>, <mark>Crab Bisque</mark>, <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark>...even scallops with pork belly.\n\ni've been here three times over the years and every time i've tried to explore the menu a bit and share some items with the table. i keep coming back because what the do well, they really do well. but in the end i just think that you can get a better meal at a much better price. it's not that joe's breaks the bank...just that most of the menu is 10-20% overpriced. i have no problem with spending a little more than the actual quality of the product calls for, but if i do, i want it to be really great food or good food in an incredible setting...joe's doesn't do either of these well enough that i see myself continuing to come back. don't get me wrong, it is good. if i was in the immediate area i'd have no problem stopping in...but i'm not going out of my way to go here when there are so many better options at the same price point all around vegas.", 
            "i am very pleased with the experience i had at joe's. this was my second trip to vegas and we were celebrating my best friends 21st birthday so we wanted to go somewhere special. from the moment we walked into joe's we were practically treated like royalty. the server was very knowledgeable about the menu and recommended the lobster bisque. this was seriously the best soup i have ever had. for dinner i had the <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> and king crab combo. the crab is served cold which was a bit odd but you can enjoy the sweet taste of the crab meat this way. they also crack the <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> for you which makes it all the better to enjoy rather than wrestling with <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark>. the steak was cooked to perfection and melted in my mouth like butter. this place is very pricey, but well worth it if you are celebrating a special occasion.", 
            "excellent service \nmore of a high end steakhouse rather than seafood restaurant. however the seafood is very good. i had the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> and king crab plates for appetizers and they were top quality. nicely cooked and shells cracked for you.\n\ni had the dry aged bone - in rib eye steak and the bone - in <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark>. i shared with another dining friend. \n\nthe steaks were the best i've tasted ever. cooked to perfection. the steaks were incredibly tender. i prefer mine pitsburg style and i cannot fault them, only compliment. no additional seasoning required.", 
            "my boyfriend and i had dinner here on feb 19th to celebrate an anniversary. this is by far one of the best meals i have ever had and was probably the best meal we ate in vegas during our stay. our server (i forget her name) was fantastic! super friendly and professional, made suggestions when appropriate but wasn't overly pushy. we started our meal off with the calamari to start which was great. for entrees i had the 8oz <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> and my boyfriend had the <mark>Crab Stuffed Shrimp</mark>. he initially was not sure about whether or not to get the <mark>Crab Stuffed Shrimp</mark> or the <mark>Grilled Seafood Platter</mark> but our server recommended the <mark>Crab Stuffed Shrimp</mark> and i am glad he followed her recommendation because they were delicious! for our side we had <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> which were also great. food was amazing, well cooked and well presented and very flavourful. service was professional and on point. will definitely recommend to others and will definitely return next time we are back. highlight of the night was our server bringing us out a complimentary brownie dessert for celebrating our anniversary which was so thoughtful and appreciated!\ndinner for two with drinks was around $115 which was not bad at all given the high quality in both food and service.", 
            "making a reservation here was easy and we got a table for 9. when we got there we were directed towards the back and then led into a room. we had a whole area to ourselves with a tv. it was pretty cool. our server gave us recommendations and told us we could share most of the sides. we ended up mostly getting steaks and a sole. we also got an order of the crab claws and king crab. the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws were really juicy and the <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> were big. pretty expensive for the portion but it's worth it. \nthe <mark>Steak Tartare</mark> had a very tart flavor from the capers and came with toasted croutons. it was a generous size and tasted good. \nthe <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> was ok. was pretty standard. \nfor the sides we got cauliflower, broccolini, brussel sprouts, <mark>Hashed Brown</mark>, and mac and cheese. the vegetable portions were pretty small. we could each only get one piece of each. the mac and cheese was okay. i really liked the <mark>Hashed Brown</mark> though. some of my group thought it was too salty but i enjoyed the flavor.", 
            "so i am going to try to make this short but no promises. if this is your first time here like it was for us stick to the most popular dishes. we started off with the oyster rockefeller, it was delicious. then the shrimp & <mark>Shrimp & Scallop Ceviche</mark> which was okay. we did two orders of their select famous <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws and they were amazing. they had plenty of meat i got full before our entree even came. we both had the petite <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> & lobster tail. for sides  we had their <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> and mushroom mac and cheese. honestly we hardly even touched the sides so next time i don't think we will be ordering them. then we finished off with this really good havana dream cake. over all this place was really good and our serve jon p was great. can't wait to come back again.", 
            "this place was pricey but good.  the best dish was the <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark>. it just melted in my mouth. it was absolutely the best i ever had.", 
            "joes is a nice place for higher end people willing to spend a good amount of money on a steak the waiter was a little slow and took a while to attend i ordered a medium <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> it was pretty good it was tender and soft the <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> with cheese and garlic that they personally recommend weren't that good they brought them a little cold and had an average flavor the asparagus were a little hard and dry the dessert cheesecake was good and had a sweet flavor.", 
            "delicious and satisfying petite <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> paired with crab meat. not sure what that cream sauce was that our server drizzled over my food, but it was good! i enjoyed the seasoning that was brought to the table, as it made an additional flavorful experience. every bite was amazing. i will definitely be visiting again on my next trip. staff was friendly and welcoming, very attentive to our needs.", 
            "this was my 2nd visit in the past three months and i can say with confidence that on both occasions, it was excellent.  this place is at least 4.5 stars.\n\non both occasions, we had reservations.  the first time was a party of 10 and and the second time, a party of 4.  upon arrival, we were seated immediately.  fantastic.\n\nfood:  \n<mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>:  excellent\nalaskan crab:  excellent\npetit <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark>:  excellent\n<mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>:  good\njennie's potato:  good\nlobster tail:  good\n<mark>Joe's <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark></mark>:  good\n<mark>Joe's <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark></mark>:  very good\n<mark>Caesar Salad</mark>:  very good\nirish coffee:  good\n\ngreat wine selection:  last night had a bottle of ruffino ducale chianti.\n\nservice:  fantastic.  whether a large party (10) or smaller (4), on both occasions, service was quick & attentive.  for example, last night my son dropped his fork and the server, mindy, was right there and grabbed it and handed him another.  further, i had mentioned we were going to a show, and mindy gave us the quickest route to theater without me asking.  \n\ni'll definitely recommend to others.",

            "i've had lawry's, ruth's chris & mastro's and this place does not compare to those steakhouses. \n\nmy sister & i wanted to eat a nice steak for dinner but since our mom wanted seafood, we settled for joe's (we were debating between lawry's & joe's). \n\nordered the <mark>Ahi Tuna Tartare</mark>, <mark>Grilled Seafood Platter</mark>, <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark>, bone-in ribeye, creamed corn & <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>. the portions were a lot smaller than anticipated. definitely incomparable to lawry's prime rib & sides. \n\n<mark>Ahi Tuna Tartare</mark>- 3/5 the appetizer was tiny with mediocre pieces of fish. the cracker? used for the tartare was a bit like pork rinds without the pork. was a good combo with the fish but definitely wouldn't order again. \n\n<mark>Grilled Seafood Platter</mark>- 4/5 came with maybe 6 pieces of scallop, 2 shrimp, and 3 lobster tails? this was a lot smaller than was expected as well. the buttery sauce it came with was delicious but nothing spectacular. my mom, however, was satisfied so thus we were as well. \n\n<mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark>- 2/5 we asked for a medium rare but instead we got more of a medium, which was quite chewy. the steak was seasoned well but some parts were very salty. definitely wouldn't order again. \n\nbone-in ribeye 4/5 the best part of the meal. asked for medium rare plus and got exactly that. it was juicy, flavorful & tender. since we shared all our plates, this was the first to go. \n\n<mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> & creamed corn! 4/5 \nboth tasted very good but again, small portions. the <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> contained some cheese and was topped with some kind of flakes that were amazing. the creamed corn was just absolutely phenomenal. definitely will order both again.\n\n finally, dessert! key lime pie & banana cream pie. 4/5 key lime pie was sour but the crust was delish! and the banana cream pie had a lot of cream in it but it was good as well. had to order it since it's like. only my favorite dessert ever. also ordered the coffee (from intelligentsia!) but it was so watered down & weak. asked for an espresso instead. \n\nservice 2/5 our server was not very friendly and was quite slow to tend to our needs. he kept saying he would get back to us but seemed uninterested in serving us. \n\nprobably will never come here again.", 
            "joe's is exactly what you would expect when you think of fine dining. the service was 10/10. the waiters kept your beverage glass full at all times, the food came ridiculously fast, and every worker was beyond pleasant. \n\nfor appetizers we ordered calamari and <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark>. both of the appetizers were fantastic! even the bread basket was delicious! this included various types of bread such as dinner rolls, pretzel bread, and a type of onion bread. \n\nas for the main dish, i ordered the filet oscar which consists of a 6 oz <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark>, asparagus, and <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>. the only reason i give them 4 stars instead of 5 because i was disappointed with the <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>. on the menu it says alaskan king crab \"legs\" not \"leg\". it was very disappointing that they only gave one leg, especially since the crab was so appetizing! \n\nwe also ordered the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> legs. this was my first time trying <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> legs and i didn't know what to expect. i thought the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> legs were pretty good. it was just really different from what i'm used to. it has a bitter kind of taste, i can't exactly pinpoint it. \n\nanother reason why i deducted a star was because on the bill they automatically add 18% for tip. before we got the bill we were planning to tip more than 18%, but we were kind of disappointed when got the bill. i feel that a person should tip at least 10%, and if the service is excellent then that determines how much more a person should tip.", 
            "the hostess was very nice! the server is professional. the food is amazing. i give this place a 5 star. \n\nthis is my favorite and best seafood place on the strip! food here is quality so yes you'll spend a little more than usual but its the experience. we got a basket of bread this was a great start to our meal. love the variety of bread!\n\nwe started with the shrimp & <mark>Shrimp & Scallop Ceviche</mark>: so fresh and amazing limey flavor. \nthe main course was snow <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>, lobster tail and <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark>...everything was so tasty. the side was roasted sweet corn... that was absolutely delicious! \nto end the night we got the key lime pie it was the perfect dessert to end the night...it is fresh with that sourness from the lime and pie crust is yummy topped with a fluffy whipped cream.\n\noverall great ambience!",

            "i was in vegas for vacation of course! i took my family here for my mom's birthday. now i must preface this review by saying my mom is the pickiest eater i know. i've taken her out to eat at many places. i was so happy to hear her saying that this was the best place i've ever taken her and the best sea food she's ever had! she went home and told my dad all about it and got him all jealous he missed out--he's allergic to shellfish!\n\nwe ordered 4 servings of <mark>Manhattan Clam Chowder</mark>, 1 <mark>Grilled Seafood Platter</mark> , 1 pound of the smallest <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws, some brocollini for a side, and 2 kids meals. the <mark>Grilled Seafood Platter</mark> came with scallops, lobster tail, and madagascar shrimp. wow, this is the first time i've actually liked scallops! they were big and meaty! the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws were cold but the meat was sweet and even the small ones had lots of meat! it was like a classier version of the atlantic blue crab that i am so used to eating on the east coast. i was not a fan of the mustard dip that it came with but the crab meat in itself had great flavor. just some lemon juice was enough!\n\nwhat i love about this restaurant is their affordable kids menu so you can bring your kids here and have them eat nice stuff, too! if they can't finish it, you can just get more food for yourself because these kids meals are basically slightly smaller portioned adult meals at like less than half the cost. sure the selection is not as extensive, but if you want <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> or <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark>, these meals are a great price! i brought two younger siblings and one ordered a 6oz <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> and the other mac and cheese. joe's have $17 kids meals with steak and <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> and $9 meals with some kind of starch or chicken nuggets, etc, you know the usual kids stuff. stay away from the $9 meals. the mac and cheese was total crap. easy mac would have been better!! it was more like hard, dry pasta shells and butter. my sister couldn't finish it. the steak however was the same quality as the adult version and cost 1/3 the price for a slightly smaller portion! each kids meal also came with a free side. one sibling picked broccolini and it was the same serving size as the appetizer portion i paid $9 for if not bigger!! seriously (look at the picture i posted). the only difference was the brocollini that came with the kids meal was steamed and the other off the menu was grilled with olive oil. each kids meal also came with the brownie sundae, which i'm pretty sure is the exact same thing they charge adults $8 for on the dessert menu! needless to say, the sundae was delicious. seriously, if you have kids, just use that as an excuse order some stuff for less than half the price on the regular menu.\n\nas for the more adult stuff, i don't think you can go wrong ordering shellfish here. everything tasted amazingly exotic and fresh. you must get the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws! i didn't know that they harvested the claws by taking one claw and throwing the crab back in the ocean! the claw regenerates! gasp! do they rotate which claw they take from the crab? is it the left or right one? i digress. i tried my other sister's steak and it was good but not something amazing (nothing i can't cook at home with a good cut of meat), so i can't say i would recommend the steak over the seafood. stay away from starches like pasta because based on the mac and cheese my sister had, i don't have faith in those dishes. why would you pray premium prices for starch dishes anyway? \n\noh and the complimentary bread was crap. olive garden probably has better. again, i don't think they know how to cook their carbs here.\n\nservice was good. our waitress, mindy, was very knowledgeable about the menu, had good recommendations and checked on us often. she didn't seem super accommodating, however. my mom didn't like her wine and she didn't offer to comp it or take it back. it wasn't that expensive glass of wine either, $8. usually nice restaurants just take stuff you really don't like off the bill and offer to replace it with something else.\n\noh, and don't worry about how to dress at this restaurant. my family showed up in hoodies and jeans and there was no problems getting service. this is touristy vegas!\n\nin the end my bill after tax and tip was over $230. it was worth it though because we left stuffed as a party of 4 (2 adults and 2 teens) and it included alcohol, dessert, and coffee, too! yum!", 
            "a great restaurant, and in the context of very expensive las vegas restaurants, actually a little bit less expensive. we arrived just a few days into <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> season and sampled both the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> and the alaskan king crab. as great as <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> is, i actually thought the alaskan king crab was even better.\n\nour tabled tried a variety of entrees ranging from more crab to fish and steaks, and all were terrific. on one occasion, the <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> that was ordered wasn't exactly the best. it was both slightly flavorless but also undercooked. however, generally fantastic.\n\nthey have great pies. we tried key lime and peanut butter, both terrific. great place, great service!", 
            "this was quite a unexpected surprise - there are so many great restaurants in las vegas and i've been fortunate enough to have experienced a fair share of them over the years. one of my associates made a reservation for the six of us attending a trade show at the convention center and picked joe's for dinner one night. i really never had the chance to read the reviews so i really walked in blind. we arrived a little late for our scheduled time but we were immediately seated and from that moment on it was incredible. \n\nour server greeted us and took our drink orders and interacted with our entire group like she had known us for years. i started with my usual ketel one martini up, a little dirty with cheese stuffed olives it came out ice cold and filled to the brim. although it's a rather simple drink to make some struggle, so by no means are they all created equal. the way i see it the difference between the okay ones and the outstanding ones are some are just poured and some are crafted it was apparent after the first sip this was definitely a crafted one that was executed by a professional mixologist. i validated this by enjoying several more and they all were outstanding as the first.\n\ni ordered raw <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> for my appetizer from a impressive selection of oysters that are flown in daily, they came out very clean with most of the natural liquor retained requiring nothing but a slight dash of tabasco and a hint of horseradish. there was plenty of time to enjoy these along with our first round of refreshments since they we're delivered and eaten before our salads orders were taken absolutely no rush here our server's timing was impeccable.  we had our second round of cocktails delivered while we place our second course selections - i chose the pork belly wedge salad with ranch dressing, a hint of balsamic vinegar, vine ripened tomatoes and may-tag <mark>Chopped Lettuce, Tomato, Onion & Blue Cheese</mark> crumbles. again i can't stress enough this salad was a creation in itself perfectly assembled on a chill plate with exact portions of each ingredient. the pork belly was crisp, succulent and plentiful this is nothing remotely similar to the typical <mark>Blt Wedge</mark> salad so common at so many restaurants. \n\nonce we had a few moments to enjoy these wonderful salads we were advised to put in our entree orders. the steak and seafood selections are amazing and i'm sure anything i'd pick would be wonderful but the prime cut bone-in filet was taunting my palette and having this special cut prepared a few degrees over rare was impossible to resist, this accompanied by grilled verse steam asparagus my experience was only going to improve by leaps and bounds if that was possible after experience the first two courses. it's such a treat to have a server who understands her clientele and being this was a business meeting she was very attentive but was able to break in at precisely the right times to explain the specials, take the drink orders or to simple ensure our evening was proceeding as we had hoped and update us on the delivery of our food. \n\nthe entrees arrived fresh from the kitchen warm and accurate the portions were extreme, we also had multiple sides to share amongst the 6 of us and really there was more food than any of us could have eaten no matter the time frame. i decided to pass on the shared sides and focus my attention on the bone-in filet which was prepared to my exact specifications (if you've never experience this cut its a bucket list item for sure) fortunately i've been able to have this cut many times over the years even though it not a common cut you can find at just any steakhouse. \n\nthese bone-in, prime grade, <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> are at the top of my list when it comes to that magical blend of tender, juicy, and flavorful.\rtrimmed perfectly and generously portioned, this steak is begging for a rare to medium rare preparation. unlike a <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> on it's own, this steak is best cooked slow to maximize the flavor that comes from a bone-in steak and this was one of the best examples i've ever cut into. after experiencing this grand finale of a steak it would be pointless to continue, joe's far exceeded any expectations i had and this meal will surely be mentioned in future conversations with my small group of associates when we're looking for our next exquisite dining adventure...enjoy!", 
            "my wife and i went here for our anniversary.  we read the many positive reviews about this on yelp.  i had the <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> and my wife had seafood. both dishes were cooked to perfection. the staff was so polite and attentive.", 
            "my wife and i come here every time we're in las vegas.  \n12/4/2015 had a belated birthday party for my my son who now lives and works in las vegas.\nfood - great as usual - we had the <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark>, dover sole, <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> and salmon. \nall cooked beautifully, the sole was perfectly boned at the table, the meat tender and well marbled. <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, sweet <mark><mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark></mark>, and amazing <mark>Crispy Brussels Sprouts</mark>.\nambiance - warm, bustling, exciting, fun. all the servers had smiles on their faces and demonstrated energy and enthusiasm as they rushed by. \nservice - peter s was our server that night and he was amazing, right down to when, after my second woodford, i asked for a glass of buttery chardonnay and got me a good one. \nperks - it was my son's birthday and we were full. nonetheless, for no charge, two desserts were brought out the names of which i cannot recall. \nvalue - with drinks, for 4, less than $400 which is stunning for the strip."

            "a table for 9 please.....i made reservations a couple of weeks in advance and we were seated promptly when everyone showed up. it was my aunt's bday and since i'm a \"foodie\" i picked joe's. after i made my first appearance here on new years, i hoped this place would meet the same expectations. unfortunately it didn't.....\n\nfood: 4.25 stars\nservice: 2.5 stars\noverall: 3.75 stars\n\nyes, we started off with 14 \"select\" <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>! 14 of them!!!! (120 dollars worth of <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>). this was delicious like i remembered.....and that mustardy sauce is so yummy that i could dip anything in it! we also tried the rockefeller oyster which i was not that impressed. i didn't taste an oysters what so ever.....\n\ni ordered the bone in ribeye this time and i shared it with my dad. i had it cooked medium. well, last time i had gotten the <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> and let's just say i was a bit disappointed with the steak. it was dry in some parts (basically well done) and it wasn't medium at all. luckily my dad rather have the steak well done then bloody, so it worked out in his favor. however, i was a really really disappointed about my steak. the <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> made up for it though as well as the garlic spinach. i didn't get to try the sweet corn, but my aunt thought it was really delicious!\n\nmy other foodmates ordered the <mark>Joe's Fried Chicken</mark> (heard it wasn't as awesome as kfc's chicken, but he is a teenager), <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> (they said it wasn't fishy at all and it was really fresh), liver (my aunt enjoyed it), fish and chips (not sure how my brother felt about it, but he ate most of it), shrimp scampi (my other brother ate all of it so it must have been good or he was just hungry) and my lil sister had the cheeseburger kids meal (pretty decent sized). overall, i think the food was enjoyable, minus my <mark>Dry Aged Chopped Steak</mark>.\n\nnow the service....i understand that when there are large parties gratuity is added on automatically. since its a \"nicer\" establishment, you would expect it to have awesome service. maybe it was just our server because last time we had an awesome server, but at the same time, when we come in and spend 700 plus dollars i think we deserve some good attention. it's not that we were getting horrible service, we just were neglected. i watched our server attend to other tables (smaller tables) attentively and with us, it just wasn't there. after my dad signed the credit card slip, the server picked up the tab right away. in my opinion, i think that is a bit rude....why can't they wait the 5 minutes it takes for us to get up and leave and then pick up our tab? maybe i'm just a cranky woman today, but it doesn't mean i don't love joe's...i just would ask for a different server. \n\noverall, the havana dream pie is to die for and i love their <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>. next time i will stick with the seafood and hopefully my experience will be a better one with the service anyways.", 
            "had a great birthday dinner here, the food and the service were superb.  first, you start off the dinner with an amazing basket of bread, there's a great variety and everything was yummy, but my favorite was the flatbread.  they make it fresh at the restaurant, and it is super crispy and tasty.  <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> - amazing!  i loved all the sauces that accompanied it and the miniature tabasco sauce was super cute.  also loved the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> but felt like it was a bit overpriced, the best thing about them was the sauce.  their <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was cooked perfectly.  the only thing mediocre was the pork chop.  i guess you should stick to seafood here.  overall, great dining experience, i'd definitely come back.",

            "what we expected to be a quick jaunt from bellagio to the forum shops at caesar's was anything but. hubby and i had discussed well before we left for las vegas that we would try new restaurants this trip which meant skipping joe's, but as we sashayed through the doors of the forum shops, there was joe's smack dab in front of us, and he was calling our name . . . we thought there was no way on a friday night without reservations we would get in without a long wait, but we looked at each other, each of us with puppy dog eyes, imploring each other to break the rule we already made and try to get into joe's. amazingly enough, they had availability for two in the back dining room in an hour which meant shopping a little longer than expected, but we were entirely grateful for the extra time to spend more money! ha!\n\nwe really didn't have to look at the menu. we knew that a plate of select <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> was in order. as many others have said, they come in sizes from small to large and then \"select\". we always get the select. we are never disappointed. the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>, meaty and succulent, are the star, but the mustard sauce is the kicker. oh how i love that sauce . . . so much so that when i ordered the <mark>Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail</mark> as my meal, i asked for the mustard sauce instead of the cocktail sauce. hubby had the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>. it was the best we've ever had in any restaurant. we also ordered the <mark>Four Cheese Mac & Cheese</mark> mac and cheese which was so delectable and creamy. as an aside, you could pick any item from their list of sides and be thoroughly entranced.\n\natmosphere at joe's runs the gamut and can please just about anyone. they have the \"outside\" patio which provides a casual experience and is perfect for people-watching. just about everyone who walks into the forum shops from las vegas boulevard walks past you. there is the bar room and can watch your favorite game while you drink, dine and root for the home team. and then, my favorite, the back dining room which reminds me of an old italian steakhouse where your servers are dressed in tuxes and provide some of the best service in las vegas. i love the maitre d at the entrance to the back room. even if he doesn't recognize you, he pretends he does!  that's a real art!",

            "our second restaurant week meal was at joe's seafood, prime steaks and <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>. we had six o'clock reservations and we were seated right away. service was attentive throughout the meal. frank ordered off the menu, and our friend and i went with the restaurant week menu for $50.13 and we chose the same items: bowl of stone <mark>Crab Bisque</mark>, <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> with <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> and <mark>Sauteed Broccolini</mark> and joe's signature key lime pie.\n \nwe started with bisque and calamari ($14.95). both were excellent! the bisque was smooth as silk and the veggies had a nice bite. it'd only be better with more crab. because everything is better with more crab. the calamari was tender and lightly breaded, and the cocktail sauce had a satisfying kick from the horseradish. \n\nafter we gobbled that up, the real feast began. we dug into <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark> claws ($59.95), <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> with bok choy, mushroom mac n cheese ($9.95), <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> and <mark>Sauteed Broccolini</mark>. it was all delicious! the claws are always out of this world. i generally prefer a hard sear on fish but this miso glaze was wonderful - a pleasant blend of sweet and salty. \n\nwe were already stuffed, but we still had dessert to come. frank looked over the menu and chose the peanut butter pie with hot fudge ($7.95). that thing was a monster! it was rich, decadent and positively sinful. he could not finish it. we tried to help, but the pb pie won. the key lime pie was light and refreshing. it hit the spot!\n\ni think i can safely say that joe's is my favorite chain. they do it right! the restaurant week menu provided an opportunity to try something other than crab and the fish was indeed was stellar. the rw three courses were offered at considerable savings too. you save about $25, and $5 goes to three square for each meal ordered.", 
            "i had dinner last month at joe's in miami, and dinner at joe's in vegas a week ago.\n\nmiami joe's is still very good, but vegas joe's is going downhill. \nfood was dull and uninspired.\nplus my dinner companion's <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> entree came out halibut.\n\nthe waiter did his best to make up for the mix-up, but something like that just shouldn't happen at a restaurant with joe's history and pedigree.\n\nsay it ain't so, joe.", 
            "the server was great in directing us to order great selections to share family style.  fresh <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> were the best ever, as well as <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, <mark>Joe's <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark></mark>, potatoes, and rib eye and raumbauer chardonnay.  perfect dinner.  several years ago had dinner in the miami original location.  same great service from professional staff and outstanding food!", 
            "the food tasted amazing. really, some of the best <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> i've ever had. but the service was lacking. they rushed us through the whole meal just to turn the table. i'm talking literally taking plates away when people are still eating. left a bad taste in my mouth.", 
            "egads!!  as locals, we go to joe's 5-6 times a year for pleasure and business, usually the food and service is outstanding, last night, for christmas dinner, it was horrendous on both fronts. we made reservations about a week in advance.  they called us that morning to confirm - then told us they could not find our reservation on the phone.  when we arrived, they told my wife they could not find the reservation, when my wife offered to show the confirmation number on her mobile phone the host says \"let me do my job.\"  after 3 minutes he then asks to see the confirmation number.  we finally get seated, and it gets worse.\n\nwe order dinner, drinks, and appetizers.  25 minutes after taking our order we are informed that the whole maine lobster is no longer available, we had ordered 2.  we then re-order. lobster tails and chiliean <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>.  when the food arrives, our side dishes are missing.  one lobster tail was over-cooked, one under-cooked, and the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was bland.  the sides finally arrived more than mid-way through our entrees - the waitress apologizes, and says the sides will be taken off the bill.  we had also asked for refills on the bread - three times, which finally arrives when the plates are cleared.\n\nthe manager comes over, and acts annoyed that he has to apologize for the service and food.  naturally when the bill comes, the sides are not taken off.   we were so bothered by the lack of concern, we paid the bill and left.  it will be awhile before we return to joe's.",

            "five stars for the food, three stars for the waitress who was efficient but unfriendly. \n\neverything a la carte. ordered the <mark>Fried Oysters</mark> for appetizer which was great because they used fresh oysters. my <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> was a perfect medium rare and my friend's <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> was awesome.... but they could lighten on that sweet sauce they use. he scraped most of it off the surface. the saut\\u00e9ed garlic spinach was good.\n\ni made a reservation, came a bit early so decided to take the first available table in the lounge area. high tables with higher chairs... should've waited for the main dining area. anyway i made the reservation on open table via yelp but they didn't check me in so i received an email about not honoring my reservation. \n\njust fyi, make sure they check you in so you get credit on your open table account.", 
            "my 2nd time here. i recommend their <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>. this time i ordered 6 blk <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> $40 again as an order. we asked for it to be steamed and served warm, & with lemon on the side since it was a little bland but tasted fresh!! they pre cracked it for us prior to serving which i thought was nice. we only had to peel <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> off easily. \n\nthey gave us salt and pepper on the side for the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> and complimentary bread when first seated. \nthe bread consisted of parmesan bread, salted pretzel bread, and other crispy wonton looking bread. \n\nalso ordered the 24 oz. bone-in ribeye $60 it was juicy, tender, and flavorful. i asked for medium well. it was delicious. this serves 2 people so i shared this also with an order of the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> and an order of mash potatoes.  3 entr\\u00e9es was enough. \n\ntheir jenny mash potatoe's $10 has bits of crispy onion or was it parmesan on top. it was also good. no complains.\n\nwith tax was $118 including 18% tip it was about $138 . not bad for a dinner date. \nmy only complaint was the server was on the side talking to her co-worker a couple of times when we needed to get her attention. also when we asked her opinion for which mash potatoes to order since there is 2 on the menu, she said both of them tasted good. the lyonnais and the jenny mash. hmm i would expect them to be more helpful. \n\nits okay, i would still come back for the great food! \n_______________________________________________\n\nthe 1st time i came here, feeding 3 people including me, we had ordered one order of <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> (6), <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>\n\n an order of \"<mark>Grilled Seafood Platter</mark>\" with <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, scallops, clams, and baby octopus, it tasted so good. \n\nand an order for asparagus on the side and salmon with grilled onion mash potatoes.",

            "yummmm!!!\n\nhas to be the best seafood place on the strip! both because of the food and the service, our waitress leanne (sp?) was amazing!!! she provided so much interesting history about the restaurant since it has been around for awhile, also made recommendations and told us even not to order certain things because she knows her stuff and she was being honest.\n\ncan i also just say the bread basket was amazing, i could've ate that all night. i seriously love bread and butter so much, the one with the roasted onions and cheese on it was my fav!\n\nordered a dozen oysters of course, which included some kumamoto and fanny bay, delish and super fresh (5 stars)\n\nalso ordered some <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> and they were the best i've ever tasted, so incredibly fresh, she told us they come straight to the restaurant unlike some other places where they first need to preserve them with a bunch of chemicals. that was awesome. (5 stars)\n\n<mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claw (2 stars)- our waitress actually suggested we don't order this because of the season they aren't as fresh as normal, my brother really wanted to try one since they're known for it, he did, and i def liked the legs better, so she was on fireeeeee!\n\ni ordered the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> with the miso glaze (4.5 stars)- divine. the flavors were all there- my only mark off was that it was slightly overcooked. my brother got the same thing and even said so, too bad they made a mistake on mine. it wasn't chewy or anything so i ate it, but i do like my fish almost medium. \n\ndover sole (4 stars)- my dad and brother got this, they served this table side, i enjoyed the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> more, but this was still pretty good, the sauce does the trick ;)\n\nsides:\n\nroasted corn (2 stars)- this is one thing i didn't enjoy- tasted way better before, they need to add something to make this stand out more. my brother makes a creamy kind of corn dish at home which is fantastic, wish i had that!\n\n<mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> (4 stars)- good some crunch goodness on the top too, wish there was some garlic in there though ;)\n\ndessert- it was all pies! i'm not a huge pie person, but you can order halves, which my brother did of the banana creme pie, pretty good and i think she gave us a whole slice and charged us for half which was nice and we tipped her very well :)\n\nword of advice- they have valet right outside the restaurant so do not valet in the lobby, it's a long horrendous walk in heels, trust me. wish we knew that ahead of time!",

            "this was quite a unexpected surprise - there are so many great restaurants in las vegas and i've been fortunate enough to have experienced a fair share of them over the years. one of my associates made a reservation for the six of us attending a trade show at the convention center and picked joe's for dinner one night. i really never had the chance to read the reviews so i really walked in blind. we arrived a little late for our scheduled time but we were immediately seated and from that moment on it was incredible. \n\nour server greeted us and took our drink orders and interacted with our entire group like she had known us for years. i started with my usual ketel one martini up, a little dirty with cheese stuffed olives it came out ice cold and filled to the brim. although it's a rather simple drink to make some struggle, so by no means are they all created equal. the way i see it the difference between the okay ones and the outstanding ones are some are just poured and some are crafted it was apparent after the first sip this was definitely a crafted one that was executed by a professional mixologist. i validated this by enjoying several more and they all were outstanding as the first.\n\ni ordered raw <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> for my appetizer from a impressive selection of oysters that are flown in daily, they came out very clean with most of the natural liquor retained requiring nothing but a slight dash of tabasco and a hint of horseradish. there was plenty of time to enjoy these along with our first round of refreshments since they we're delivered and eaten before our salads orders were taken absolutely no rush here our server's timing was impeccable.  we had our second round of cocktails delivered while we place our second course selections - i chose the pork belly wedge salad with ranch dressing, a hint of balsamic vinegar, vine ripened tomatoes and may-tag <mark>Chopped Lettuce, Tomato, Onion & Blue Cheese</mark> crumbles. again i can't stress enough this salad was a creation in itself perfectly assembled on a chill plate with exact portions of each ingredient. the pork belly was crisp, succulent and plentiful this is nothing remotely similar to the typical <mark>Blt Wedge</mark> salad so common at so many restaurants. \n\nonce we had a few moments to enjoy these wonderful salads we were advised to put in our entree orders. the steak and seafood selections are amazing and i'm sure anything i'd pick would be wonderful but the prime cut bone-in filet was taunting my palette and having this special cut prepared a few degrees over rare was impossible to resist, this accompanied by grilled verse steam asparagus my experience was only going to improve by leaps and bounds if that was possible after experience the first two courses. it's such a treat to have a server who understands her clientele and being this was a business meeting she was very attentive but was able to break in at precisely the right times to explain the specials, take the drink orders or to simple ensure our evening was proceeding as we had hoped and update us on the delivery of our food. \n\nthe entrees arrived fresh from the kitchen warm and accurate the portions were extreme, we also had multiple sides to share amongst the 6 of us and really there was more food than any of us could have eaten no matter the time frame. i decided to pass on the shared sides and focus my attention on the bone-in filet which was prepared to my exact specifications (if you've never experience this cut its a bucket list item for sure) fortunately i've been able to have this cut many times over the years even though it not a common cut you can find at just any steakhouse. \n\nthese bone-in, prime grade, <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> are at the top of my list when it comes to that magical blend of tender, juicy, and flavorful.\rtrimmed perfectly and generously portioned, this steak is begging for a rare to medium rare preparation. unlike a <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> on it's own, this steak is best cooked slow to maximize the flavor that comes from a bone-in steak and this was one of the best examples i've ever cut into. after experiencing this grand finale of a steak it would be pointless to continue, joe's far exceeded any expectations i had and this meal will surely be mentioned in future conversations with my small group of associates when we're looking for our next exquisite dining adventure...enjoy!"

            "everything about this restaurant is fantastic!!!  the food is so good here - and the service is awesome.  i went for my 33rd birthday with 10 girlfriends, and we had a blast!  the <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark> is incredible, the <mark>Crab Bisque</mark> soup is delicious - and the crabs were amazing.  we were all very impressed with the side dishes we ordered - mainly the rice, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> and corn dishes.  i tried the boston cream pie - i loved it - i have a big sweet tooth!  overall, it was a delightful experience and a great time.  i highly recommend this for romantic dates, groups, and special occasions.  you really cannot go wrong!!!  everyone thought the prices were reasonable - you get what you pay for here and more.  we will all be back... we can't wait!", 
            "we were seated right away and the whole experience was great.  they even tried to find the football game my husband wanted to watch.  a little pricey for sitting at a bar table but the food was very good.  the seafood <mark>Joe's <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark></mark> was my fav. and they make a great <mark>Chopped Lettuce, Tomato, Onion & Blue Cheese</mark> stuffed olive dirty martini!", 
            "after my first visit to joe's in chicago, i was hooked, yet also saddened that there was no manhattan location.  so, imagine my pleasant surprise when i saw the las vegas destination listed on opentable.  i made a note of this exciting fact and convinced my friend to try it during our trip to the crazy city.\n\nthe lunch hour brought a substantial crowd to the outpost at casear's palace, and we had to wait quite a while only to grab two stools at the packed bar.  our busy and bland waitress/bartender did little to speed up our dining adventure.  we dug through our varied bread basket, each new roll or flat bread an exciting discovery.  \n\nwe each ordered the seafood <mark>Joe's <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark></mark>, the dish that joe's had won me over with.  the large bowl of mixed greens was topped with slices of hard-boiled egg, cubes of cheese, and various fresh vegetables.  large succulent shrimp, flavorful lobster claw meat, and chunky alaskan king crab were scattered throughout the plate.  <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> tasted fresh from the sea, perfectly crisp and tender.  in terms of dressing, i had requested the joe's vinaigrette on the side, but was told that it usually comes with the creamy italian instead.  however, the waitress offered to bring me a cup of each, which i was so thankful for.  the house dressing was more like an oily, garlicky salsa with chunks of ripe tomato.  the italian vinaigrette was also delicious, with a light-bodied seasoning.  since the joe's version contained vegetable pieces, you could basically spice up your salad with drizzles of each.  this fresh meal was what health food dreams are made of, and the bread basket alone is reason enough to dine here.  \n\njoe's is a fantastic chain seafood house that far surpasses expectations.  for all of its touristy, casual dining attributes, it will blow you away with its high-quality ingredients and traditional preparations.", 
            "i am very familiar with the original joe's on south beach and just happend to stumble on this one in vegas while looking for a place for lunch...i was not disappointed. \n we were greeted with a basket of warm fresh breads including their delicious pretzel bread. i ordered the <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark> that was loaded with shrimp, crab and lobster  and it was great. others on the table had the lobster, <mark>Manhattan Clam Chowder</mark>,  oysters and <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> and all raved about it. we finished the meal by sharing thier keylime pie....it too was super yummy. \nthis might be the best lunch in vegas", 
            "sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo good!!!!! i have always wanted to try this place but never had the chance to until my most recent trip to vegas with a bunch of foodies!! we went there for lunch. ordered the 2nd mortgage (appetizer) which was around $16 or $17 per person. it consisted of <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>, lobster, ceviche, shrimp, etc. the presentation of the platter was soooooooo nice but the only thing that really blew my mind was the <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>. they were sooooooooooooooo huge and sweet!!!! everyone else loved the entrees they ordered except me. i think i had the fish with lobster sauce or something ..it was kind of bland. i am definately coming back again very soon..but this time, i will only be ordering the <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>. oooo and the seafood <mark>Joe's <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark></mark> (someone at the next table had it and it looked sooooooooooooo good) yum yum!!!!! can't wait for my next vegas trip!!!",

            "we decided to stop in here for a pre-show dinner. this place is easy to get to off the strip since it's on the street level of the forum shops near caesar's palace. we arrived without a reservation and got seated right away. \n\nthe seafood <mark>Joe's <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark></mark> was exceptionally good. the ingredients were fresh and we were able to get in and out quickly. not really knowing where we were going to eat on the strip this place turned out to be far better than expected.", 
            "we come here for lunch on every vegas trip.  the lunch menu is cheaper and you're getting pretty much the same items as dinner.  \n\nthe crab claws were good, but we prefer the  <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> ($14.95) because it comes with the same tasty mustard dipping sauce and you don't have to get your hands all messy.  \n\nthe seafood <mark>Joe's <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark></mark> ($16.95) a great salad to split with someone else, just let your waiter know you'll be sharing it and it comes out with 2 huge portions.  \n\nour absolute favorite is the stone <mark>Crab Bisque</mark> ($6.95 a bowl) i want to lick the bowl clean everytime i get this.  \n\nthey open at 11:30am daily, get there as soon as you can for really quick service!", 
            "a must try for those going to the city of loss wages...no loss here as their <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>, lobster bisque, and other specialty items on the menu are mouth-satisfying.\n\non the recommendation of our server, i had the salmon with lime butter.  l-o-v-e-d it!!! the salmon wasn't drenched in the sauce, but lightly pampered in it making it  a delish and still healthy meal.  we also had the <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark>, which is a salad that comes with nice sized pieces of lobster, <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>, and other delectably ocean faring critters.  last but not least, we ordered the prime rib, which was cooked to perfection!\n\na definite must stop on our next trip back...hopefully this time to withdraw!!! :)",

            "restaurant week is in full swing, and we are now 4 for 4! last night diane and i dined at joe's, and it was another great meal! \n\nwe arrived for dinner on thursday at 5:45 p.m., 15 minutes before our reservation, and were seated right away. by 7:00 p.m. the main dining room was almost completely full. we had never been here before, and i was a bit intimidated at first as i approached the high reception stand where a man in a jet black tuxedo with jet black hair towered over me. but he was friendly and professional, as were all of the other black bow-tied, black tuxedoed, and white aproned restaurant personnel we encountered during our visit. i had only seen the bar and mall dining areas before, and thought they comprised the whole restaurant. not so! we were ushered through a curtain to a very elegant dining room that had decorative lights on the wall and a decidedly new york city clubby steakhouse feel to it, with much dark wood and brown leather, white tablecloths, and several tables surrounded by comfortable booths along both main walls. it was very sophisticated but not pretentious, as were the several servers who moved briskly about like busy bees. it was interesting just watching them in action. \n\nwe went with the restaurant week menu, but augmented it with a two-claw appetizer of <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws and king crab mac & cheese. i always wondered whether i would be able to eat <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws because their ends look like elongated fingers painted with black nail polish. but it was easier than i thought, since that part of the claw is left alone. the claws arrived from the kitchen already largely crushed by a mallet, so it was not that difficult to pry apart the porcelain-like shell casing to get at the meat underneath. but there seemed to be less meat than found in alaskan crab claws. the thin morsels of crab meat tasted fine either dipped in drawn butter, the mild mustard sauce that was provided, or just eaten straight out of <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark>. yet i noted that they were not as sweet or satisfying as king crab claw meat. and, at about $22 for two claws, they were not cheap. so, for me, it is now \"been there, done that!\" but i will definitely return to joe's for its other fine fare, including lobster and king crab. \n\nalthough this was hardly needed, an assortment of bread products tasted good with the soft pats of butter provided. and a bowl of stone <mark>Crab Bisque</mark> was sweet and smooth--simply exquisite in taste and texture. i liked it better without the garnish of tiny cuts of carrots and zucchini that we asked to have served on the side, since diane's yelp nickname is \"veggie hater\" for a reason. but i picked the delicate morsels of <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> out of the garnish and tossed them in the wonderful soup, which avoided an inexcusable wasting of fine crab particles and made the soup even tastier. \n\na large <mark>Joe's <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark></mark> of lettuce, tomato, onion, and <mark>Chopped Lettuce, Tomato, Onion & Blue Cheese</mark> crumbles with a fine vinaigrette dressing was quite satisfying. my 8 oz. <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> with drinkable bearnaise sauce was simply divine. it was well seasoned on top, perfectly medium rare inside as ordered, and did literally melt in my mouth. i liked it better without the house seasonings, which i tried on a couple of bites. it was one of those steaks that kept getting better and better as slices of beef moved toward the rarer center. \n\ndiane's moist halibut had a tasty parmesan crust, augmented by a buerre blanc-like sauce that was provided. it was notably flatter than many servings of halibut experienced at other restaurants, but of ample portion size. the king crab mac & cheese, made with white shells, hunks of king crab, and bechamel sauce, tasted good, but was not nearly as noteworthy as the sumptuous <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> that were covered with a mix of baked asiago cheese and breadcrumbs. and, few lobster chunks were included in the dish. <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> was creamy as billed, and quite tasty. \n\njoe's signature key lime pie arrived ultra cold and almost frozen. after trying one bite, i let my slice sit for 5 minutes, and then it was just right, having lost its icy taste. it was very tart and delicious. \n\npeppermint gelato with hot fudge was not as memorable as the key lime pie, but the melted hot fudge was delicious. it had the strong taste of peppermint, and every now and then surprised the palate with peppermint candy chips. i would have preferred this dish during the christmas season! \n\nall in all, a wonderful five-star meal!", 
            "service is always great here. i'm not a \"chain\" kind of person but there are a few that are worth visiting. joe's <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> is one. the seafood <mark>Joe's <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark></mark> is one of my top 10 favorite salads. its a hand full of romain lettuce chopped with asparagus, red and yellow bell pepper, hearts of palm, red onion, cucumber, carrots, green onion, celery, cherry tomatoes, topped with shrimp, crab, lobster, avocado and croutons and lightly tossed with a vinaigrette for $13 at lunch. \n\ni have had the king crab, super yummy, and the <mark>Crab Bisque</mark> which they actually serve hot unlike most places.\n\ndefinitely worth a trip!", 
            "this is hands down one of our favorite lunch spots in las vegas.  we just visited last week and had a fantastic meal.\n\nwe started with a bottle of cakebread chardonnay and crab claws, and luckily the crabs had just come into season.  they were fresh and sweet and so good.  a little messy, there is really no way to eat <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws elegantly, but worth the mess (and of course, you get a hot towel to clean up afterwards).\n\nthe bread basket at joe's is always a big hit.  there are soft pretzel sticks, a yummy caramelized onion and cheese roll, some sweet breads, a really good cracker-like flat bread.\n\ni always get the same thing, it's basically my favorite salad ever.  the seafood <mark>Joe's <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark></mark>, with lobster, alaskan king crab, and shrimp over greens with eggs, celery, hearts of palm, etc, etc, etc... it's amazing.  i always want to try something new, and ultimately can never order anything else. \n\nmy husband usually gets their cheeseburger (i know, cheeseburger at an amazing seafood restaurant?  but it's a great burger), but this time opted for the turkey burger (where did my husband go, and who is this health-conscious imposter?).  he thought it was great, it had great black pepper spice and a cranberry relish.  not sure if he liked it more than the regular burger, but he was pleased.\n\njoe's is also a great atmosphere.  the service is always great, and whether you sit in the comfy bar area or out in the courtyard, you'll have a great experience.", 
            "this place is amazing. bring your wallet!!!!!\n\nyou can make reservations at this one on opentable, something you can't even think about doing in the south beach location. this is not the same as joe's crab shack, they are light years apart. there are only 3 of these locations that i know about--miami, chicago, & vegas.\n\nthe roasted corn is by far my favorite side.  the <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark> to start is awesome. and believe it or not their <mark>Joe's Fried Chicken</mark> is off the chain.  other good sides are their potatoes and <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>.\n\nthey had fresh <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> 1.25 lb was $90, not cheap by any means but super good. great for groups!  great for dates. all the waiters are in tuxedos. joe's is on the first floor and there is a side sneaky valet if you know where to look that's right next to it.\n\nkey lime pie for dessert is a must!  but they have a banana one too that is just as good. get both why not! what's another $10 when you are going all in!\n\nmake sure you ask for extra lemons and mustard sauce.\n\nyou can thank me later.  oh and ps they are open for lunch too!", 
            "i have to admit, the key lime pie ($6.95) was terrific.  but the seafood, which i thought was their specialty, was just so so.  the scallops ($24.95) tasted kind of dirty.  and the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> ($42.95) was nothing special.  i'm not a big fan of their mushroom sauce, so maybe that has something to do with it.  if i go again, i'm going to try to get some good, old melted butter.\n\nwe also tried the vegetable <mark>Joe's <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark></mark> ($13.95), which was a lot smaller than i thought it would be, but chock full of vegetables and pretty tasty.  the pretzel bread was pretty good, but cold.  :(\n\nkeep in mind, about half the tables are high-top so you may have to sit at one of those.  also, they could use some dual service technique or something.  we did have a guy come down and randomly wipe down our table at odd intervals, but he didn't seem interested in helping with anything else.  so our only waitress was occupied and we had to wait longer than we wanted to order dessert and get the check.\n\nall in all, just a-ok.", 
            "came here with mom, and we shared the <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> appetizer, the stone <mark>Crab Bisque</mark>, and the seafood chop salad with creamy vinaigrette.  everything was excellent.  \n\nthe <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> are 95% crab chunks. and i mean chunks, none of those wimpy small pieces you get in normal <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark>. the crabs they use must be huge! the meat was sweet and juicy, and the binding agent they use to hold it all together only added to the flavor. the cakes are roasted to a golden brown (not fried) and about the size of a tennis ball. one $16 serving comes with two cakes, making this an insanely good deal.\n\nthe <mark>Crab Bisque</mark> was very tasty and super rich, if a little salty. a small cup was $8, but it was so rich and filling that i could barely finish it.\n\nthe <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark> comes with avocado, celery, asparagus, tomatoes, lettuce, cucumbers, onions, and lobster, shrimp and crab meat. they were generous with the seafood,  and all the ingredients worked well together.\n\nservice was excellent and the seating area is very pleasant.  the kitchen was nice enough to split both the <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> and the salad on two plates since we were sharing.  i will continue to return every time i'm in vegas.",

            "looking for eating options in vegas and i can not tell you how stoked i was to see this pop up on my yelp feed.  i tried joe's <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> in miami, florida and it was probably one of my most memorable restaurant experiences.  this is their sister restaurant.  and now i have one on the west side of the us! ok, it's not quite in la...but it's doable.  it's slightly hard to find if you're starting from the caesar's casino, but it's worth the long walk.  made a reservation for lunch with my family at 11:30am (their opening time) and was seated very promptly.  \n\nservice was amazing and the waiter was helpful and hilarious.  the staff really seemed like they were all very well trained and enjoyed working there and it created an awesome atmosphere for us to enjoy.  and the food came out quick! i love and appreciate fast service because ain't nobody got time to be hangry.\n\nnow on to the food:\nbread: you get an assortment of bread.  our basket included a variety of about five different types including a traditional dinner roll, onion roll, pretzel bread, and bacon & ciabatta.  load up on the carbs (:\n\nhot chocolate: it was so delicious.  none of that watered down hot chocolate nonsense found here.  really satisfied my craving for hot chocolate and their whip cream is freshly home-whipped.  yum!\n\n<mark>Crab Bisque</mark>: the size difference jumps a lot from cup to bowl.  i love their presentation.  you're first served with a bowl with crab bits and stuff in the middle and then the server pours the bisque all over it.  i don't know if they do that for the cups, but it is a nice touch. flavor is nothing short of what i expected.\n\n<mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>: our waiter recommended us to get two orders of this (vs. a jumbo order with less claws) for our party of seven so we each could get two claws.  you still have to take off <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> of the crab, but they pre-crack it for you so it's almost like peeling a boiled egg shell.  a must order while eating here.\n\n<mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>: ugh this was amazing! another must order!! the meat was easy to slide out and it had a sweet scrumptious taste to it. dip that into the mustard or butter sauce and it's pretty mindblowing. too good!!\n\n<mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark>:  this was the only dish that we ordered that i could have lived without.  it was good, but i just felt like it was a tad bit on the extra fried side to me.\n\n<mark>Alaskan King Crab Roll</mark>:  i will totally order this again.  it's a perfect order of seafood, if you don't want to over order or go over budget haha.  they stuff the roll with fresh crab meat and it comes with a side of their homemade chips (which are pretty much perfection).\n\nseafood <mark>Joe's <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark></mark>:  this is also perfect if you're feeling full already.  this salad comes with the alaskan crab, lobster, and shrimp on top of salad with a vinaigrette.  it's so good. like wow good. wow.\n\nwild mushroom mac & cheese:  it is most definitely on the cheesy side and it's freaking delicious.  one side order is worth sharing because it's a lot to finish, but it's worth a try to all the cheese lovers out there.\n\nkey lime pie: the only key lime pie i've ever liked was at the joe's in miami. and they serve it just as good here. it's pretty freaking awesome and you're either an idiot for not ordering it (or you're too full haha). just kidding that was mean...but it's really yummy!\n\ni can't rave about this place enough. one of my favorite restaurants ever and you have to come and splurge a little bit here. \n\nsidenote: you can order from their dinner menu for lunch if you're interested!

            "the skinny : come for lunch as the prices are much more reasonable - get the 2 course lunch for a great deal.  the <mark>Roast Turkey & Avocado</mark> sammy is my fav(3.5) service is solid (4) value: depends on what you order.  stick to the sandwiches and the 2 course lunch and you should make out fine (3.5 bump up to 4)\n\njust to preface this review -  <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> is not all that for me. neither is crab in general. but we still make our way to joe's for lunch to catch some of their other menu items. \n\nwe usually go during the summer when lettuce entertain you club members receive coupons to dine in their local joints. usually there is a coupon for joe's which is a major score (yay!). \n\nwe've tried different iterations of things but the true stand outs for us is the lunch menu which is way easier on the wallet than dinner. \n\nmy perennial favorite is their <mark>Roast Turkey & Avocado</mark> sandwich. served with real roasted moist turkey and a nice thick slice of bacon, it is a simple dish done really well. love the combination of alfalfa sprouts, tomato and avocado. the fried <mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark> fries are pretty solid but nothing special. for $16, this is as affordable for a place like joe's gets. \n\nthe hubs loves their sliced rib eye french dip with saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms and onions and a side of fries. ($22) it's messy/juicy but oh so good sandwich served on a ciabatta roll. the <mark>French Fried</mark> again are nothing special. \n\nthe two course lunch is a good deal if you consider how much they charge for sides and dessert. between the two options of alaskan king crab vs.  the steak,  i would opt for the crab. \n\nreally,  the crab is only okay in my books. portion size for this is pretty small -  about 5 small legs. where it stands out is the lyonnaise potatoes and roasted sweet corn. the lyonnaise potatoes is kind of like a large mound of hash browns topped with caramelized onions. greasy but very tasty. the roasted sweet corn with a hint of lime is great too. both portion sizes for the sides are really a lot for one person and easily shared. it comes with havana dream pie which is essential a boston cream pie minus the chocolate topping and instead dulce de leches with a hit of cinnamon. if you decide you want banana cream pie or key lime pie instead (both are pretty good) ,  they will accommodate you. all of this for around $28-29.\n\nthe steak option is okay - just the <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> are boring while the saut\\u00e9ed spinach is nothing special. \n\nservice is prompt generally during lunch hours due to all the power lunches that go down here. as soon as you are seated,  they make sure the water glasses are filled and a basket of warmed bread is placed while you peruse the menu. the bread basket is okay but i find myself partial to the parker roll and the lavosh -  both are kind of guilty pleasures.\n\noverall, joe's is nothing particularly innovative. but it is good food executed well generally. value is largely during the lunch hours with decent eats for a more reasonable price point. 3.5 starred review with bump up to 4."

            "looking for eating options in vegas and i can not tell you how stoked i was to see this pop up on my yelp feed.  i tried joe's <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> in miami, florida and it was probably one of my most memorable restaurant experiences.  this is their sister restaurant.  and now i have one on the west side of the us! ok, it's not quite in la...but it's doable.  it's slightly hard to find if you're starting from the caesar's casino, but it's worth the long walk.  made a reservation for lunch with my family at 11:30am (their opening time) and was seated very promptly.  \n\nservice was amazing and the waiter was helpful and hilarious.  the staff really seemed like they were all very well trained and enjoyed working there and it created an awesome atmosphere for us to enjoy.  and the food came out quick! i love and appreciate fast service because ain't nobody got time to be hangry.\n\nnow on to the food:\nbread: you get an assortment of bread.  our basket included a variety of about five different types including a traditional dinner roll, onion roll, pretzel bread, and bacon & ciabatta.  load up on the carbs (:\n\nhot chocolate: it was so delicious.  none of that watered down hot chocolate nonsense found here.  really satisfied my craving for hot chocolate and their whip cream is freshly home-whipped.  yum!\n\n<mark>Crab Bisque</mark>: the size difference jumps a lot from cup to bowl.  i love their presentation.  you're first served with a bowl with crab bits and stuff in the middle and then the server pours the bisque all over it.  i don't know if they do that for the cups, but it is a nice touch. flavor is nothing short of what i expected.\n\n<mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>: our waiter recommended us to get two orders of this (vs. a jumbo order with less claws) for our party of seven so we each could get two claws.  you still have to take off <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> of the crab, but they pre-crack it for you so it's almost like peeling a boiled egg shell.  a must order while eating here.\n\n<mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>: ugh this was amazing! another must order!! the meat was easy to slide out and it had a sweet scrumptious taste to it. dip that into the mustard or butter sauce and it's pretty mindblowing. too good!!\n\n<mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark>:  this was the only dish that we ordered that i could have lived without.  it was good, but i just felt like it was a tad bit on the extra fried side to me.\n\n<mark>Alaskan King Crab Roll</mark>:  i will totally order this again.  it's a perfect order of seafood, if you don't want to over order or go over budget haha.  they stuff the roll with fresh crab meat and it comes with a side of their homemade chips (which are pretty much perfection).\n\nseafood <mark>Joe's <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark></mark>:  this is also perfect if you're feeling full already.  this salad comes with the alaskan crab, lobster, and shrimp on top of salad with a vinaigrette.  it's so good. like wow good. wow.\n\nwild mushroom mac & cheese:  it is most definitely on the cheesy side and it's freaking delicious.  one side order is worth sharing because it's a lot to finish, but it's worth a try to all the cheese lovers out there.\n\nkey lime pie: the only key lime pie i've ever liked was at the joe's in miami. and they serve it just as good here. it's pretty freaking awesome and you're either an idiot for not ordering it (or you're too full haha). just kidding that was mean...but it's really yummy!\n\ni can't rave about this place enough. one of my favorite restaurants ever and you have to come and splurge a little bit here. \n\nsidenote: you can order from their dinner menu for lunch if you're interested!

            "i've tried the joe's in miami so i was not sure how the seafood would be here in vegas. it didn't disappoint! i had the <mark>Alaskan King Crab Roll</mark> and it was the best i've ever had. the toasted bun is perfection. my husband has the shaved <mark>Char-Broiled Beef Tenderloin Sandwich</mark>. really good as well. one of the best simple meals we've had in vegas"

            "i love <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>, but this location was a little disapointing for me.  i could go on all day about the jumbo <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws that i had in miami, in vegas it was just ok.  they were out of the jumbo claws and maybe the large because we ended up just getting the mediums, you really can taste the difference.  in miami the <mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark> fries are thick cut and in vegas they're shoestrings and i prefer the thick cut.    the garlic <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> is the same.  do not order the <mark>Joe's Fried Chicken</mark>!  i had heard so many great things about the chicken , but ended up so disapointed, it was not salted at all so it tasted really, really bad.  i'm sure this locaton loses some of it's charm because it's not in the salty air of  the miami coast, but there is no excuse for the bad chicken and being out of jumbo claws.  i'll think i'll stick with the miami location for future. oh and our server was not very nice.", 
            "a friend told me that this place was a must eat next time i was in vegas. \n\nafter getting a little lost walking around the forum shops at caesar's (30 mins late to our reservation)... we were ready to try these famous <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> from miami. i don't like eating seafood as the main course because it's very light and from my reviews... you should know that i like to feel heavy and full after i eat. so... i couldn't resist the bone-in-ribeye (surprise...  surprise). this was the third time i've eating the ribeye in the past 2 weeks (i'm seeing the doctor next week... might as well hear bad news since i'm expecting it). since i had mastro's (see my review) last week... i had it fresh in my mind and could say that this steak was not quite at its level. but overall it was a very good steak. \n\nmy wife had the large <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> (5 claws). of course i snagged a couple of them. very good i must say but was a little disappointed with the size. you only get the claws... that's it. i wanted the whole freakin thing. \n\nfor our sides we got jennie's special potatoes and sweet corn. the jennie's special potatoes were twice baked <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> with garlic, parmesan cheese and asiago cheese. i loved the creaminess of the potatoes and then the crunch of the parmesan and asiago... definitely one of the highlights. the sweet corn was good but regretted not getting the creamed corn.  \n\na friend of mine got the <mark>Joe's Fried Chicken</mark> and since <mark>Joe's Fried Chicken</mark> is a top 5 food of mine i had to try it. the chicken was very moist inside and crispy on the outside but the crust (skin) lacked a little flavor. maybe <mark>Joe's Fried Chicken</mark> and fine dining don't go together?", 
            "first of all, lunch. surprisingly there aren't that many nice places to have lunch on the strip: joe's is one of the best choices, particularly if you are unsure of your companion's dining preferences or looking to find something moderately priced and moderately fast (there are small salads, sandwches and burgers on the bar menu). \n\na spin-off of the miami legend, joe's offers three distinct environments --a bustling patio in the elegant forum rotunda, a very large casual bar, and a huge 40s-50s era dining room that is classic (i also discovered they have two round function rooms overlooking the strip and a elegantly old school \"boardroom\" for private dining/meeting).\n\ncoat and tie not required, but common, esp. in dining room--and large parties seem to be common. it isn't surprising to run into both casino heavy hitters (even those from competing properties, who could eat elsewhere for free) as well as visiting celebs. tuxedoed waiters  provide detailed service...though when things get very busy, they may run by you a bit too quickly.\n\nthe menu is full of surprises--beyond the expected <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws, shrimp, oysters rockafeller, <mark>Shrimp De Jonghe</mark> (basically breaded scampi, but made with impressively tender prawns), <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> and fish dishes, there is an excellent chopped vegetable salad, good garlic <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> and roasted corn.\n\nthe bone-in <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> was among the very best i've had in vegas. and i have to tell you that i have sampled virtually all of the best steakhouses here.\n\nour dover sole was lightly breaded and gorgeously saut\\u00e9ed to a golden hue; the waiter deftly deboned it at the table and served it with a slightly carmelized lemon butter (it didn't need it).\n\nthe <mark>Joe's Fried Chicken</mark> was another unexpected surprise, a hefty four pieces, lightly battered and deep fried, the crispy crumb batter giving way to moist flavorful meat within. savory but light.\n\nin season, the <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> here are far and away the best i've had: sweet, juicy, light with none of the mealy taste you get from lesser crab. \n\ntheir pies are offered in half portions-a great option should you want to sample more than one. i have had uneven experiences with the signature key lime pie--one time it was perfect, another time, it was rock-solid frozen, and the waiter neither apologized nor replaced it when i complained. \n\ngenerally speaking, prices are on the high side but the quality reflects that. order with care.", 
            "tried this place for the first time on a saturday last month and went back the very next day! yes, it is that delicious!\n\nwithin our group we tried their <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>, shrimp in garlic sauce, <mark>Joe's Fried Chicken</mark>, steak, macaroni and cheese, and roasted corn and if i could i would of tasted more! \n\ntheir service was also excellent and fast, and valet parking is free! (gratuity still appreciated however). \n\ni cannot wait to go back!", 
            "awesome! we practically came here right off the plane. (we picked up the rental car and checked into our hotel first.) we were starving because it was dinner time back in brooklyn and we had flown through lunch. thank the merciful heavens for the loveliness that is joe's seafood prime steak & <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>. we started with a appetizer-size order of the claws themselves. they were perfectly fresh and sweet.\n\ni ordered the <mark>Joe's Fried Chicken</mark> and it was all killer, no filler. you might need a friend to help you finish, though because it must have been half a five pounder. not that i'm complaining. it was great.\n\nthe bar makes a nice cocktail and the prices are usual for a traditional steakhouse (think $30 entrees). if you want a real treat, joe's is worth the splurge. we certainly felt like \"high rollers\".", 
            "a table for 9 please.....i made reservations a couple of weeks in advance and we were seated promptly when everyone showed up. it was my aunt's bday and since i'm a \"foodie\" i picked joe's. after i made my first appearance here on new years, i hoped this place would meet the same expectations. unfortunately it didn't.....\n\nfood: 4.25 stars\nservice: 2.5 stars\noverall: 3.75 stars\n\nyes, we started off with 14 \"select\" <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>! 14 of them!!!! (120 dollars worth of <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>). this was delicious like i remembered.....and that mustardy sauce is so yummy that i could dip anything in it! we also tried the rockefeller oyster which i was not that impressed. i didn't taste an oysters what so ever.....\n\ni ordered the bone in ribeye this time and i shared it with my dad. i had it cooked medium. well, last time i had gotten the <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> and let's just say i was a bit disappointed with the steak. it was dry in some parts (basically well done) and it wasn't medium at all. luckily my dad rather have the steak well done then bloody, so it worked out in his favor. however, i was a really really disappointed about my steak. the <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> made up for it though as well as the garlic spinach. i didn't get to try the sweet corn, but my aunt thought it was really delicious!\n\nmy other foodmates ordered the <mark>Joe's Fried Chicken</mark> (heard it wasn't as awesome as kfc's chicken, but he is a teenager), <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> (they said it wasn't fishy at all and it was really fresh), liver (my aunt enjoyed it), fish and chips (not sure how my brother felt about it, but he ate most of it), shrimp scampi (my other brother ate all of it so it must have been good or he was just hungry) and my lil sister had the cheeseburger kids meal (pretty decent sized). overall, i think the food was enjoyable, minus my <mark>Dry Aged Chopped Steak</mark>.\n\nnow the service....i understand that when there are large parties gratuity is added on automatically. since its a \"nicer\" establishment, you would expect it to have awesome service. maybe it was just our server because last time we had an awesome server, but at the same time, when we come in and spend 700 plus dollars i think we deserve some good attention. it's not that we were getting horrible service, we just were neglected. i watched our server attend to other tables (smaller tables) attentively and with us, it just wasn't there. after my dad signed the credit card slip, the server picked up the tab right away. in my opinion, i think that is a bit rude....why can't they wait the 5 minutes it takes for us to get up and leave and then pick up our tab? maybe i'm just a cranky woman today, but it doesn't mean i don't love joe's...i just would ask for a different server. \n\noverall, the havana dream pie is to die for and i love their <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>. next time i will stick with the seafood and hopefully my experience will be a better one with the service anyways.", 
            "a great restaurant! have eaten here 10+ times and always great waiters,service & food.  4 of us went last night and ordered large <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>. it was not up to the normal unbelievable quality. the manager came over and told us, very nicely, that it was out of season and that was why it was frozen. we sent it back. 10 minutes later he had a platter of cold king crab sent to the table to make up for the problem. \nif you go ask if the crab is in season, if not, get the king crab. their steaks are great, the sides very large & good, and probably has the best <mark>Joe's Fried Chicken</mark> on the west coast.  key lime pie is a must.\ntry it, it is one of the top restaurants in vegas.", 
            "this place is amazing. bring your wallet!!!!!\n\nyou can make reservations at this one on opentable, something you can't even think about doing in the south beach location. this is not the same as joe's crab shack, they are light years apart. there are only 3 of these locations that i know about--miami, chicago, & vegas.\n\nthe roasted corn is by far my favorite side.  the <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark> to start is awesome. and believe it or not their <mark>Joe's Fried Chicken</mark> is off the chain.  other good sides are their potatoes and <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>.\n\nthey had fresh <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> 1.25 lb was $90, not cheap by any means but super good. great for groups!  great for dates. all the waiters are in tuxedos. joe's is on the first floor and there is a side sneaky valet if you know where to look that's right next to it.\n\nkey lime pie for dessert is a must!  but they have a banana one too that is just as good. get both why not! what's another $10 when you are going all in!\n\nmake sure you ask for extra lemons and mustard sauce.\n\nyou can thank me later.  oh and ps they are open for lunch too!",

            "still one of my favorite restaurants across the country & def in this city.  the one in miami does not take reservations this one does!   i get almost the same thing every time and every time i'm overjoyed! it never disappoints and the service is impeccable. \n\nthis is a place for sharing, if you are not a sharer maybe not for you.\n\nif it's your first time or you've been before here's my favorites:\n\n1) <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>- remember season is oct 15- may 15 (2 days before my birthday) so ordering them in this time frame will ensure optimum pleasure.  anytime else, they are frozen and while still good not great. joe's mustard sauce is infamous and amazing but keep in mind it's mayo based so opt for less than more. [see pix]\n2) roasted corn- amazing- simple plain with a touch of heat and lime\n3) <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>- oh lord this is not on the diet but you are eating shellfish so it's kinda ok, ish\n4) <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark>- dressing on the side for me. it's divine\n5) pretzel roll and or onion and cheese roll oh lordie\n6) potatoes i can do with or without\n7) <mark>Joe's Fried Chicken</mark>- yes i know, my friend is kosher, this is what he orders, it's damn near amazing, only reason i've ever even tried it\n8) <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>- about the same price as your first born but in the long run cheaper than a kid! [see pix]\n9) dessert- ice cold key lime pie is what they are known for but their havana one is knock your socks off good too.",

            "food was 3 stars, service was 1 star; so 2 stars it is! \n\nwe did not receive good service. if i am at a \"nice\" restaurant, i expect to be treated \"nicely.\" we thought our server was just having a bad day, until we watched her interact with other tables. she was very chipper and helpful to everyone else. i don't know if she treated us this way because we looked kind of scrubby and young? \n\nfood was meh. \n\nthey didn't have the large <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>. from some other low star reviews i'm understanding they often don't have them. please don't even put them on the menu then... also the lobster bisque was oddly sweet. i wanted the lobster hash i got in miami but the only thing they had that was similar was the big daddy hash (not on the menu - hash with onions bacon and cheese). it was okay. the <mark>Joe's Fried Chicken</mark> was also alright, but not worth twenty dollars. it's only seven dollars in miami and way better. \n\ndidn't get drinks because we were about to drive to la and kind of hungover. the only thing i like about joes vegas vs joes miami is that vegas has cocktails and liquor - miami only has wine. \n\ni wouldn't recommend this place. there are plenty of other better restaurants on the strip to blow your money at. but definitely check out the joes in miami if you ever can. my favorite restaurant ever",

            "i've been to the original joe's in miami dozens and dozens of times. this location is not the same, not even close. <mark>Joe's Fried Chicken</mark> was bland and flavorless. service was not good, to the point where we couldn't even get water refills even though the wirestaurant wasn't remotely busy. the <mark>Joe's <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark></mark> wasn't even chopped. read that last sentence again. yup.",

            "the best <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> ever! \n\nthis is it folks! when you're looking for a filet that is so good it speaks to your soul look no further - get it at joe's. i generally do not order <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> because they always seem to lack flavor. delmonico's is a prime example of an over priced bland filet. thank god for joe's that a sista can finally enjoy a figure friendly cut of steak that is out of this world. i ordered the lunch special and for $21.99 here's whatcha girl got: \n\npetite filet - awesome! \n\njenny's potatoes - not the greatest. i would never order this again. the <mark>Hashed Brown</mark> potatoes didn't look any better. they looked like an over-sized overcooked <mark><mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark></mark>. \n\ngrilled tomato - phenomenal. never had anything like this i'm my life. one slice of a grilled tomato covered with cream of spinach and then layered with baked cheese...don't knock it til you try it. \n\ntwo crab claws - my awesome waiter threw these in for free to ensure that i at least experienced the famous crab claws. he was honest about stating they were not in season. they were a bit frozen, but still okay. i was glad i didn't order them as my main course. \n\nkey lime pie - the bomb! the lunch special actually came with banana cream pie...once again my waiter went over and beyond to hook me up. \n\nthe service here is the best. everyone is there to ensure you leave extremely happy. my server went as far as to squeeze lemon juice over my hands prior to handing me a hot towel...omg!!! \n\noverall, this place was outstanding!. i would highly recommend.", 
            "surf and turf ftw!!!\n\ni love how you can pretty much create your own dish with the waiter. i got me some surf and turf with 3 large <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> and a petite filet. the filet was good, not great. the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> is wonderful and fresh, but what really makes it is the mustard sauce it's served with.\n\nwe also had:\n- oysters - tiny tiny oysters but really good. i could eat them all day.\n- lyonnaise potatoes - bomb! it's a big pile of <mark>Hashed Brown</mark> topped with delicious caramelized onions.\n- <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> - yum yum!\n- broccolini - thumbs up!", 
            "still love this place! \n\na must stop anytime i'm in vegas. this time i visited for lunch and went with their joe's classic w/ <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>. a yummy 3- course meal that comes with 5 large <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws, <mark>Hashed Brown</mark> potatoes and a slice of key lime pie all for $26! \ncrab claws- 5 large pre-cracked <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws, sweet and tender meat conveniently pre-cracked for your dining ease :)\n<mark>Hashed Brown</mark> potatoes- a large serving of their delicious hashed/s<mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> with a wonderfully crispy outer crust. (it came with a meal for one, but is definitely enough for 2-3 people!)\nkey lime pie- yum-my!!! i've never had key lime pie, but now...i'm a fan!! cool and creamy, tangy and tart with my favorite graham cracker crust. this pie made me :)\nwhile we had more than enough food, the <mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark> fries sounded good so we added an order of those as well. a huge plate of crispy fries topped with a cinnamon/salt mixture. a nice sweet and salty combo!\n\nour server was super sweet. food came out quickly, she checked on us regularly and drinks stayed full. \n\ni'll be back!", 
            "flexible dress code.  sure they say \"business casual\" but they are absolutely fine with shorts in the dining room during dinner.  two thumbs up for this since when we visited (week of july 9th) the temps were 115-116 during the day cooling down to 95-100 in the evenings!\n\nthe drinks are pricey... $15 for a cranberry & grey goose... but they're stiff!!!  the food is rather reasonably priced for a rather high end seafood/steak restaurant in las vegas.  \n\ni had the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> appetizer, my husband had the <mark>Joe's Cole Slaw</mark>, we split the 12oz filet and the big daddy's potatoes (not on the menu so i'll describe... they're <mark>Hashed Brown</mark> sitting on a bed of caramelized onions then topped with loaded <mark><mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark></mark> innards... must must must try!!!).  for dessert i had the havana dream pie (white cake with a custard filling and an uber-thick drizzle of dulce de leche on top... again, a must must must try!!!)  and hubby had the peppermint ice cream with hot fudge. \n\nour food total was under $90 which is not expensive for the quantity and quality of food.  it was my birthday so they brought out a complimentary brick of flourless chocolate cake topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream which is then topped with hot fudge.  this was very tasty however since we had each ordered a dessert it was totally too much / ott and we would have preferred they either comp the dessert i ordered or told me they'd be bringing that out so i would not have ordered something else.   \n\nservice was excellent... from the bar tender to the waitress to the maitre d.  no complaints whatsoever and we'll certainly be back!", 
            "i love joe's. i was here last year on a business dinner and came back around for a repeat with a girlfriend from work. the service and food are both wonderful. obviously, we came for surf n' turf and we both left stuffed and happy (and, for being on the las vegas strip, the prices are the same as you would find at any higher-end steakhouse - nothing on the menu seemed outrageously inflated).\n\nour charming server (\"steven\" or \"stephen\", he-of-the-awesome-bulgarian-accent) suggested we start off with the <mark>Shrimp De Jonghe</mark> appetizer (i.e., a fancy name for scampi): six plump shrimps, basting in a super-garlicky sauce. delicious. joe's also provides a very ample basket of mixed breads (soft pretzel, dinner roll + a savory bacon-y ciabatta that my friend loved). \n\nwe both ordered surf 'n turf: petit <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> (i chose the alaskan king crab and my friend had lobster). we also split an order of the <mark>Hashed Brown</mark> potato and the grilled asparagus with romesco sauce. my steak was a little overcooked in the interior and a little ash-y charred on the outside. however, the <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> were delicious (and already split down the middle for me), so i flaked and dunked those bad boys in the clarified butter.\n\nthe presentation and texture of the <mark>Hashed Brown</mark> was awesome: a golden brown and crusty mound of fluffy-on-the-inside starchy goodness (but a little lacking in flavor). but the grilled asparagus was absolutely delicious (and i don't really like asparagus that much), and the cherry tomato romesco sauce was truly the star of the dish (we both loved the delectable tomatoes - sweet, chunky, delicious). the generously-portioned sides could easily be shared between 2-3 people.\n\nwe finished off with two desserts (we were both veritable piggies that night): wedges of lemony cream cheese pie with strawberry sauce (my friend's favorite), and fudge pie (my favorite!). they were both about as good as dessert can get.\n\nto reiterate, our server was excellent: he looked like a possible secret agent assassin, had a fabulous accent, provided attentive (but not smothering) service with a flourish (he snapped our photo), and we never felt rushed or like a nuisance (and we lingered over dinner for close to three hours, chatting, sipping and and forking around - hehe). service nailed a 5-star rating as perfect.", 
            "making a reservation here was easy and we got a table for 9. when we got there we were directed towards the back and then led into a room. we had a whole area to ourselves with a tv. it was pretty cool. our server gave us recommendations and told us we could share most of the sides. we ended up mostly getting steaks and a sole. we also got an order of the crab claws and king crab. the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws were really juicy and the <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> were big. pretty expensive for the portion but it's worth it. \nthe <mark>Steak Tartare</mark> had a very tart flavor from the capers and came with toasted croutons. it was a generous size and tasted good. \nthe <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> was ok. was pretty standard. \nfor the sides we got cauliflower, broccolini, brussel sprouts, <mark>Hashed Brown</mark>, and mac and cheese. the vegetable portions were pretty small. we could each only get one piece of each. the mac and cheese was okay. i really liked the <mark>Hashed Brown</mark> though. some of my group thought it was too salty but i enjoyed the flavor.", 
            "back we went to introduce a california couple to joe's seafood prime steak & <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> in the forum shops, with its classic clubby steak house chi-town or nyc ambiance punctuated by black tux-clad waiters, white tablecloths, and black leather booths, coupled with a dash of miami elegance underscored by black-clawed <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> legs.  this elegant restaurant even has a coat check service!\n\ni began with a meaty <mark>Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail</mark> and very good <mark>Manhattan Clam Chowder</mark>, followed by an excellent <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> with anchovies quickly brought forward when i requested them.  this time i concentrated on the sea, and enjoyed an entree of delicious steamed <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> along with some of diane's poached jumbo lobster dipped in drawn butter.  a large side of juicy yet crispy <mark>Hashed Brown</mark> potatoes was particularly noteworthy (and no doubt fattening!).   \n\nservice was very good except diane received unwanted char on her filet and was erroneously told that no vegetables or onions were included in the <mark>Crab Bisque</mark> after she asked for no char and vegetable-free soup.  our guests seemed pleased with the food, service, and ambiance, as was i.\n\nonce again 4 stars overall, and this time almost 5!"

            "came here with my gf when i was flown in for an interview.  i heard about joe's on food network and knew there was one in miami.   to my surprise my friend karen told me that there was one in las vegas.  so being the foodie that i am, i had to check it out.  joe's decor is reminds me of a nyc steakhouse. dark wood tables, chairs and floors.  the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> are definitely the star in this place, hence the name.  the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> come pre-cracked so the all the hard work is done for you.  the meat is sweat and very flavorful and pairing it with the honey mustard sauce is genius!  i had the scallops and the gf have the crab stuffed sole.  the scallops came out alone with a little green garnish and a little greasy.  for me, it was too plain.  i needed something to go along with the scallops, maybe a mixed green salad wtih balsamic vinegrette.  the crab stuffed sole was great, especially when dipped in the sauce.  the onion rings were good if you like them thin and stringy.  the <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> with the fontina cheese is to die for!  granted were on a low-carb diet, but you have to try it.  you only live once!  as you can tell, we obviously weren't able to finish the meal so we brown-bagged it home.  what a night at joe's!\n\ni've been back many times and love their <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>. i love this place!", 
            "i ate here with my family and future in-laws for a nice new year's eve dinner. i think it was a great place to spend the last night of 2008. as in most restaurants they start with some bread. they give different varieties of bread, which is all really good. i ordered <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> with <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark>, which was a new year's eve special. i was worried that the <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> were going to be small, but they were huge! i like big servings so i was so happy that the portions were very good. i tried a little bit of everyone's food and i can't complain, everything was good! i loved the stone <mark>Crab Bisque</mark> and <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>.", 
            "my friend had her lunch wedding reception at joe's this past weekend. she rented out the private area on the second floor of this restaurant. it was very nicely decorated. appetizers consisted of mushrooms(sooo juicy and delicious), crab dip (omg to die for), variety of bread (yummy) and calamari. i ordered the swordfish, string beans and <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>. the swordfish melted in my mouth. i normally don't eat fish, but this was so delicious. the the potatoes had bread crumbs on it which made it different from regular <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>. bf ordered the <mark>Salmon Au Poivre</mark> i had a lil bit and it was too fishy for my taste. i will definitely be coming back! maybe try some steak or <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> next time around.", 
            "a friend told me that this place was a must eat next time i was in vegas. \n\nafter getting a little lost walking around the forum shops at caesar's (30 mins late to our reservation)... we were ready to try these famous <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> from miami. i don't like eating seafood as the main course because it's very light and from my reviews... you should know that i like to feel heavy and full after i eat. so... i couldn't resist the bone-in-ribeye (surprise...  surprise). this was the third time i've eating the ribeye in the past 2 weeks (i'm seeing the doctor next week... might as well hear bad news since i'm expecting it). since i had mastro's (see my review) last week... i had it fresh in my mind and could say that this steak was not quite at its level. but overall it was a very good steak. \n\nmy wife had the large <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> (5 claws). of course i snagged a couple of them. very good i must say but was a little disappointed with the size. you only get the claws... that's it. i wanted the whole freakin thing. \n\nfor our sides we got jennie's special potatoes and sweet corn. the jennie's special potatoes were twice baked <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> with garlic, parmesan cheese and asiago cheese. i loved the creaminess of the potatoes and then the crunch of the parmesan and asiago... definitely one of the highlights. the sweet corn was good but regretted not getting the creamed corn.  \n\na friend of mine got the <mark>Joe's Fried Chicken</mark> and since <mark>Joe's Fried Chicken</mark> is a top 5 food of mine i had to try it. the chicken was very moist inside and crispy on the outside but the crust (skin) lacked a little flavor. maybe <mark>Joe's Fried Chicken</mark> and fine dining don't go together?", 
            "do you see the drool dripping down my face?  that's because i'm thinking about joe's.  we had our wedding reception at joe's in the private gigi room upstairs- beautiful, and worth every penny.  my husband's family comes from dungeness crab fisherman stock, and so are crab snobs, they loved the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> (only after we brought and extra order to their table).  the desserts are to die for.  the <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> are insanely delicious.  the salad is even to die for.  also, ask for the mustard sauce when you first sit down because the pretzel bread is great to dip in it.",

            "we came here on a saturday night in december, a party of 6.  we made reservations for 5 since the only other time was at 9.  it ended up working out well because we had a nice relaxing long dinner before returning back to our hotel for a nap and getting ready for the evening.\n\ndecor: 4.5/5  clean, beautiful dark wood paneled walls.  we sat in the back circular room, the seats and tables were arranged a little strangely in that i noticed later the seats weren't evenly distributed (minor) but not in a logical way.  the seats were up against other seats from adjacent tables.  poor planning and made getting in and out difficult.\n\nservice:  5/5 service here was fantastic.  the waiters (i didn't see any waitresses) were all in tuxes and very professional but more importantly friendly.  plates and dishes were cleared promptly and the waiter chatted and joked with us.  amusingly enough, we stopped a bus boy (who was also dressed in a tux) if he could bring us a jus -- he either misheard or didn't know what it was, but he did his best and we were brought some other sauce.  (some white gravy stuff that turned out to be pretty tasty)\n\nsurf: 4/5 i didn't try the oysters but the table seemed to enjoy them.  the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> pretty much just tasted like crab to me.  the mustard sauce didn't have much flavor in my opinion.  i was underwhelmed by the crab but it was neat trying them.  i wouldn't feel the need to order that again.\n\nturf: 4/5 the meat was good.  4 of us ordered the petite <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> -- strangely i think only one of us finished it.  i guess we got filled up with the delicious bread (5/5!).  the meat itself wasn't bad but not amazing.  i think it was worth the money but sadly not memorable.  the fresh horseradish was not very spicy, their special mix of spices/seasoning was tasty (but very salty)\n\nside dishes: 3/5 we tried a few of their dishes.  ranked from least favorite to favorite.  1) the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> could have been entirely skipped.  it was flavorless.  2) the mac n cheese was ok, they used spiral noodles.  if you're in the mood for mac n cheese you'd probably be satisfied, but it also wasn't memorable.  then again i think i've started expecting bacon and maybe gouda in my mac n cheese now... 3.  <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  the crusty crumbly bits on top were yummy and the melted cheese inside was great.  it was strangely dry though.  my idea <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> have chunks of firm potato and then soft creamy potatoes in it... this was just a little dry but great flavor.  worth ordering  4) the sweet corn was surprisingly great!  i usually like corn plain, but this was really delicious.  i think we were all surprised with how good this was -- that was the only side plate that was entirely finished.\n\ndessert 5/5: we ordered the key lime pie.  all their desserts are made fresh daily and since this is originally a florida restaurant -- we decided on the key lime pie.  it was thankfully not green and was very light and at least for me, the best key lime pie i've ever had.  i finished most of the pie even though i couldn't even finish my steak (and lemme tell ya what a steak person i am!).  the coffee was also excellent according to my friends, but i think starbucks is good so i wouldn't know.  sorry!\n\noverall, it was a great meal.  if i went back to vegas i'd probably want to try a different restaurant but i certainly recommend this place to anyone who hasn't been there.  the meal ended up being a final cost of  $78/person (that includes a $40 bottle wine). \n\ni'd recommend coming here with at least 4 people (we had 6) since the side dishes family style.  apparently, you can get joe's delivered to your house.",

(btw, there were other children dining there, i tried to find some logical reason for this crap) was is a racist thing? heck if i know, it doesn't matter what it was, it was wrong and the end result: because of that, even if i love their food, they get a 1-star rating. this situation really upset me, i cringe every time we go there and i see that db.\n\nneedless to say, this particular night, we ate at another restaurant and it goes to show, bad service can leave a bad impression that can last for years.", 
            "the food here is some of the best i've had.  if you ever see the paremsan-crusted halibut on the specials menu, i insist you get it.  it was one of the best fish dishes i've ever eaten.  the <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> are so good, and the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> app with the mustard sauce, yum yum yum.  the only reason i am knocking off one star is because our server really rushed us.  she was super-efficient at her job which is great but this isn't a diner so she really needed to slow her roll.  she tried several times to take away plates before we were finished and also kept coming back for the check when we hadn't even looked at it yet.  if it was a little more leisurely, i'd give them 5 stars.  i would definitely come there again, though, and would recommend to anyone.", 
            "we have been going to joe's for years and the service and food is normally outstanding.  our last experience was extremely rushed , as they had us served and what seemed to feel like pushing us out the door in under an hour.  we had an 8:30 reservation so tables were clearing out as we were dining, so there should of been no need for the rush.  the food quality seemed to decline since our last visit also, the jeenies <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> were dry, and the asparagus was undercooked.  although i did have the bone-in filet, and it was perfect.  by 8:30 they were sold out of the large claws so we ordered the selects, and they were extremely tough, my suggestion is if that the large claws are sold out, save your money and order something else.  i was very disappointed in our last visit to joe's.", 
            "the steak i had here was melt-in-my-mouth perfection.  sooo good!  the steak seasoning that they serve with it enhanced a perfect steak even more.  yum.  what a good steak!\n\nthe sides were very good - the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> gets 5 stars and jenny's <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> were nice.  eat them while they're hot, though.\n\nthe banana cream pie was so so yummy.  we all shared it.\n\nmy friend wasn't crazy about her <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark>.  everyone else at the table loved their meal.  the salads were beautiful and fresh.\n\nour waitress was excellent and we were sat immediately (we had a reservation) upon arrival.\n\nmy only complaint was that opentable emailed me to ask why i didn't show up for my reservation - which i had.  ah well.", 
            "we decided to come here for new years eve and since i procrastinated i didn't make reservations till two days before nye. i couldn't find an open reservation on open table so i ended up calling instead. the lady was able to fit me in for a 530pm reservation. this worked out for us, since the strip was closing down for all of the new year's party people. \nwe were seated immediately and greeted by our server, ralph. drink orders were taken and brought to us right away. ralph informed us of the specials of the day and how we should order the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>....even numbers since there's two of us. \nwe started off with the \"select\" <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>. (there are 3 different sizes and this one came in a quantity of 6). i've never ever had <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> before and it wasn't what i imagined in my head. anyhow, they came cracked and the best part was the mustard sauce. i think that is what did it for me, the dipping sauce...deliciousness!\ni ordered the <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> with <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> and the fianc\\u00e9 ordered the bone in rib eye. at first glance, i thought that my entree would not be enough for me, but it definitely was. i was full after eating half of my filet and two of my <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>. the fianc\\u00e9 really enjoyed his steak and i mean really. it was gone before i knew it and i got to try a bite and was quite impressed with it as well.  \nfor a side we ordered \"<mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>!\" and for those of you that don't know, i have this lust/love for potatoes! these were spectacular!!!!!!!!! cheesy with garlic bread bites and creamy potatoes....i was in heaven. \nwe ended the night with the havana pie and the fudge pie. we were able to order half a slice so we could try both, thanks to ralph for the suggestion. i was in love with the havana dream and just thinking about it makes me want to return for some more! the havana pie was some kind of custard cake with condensed milk and caramel.  the fudge pie was ok, but i generally like desserts that are not as rich. \noverall, i love joe's and i hope we can return in the future....i didn't say near, because we did spend quite a few benjamin's. =)", 
            "wow! this place is the best, i mean the best! the bacon wrapped scallops are too die for!!!!! the <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> are yummy and full of crab. the steaks are tender and full of flavor!!!! i went with a party of 5 and everyone loved their food! this place is a must go for seafood lovers! oh, the sides were delish too, they are big enough to share! the <mark>Fried Asparagus</mark> and jennies <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> are yummmo!!!  dont forget the havanna dream pie!!!", 
            "i made the mistake of eating <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> the previous night, so i was pretty much crabbed out by the time we arrived at joe's.\n\ni rallied and was able to order a <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> appetizer, yay, though it wasn't as good as the previous evening's <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> appetizer---boo.\n\ni ended up with the mahi mahi and it was excellent.  the sides that we went with were the <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> and the asparagus, the <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> were bland, one tablemate was pouring his clarified butter leftover from his lobster onto the potatoes and the rest of us were adding salt & pepper.  one person suggested that maybe they were instant.  i don't know about going that far, but they were blah.\n\nour waiter definitely had an attitude, just a \"holier than though\" type of person so it wasn't a great dining experience overall, too bad.  \n\nwe had dessert too, but i've completely forgotten what it was.  oh, and we were charged for the wrong glasses of scotch that we had at the end of the meal.  when you're paying $400 for dinner what's $4, but still---get it right.", 
            "we were sick of being in the mirage and right next door is the forum, so we hit this place.\n\nvery nice place, great ambiance, wonderful service.  our server was outstanding.\n\nhere's what i had:\n<mark>Caesar Salad</mark> - solid\nlobster bisque - crazy good\n<mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> and crab - very good.  not the best i've had, but very yummy!\n\nthe sides are family style:\n<mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> - crazy good\nhash browns - very good\ngrilled asparagus - good\ngrilled corn - crazy good\n\ni'm not a dessert person, but i was feeling like i needed just a bit more, so i ordered the apple pie ala mode.  it may have been the best apple pie i've ever had!!!", 
            "a table for 9 please.....i made reservations a couple of weeks in advance and we were seated promptly when everyone showed up. it was my aunt's bday and since i'm a \"foodie\" i picked joe's. after i made my first appearance here on new years, i hoped this place would meet the same expectations. unfortunately it didn't.....\n\nfood: 4.25 stars\nservice: 2.5 stars\noverall: 3.75 stars\n\nyes, we started off with 14 \"select\" <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>! 14 of them!!!! (120 dollars worth of <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>). this was delicious like i remembered.....and that mustardy sauce is so yummy that i could dip anything in it! we also tried the rockefeller oyster which i was not that impressed. i didn't taste an oysters what so ever.....\n\ni ordered the bone in ribeye this time and i shared it with my dad. i had it cooked medium. well, last time i had gotten the <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> and let's just say i was a bit disappointed with the steak. it was dry in some parts (basically well done) and it wasn't medium at all. luckily my dad rather have the steak well done then bloody, so it worked out in his favor. however, i was a really really disappointed about my steak. the <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> made up for it though as well as the garlic spinach. i didn't get to try the sweet corn, but my aunt thought it was really delicious!\n\nmy other foodmates ordered the <mark>Joe's Fried Chicken</mark> (heard it wasn't as awesome as kfc's chicken, but he is a teenager), <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> (they said it wasn't fishy at all and it was really fresh), liver (my aunt enjoyed it), fish and chips (not sure how my brother felt about it, but he ate most of it), shrimp scampi (my other brother ate all of it so it must have been good or he was just hungry) and my lil sister had the cheeseburger kids meal (pretty decent sized). overall, i think the food was enjoyable, minus my <mark>Dry Aged Chopped Steak</mark>.\n\nnow the service....i understand that when there are large parties gratuity is added on automatically. since its a \"nicer\" establishment, you would expect it to have awesome service. maybe it was just our server because last time we had an awesome server, but at the same time, when we come in and spend 700 plus dollars i think we deserve some good attention. it's not that we were getting horrible service, we just were neglected. i watched our server attend to other tables (smaller tables) attentively and with us, it just wasn't there. after my dad signed the credit card slip, the server picked up the tab right away. in my opinion, i think that is a bit rude....why can't they wait the 5 minutes it takes for us to get up and leave and then pick up our tab? maybe i'm just a cranky woman today, but it doesn't mean i don't love joe's...i just would ask for a different server. \n\noverall, the havana dream pie is to die for and i love their <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>. next time i will stick with the seafood and hopefully my experience will be a better one with the service anyways.", 
            "the only reason i didn't give this an outstanding rating was bc we ordered the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> appetizer and we were not impressed. at $23 there was barely any meat and waste of money. other than that the food was excellent. my husband ordered the bone in filet which was probably one of the best steaks we have ever had. i ordered the potato crusted flounder (i think it was a special that night) and that was very good. we got the <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> as a side which were very good but didn't compare to the pan roasted corn our server brought us complimentary; it was out of this world. next time i would skip the appetizer and potatoes as the portions are large. we didn't have any room left for dessert unfortunately bc they sounded delicious.", 
            "all i can think about from my vegas trip is joe's seafood!! it wasn't about all the partying, drinking, gambling or any of that it was just how darn good this place was !! \n\nthe night was started off by looking for a seafood place to go and eat at. mainly looking through yelp to find one. i didn't really want to get a buffet but i wanted a nice classy sit down and order your food ! i got what i wanted and called joe's seafood up. \n\nthey said they could take us in a few hours and indeed they did. while walking through this place you will notice that every server is wearing a nice black suit and it seems formal but hey we are in vegas and i saw many patrons wearing just flip flops and t shirts. \n\ni did call about the dress code but they said they do prefer business but doesn't matter if you are dressed in casual. so off we went on this find adventure!!\n\nthe order: \n<mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark>- it is one large <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> which is cooked or pan fried lightly for a little bit of crisp on the outside. the inside is nice and soft with a hint of mayo. the taste is amazing and i would say this is on my top 10 list of <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark>. \n\n<mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claw- had two of these and they are served chilled with a wedge of lemon but you really don't need anything. just try it without and you can tell that this is really good crab. the flavor is nice and and amazing. i wish i could just eat more...but we wanted to try everything!\n\n<mark>Crab Bisque</mark>- not my favorite thing on my meal. i didn't even finish it because it just had a very bad buttery flavor. it tasted way too fatty for me and i just didn't like it. \n\nparmesan crusted halibut- need to order this, the crust was just perfect amount of crispiness in each bite with the fish. also the fish was not at all dry and it just had an awesome flavor. love love it!! must order if you come here. \n\nhalf order of <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>- on the top of it was some very crispy cheese topping. i can tell you the half order was huge. we didn't even finish most of the sides because we were just stuffed with food!!\n\nhalf order of mac and cheese- i see mushrooms yeah !! :) i liked how the texture of the pasta is and also how they did the mac and cheese, it is defiantly a different style. not from kraft and it does taste a whole lot better. \n\noverall the meal was perfect, the server that we had was a very nice lady and she didn't hassle us about what we ordered or if we needed to order more. i know some places might be a little bit on the mad side if you only order one meal but seriously..i can't eat a whole lot and the portion size is out of this world!! most places feed you a very large size and this is one of them!! everything was large and good !! the only thing i would suggest not getting is the <mark>Crab Bisque</mark>. \n\nbut my experience at joe's has made me want to come to vegas more often to get a nice meal in!! see you soon joe!", 
            "this is another stop on my \"must see vegas\" list. i really can't say enough good things about this place. if you were like me and had never even heard of <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> before, then you have to come here. if you're a little more budget-conscious (if such a thing exists in vegas) go for lunch because they are usually running great lunch specials where you can get <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>, they're melt-in-your-mouth potatoes, a side of tomato and a dessert for a very reasonable price. if you want to splurge, check it out for dinner. both times it has a great swanky yet casual vibe. but for either one...be sure to make a reservation.\n\ni've been going for about 3 years now and it's always been the same host standing at the front podium. he even recognizes my mom and i when we come. the waitstaff has been the same for a long time too which is nice when you come back to a place annually and you see the same friendly faces.\n\ni recommend the large <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> (it's a bit of an effort to eat i warn you). but once you get inside those shells, the buttery deliciousness that awaits will make it all worthwhile. order any one of their many kinds of <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>...there's nothing like them. and for dessert, everything is good but the key lime pie...wow! it's the perfect refreshing finisher on a hot summer vegas day too.\n\nnow if you'll excuse me, i'm getting in my car to take off for vegas as i just made myself desperately starving for some joe's <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>!", 
            "wow, delicious. our group decided to split everything including: <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>, <mark>Crab Bisque</mark>, <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> (we liked that better than the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>), corn, <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>, broccoli and steak and everything was delicious. they prepare all of the crab for you so all you have to do is scoop the meat out. delicious, definitely on the pricey side, great service.", 
            "i was looking forward to finally trying joe's <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>. i have seen on it tv shows, heard great things from others who have been there, and thought i was going to be in for a treat. unfortunately i was sadly mistaken. i went with the big <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> and we had the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, pan roasted sweet corn, <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>, lyonnaise with some <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark>. the oysters and sides were good and so was the wine (rioja) but the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> was a flop. now maybe it was because they weren't in season and if that was the case i will research and try them again when they are in season. what will make me seek out a different restaurant to try them in was the service. we had two tables with a total of 15 people. for the two tables we were given one waitress who was very slow. forget about the fact it took forever for us to get a drink order in, it took even longer for the drinks to finally arrive. overall it was a disappointing experience at what should have been an excellent restaurant. my company is in vegas twice a year and i was hoping this would be a restaurant that would be on our annual list, but it was so bad we skipped dessert and had cigars and after dinner drinks somewhere else instead.", 
            "restaurant week is in full swing, and we are now 4 for 4! last night diane and i dined at joe's, and it was another great meal! \n\nwe arrived for dinner on thursday at 5:45 p.m., 15 minutes before our reservation, and were seated right away. by 7:00 p.m. the main dining room was almost completely full. we had never been here before, and i was a bit intimidated at first as i approached the high reception stand where a man in a jet black tuxedo with jet black hair towered over me. but he was friendly and professional, as were all of the other black bow-tied, black tuxedoed, and white aproned restaurant personnel we encountered during our visit. i had only seen the bar and mall dining areas before, and thought they comprised the whole restaurant. not so! we were ushered through a curtain to a very elegant dining room that had decorative lights on the wall and a decidedly new york city clubby steakhouse feel to it, with much dark wood and brown leather, white tablecloths, and several tables surrounded by comfortable booths along both main walls. it was very sophisticated but not pretentious, as were the several servers who moved briskly about like busy bees. it was interesting just watching them in action. \n\nwe went with the restaurant week menu, but augmented it with a two-claw appetizer of <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws and king crab mac & cheese. i always wondered whether i would be able to eat <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws because their ends look like elongated fingers painted with black nail polish. but it was easier than i thought, since that part of the claw is left alone. the claws arrived from the kitchen already largely crushed by a mallet, so it was not that difficult to pry apart the porcelain-like shell casing to get at the meat underneath. but there seemed to be less meat than found in alaskan crab claws. the thin morsels of crab meat tasted fine either dipped in drawn butter, the mild mustard sauce that was provided, or just eaten straight out of <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark>. yet i noted that they were not as sweet or satisfying as king crab claw meat. and, at about $22 for two claws, they were not cheap. so, for me, it is now \"been there, done that!\" but i will definitely return to joe's for its other fine fare, including lobster and king crab. \n\nalthough this was hardly needed, an assortment of bread products tasted good with the soft pats of butter provided. and a bowl of stone <mark>Crab Bisque</mark> was sweet and smooth--simply exquisite in taste and texture. i liked it better without the garnish of tiny cuts of carrots and zucchini that we asked to have served on the side, since diane's yelp nickname is \"veggie hater\" for a reason. but i picked the delicate morsels of <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> out of the garnish and tossed them in the wonderful soup, which avoided an inexcusable wasting of fine crab particles and made the soup even tastier. \n\na large <mark>Joe's <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark></mark> of lettuce, tomato, onion, and <mark>Chopped Lettuce, Tomato, Onion & Blue Cheese</mark> crumbles with a fine vinaigrette dressing was quite satisfying. my 8 oz. <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> with drinkable bearnaise sauce was simply divine. it was well seasoned on top, perfectly medium rare inside as ordered, and did literally melt in my mouth. i liked it better without the house seasonings, which i tried on a couple of bites. it was one of those steaks that kept getting better and better as slices of beef moved toward the rarer center. \n\ndiane's moist halibut had a tasty parmesan crust, augmented by a buerre blanc-like sauce that was provided. it was notably flatter than many servings of halibut experienced at other restaurants, but of ample portion size. the king crab mac & cheese, made with white shells, hunks of king crab, and bechamel sauce, tasted good, but was not nearly as noteworthy as the sumptuous <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> that were covered with a mix of baked asiago cheese and breadcrumbs. and, few lobster chunks were included in the dish. <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> was creamy as billed, and quite tasty. \n\njoe's signature key lime pie arrived ultra cold and almost frozen. after trying one bite, i let my slice sit for 5 minutes, and then it was just right, having lost its icy taste. it was very tart and delicious. \n\npeppermint gelato with hot fudge was not as memorable as the key lime pie, but the melted hot fudge was delicious. it had the strong taste of peppermint, and every now and then surprised the palate with peppermint candy chips. i would have preferred this dish during the christmas season! \n\nall in all, a wonderful five-star meal!", 
            "joe's seafood...why had i not dined with you sooner?  is it because i discounted you for being at the end of the caesar's forum shops?  or is it because i had no idea what <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> was?  whatever the case may be, i'm sorry it took me so long to find you.\n\nwe started off with the appetizer called the \"2nd mortgage\" and it was awesome. lobster, king crab, peeled shrimp and a seafood ceviche.  oh how i love thee.  next came our stone aged filet and <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> (medium sized) entrees accompanied by <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> topped with an asiago cheese crust.  heavenly!  even the asparagus was cooked to perfection.  \n\nthe service was superb and this is going to be on my must come back to when i'm in vegas list!  the atmosphere is a little crowded and noisy but who cares about that when the food is so delicious!", 
            "i didn't find anything too special about the place.  it's like any steakhouse i feel like.  i do enjoy the idea of having shared sides but my steak was a-ok.  we had the <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> as appetizers which was meaty with crabs and raw oysters were fresh.  i had the <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> and like i said, nothing too special.  we all shared the garlic <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>, and the roasted corn.  i liked the corn the most. that's all there was to it really.", 
            "the first time we walked up we all thought it was this simple bar and grill place.  we made reservation thru our concierge @ vdara. when we get there we tell the host that we have reservation and they escort us to the back, behind the curtain and bam!! we get hit with the elite and fancy side of joe's. wow, fancy shemancy... love it.  so we sit down wit at least 3 -4 server per table and one took our orders.  we had to try the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> of course and the 20 oz rib eyes. we also order some lobster bisque... oh man i only ordered a cup of this stuff but i could've eaten a gallon of it. so rich and flavorful each bite had tons of lobster meat..yumm-mo!! the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> came out next and we each got 2....pretty damn expensive but it was a great piece of claw. super fresh and amazingly easy to get every single piece of meat.  not sure if i would get this again since it was about $47 for 2 claws.... =p  either way once in a lifetime type of deal for all of us.  \nour main entrees came next...i ordered the 20 oz rib eye medium well and my wife ordered the veal.  oh man the rib eye was huge!! didn't have to put much effort in cutting that bad boy.  the taste was perfect no a1 or sauce or anything.  loved it my wife's veal was super tender and tasted great. the veal was breaded and had a great flavor and crunchiness to it.  our friend got the pound of <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>.. oh man those were great.. i wish they had that and a small side of rib eye.  hint hint!! they even cut open every single crab leg.  fancchee!!  we also ordered our sides, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, garlic <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>, and roasted corn.  all were fantastic..we found out if you mix all three it creates complete happiness in your mouth. hahaha  \nalthough we were stuffed i wanted to order some dessert for everyone.  so we shared some banana foster cake and some chiffon type cake. both were so good and ended our night perfectly.  great way to end our vegas trip!!   for all 7 of us the bill was only $600ish.. so not bad.  great service and great food! must try guys!!",

            "went here with the hubby on tuesday night last week, and dinner was wonderful! i am a huge seafood lover, and this is probably one of the best seafood places i've had in ca or nv.  the food is fresh and very good, though a bit pricey.\n\nit's located at the very end of the forum shops at caesar's palace on the bottom/street level.  if you are coming from caesar's, it'll be in the right wing at the very end.  you'll need to take the escalator down one level.  \n\ni tried to make a reservation the day before on open table, but nothing was available for the entire evening for even just 2 people.\n\nso i called to ask what the wait would be for 2 people w/o reservations.  they said they don't like to give estimates on the phone because the wait times can change so quickly.  so i asked them what the average wait time would be overall, and they said anywhere from 10 - 45 minutes.\n\nso we walked over there to do a walk-in to see if they could accommodate.  at first, we got there at 6:45 pm and they told us it would be a 45 min wait.  but seeing there weren't a lot of people waiting around, we walked back up to check in on the wait at 7:05, and they were able to seat us at that time.  so our wait was just 20 minutes.\n\nsince i'm from so cal, i can get <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> pretty easily at the fisherman's wharf in redondo beach or even at 99 ranch supermarket.  they are fairly cheap to buy whole (santa barbara <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> are about $5/lb depending on the season), and the wharf or supermarket will steam them for free for you.  so that's why i didn't get <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> at joe's.  but if you haven't had <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> before, you should definitely get them because they are probably one of my favorite types of crab to eat (and i've had all kinds).  they are meaty, easy to break because of the stone-like shell, and have a sweet flavor.  \n\nhalf-dozen oysters (1 order):\n- i forgot what kind they were, but they were delicious.  even my husband who isn't a fan of oysters liked these.  i think what really made it good was their fresh tasting vinegar sauce that we used with it.  the oysters were very fresh tasting with no fishy taste.  i could've probably eaten a whole dozen by myself easily.\n\nfisherman's platter - grilled:\n- i got this and loved it.  it was a fair amount of food, though not a whole lot.  the server told me ahead of time when i asked how big the plate was that the amount of seafood added up to about 8 oz - the size of fish that they would give you on a fish plate.  with the mashed potato side we got, it was definitely enough food.  my husband tasted the scallops and remarked that they were probably some of the best he's ever had.  the seafood was very fresh, grilled with butter and maybe a bit of parsley and a bit of seasoning.  the shrimp were big and crunchy.  the squid pieces didn't taste rubbery or fishy.  the flavor was overall very good.  i would definitely get this dish again.  \n\nlobster-stuffed sole:\nmy husband got this and loved it.  in fact, i was debating getting this in the beginning, and upon tasting it was kinda wishing that i had.  the sauce was like a hollandaise sauce, but not as heavy.  the fish was very tender and the sauce with the lobster was really good.  \n\n<mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>:\nthese were special <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> that were very good!  they had a crunchy, cheese bread crumb type topping on them that was amazing.  the combination of the <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> with the crunchy topping was absolutely delicious.  it went perfectly with our meal, and i would definitely get these again.  i don't think i've run into any other place that makes their <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> like this.  very good and filling!\n\noverall, this is a great seafood place.  if there was one of these places in so cal, i would probably frequent it for most special occasions.  it's a bit pricey, but well worth it if you're wanting a nice good meal.  the service was great and the food was great.  the only thing was that we were seated at a table near the bar and there was a huge group of like 20 people that came in and were standing around by the bar (and hence our table).  our poor server had to squeeze by them each time she walked over to us.  so it got pretty loud in there, though we were still able to enjoy our food.", 
            "this is as good as it gets! i remember the time a few years back when i came in to this steakhouse and asked them what are <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>?!? the server went to describe these succulent <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> unlike any i've had before, cooked and served cold with mustard sauce....perfect! now i love seafood and this was simply amazing.\n\ni come to vegas from time to time and i always look forward to eating at joe's. sure they make great steaks, after all it is a steakhouse but these <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> are to die for! pair it with a martini (sapphire straight up with olives always hits the spot!), white wine, sides of jennys <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, green beans almondine. you can't go wrong!\n\nservers are great and attentive. layout of the restaurant is classy with a nice vibe to it. there is a back area for dinner reservations but i like sitting in the patio (see and be seen!) as well as the bar area. even once a nice gentleman bought me a glass of wine. \n\nanyway, i eat here at least 1-2 times per year during fun visits to vegas. this location is at the end of the forum shops right near las vegas blvd (the strip) so you see it right as you come in. or if you are coming from the casino, you have to walk a long way to get here (but it is worth it!).\n\noh in the bar there are a couple of hd televisions so i did take in the 2014 sochi olympics mens figure skating. cool.", 
            "this is definitely fine dining.  the food is very good; i had the <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> and tasted  jenny's <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> (a must!) and <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>.  i enjoyed every bite.  the service is great; our server was well versed on the menu, which was helpful.  we split the birthday brownie sundae for dessert and it didn't disappoint.  if you have the extra money and want to enjoy a relaxing atmosphere with great food, give joe's a shot.", 
            "yes yes, a thousand times yes! my fiance took me here for my birthday. everything down to the free bread was amazing ! we got the stuffed mushroom appetizer. i seriously dislike mushrooms but my fiance insisted and they were delicious! i was blown away! \nwe both got the filet mingnon and ohhhh emmmm geeee. it was perfect. my mouth was watering. they give you some extra seasoning just in case and i took that as well as an extra container (i asked them for it) home with me. i currently have their steak seasoning in my seasoning collection lol. \nwe also got their <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> and i figured they'd just be regular potatoes nothing special. but wow...they put all sorts of cheese on it and bake it i believe. i got the large size and it's way too much for two people. we had to take the rest home! \nthe server was attentive and personable. i usually assume in such a nice restaurant the servers would be stiff and boring but she was awesome !\nthe only thing i wasnt to hot on was my birthday dessert. it was f", 
            "decent service but good seafood and meat to satisfy your needs. make reservations so you don't have to wait long to get seated. i made reservations and though i was about 10 mins late, we were still seated right away. be sure to use the valet parking where the forum shop is near las vegas blvd. easier to navigate right to joe's. \n\nfirst came the free bread. none are the same and you get 5 different types to try. in my opinion, all were great. the one with sesame i liked the most. we started with a half dozen order of oysters and though the oysters were good, i've had better. we then ordered 7 <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws to split with my wife. great part about this is that they come cracked already and i definitely recommend getting it. great tasting and fresh, you can't go wrong with this.  for the main, i got their bone-in <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark>. priced around $55, this is definitely worth it. nice huge sized <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> that's cooked perfectly and they give you additional steak seasoning on the side if you need it. bad thing is that the $55 doesn't come with any sides which i don't think any of those do. you will have to order their sides separately. good thing is that it's a large portion so it isn't too bad if you're sharing. i recommend ordering the <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>. one of the best i've had and yet it was so good and great serving, we couldn't finish it. place is a bit expensive but it's worth the price. service could be a bit better but wasn't too bad. just that we waited for about 20-30 mins before our main dishes came out. i would probably come back again and try something else on their menu but can't go wrong with the bone-in <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark>, <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws and mash potato.", 
            "unbelievably delicious! prices are kinda steep and high but u get what u pay for. \ni went here last time with my fiancee and fam, and we enjoyed everything! i mean from the <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>, mac n cheese, <mark>Crispy Onion Strings</mark>, oysters (i dont even like oysters), to of course the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>. even down to the bread. \nthere's only 3 locations i believe in chicago, miami, and vegas. we were all saying how they should open one up in la. they have to... it would make a killing. but for the time being, since vegas is the closest, looks like we'll have to make a trip back soon.", 
            "located inside the forum shops inside caesar's palace, it is a cute place with outside seating if you want to have a nice meal by the water fountain and secretly people watch. not to mention, it is conveniently located right next to vosges haut chocolat (i highly recommend their boxes of truffles). \n\nmy dining experience can be best described as mediocre. great intentions, questionable execution. i really wanted to like this restaurant but my expectations were not met. two of the things i absolutely love is steak and seafood. when you have a restaurant that is known for both, you'd think this is food heaven. unfortunately, i was quite disappointed. \n\nbread basket- i usually don't talk about the bread but this one deserves it's own review. it is delicious. the variety is great. the pretzel mini loaf is really cute. \n\n<mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark>- sadly, it is unimpressive. it had a slight off flavor to it and too salty. and a pet peeve of mine at steak houses is when i asked for steak to be on the rare side, it comes out dry and well done. \n\nalaskan king crab- also quite salty as well and nothing special. served with lemon and butter. \n\n<mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>- not too bad but it also wasn't memorable either. \n\nlyonnaise potatoes- pretty good. i enjoyed eating it. \n\nkey lime pie- signature dessert was okay. not my personal preference. \n\nhavana dream pie- yum. this one is delicious. might be a bit too sweet but still good. served with slices of strawberries. it is soft, creamy, and sweet. \n\nbanana cream pie- this one is my favorite dessert. it is delicious. not too sweet. great banana flavor. light and airy. \n\nthe service here is friendly and efficient. a tad bit unrefined and awkward at times. slapping a spoon on a plate and served our side dishes cafeteria style. an elbow almost knocking someone out. and taking someone's eating utensils while they were still using them. maybe i'm being overly picky but i'm comparing the service with other $$$ restaurants and it does lack a certain refinement. \n\nwould i come back again? i might just to give this place one more chance. i really wanted to like it but it was way below expectations.", 
            "honestly, i was in the area to get some $1 oysters at pj clarke's but they've closed down!!!! :(  so the group and i took the next closest thing, even though we weren't looking to spend a bunch but it happens...\n\nso i went through the cheaper route while dining here so i'm pretty sure i didn't get the full experience.  i ordered the <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> (6 oz) lunch special at i believe $27 which comes with joes grilled tomato and jennies <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  it also comes with a selection of a slice of pie, which i chose the havana.  \n\nthe steak was cooked very well and they do bring out some steak salt to season to your liking.  honestly, i would rather have the chef season it his taste so as the seasoning can permeate the meat better but not everyone would feel the same way.  the tomato was topped with their famous <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> and topped with cheddar cheese under a broiler for a few seconds.  the spinach was very rich and i am glad i didn't get a full order of that.  the sampling was just enough for me.  the potatoes were also seasoned with bread crumbs and more cheese.  a very rich meal that relies on comfort food.  \n\nthat dessert though.... to sum it up, essentially like a dulce de leche pie made from the heavens.  they make their pies in house and you can definitely tell.  each bite was so rich yet so good, coffee does wonders with this dessert.  my friend also got the same combo and ordered the key lime pie.  damn. the dessert chef here knows his/her stuff.  be sure to order a slice if you don't get the combo.\n\nservice was very hospitable and welcoming, and the bread baskets will definitely fill you up if you're not careful. they serve about 5 different types of bread for all kinds of different tastes.  although i didn't get order oysters from here, i was still very satisfied. next time, i'll come back and try what everyone else raves about and also in their name, the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>. :)",

            "when i saw that joe's was participating in restaurant week and specifically for lunch i knew we had to try it out. \n\nthe bread basket had a nice variety of breads, but the onion bread was my favorite. for my appetizer i had the calamari on a bed of couscous. this was a very generous portion and had a very fresh taste. i'd surprisingly never had calamari that wasn't fried and really enjoyed that joe's serves their calamari fresh without frying. my husband started with mussels which were plentiful and flavorful. the broth they were in was delicious. my entree was the steak <mark>Salmon Au Poivre</mark> which had a nice peppery topping with tasty <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>. my husband's copper river salmon was perfectly prepared and delicious. the corn on the plate was amazing, i have no idea what they did to it, but i couldn't stop stealing his corn. we wrapped up with key lime pie and blueberry pie. i liked the key lime filling flavor, but the crust was kind of bland. my blueberry pie wasn't amazing, but satisfied my sweet tooth. \n\nwe'll definitely be back as my husband has declared this his favorite seafood restaurant in town.",

(5 stars)\n\n<mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claw (2 stars)- our waitress actually suggested we don't order this because of the season they aren't as fresh as normal, my brother really wanted to try one since they're known for it, he did, and i def liked the legs better, so she was on fireeeeee!\n\ni ordered the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> with the miso glaze (4.5 stars)- divine. the flavors were all there- my only mark off was that it was slightly overcooked. my brother got the same thing and even said so, too bad they made a mistake on mine. it wasn't chewy or anything so i ate it, but i do like my fish almost medium. \n\ndover sole (4 stars)- my dad and brother got this, they served this table side, i enjoyed the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> more, but this was still pretty good, the sauce does the trick ;)\n\nsides:\n\nroasted corn (2 stars)- this is one thing i didn't enjoy- tasted way better before, they need to add something to make this stand out more. my brother makes a creamy kind of corn dish at home which is fantastic, wish i had that!\n\n<mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> (4 stars)- good some crunch goodness on the top too, wish there was some garlic in there though ;)\n\ndessert- it was all pies! i'm not a huge pie person, but you can order halves, which my brother did of the banana creme pie, pretty good and i think she gave us a whole slice and charged us for half which was nice and we tipped her very well :)\n\nword of advice- they have valet right outside the restaurant so do not valet in the lobby, it's a long horrendous walk in heels, trust me. wish we knew that ahead of time!", 
            "came here after my girlfriend and i were shopping at the forum shops. we get in and there is only a five minute wait, once inside our waiter gave us what are the best options and took our drinks. my girlfriend got the pimm's cup and i had the hudson baby bourbon. the pimm's was delicious, perfect amount of sweetness for my girlfriend and the bourbon was great. when it came to food, my girlfriend got the <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> and i had the bone-in ribeye. we also had sides of <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>, <mark>Fried Asparagus</mark>, roasted corn, and mac and cheese. it was to die for! the steaks and the seasoning that comes on the side were cooked to perfection and tasted amazing! the sides were all so delicious, no complaints at all about the meal! service was very great and attentive. highly recommend for anyone looking to spend a few extra bucks on great quality of food, quick service, and stellar ambience!", 
            "having walked by joe's many times in the past six years and intrigued by the camaderie of the restaurant, i finally decided to make a reservation here for my pop's birthday dinner. after having our dinner here, i have decided joe's is actually a 3-star restaurant hidden behind their parade of waiters in suits and their famous <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>. \n\nin a city bustling with celebrity chef restaurants, joe's fails to scratch at the surface of the upper echelon that consists of places like sw steakhouse or joel robuchon. there's no single bad element that defines joe's, but it was a combination of little miscues that diminished my experience here. \n\n1) mac & cheese was too runny for my liking. i thought gourmet mac & cheese would have more texture, but this side dish was slathered in kraft-like liquid cheese.\n\n2) most upscale joints have their waiters/assistants scrap off bread crumbs off the white tablecloth onto a pan. details like that are supposed to enhance your fine-dining experience. but this particular evening, the assistant to our waiter just scraped the breadcrumbs onto the ground. i felt that small detail made my dinner less-than-memorable. \n\n3) the complimentary bread was less than stellar. i have had better bread at lower $$ establishments. i liked that there was variety to the bread basket, but some of the choices tasted stale. \n\npops and i both ordered the steak & lobster dinner. dinner tasted delicious, but it fails to distinguish itself from previous steak and seafood joints i have eaten at. is joe's worth visiting once in your lifetime? yes, it has some good qualities. the <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> were very good and i enjoyed the custom-inked cloth napkins in the upstairs restroom. i just don't find myself rushing back here anytime soon.", 
            "the skinny : come for lunch as the prices are much more reasonable - get the 2 course lunch for a great deal.  the <mark>Roast Turkey & Avocado</mark> sammy is my fav(3.5) service is solid (4) value: depends on what you order.  stick to the sandwiches and the 2 course lunch and you should make out fine (3.5 bump up to 4)\n\njust to preface this review -  <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> is not all that for me. neither is crab in general. but we still make our way to joe's for lunch to catch some of their other menu items. \n\nwe usually go during the summer when lettuce entertain you club members receive coupons to dine in their local joints. usually there is a coupon for joe's which is a major score (yay!). \n\nwe've tried different iterations of things but the true stand outs for us is the lunch menu which is way easier on the wallet than dinner. \n\nmy perennial favorite is their <mark>Roast Turkey & Avocado</mark> sandwich. served with real roasted moist turkey and a nice thick slice of bacon, it is a simple dish done really well. love the combination of alfalfa sprouts, tomato and avocado. the fried <mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark> fries are pretty solid but nothing special. for $16, this is as affordable for a place like joe's gets. \n\nthe hubs loves their sliced rib eye french dip with saut\\u00e9ed mushrooms and onions and a side of fries. ($22) it's messy/juicy but oh so good sandwich served on a ciabatta roll. the <mark>French Fried</mark> again are nothing special. \n\nthe two course lunch is a good deal if you consider how much they charge for sides and dessert. between the two options of alaskan king crab vs.  the steak,  i would opt for the crab. \n\nreally,  the crab is only okay in my books. portion size for this is pretty small -  about 5 small legs. where it stands out is the lyonnaise potatoes and roasted sweet corn. the lyonnaise potatoes is kind of like a large mound of hash browns topped with caramelized onions. greasy but very tasty. the roasted sweet corn with a hint of lime is great too. both portion sizes for the sides are really a lot for one person and easily shared. it comes with havana dream pie which is essential a boston cream pie minus the chocolate topping and instead dulce de leches with a hit of cinnamon. if you decide you want banana cream pie or key lime pie instead (both are pretty good) ,  they will accommodate you. all of this for around $28-29.\n\nthe steak option is okay - just the <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> are boring while the saut\\u00e9ed spinach is nothing special. \n\nservice is prompt generally during lunch hours due to all the power lunches that go down here. as soon as you are seated,  they make sure the water glasses are filled and a basket of warmed bread is placed while you peruse the menu. the bread basket is okay but i find myself partial to the parker roll and the lavosh -  both are kind of guilty pleasures.\n\noverall, joe's is nothing particularly innovative. but it is good food executed well generally. value is largely during the lunch hours with decent eats for a more reasonable price point. 3.5 starred review with bump up to 4.", 
            "came here for a destination wedding 2 weeks ago and was pleasantly surprised.\n\nthe venue held on the second level of the restaurant which was away from the crowd downstairs. it was small yet warm and inviting. when we got there, there was a small menu for us to choose from for the entr\\u00e9e. \n\nthe appetizer was a platter of seafood including shrimp, lobster, crab and a shrimp/<mark>Shrimp & Scallop Ceviche</mark>. all the seafood was really fresh. this was then followed by a hearty <mark>Caesar Salad</mark>. \n\nfor the entr\\u00e9e, i decided on the ahi tuna filet on a bed of spinach/mushrooms topped with red wine bordelaise. it also came with some potato cakes as well. additionally, we also had asparagus and <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> on the side with our meal. i must say the side of <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> was definitely my favourite of the night. it was so creamy and flavourful. of course, the main itself was absolutely delicious! the tuna literally melted in my mouth. my boyfriend had the steak which he mentioned was only alright - he definitely liked my tuna better! \n\nfor the dessert i had the chocolate marquise pie. it was okay, nothing too special. i was too full after the main course to even eat the dessert. overall a very good place to dine at."

            "this is part of a small chain, based in miami beach.  i had lunch here.  service was inconsistent.  the initial greeting was friendly, and i was seated quickly.  water was quickly offered, and a very good bread basket arrived shortly thereafter.  however, the server took a long time to bring me a menu, and seemed in a hurry.  this slow-to-return then in-a-hurry attitude would recur.  oh yeah, i was never even offered dessert, just handed the check.  isn't this place famous for its key lime pie?\n\ni had never had <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>, so i gave them a try as an appetizer.  they were ok, but i guess i'm not a fan.  also, i thought joe's was known for its mustard sauce.  none was provided.  one nice touch: after i was finished, an assistant came by with a lemon, and squeezed the juice over my hands into a waiting bowl.  he then gave me a hot, wet towel.  much appreciated.\n\ni had glazed black cod as an entree.  it was a big piece of wonderfully moist, flaky fish.  the glaze was excellent.  a trifle sweet, it began to cloy after a few bites.  not to worry - half a lemon was provided; the juice made the sauce perfect.  on the other hand, i could have done without the pedestrian <mark>French Fried</mark> <mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark>.", 
            "we were staying at caesars & wanted something nice but not too spendy. we found the listing for this in the hotels magazine & decided to give it a go. so happy that we did! the place was pretty packed for a wednesday night but the wait in line wasn't long. the reason it wasn't soon became clear, as we were seated in the bar. i was a bit disappointed by this but realized i shouldn't be, as we had no reservations & didn't have to wait more than 5 minutes. \n\nthe bread they bring to the table is really excellent, with various types including one that's much like a soft pretzel. yum! \n\nour service was very good... very attentive. my husband wound up ordering the fish & chips and i had the broiled salmon with 1/2 <mark><mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark></mark>. both were served quickly and i must say that salmon was some of the best i've ever had!! \n\nin and out in probably just a bit over an hour, and prices that didn't break the bank. i'd definitely go there again!", 
            "i love <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>, but this location was a little disapointing for me.  i could go on all day about the jumbo <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws that i had in miami, in vegas it was just ok.  they were out of the jumbo claws and maybe the large because we ended up just getting the mediums, you really can taste the difference.  in miami the <mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark> fries are thick cut and in vegas they're shoestrings and i prefer the thick cut.    the garlic <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> is the same.  do not order the <mark>Joe's Fried Chicken</mark>!  i had heard so many great things about the chicken , but ended up so disapointed, it was not salted at all so it tasted really, really bad.  i'm sure this locaton loses some of it's charm because it's not in the salty air of  the miami coast, but there is no excuse for the bad chicken and being out of jumbo claws.  i'll think i'll stick with the miami location for future. oh and our server was not very nice.", 
            "i tend to favor restaurants with foofoo menus, the kind of stuff i'd never make at home, with ingredients you'd have to have sent from outer mongolia.  that said, joe's was fantastic.  it's basically <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>, steaks and seafood, but anything but basic.  first of all, i'd give 5 stars just for the best mojitoes i've ever had in my (long) life.  then the meal:  we shared <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws appetizer with a delicious mustardy sauce.  i had stone <mark>Crab Bisque</mark> (seems the thing to do here is enjoy <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>) which was ethereal.  my husband had <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> which were blue crab meat barely held together in a \"cake \" form, there being little or more likely no breading.  just sublime crabmeat.  i had a fantastic idea in menu offerings -- lobster tail tempura.  lobster meat -- 2 large tails.  deep fried in tempura batter.  what in the name of all that is right and holy could be better than that?!  and did i mention the mojitoes?  we also shared their highly touted, rightfully so, <mark>Joe's Cole Slaw</mark> and <mark>French Fried</mark> <mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark> and still managed to save room for dessert.  husband couldn't decide between the coconut cream pie or banana cream pie with foster sauce, so awesome server brought both (for price of one).  i had peach pie with melba sauce.  great location, ambiance and friendly, knowledgeable server.  a great time.", 
            "great food & great service!! even though we were about 15-20 minutes late, we were greeted warmly and got seated right away. \ncrabs at joe's are to die for...and so are their bone-in steaks. i got the bone-in <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> and it was cooked perfectly and super tasty. oh don't forget about their potato dishes! i am not a big fan of potato but i just can't get my fork off the plate! and i don't mean ordinary potato dishes like <mark><mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark></mark> or mashed potato, try lyonnaise potato or jennie's potato! and considering how big the portions are with great flavors, it definitely worth every penny. one thing about the <mark>Manhattan Clam Chowder</mark> though...is that it's not the white-creamy chowder that you get, it was more like...borshch-tomato style soup. besides that, everything else was perfect and i will definitely go back again when i visit vegas next time!", 
            "we were so blown away by this place. i was in a food coma for the rest of the night;) we had the 26oz prime rib (ask for the steak season salt) if you're a true  carnivore like we are than you know it's a perfect steak when you don't have to ask for steak sauce, we also had the enormous hash brown,mac n' cheese, <mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark> and the best oysters ever!   a bit pricey but you get what you pay for. this is one more place we added to our \"must have\" vegas trip!", 
            "the best <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> ever! \n\nthis is it folks! when you're looking for a filet that is so good it speaks to your soul look no further - get it at joe's. i generally do not order <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> because they always seem to lack flavor. delmonico's is a prime example of an over priced bland filet. thank god for joe's that a sista can finally enjoy a figure friendly cut of steak that is out of this world. i ordered the lunch special and for $21.99 here's whatcha girl got: \n\npetite filet - awesome! \n\njenny's potatoes - not the greatest. i would never order this again. the <mark>Hashed Brown</mark> potatoes didn't look any better. they looked like an over-sized overcooked <mark><mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark></mark>. \n\ngrilled tomato - phenomenal. never had anything like this i'm my life. one slice of a grilled tomato covered with cream of spinach and then layered with baked cheese...don't knock it til you try it. \n\ntwo crab claws - my awesome waiter threw these in for free to ensure that i at least experienced the famous crab claws. he was honest about stating they were not in season. they were a bit frozen, but still okay. i was glad i didn't order them as my main course. \n\nkey lime pie - the bomb! the lunch special actually came with banana cream pie...once again my waiter went over and beyond to hook me up. \n\nthe service here is the best. everyone is there to ensure you leave extremely happy. my server went as far as to squeeze lemon juice over my hands prior to handing me a hot towel...omg!!! \n\noverall, this place was outstanding!. i would highly recommend.", 
            "i'm definitely a fan! the fam took a vegas vacation for my parents 40th anniversary. a friend suggested joe's. great place to go for a party of 6. their specialty is the crab and steak.  \n\nwe started with the calamari. yum\n\ni ordered the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> that came with mustard sauce. the crab was delicious and the sauce nicely complimented the dish. as a side i ordered the <mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark> fries.. it was sooo yummy with the mustard sauce. \nmy beau had the bone in filet. yes were all a little confused that the filet came with a bone, but our waiter assured us it was possible. it was cooked perfectly and melted in the mouth. that's how i like my <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark>! \neveryone else loved their dishes. at the very end our server brought my parents a lovely brownie topped with ice cream to celebrate their anniversary. \njoe's made us feel very welcome! a great experience indeed.", 
            "i am all for joe's.\ni came here for dinner during a business trip to las vegas and was not disappointed.  the service was terrific and the food was great. the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> did not disappoint and i appreciated that they cracked <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> before serving it to you! i really enjoyed the horseradish dipping sauce that accompanied the crab and the <mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark> fries. \ni also enjoyed a couple of dirty vodka martini's and the bartender made them perfectly! i would go back for the drinks alone.", 
            "good restaurant to try, but don't think i will be coming back.  i've tried the joe's in south beach several years ago and remembered being disappointed by the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws.  but, i thought maybe my tastebuds weren't \"matured\" yet so i'll give it another shot.  the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> was better than i remembered, but still not worth the $ - my favorite part being the mustard sauce that they served with it.  \n\nmy girlfriends and i shared all three cuts of their bone-in steaks (ny, filet, rib-eye), <mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark> fries, mac and cheese, and sweet corn.  the only cut that really stood out was the bone-in filet, which was perfectly cooked and was tender, juicy, and flavorful.  \n\noverall, the dining experience was pleasant, but i do have one major gripe.  as other yelpers mentioned, it's not exactly the cheapest place to eat, which i expected, but for the same reason, i also expected a high level of professionalism and service.  by the time we finished dinner, it was only 6:30 so the restaurant was pretty empty.  it was obvious that nobody was waiting to be seated at our table immediately.  i was pretty pissed when the bussers started to clear our table while we were working on splitting the bill.  it led to us having to reach over them and they having to reach under us, just a big mess everywhere.  couldn't even get my purse without having to dodge around them.  left a bad impression for an otherwise decent dinner.", 
            "this is a solid choice for fish and steak.  of course the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> must be ordered as they are the signature dish.  while pricey, they are sweet and tasty with the house sauce.  two per person allows for a perfect starter.  all of our fish entrees were fresh and tasty. loved the mahi and cod.  <mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark> fries were soft and lucious, and the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> was also good.   key lime pie is a fun tart dessert for sharing.  service is top notch as well.", 
            "we decided to go here for dinner before the show at caesars that night. everything is a la carte, so when you order a steak, that's all you get. sides are ordered separately, but each side will easily serve two people. i was in a party of five so everyone ordered their entrees and we had three side dishes, which was more than enough for my table. our server was spot on and courteous. i would probably put him near or at the top of the list of the servers i have had. \n\nwe ordered a <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> appetizer for all of us to share. it was the first time for me having <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> and i didn't think it was the greatest. but i knew what i had coming, so nothing was going to compare anyway. it probably isn't something i would order again. i absolutely had to order the table-side chilled <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> with melted butter. i died and went to heaven several times over! i normally prefer my crab meat warm instead of chilled, but who am i to complain if they're going to do all the work for me? it was so delicious i'm about to start drooling just thinking about how good it was. i normally make fun of my sister about being stingy with food, but i made the most food aggressive dog look tame with my <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>. the side dishes were good too, which ranged from <mark>French Fried</mark> to <mark><mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark></mark> to macaroni and cheese to green beans. it was a fairly good list so i don't remember all of them. \n\nit is a bit on the expensive side (my <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> were well worth the $60, though) so be prepared drop some bucks. if you're lucky enough, you'll be able to pay for the entire meal with casino winnings. if you like alaskan king crab, this is definitely the place for you.", 
            "the best restaurant in las vegas for <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>.  celebrated my birthday the other night there with my wife and two kids.  we had the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> (great), jumbo <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> (phenomenal), bone in ribeye (terrific), dover sole (unreal), and the following sides...... <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, roasted corn, and a potato dish our server recommended.  wow what a meal and the service was great.  we didn't have room for desert, however they brought out a brownie with ice cream for my bday. now with that being said tis the season for holiday deserts so of course we had to order some to go.  traditional key lime pie, pumpkin chiffon pie and <mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark> pecan pie were all a must.  love joes!", 
            "my boyfriend and i were excited to dine here on december 26, 2011.  my best friend raved about their <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> and key lime pie, so i had to try!\n\nthe complimentary bread assortment was so delicious.  we were walking along the vegas strip all day and didn't realize how hungry we were until we sat down.  thank goodness for the fresh gourmet bread & butter!\n\nfor starters we ordered the <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark> and the <mark>Crab Bisque</mark>.  the <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark> was refreshing, but the <mark>Crab Bisque</mark> truly stood out.  my boyfriend loved it.  it had chunks of crab in there!\n\nthen came two orders of the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> served with a dipping sauce that was to die for.  the crabs were perfectly chilled and so meaty.  we also ordered  <mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark> fries.  they were very yummy too.  we were so stuffed i didn't have room to try their key lime pie. that was my only disappointment with this place.\n\ni will definitely be back for more!", 
            "went to joe s with my finance\\u00e9. hands down it is one the best restaurants i ve been in vegas. every thing was perfect. ordered the surf n  turf: petite <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> and brolied lobster tail, with a side of <mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark>. i felt like a king after eating that :) \n\nas an appetizer, we had some <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws. i have to say, the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>, although tasty and highly publicized, was not the best part of dinner. the <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> was perfectly cooked. the lobster was delicious. \n\nfor dessert you can order half slices so we had the key lime and havana pie.\n\nthe whole experience made me a fan of this place!", 
            "two words: <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>. best crab i've ever tasted.\n\nthis joe's is loud - our party of 10 was seated in the main dining room, which essentially does not permit for group conversation - was able to speak with immediate tablemates only. excellent people watching - the bank set dines here. fantastic service - server didn't miss a beat despite a few obnoxious members in our party - kudos to her.\n\nsteaks and sides didn't disappoint - had the petite 8 oz <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark>. sides are meant for sharing - offers <mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark> in 3 different preparations, spinach in 3 preparations. broccolini and green beans amandine are excellent steak complements. for non-steak diners, joe's offers a decent fish selection as well, including mahi mahi, salmon, halibut, <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>, ahi tuna.\n\ncome here for the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>.", 
            "was in vegas this week for a convention and went to joes my first night.  sat at the bar and waited for my party of 10 to show up and enjoyed a drink with my sweetie.  even though there were about 10 servers milling around i had to get up and go to the bar to get my own drink.  the drink was great, and the atmosphere of the bar and dining room was very nice and welcoming.\nsat down to the table and met our waiter who was very nice and gave us the history of the restaurant and suggested some appetizers and entrees since it was our first visit .  we started off with the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws which were out of this world and the mustard dipping sauce was from the heavens.  we also had the shrimp de jonge which was ok.\ni had the ribeye which was ok, nothing fantastic.  it was a bit on the small side for a bone in ribeye, but since i was still on east coast time so it was really late.  sweetie had the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> and liked it.  the side dishes were also very nice we had the lyonaise potatoes, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, <mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark> fries, onion straws and maybe one other, all were tasty.\nfor dessert someone ordered the peanut butter pie which was very tasty and to call it rich would be an understatement.  since there was 10 of us they added a percentage to the bill for a tip, which is normal but then the waiter made a point to let the member of our party that was paying know that he had to share the tip with the other people who participated in our service so it was customary to add more so that he gets his fair share.  i thought this was tasteless and uncalled for he was also pretty persistent about it and it left a bad taste in my mouth.\nthis meal was nice, and i would go back for the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws.  there were parts that were great and parts that were not so great about this experience.", 
            "still love this place! \n\na must stop anytime i'm in vegas. this time i visited for lunch and went with their joe's classic w/ <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>. a yummy 3- course meal that comes with 5 large <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws, <mark>Hashed Brown</mark> potatoes and a slice of key lime pie all for $26! \ncrab claws- 5 large pre-cracked <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws, sweet and tender meat conveniently pre-cracked for your dining ease :)\n<mark>Hashed Brown</mark> potatoes- a large serving of their delicious hashed/s<mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> with a wonderfully crispy outer crust.

            "flexible dress code.  sure they say \"business casual\" but they are absolutely fine with shorts in the dining room during dinner.  two thumbs up for this since when we visited (week of july 9th) the temps were 115-116 during the day cooling down to 95-100 in the evenings!\n\nthe drinks are pricey... $15 for a cranberry & grey goose... but they're stiff!!!  the food is rather reasonably priced for a rather high end seafood/steak restaurant in las vegas.  \n\ni had the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> appetizer, my husband had the <mark>Joe's Cole Slaw</mark>, we split the 12oz filet and the big daddy's potatoes (not on the menu so i'll describe... they're <mark>Hashed Brown</mark> sitting on a bed of caramelized onions then topped with loaded <mark><mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark></mark> innards... must must must try!!!).  for dessert i had the havana dream pie (white cake with a custard filling and an uber-thick drizzle of dulce de leche on top... again, a must must must try!!!)  and hubby had the peppermint ice cream with hot fudge. \n\nour food total was under $90 which is not expensive for the quantity and quality of food.  it was my birthday so they brought out a complimentary brick of flourless chocolate cake topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream which is then topped with hot fudge.  this was very tasty however since we had each ordered a dessert it was totally too much / ott and we would have preferred they either comp the dessert i ordered or told me they'd be bringing that out so i would not have ordered something else.   \n\nservice was excellent... from the bar tender to the waitress to the maitre d.  no complaints whatsoever and we'll certainly be back!", 
            "my husband was very happy with their lobster and steak combo meal, definitely worth the $65 he says, well, everyone is entitled with his or her opinions.  i tasted it.  they are good but not phenomenal.   \n\nmy 9 year old had 3 of their <mark><mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark></mark> with chives and butter, they are good but then what doesn't taste good with load of butter? \n\nmy older son scored!  his <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> was the best to me.  it had the perfect balance of flavors, delicious.  \n\ni was the least lucky one for the night.  i had a terrible time!  all because i started with the half-dozen oysters, which were not what i had expected.  first of all, they tasted bitter! the flavor didn't improve after i dipped them in the sauce it came with.  as a seasoned oyster sampler, i know the good fresh oysters don't need any sauce or dipping, they are good on their own.\n\nsecondly, they were tiny. i'm talking about the actual meat part.  one of them was the size of my thumb nail, no kidding.  \n\nand worse of all, i had a very bad tummy ache right after i ate the oysters.  ouch, ouch!\n\nat this point i ordered their lobster bisque, thinking it might ease my tummy ache.  but the bisque tasted so weird, it was too salty, and too sweet at same time.  and my tummy ache got worse now, i had to let my son get up so i can lay down.  that didn't help, so i asked for some very hot water. then another pot, and another.  i was sweating profusely after 3 pots of hot piping water by now, and i was a royal mess regretting ordering that wretched oysters.  but at least i could get up and walk back to our room at the end, thank god, we are not staying at augustus tower this time, or i have to walk more.\n\ni am thankful to that nice bus boy who brought me hot water. god bless u for ur sweet tender heart.  all this time, our waitress, a well-weathered one, witnessed my pain with such an indifference as if she has seen the world of suffering.  i think she was afraid if she admit i got ill from their oysters we may not pay her.  i know there are people who do that, but not us.  the bill was almost $200 with the wine, nothing was comped even with  my terrible plight.  she was very glad to take the hefty tip from us though.  \n\ni have never had reactions like this to the oysters before, and oysters are my favorite food if u read my profile.  it was just not my night.\n\nsince the rest of my family did have good meal, i am giving them a very generous 3 stars.  i would have rated them higher if the waitress didn't retort me bitterly after i gave her my feedback of the oysters and the lobster bisque each time.  hey, waitress lady, everyone else may prefer ur tiny bitter taste oyster but i don't, is that a crime?  also, please don't look aghast when i tell u i didn't care the lobster bisque as if i am not refined enough to appriciate ur \"fine\" dinning.  a decent and graceful hostess would have taken it back right away.", 
            "by god this place is good!!  i've been to some off the charts seafood and steak places but wow this place blew me away!  i came here with a friend and we started off with the ceviche, crab mushrooms and oysters rockafeller and all three were off the charts good.  for the entree we had the rib eye with a <mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark> and i swear i could hear my taste  buds singing from joy!  finally came the key lime pie which was truly the best i have ever had.  to top off the food the service was top notch!  in the end i left with a feeling of euphoria that stayed for hours.  i would totally come back and i would give a serious recommendation for anyone who wants to have a very nice meal while they're in vegas.  once again wow!!",

            "i cannot believe this place is called joe's <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> just like the one in miami ? it has absolutely nothing to do with the original one, i have been more than 30 times to the original in miami and the only thing i can say is that the one in las vegas is horrible in every way, for example in vegas the <mark>Manhattan Clam Chowder</mark> was not only cold but we had to return it because it tasted like dirty laundry, then we ordered the wedge salad where in miami they bring you a huge portion witch most of times you have to share because it is so big, in vegas they brought me a 1/3 of a half, i returned it telling them that there most be a mistake on the portion, 10 minutes later they brought me the exact same portion telling me that in vegas is a different portion, then we ordered the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>, incredibly they didn't had the most common size witch is the large and told us that they only had the jumbos that were priced about $ 85dls per order,  20 minutes later another person came and told me that they had ran out of the jumbo's but now suddenly they had the large ! so we ordered the large, it was not surprised that when the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> came they were frozen and not good at all,  a fresh <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> should not stick to <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> and this ones were a disgrace for what they charge, the <mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark> fries are completely different as well, and the signature key lime pie is also not made the same way and tasted nothing like the original. if you plan to go to joe's do not consider by any means to go to the one in vegas, it has nothing to do with the original in miami,  i keep asking me why would they change a great menu like the one in miami to make a worst one? please some one tell me ! they should be ashamed to be called joes <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>.",

(good tip that i got from my friend holly) best <mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark> fries in town, kusshi oysters and <mark>Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail</mark> are great for starters. havana dream pies and chocolate fudge pies are always a treat for dessert. the apple pie a la mode's crust is awesome but the apples are usually on the bland side. trust me all the pies are a treat just chose one to your liking. for service, they always greet you with a smile and linda and joey are the best servers, they're really awesome, sit with linda if you want the most sweet and charming british lady and joey if you want a down to earth no hassle good ol city joe. i hope this helps. enjoy!",

            "wow, this place is really great.  of course, it is pricey but definitely worth it.  to save some money, you can order off of the bar menu selection.  this is what the people in my party did, and the food was no less delicious for it.  to start, the bread was quite tasty.  for dinner, i ordered the <mark>Char-Broiled Beef Tenderloin Sandwich</mark> and substituted <mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark> fries for regular (at no additional cost).  joe's serves this sandwich akin to sliders, with three small sandwiches on the plate.  the tenderloin was excellent quality, and the bread it was served on was phenomenal.  one other person in my party ordered the ribeye sandwich, also from the bar menu, and was able to substitute a salad for fries.  this sandwich is served on a sub-type roll.  a very good quality sandwich as well.  we ordered grilled asparagus as a side, which i would say was the only disappointing part of the meal.  it's not that the asparagus was bad, but i feel they charge too much for the quantity given.  when it came time for dessert, the waitress explained they are all homemade.  i had several questions, which she patiently answered and described in further detail the desserts i asked about.  she also explained that each dessert is large enough to share, and they also have \"half sizes\" not listed on the menu.  i decided to share the chocolate fudge cake, which was heavenly.  the other person in my group had the key lime pie, which was not a portion large enough to share, but was described by them as the best they've ever had.  i was thrilled with this restaurant and would recommend it to anyone.",

($22) it's messy/juicy but oh so good sandwich served on a ciabatta roll. the <mark>French Fried</mark> again are nothing special. \n\nthe two course lunch is a good deal if you consider how much they charge for sides and dessert. between the two options of alaskan king crab vs.  the steak,  i would opt for the crab. \n\nreally,  the crab is only okay in my books. portion size for this is pretty small -  about 5 small legs. where it stands out is the lyonnaise potatoes and roasted sweet corn. the lyonnaise potatoes is kind of like a large mound of hash browns topped with caramelized onions. greasy but very tasty. the roasted sweet corn with a hint of lime is great too. both portion sizes for the sides are really a lot for one person and easily shared. it comes with havana dream pie which is essential a boston cream pie minus the chocolate topping and instead dulce de leches with a hit of cinnamon. if you decide you want banana cream pie or key lime pie instead (both are pretty good) ,  they will accommodate you. all of this for around $28-29.\n\nthe steak option is okay - just the <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> are boring while the saut\\u00e9ed spinach is nothing special. \n\nservice is prompt generally during lunch hours due to all the power lunches that go down here. as soon as you are seated,  they make sure the water glasses are filled and a basket of warmed bread is placed while you peruse the menu. the bread basket is okay but i find myself partial to the parker roll and the lavosh -  both are kind of guilty pleasures.\n\noverall, joe's is nothing particularly innovative. but it is good food executed well generally. value is largely during the lunch hours with decent eats for a more reasonable price point. 3.5 starred review with bump up to 4.",

            "loved joe's.  liked it even more because we went with our kids for lunch and they loved it too.  kids had a <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> and the mini cheese burgers and fries.  they loved it.  my husband and i had the crab claws as an appetizer which was awesome.  i had a ny steak and asparagus.  steak was perfectly seasoned and cooked to medium rare.  my husband had the scallops.  he said they were a tad overdone, but i didn't think so at all.  he also ordered the <mark>Joe's Grilled Tomatoes</mark>.  we all loved that.\nour server joey was terrific and his assistants were just as good.  everyone was so friendly and accommodating (because we had the 3 kids).  we sat on the \"patio\" area which was perfect for our loud family.  lots of noise from people walking by.  will definitely go back.",

            "we came here on a saturday night in december, a party of 6.  we made reservations for 5 since the only other time was at 9.  it ended up working out well because we had a nice relaxing long dinner before returning back to our hotel for a nap and getting ready for the evening.\n\ndecor: 4.5/5  clean, beautiful dark wood paneled walls.  we sat in the back circular room, the seats and tables were arranged a little strangely in that i noticed later the seats weren't evenly distributed (minor) but not in a logical way.  the seats were up against other seats from adjacent tables.  poor planning and made getting in and out difficult.\n\nservice:  5/5 service here was fantastic.  the waiters (i didn't see any waitresses) were all in tuxes and very professional but more importantly friendly.  plates and dishes were cleared promptly and the waiter chatted and joked with us.  amusingly enough, we stopped a bus boy (who was also dressed in a tux) if he could bring us a jus -- he either misheard or didn't know what it was, but he did his best and we were brought some other sauce.  (some white gravy stuff that turned out to be pretty tasty)\n\nsurf: 4/5 i didn't try the oysters but the table seemed to enjoy them.  the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> pretty much just tasted like crab to me.  the mustard sauce didn't have much flavor in my opinion.  i was underwhelmed by the crab but it was neat trying them.  i wouldn't feel the need to order that again.\n\nturf: 4/5 the meat was good.  4 of us ordered the petite <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> -- strangely i think only one of us finished it.  i guess we got filled up with the delicious bread (5/5!).  the meat itself wasn't bad but not amazing.  i think it was worth the money but sadly not memorable.  the fresh horseradish was not very spicy, their special mix of spices/seasoning was tasty (but very salty)\n\nside dishes: 3/5 we tried a few of their dishes.  ranked from least favorite to favorite.  1) the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> could have been entirely skipped.  it was flavorless.  2) the mac n cheese was ok, they used spiral noodles.  if you're in the mood for mac n cheese you'd probably be satisfied, but it also wasn't memorable.  then again i think i've started expecting bacon and maybe gouda in my mac n cheese now... 3.  <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  the crusty crumbly bits on top were yummy and the melted cheese inside was great.  it was strangely dry though.  my idea <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> have chunks of firm potato and then soft creamy potatoes in it... this was just a little dry but great flavor.  worth ordering  4) the sweet corn was surprisingly great!  i usually like corn plain, but this was really delicious.  i think we were all surprised with how good this was -- that was the only side plate that was entirely finished.\n\ndessert 5/5: we ordered the key lime pie.  all their desserts are made fresh daily and since this is originally a florida restaurant -- we decided on the key lime pie.  it was thankfully not green and was very light and at least for me, the best key lime pie i've ever had.  i finished most of the pie even though i couldn't even finish my steak (and lemme tell ya what a steak person i am!).  the coffee was also excellent according to my friends, but i think starbucks is good so i wouldn't know.  sorry!\n\noverall, it was a great meal.  if i went back to vegas i'd probably want to try a different restaurant but i certainly recommend this place to anyone who hasn't been there.  the meal ended up being a final cost of  $78/person (that includes a $40 bottle wine). \n\ni'd recommend coming here with at least 4 people (we had 6) since the side dishes family style.  apparently, you can get joe's delivered to your house.",

(no wonder the recipe is top secret!) all i know is it's made with skyy vodka, half & half or some other cream, i'm guessing a lime liqueur because it was sweeter than if it were just lime juice and it's served in a martini glass rimmed in a sugary graham cracker dust. bottoms up! it was deeeelicious. \n\nbefore i forget, too, i have to mention the bread basket! there is the omgah cutest mini loaf pretzel bread in that basket. i loves it!!!\n\neven though we all pretty much knew what we wanted as our entrees...we took our time looking over the menu to determine our starters and sides. in fact, i ordered well after appetizers were set on our table because i didn't think i was hungry enough to justify that and an entr\\u00e9e. however, once i caught sight of the jumbo <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> i knew i couldn't resist.\n\nthat jumbo <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> was so good... chunks of flaky, white crab meat. it practically melted in my mouth! the next time i'm at joe's i'm going to order the jumbo <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> dinner. (my mouth is watering right now just thinking about it!)\n\nrob & jolene ordered the 2nd mortgage, an appetizer that lives up to its name! a plate of jumbo shrimp, lobster cocktail, alaskan king crab, and a shrimp & <mark>Shrimp & Scallop Ceviche</mark>.  i tried some of the ceviche and it was flavored so nicely...light with just the right amount of acidity with chunks of scallops and shrimp... very, very good. \n\nnow... the main course... \n\ni knew immediately that i wanted the bacon-wrapped scallops. have you seen them? oh my goodness! ten scallops in total; served in a \"pair\" of five since they are wrapped in bacon... oh my goodness...oh my goodness... heavenly! i could only eat five of them which worked out perfectly for me since i had leftovers for dinner last night! the scallops are fantastic. i didn't much care for the bacon itself but the flavor the bacon gave the scallops was fantastic and they were perfectly cooked. \n\nfor sides i ordered the pan roasted sweet corn, which i absolutely loved, and the deep <mark>Fried Asparagus</mark>. how could i resist it? even our waiter made a comment that they took a perfectly healthy vegetable and umm... made it unhealthy... and it was divine! good thing the sides are generous in portion and can be shared easily between a party of even four, i'd say...\n\ni tried the garlic <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, also, and it was nice... but the asparagus was the clear front runner. \n\nafter our leftovers were boxed up, we ordered coffee... i really wanted dessert...but i had no room whatsoever. i was so stuffed i even considered for a second, sprinting to the opposite end of the forum shops to h&m to purchase a pair of elastic waistband pants... *tee hee* \n\ntwo in our party of six did order dessert... i had a bite of both the key lime pie and the havana dream pie... which, oh yes... was certainly that. both were decadent... i woulda needed a pair of elastic waistband pants and a couch (a stretcher? and two strong mens?) had i indulged in a whole piece.\n\nit was a lovely meal... with great friends that are near and dear to me... and a great send off for 2010... \n\ni know we're not quite there yet...but i don't see another $30 entr\\u00e9e a'happenin for me before friday so... there you go.", 
            "joe's is high-quality well-prepared food, excellent service, and an old-time steakhouse atmosphere.\nwe went for my husband's birthday and had a great time. obviously their signature <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws are excellent. for our entrees, i had the glazed black cod, based on the recommendation of other reviewers. i was not disappointed - it was excellent! light, flaky, but with a little bit of sweet barbecued glaze. my husband had the steak and king crab, which was also very good. i might complain about the amount of king crab (it seemed like less than one leg), but we were so stuffed, we didn't even finish everything anyway. our sides were the corn and <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>. i would not normally have ordered corn, but this was quite good, and i loved the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>. he drank, i had club soda, and we shared a dessert. total, with tip, was just over $150 - you could pay a lot more for a lot worse food!", 
            "i been dreaming of joe's <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> since i last had them over two years ago. we came back for nc's 30th bday dinner. we dined in what looked like a small conference room. service was good.\nfoodwise:\n<mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> legs: very delicious. 5/5\n<mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark>: although it was packed with crabmeat, it was not quit what i remembered it to be. it tasted just alright. 3/5\nfilet: it was a tad charred on the outside. 3.5/5\n<mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>: very good 5/5\nmashed tatoes: 4/5\nmaybe it was an off day for them. overall joe's portions are sizable and their prices are very reasonable for the quality of food.", 
            "i typically don't care for crab claws, but being at a restaurant where their specialty is <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws, i had to order it. this is the first time i have had <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claw but its definitely different in meat texture and flavor than other crab claws. they crack <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> up pretty good and you just have to peel away <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark> and eat. the waitress said to just eat it like you would a hard boiled egg.\n\napparently, the fishermen catch these crabs, cut off one of the claws, and then throw them back. the claws grow back and then they later get caught again.\n\ni do recommend starting off the with some <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws.\n\nfor my entree, i had the petite <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> and <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>. these were both very good...can't really go wrong with these.\n\nthe <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> was just okay....the pan roasted sweet corn was delicious.", 
            "this is an excellent restaurant. the service was first rate. i enjoyed the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>, lyonnaise, and <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>. it is very close to a 5 star experience, but is sits within the forum mall. this is vegas and things are a little different, just an odd combo having shoppers walk by. my uncle chooses the inside dark booths which may have created a better atmosphere.", 
            "i was looking forward to finally trying joe's <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>. i have seen on it tv shows, heard great things from others who have been there, and thought i was going to be in for a treat. unfortunately i was sadly mistaken. i went with the big <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> and we had the <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, pan roasted sweet corn, <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>, lyonnaise with some <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark>. the oysters and sides were good and so was the wine (rioja) but the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> was a flop. now maybe it was because they weren't in season and if that was the case i will research and try them again when they are in season. what will make me seek out a different restaurant to try them in was the service. we had two tables with a total of 15 people. for the two tables we were given one waitress who was very slow. forget about the fact it took forever for us to get a drink order in, it took even longer for the drinks to finally arrive. overall it was a disappointing experience at what should have been an excellent restaurant. my company is in vegas twice a year and i was hoping this would be a restaurant that would be on our annual list, but it was so bad we skipped dessert and had cigars and after dinner drinks somewhere else instead.", 
            "wonderful experience.  we came without a reservation and were accommodated and given a nice table.  we had the cesar salad, seared ahi and <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>.  food was excellent and the service was just as good.  i was happy we happened to go there on a whim.  we will return!", 
            "restaurant week is in full swing, and we are now 4 for 4! last night diane and i dined at joe's, and it was another great meal! \n\nwe arrived for dinner on thursday at 5:45 p.m., 15 minutes before our reservation, and were seated right away. by 7:00 p.m. the main dining room was almost completely full. we had never been here before, and i was a bit intimidated at first as i approached the high reception stand where a man in a jet black tuxedo with jet black hair towered over me. but he was friendly and professional, as were all of the other black bow-tied, black tuxedoed, and white aproned restaurant personnel we encountered during our visit. i had only seen the bar and mall dining areas before, and thought they comprised the whole restaurant. not so! we were ushered through a curtain to a very elegant dining room that had decorative lights on the wall and a decidedly new york city clubby steakhouse feel to it, with much dark wood and brown leather, white tablecloths, and several tables surrounded by comfortable booths along both main walls. it was very sophisticated but not pretentious, as were the several servers who moved briskly about like busy bees. it was interesting just watching them in action. \n\nwe went with the restaurant week menu, but augmented it with a two-claw appetizer of <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws and king crab mac & cheese. i always wondered whether i would be able to eat <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws because their ends look like elongated fingers painted with black nail polish. but it was easier than i thought, since that part of the claw is left alone. the claws arrived from the kitchen already largely crushed by a mallet, so it was not that difficult to pry apart the porcelain-like shell casing to get at the meat underneath. but there seemed to be less meat than found in alaskan crab claws. the thin morsels of crab meat tasted fine either dipped in drawn butter, the mild mustard sauce that was provided, or just eaten straight out of <mark>Oysters on the Half Shell</mark>. yet i noted that they were not as sweet or satisfying as king crab claw meat. and, at about $22 for two claws, they were not cheap. so, for me, it is now \"been there, done that!\" but i will definitely return to joe's for its other fine fare, including lobster and king crab. \n\nalthough this was hardly needed, an assortment of bread products tasted good with the soft pats of butter provided. and a bowl of stone <mark>Crab Bisque</mark> was sweet and smooth--simply exquisite in taste and texture. i liked it better without the garnish of tiny cuts of carrots and zucchini that we asked to have served on the side, since diane's yelp nickname is \"veggie hater\" for a reason. but i picked the delicate morsels of <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> out of the garnish and tossed them in the wonderful soup, which avoided an inexcusable wasting of fine crab particles and made the soup even tastier. \n\na large <mark>Joe's <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark></mark> of lettuce, tomato, onion, and <mark>Chopped Lettuce, Tomato, Onion & Blue Cheese</mark> crumbles with a fine vinaigrette dressing was quite satisfying. my 8 oz. <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> with drinkable bearnaise sauce was simply divine. it was well seasoned on top, perfectly medium rare inside as ordered, and did literally melt in my mouth. i liked it better without the house seasonings, which i tried on a couple of bites. it was one of those steaks that kept getting better and better as slices of beef moved toward the rarer center. \n\ndiane's moist halibut had a tasty parmesan crust, augmented by a buerre blanc-like sauce that was provided. it was notably flatter than many servings of halibut experienced at other restaurants, but of ample portion size. the king crab mac & cheese, made with white shells, hunks of king crab, and bechamel sauce, tasted good, but was not nearly as noteworthy as the sumptuous <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> that were covered with a mix of baked asiago cheese and breadcrumbs. and, few lobster chunks were included in the dish. <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> was creamy as billed, and quite tasty. \n\njoe's signature key lime pie arrived ultra cold and almost frozen. after trying one bite, i let my slice sit for 5 minutes, and then it was just right, having lost its icy taste. it was very tart and delicious. \n\npeppermint gelato with hot fudge was not as memorable as the key lime pie, but the melted hot fudge was delicious. it had the strong taste of peppermint, and every now and then surprised the palate with peppermint candy chips. i would have preferred this dish during the christmas season! \n\nall in all, a wonderful five-star meal!", 
            "this place is amazing. bring your wallet!!!!!\n\nyou can make reservations at this one on opentable, something you can't even think about doing in the south beach location. this is not the same as joe's crab shack, they are light years apart. there are only 3 of these locations that i know about--miami, chicago, & vegas.\n\nthe roasted corn is by far my favorite side.  the <mark>Seafood Chopped Salad</mark> to start is awesome. and believe it or not their <mark>Joe's Fried Chicken</mark> is off the chain.  other good sides are their potatoes and <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>.\n\nthey had fresh <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> 1.25 lb was $90, not cheap by any means but super good. great for groups!  great for dates. all the waiters are in tuxedos. joe's is on the first floor and there is a side sneaky valet if you know where to look that's right next to it.\n\nkey lime pie for dessert is a must!  but they have a banana one too that is just as good. get both why not! what's another $10 when you are going all in!\n\nmake sure you ask for extra lemons and mustard sauce.\n\nyou can thank me later.  oh and ps they are open for lunch too!", 
            "i didn't find anything too special about the place.  it's like any steakhouse i feel like.  i do enjoy the idea of having shared sides but my steak was a-ok.  we had the <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> as appetizers which was meaty with crabs and raw oysters were fresh.  i had the <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> and like i said, nothing too special.  we all shared the garlic <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>, and the roasted corn.  i liked the corn the most. that's all there was to it really.", 
            "the best restaurant in las vegas for <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>.  celebrated my birthday the other night there with my wife and two kids.  we had the <mark>Caesar Salad</mark> (great), jumbo <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> (phenomenal), bone in ribeye (terrific), dover sole (unreal), and the following sides...... <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, roasted corn, and a potato dish our server recommended.  wow what a meal and the service was great.  we didn't have room for desert, however they brought out a brownie with ice cream for my bday. now with that being said tis the season for holiday deserts so of course we had to order some to go.  traditional key lime pie, pumpkin chiffon pie and <mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark> pecan pie were all a must.  love joes!", 
            "my wife and i were looking for a nice dinner after the michael jackson immortal show in vegas....thought this place would work nicely. this was my 2nd stint at this place (1st time was w/my boys for my bachelor party), i must say this place does not disappoint. for appetizers i started with the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> (their famous for) and <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark>, both were pretty delicious. ordered the 20 oz bone-in ribeye w/garlic <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> and hash browns. their service is superior, if you're looking for a meal that will do the job, here it is, lol there's only 2 of these in the u.s. one in vegas and the other is where else....miami.", 
            "the first time we walked up we all thought it was this simple bar and grill place.  we made reservation thru our concierge @ vdara. when we get there we tell the host that we have reservation and they escort us to the back, behind the curtain and bam!! we get hit with the elite and fancy side of joe's. wow, fancy shemancy... love it.  so we sit down wit at least 3 -4 server per table and one took our orders.  we had to try the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> of course and the 20 oz rib eyes. we also order some lobster bisque... oh man i only ordered a cup of this stuff but i could've eaten a gallon of it. so rich and flavorful each bite had tons of lobster meat..yumm-mo!! the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> came out next and we each got 2....pretty damn expensive but it was a great piece of claw. super fresh and amazingly easy to get every single piece of meat.  not sure if i would get this again since it was about $47 for 2 claws.... =p  either way once in a lifetime type of deal for all of us.  \nour main entrees came next...i ordered the 20 oz rib eye medium well and my wife ordered the veal.  oh man the rib eye was huge!! didn't have to put much effort in cutting that bad boy.  the taste was perfect no a1 or sauce or anything.  loved it my wife's veal was super tender and tasted great. the veal was breaded and had a great flavor and crunchiness to it.  our friend got the pound of <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>.. oh man those were great.. i wish they had that and a small side of rib eye.  hint hint!! they even cut open every single crab leg.  fancchee!!  we also ordered our sides, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, garlic <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>, and roasted corn.  all were fantastic..we found out if you mix all three it creates complete happiness in your mouth. hahaha  \nalthough we were stuffed i wanted to order some dessert for everyone.  so we shared some banana foster cake and some chiffon type cake. both were so good and ended our night perfectly.  great way to end our vegas trip!!   for all 7 of us the bill was only $600ish.. so not bad.  great service and great food! must try guys!!", 
            "surf and turf ftw!!!\n\ni love how you can pretty much create your own dish with the waiter. i got me some surf and turf with 3 large <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> and a petite filet. the filet was good, not great. the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> is wonderful and fresh, but what really makes it is the mustard sauce it's served with.\n\nwe also had:\n- oysters - tiny tiny oysters but really good. i could eat them all day.\n- lyonnaise potatoes - bomb! it's a big pile of <mark>Hashed Brown</mark> topped with delicious caramelized onions.\n- <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> - yum yum!\n- broccolini - thumbs up!", 
            "i've passed by joe's plenty of times on my many expeditions through the forum shops.  it wasn't until i saw a segment on the travel channel about <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> that i took interest in the restaurant.  when <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> are caught, one claw is torn off and the crab thrown back in the ocean.  it's mean but <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> have the ability to grow back their claw in about 12 to 24 months.\n\nthree friends and i dined here on a saturday night at 7pm for our friend's birthday.  the restaurant is more than what meets the eye, there's also a back room with a good amount of seating.  i'm not sure if it's for reservations only but making reservations is always suggested.\n\nappetizers:\n*<mark>Oysters Rockefeller</mark> (4 pieces/order) - okay.  though the oyster shells were good size, the oysters were small and the creamy mixture overpowered the dish.\n*<mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> - you can't dine here and not order the crabs.  i though the crabs were delicious.  they were a bit on the sweet side and tasted perfect with the accompanied special mustard sauce.  the only downer was that it seemed the claws were cracked too much making it tougher to eat trying to pick out the tiny shells.  do note: <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> are more expensive than your normal crab and will cost up to $10/claw depending on how you order (you can order medium, large, or select).\n*<mark>Blt Wedge</mark> salad - good, but bacon makes everything taste better.  our waiter was nice enough to split the salads so it could end up on each side of the table to be shared.  the salad consisted of <mark>Chopped Lettuce, Tomato, Onion & Blue Cheese</mark>, onions, tomatoes, bacon, and topped off with a vinaigrette dressing.\n\n entr\\u00c9e:\n*veal cutlets \"oscar style\" - pass, i should've stuck to seafood.  the dish was comprised of two small veal cutlets which were breaded and fried, then sprinkled with crabmeat and chopped asparagus, and then doused with a hollandaise sauce.  the main reason this dish failed with me was the overcooked veal cutlets.  the crabmeat was deliciously sweet and the hollandaise sauce helped with the dryness of the veal.  \n\nsides:\n*garlic <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> - delicious!  the dish was creamy and full of flavor.  i thought the garlic would be chopped into the spinach, but garlic cloves were cooked on top of the dish.  \n*sugar snap peas - good and extremely fresh.  the peas were had a nice sweet crisp to them.\n\nservice:\ngood and extremely professional.",

            "pretty good really.\n\nhad the 22oz lobster tail and garlic <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>.  good stuff and well worth the price.\n\nservice was a little uneven but not bad.\n\ni'd go back again.",

            "3 of us went to joe's today for a late lunch (3pm). we sat in the lounge area instead of the outside patio area. our server's name was hope and she was great.  we started with a <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> appetizer which was full of crab meat delicately seasoned. 2 of us ordered the joe's lunch special for $24.95 which included a 6oz filet, grilled tomato topped with <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> and desert.  what a great deal that was. the other person in our party ordered the fish & chips (with <mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark> chips) and a side dish of macaroni & cheese. the fish was very good with a light batter. he did not care for the <mark>Baked Sweet Potato</mark> chips they were a little greasy and cold. the macaroni & cheese was hot and delicious. for desert we had the banana cream pie, tres leeches cake and the brownie sundae topped with ice cream. the banana cream pie and the tres leeches cake were both something we will have again. our waitress was very helpful picking out wine and checked back frequently to see if we needed anything. service was great and the food was great-\n we will definitely be back and will ask for hope. lunch is very casual, we all wore jeans and nice shirts-there were people eating in shorts. dinner is much more formal and expensive.", 
            "an overall amazing meal. if a place was ever worthy of 5+ stars, this is it. located inside the cesar's forum shops, the restaurant had a great refined setting. our server was nice and very accommodating to our group of 7 busy girls.\n\nan absolute must here is the crab claws. absolute! we did two orders of the medium claws (7 claws per order at $39 an order). tasty crab claws itself, the flavor is put over the top when you pair it with their special sauce. \n\nwe tried 3 sides amongst the 7 of us to pair with our entrees and still had leftovers. the side portions are pretty big.\n\nsides:\nlyonnaise potatoes: perfect crisp on the outside & great flavor with the onions in the middle\n<mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>: not noteworthy but decent\nsauteed corn: probably the favorite of the sides. the flavor was really good. i would order this again\n\ni can't speak on behalf of the other girls' entrees as i didn't try it but the restaurant was kind enough to split any entrees to two plates before it was served to us if anyone was sharing. this made things run a lot smoother & it was much appreciated. \n\ni split the scallops with a friend as my entree and it was definitely enough for the both of us to be full. granted we did have a lot of sides & had snacked on the yummy bread basket that was served in the beginning. these are probably some of the best scallops i have ever had. cooked to perfection! flavor & texture was great. i highly recommend it. \n\noverall: this place was great. a superb meal of fine food.", 
            "this is as good as it gets! i remember the time a few years back when i came in to this steakhouse and asked them what are <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>?!? the server went to describe these succulent <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> unlike any i've had before, cooked and served cold with mustard sauce....perfect! now i love seafood and this was simply amazing.\n\ni come to vegas from time to time and i always look forward to eating at joe's. sure they make great steaks, after all it is a steakhouse but these <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> are to die for! pair it with a martini (sapphire straight up with olives always hits the spot!), white wine, sides of jennys <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>, <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, green beans almondine. you can't go wrong!\n\nservers are great and attentive. layout of the restaurant is classy with a nice vibe to it. there is a back area for dinner reservations but i like sitting in the patio (see and be seen!) as well as the bar area. even once a nice gentleman bought me a glass of wine. \n\nanyway, i eat here at least 1-2 times per year during fun visits to vegas. this location is at the end of the forum shops right near las vegas blvd (the strip) so you see it right as you come in. or if you are coming from the casino, you have to walk a long way to get here (but it is worth it!).\n\noh in the bar there are a couple of hd televisions so i did take in the 2014 sochi olympics mens figure skating. cool.",

            "honestly, i was in the area to get some $1 oysters at pj clarke's but they've closed down!!!! :(  so the group and i took the next closest thing, even though we weren't looking to spend a bunch but it happens...\n\nso i went through the cheaper route while dining here so i'm pretty sure i didn't get the full experience.  i ordered the <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> (6 oz) lunch special at i believe $27 which comes with joes grilled tomato and jennies <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark>.  it also comes with a selection of a slice of pie, which i chose the havana.  \n\nthe steak was cooked very well and they do bring out some steak salt to season to your liking.  honestly, i would rather have the chef season it his taste so as the seasoning can permeate the meat better but not everyone would feel the same way.  the tomato was topped with their famous <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark> and topped with cheddar cheese under a broiler for a few seconds.  the spinach was very rich and i am glad i didn't get a full order of that.  the sampling was just enough for me.  the potatoes were also seasoned with bread crumbs and more cheese.  a very rich meal that relies on comfort food.  \n\nthat dessert though.... to sum it up, essentially like a dulce de leche pie made from the heavens.  they make their pies in house and you can definitely tell.  each bite was so rich yet so good, coffee does wonders with this dessert.  my friend also got the same combo and ordered the key lime pie.  damn. the dessert chef here knows his/her stuff.  be sure to order a slice if you don't get the combo.\n\nservice was very hospitable and welcoming, and the bread baskets will definitely fill you up if you're not careful. they serve about 5 different types of bread for all kinds of different tastes.  although i didn't get order oysters from here, i was still very satisfied. next time, i'll come back and try what everyone else raves about and also in their name, the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>. :)",

            "it's times like these when i truly enjoy writing a deserved review on a restaurant. we had actually planned to go to a crawfish place for dinner, but i really wanted to try something else for once...since we always go to the crawfish place when we come to vegas.\n\nmy first impression when walking toward this restaurant was....wow....this place looks really expensive, so it better be good! located in the forum shopping mall at caesar's, the restaurant looks like a long and well established classic american bar and restaurant. we were greeted at the entrance by a host who seated us right away....likely because we showed up early at around 5.30pm....but even then, the place was very busy. we were led to our table where we were introduced to our waiter itodd) who took very good care of us. both the host and todd were extremely polite and nice, courteous, and professional, and made us feel like the most important guests at the restaurant.....real class.\n\nin less than a minute, a fresh basket of yummy bread was placed on our table....and it looked gooooood! ....and after tasting it....wow, delicious. todd then came over and showed us the menu with the featured specials, which all sounded absolutely amazing.  everything on main menu looked absolutely delicious, but we couldn't order everything that looked good as we would not have been able to finish it all.....so we were very selective. as an appetizer we ordered the <mark>Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms</mark>.... and omg,...they were absolutely delicious! i can quite confidently say without a doubt that these were the best i have ever tasted! next, how could we have come to joe's without trying their 5-piece signature <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws. also absolutely delicious....and together with their special dipping sauce.....absolutely fantastic! $65 for 5 claws.....well, it better have been good! already cracked, todd was good enough to instruct us how they are supposed to be peeled and eaten....and afterwards, brought us some lemon to squeeze on our hands and wet towels to clean our hands of the fishy crab smell. and it actually worked!\n\nfor our entrees, we ordered their featured special grilled dover sole, which was de-boned at table side. simply squeezed lemon on top and you have one absolutely delicious fish meal. for myself, i ordered the roasted black cod as this is one of my favorite types of fish. it was cooked and served in a mild tomato broth with olives and herb oil. the cod was so fresh and perfectly cooked.....and the broth was mild enough as to no way overpower the fish.....every part of this dish complimented each other.....i absolutely loved it.....i thought the portion was a bit small, so thank goodness my friends and i shared everything. for sides, we ordered the <mark>Sauteed Broccolini</mark> and highly recommended roasted swee corn. both were also perfectly cooked and delicious. the serving of corn was good, but i think there should have been a bit more broccolini in the dish.\n\nall this together with a bottle of wine......wow.....life is good....and this restaurant qualifies as being one of the best restaurants i have ever tried! the service was excellent and attentive, and i will say that it was worth every dollar we spent on this dinner. i will definitely be back when i'm next in town. oh, we were brought the wrong check, but it's a good thing we normally check everything before paying.\n\ni love this place! :)"

            "what we expected to be a quick jaunt from bellagio to the forum shops at caesar's was anything but. hubby and i had discussed well before we left for las vegas that we would try new restaurants this trip which meant skipping joe's, but as we sashayed through the doors of the forum shops, there was joe's smack dab in front of us, and he was calling our name . . . we thought there was no way on a friday night without reservations we would get in without a long wait, but we looked at each other, each of us with puppy dog eyes, imploring each other to break the rule we already made and try to get into joe's. amazingly enough, they had availability for two in the back dining room in an hour which meant shopping a little longer than expected, but we were entirely grateful for the extra time to spend more money! ha!\n\nwe really didn't have to look at the menu. we knew that a plate of select <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> was in order. as many others have said, they come in sizes from small to large and then \"select\". we always get the select. we are never disappointed. the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>, meaty and succulent, are the star, but the mustard sauce is the kicker. oh how i love that sauce . . . so much so that when i ordered the <mark>Jumbo Shrimp Cocktail</mark> as my meal, i asked for the mustard sauce instead of the cocktail sauce. hubby had the <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark>. it was the best we've ever had in any restaurant. we also ordered the <mark>Four Cheese Mac & Cheese</mark> mac and cheese which was so delectable and creamy. as an aside, you could pick any item from their list of sides and be thoroughly entranced.\n\natmosphere at joe's runs the gamut and can please just about anyone. they have the \"outside\" patio which provides a casual experience and is perfect for people-watching. just about everyone who walks into the forum shops from las vegas boulevard walks past you. there is the bar room and can watch your favorite game while you drink, dine and root for the home team. and then, my favorite, the back dining room which reminds me of an old italian steakhouse where your servers are dressed in tuxes and provide some of the best service in las vegas. i love the maitre d at the entrance to the back room. even if he doesn't recognize you, he pretends he does!  that's a real art!",

            "i'd say my group ordered almost everything on the menu!  we walked out of there stuffed to the max that our stomachs were hurting.\n\nour dinner started out with complimentary bread, which came in different types.  they were delicious.  we ordered other items such as roasted sweet corn (bomb!), hash browns (can never go wrong w/ potatoes), lyonnaise (bomb!), <mark>Four Cheese Mac & Cheese</mark> mac & cheese (okay), <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> (i like seafood, but not a huge fan of this).  i also ordered the shrimp and <mark>Shrimp & Scallop Ceviche</mark> because i love ceviches, but i wasn't sure if i should order it because they only taste good by authentic mexican restaurants.  but because it was a fancy restaurant i went for it.  in the end, i was disappointed...never again.  the shrimp and scallop tasted like shrimp and scallop alright.  it had a hint of lemon on it and lame junk.  they made it worse by serving it with the cheap salt crackers!  what happened to the tostatas?? fail",

            "great upscale restaurant!! \n\nwhile planning a great trip to the lovely las vegas area, joe's crossed my list as one of the top places to eat--thanks to my fellow yelpers! i wanted to impress the hubby with a romantic dinner and amazing steak. and after much debt-- i decided joe's would be it!\n\nlet me say if you come in the main entrance of the caesars palace you are jacked and i hope you have on comfortable shoes! the restaurant is on the far end of the hotel and located in the shopping and eating plaza of the hotel. make sure you ask somebody if you are not sure, or you will get an amazing amount of exercise before you eat. after our long hike from the beginning of the hotel to the restaurant, we finally made it to joe's (ahhhhh*** angel music in the background). there was a gentlemen hostess outside the restaurant behind a booth --who was taking seating request for people as they came up to the restaurant (there was a wait). luckily for the hubby and i, i made reservations a few days in advance. the host escorted us into the restaurant and into a second check in area and a second dining room area for those who made reservations. this area was kind of sectioned off and i felt very exclusive! after the second host confirmed our name we were immediately seated. the set up and decorations of joe's is so upscale, i felt like i traveled back in time to the early 1900s and dining at the classist establishment in vegas. the lighting is dim and romantic and the waiters all wear full tuxedos. \n\nthe hubby and i were seated in a cushiony booth and immediately given water and bread from the sub server. after a couple of minutes our waiter made his way to our table and went through the menu and what the day's specials were. i placed an order for a glass of wine and the hubby ordered water (not sure what wine i ordered--its vegas and i had a few before i got there). the wine was very good-- i do know that much. everything sounded so good on the menu, i couldn't decide what to order. i ended up ordering the <mark>King Crab Louis</mark> salad and the <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>. the hubby ordered the <mark>Ahi Tuna Filet Mignon</mark> steak. the salad was so amazing and fresh! it was the best crab salad i have ever had! the <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> i could have gone without-- the market price was 20 or 30 bucks and i only received like a piece of 2 legs--it looked like an appetizer--but i guess that's what is served at upscale places. we also ordered a side of <mark>Steamed Asparagus</mark> and mac and cheese. everything was just amazing and mouth watering and our server was on point from the time we came till the very end of our meal. my husband's water was never empty and we were completely tended to by the waiter and the servers. his steak was also made to perfection and very juicy. this was an excellent restaurant and i will def. go again when i visit the vegas area. the waiter also informed us there is a location in the dc area, so i may not have to wait long before i try this great place again!", 
            "came for the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws and <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> as recommended. made a reservation the day before as was also recommended. got the select (6pcs) and they were a little small but tasty. the <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> as well. food and service was excellent, our server gave us a bit more time to order than we needed but was very courteous and friendly. \ncon: while i was expecting dishes to be pricey, i'm not sure how to feel about $11 for 8 pieces of <mark>Steamed Asparagus</mark>..."

            "i had a great piece of <mark>Chilean Sea Bass</mark> here, but the <mark>Fried Asparagus</mark> (although very tasty) ended up souring my stomach (nothing a few single-malts couldn't remedy). seemed a bit on the greasy side. the salads were nothing special.\n\nthe service was friendly and constant - a little slow though. i like being able to eat good food in an unpretentious atmosphere (we sat in the front). it was also nice to walk up and be seated without waiting at prime dinner time.", 
            "the bf and i enjoyed a post-christmas dinner at joe's this past sunday with close friends jolene l. and rob c., as well as rob's brother russ and their mom, diann. \n\nwithout a doubt i'd been looking forward to our 5pm reservation for a couple of weeks... \n\nour waiter was a nice fella whose name escapes me...but he'd no doubt made a career for himself on knowing the specials and knowing them well. a little bit snoot, but still a whole lotta nice. \n\nwe ordered drinks and i decided on one of the fancy schmancy specialty cocktails called \"daddy's key lime pie\" - a yummy concoction that yes - tastes like liquid key lime pie and no doubt could turn deadly very quickly... (no wonder the recipe is top secret!) all i know is it's made with skyy vodka, half & half or some other cream, i'm guessing a lime liqueur because it was sweeter than if it were just lime juice and it's served in a martini glass rimmed in a sugary graham cracker dust. bottoms up! it was deeeelicious. \n\nbefore i forget, too, i have to mention the bread basket! there is the omgah cutest mini loaf pretzel bread in that basket. i loves it!!!\n\neven though we all pretty much knew what we wanted as our entrees...we took our time looking over the menu to determine our starters and sides. in fact, i ordered well after appetizers were set on our table because i didn't think i was hungry enough to justify that and an entr\\u00e9e. however, once i caught sight of the jumbo <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> i knew i couldn't resist.\n\nthat jumbo <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> was so good... chunks of flaky, white crab meat. it practically melted in my mouth! the next time i'm at joe's i'm going to order the jumbo <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> dinner. (my mouth is watering right now just thinking about it!)\n\nrob & jolene ordered the 2nd mortgage, an appetizer that lives up to its name! a plate of jumbo shrimp, lobster cocktail, alaskan king crab, and a shrimp & <mark>Shrimp & Scallop Ceviche</mark>.  i tried some of the ceviche and it was flavored so nicely...light with just the right amount of acidity with chunks of scallops and shrimp... very, very good. \n\nnow... the main course... \n\ni knew immediately that i wanted the bacon-wrapped scallops. have you seen them? oh my goodness! ten scallops in total; served in a \"pair\" of five since they are wrapped in bacon... oh my goodness...oh my goodness... heavenly! i could only eat five of them which worked out perfectly for me since i had leftovers for dinner last night! the scallops are fantastic. i didn't much care for the bacon itself but the flavor the bacon gave the scallops was fantastic and they were perfectly cooked. \n\nfor sides i ordered the pan roasted sweet corn, which i absolutely loved, and the deep <mark>Fried Asparagus</mark>. how could i resist it? even our waiter made a comment that they took a perfectly healthy vegetable and umm... made it unhealthy... and it was divine! good thing the sides are generous in portion and can be shared easily between a party of even four, i'd say...\n\ni tried the garlic <mark>Creamed Spinach</mark>, also, and it was nice... but the asparagus was the clear front runner. \n\nafter our leftovers were boxed up, we ordered coffee... i really wanted dessert...but i had no room whatsoever. i was so stuffed i even considered for a second, sprinting to the opposite end of the forum shops to h&m to purchase a pair of elastic waistband pants... *tee hee* \n\ntwo in our party of six did order dessert... i had a bite of both the key lime pie and the havana dream pie... which, oh yes... was certainly that. both were decadent... i woulda needed a pair of elastic waistband pants and a couch (a stretcher? and two strong mens?) had i indulged in a whole piece.\n\nit was a lovely meal... with great friends that are near and dear to me... and a great send off for 2010... \n\ni know we're not quite there yet...but i don't see another $30 entr\\u00e9e a'happenin for me before friday so... there you go.", 
            "wow! this place is the best, i mean the best! the bacon wrapped scallops are too die for!!!!! the <mark>Colossal Lump Crab Cake</mark> are yummy and full of crab. the steaks are tender and full of flavor!!!! i went with a party of 5 and everyone loved their food! this place is a must go for seafood lovers! oh, the sides were delish too, they are big enough to share! the <mark>Fried Asparagus</mark> and jennies <mark>Jennie's Mashed Potatoes</mark> are yummmo!!!  dont forget the havanna dream pie!!!", 
            "joe's is one of my favorite spots in vegas, i'm a vegetarian but the vegetable dishes are amazing! my favorites are the <mark>Fried Asparagus</mark> with lemon butter sauce, jennies potatoes, green beans and creamed corn, just perfect. the bar is also really fun and the cocktails are the bomb, it's a great spot to enjoy a cocktail before sitting down to eat. \n\ni love the \"outdoor\" seating area which is were i normally sit as it's light and i can see if there's fly in my salad. i dined once in the back room which is dark and romantic, that was a hot date night and then who cares if there's a fly in my salad? i'm getting some :)\n\nquick note about the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>, i'm normally the only vegetarian of the group so they are always ordered and apparently amazing (if they are fresh) sometimes they have been frozen and they have been sent back because of that.", 
            "holy moly!!!  the <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> are so amazing!!!  the most meaty pair of <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> i've ever had.  i love it because there is a person who prepares the legs for you, so all you have to do is pull the meat out with your fork!  the sides are delicious as well!  the deep <mark>Fried Asparagus</mark> was crunchy and tender, the grilled corn is also a must.  they had a lobster mac and cheese, but just recently took it off the menu!  big sad face!  it's  must if you are in vegas!  you might have to win some money to pay for it though :) enjoy!",

            "we visited again on our last trip, but this time for lunch, and had an even better experience than the last.  \n\njohn, our maitre d, was back again and was his usual funny self.  he sat us inside the main dining area, and there was no wait for lunch on a saturday.  call ahead if you know you're heading there and he'll set you up.  \n\non my last visit, the <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> claws were a bit disappointing, but we tried them again because it was a first for my friends, and this time, they were delicious.  sweet, tender, and a better deal if you order the select variety with an order of 6 for $45.  \n\nof course i had to get the <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark>, and they did not disappoint.  lunch prices were $55 for 1 pound as opposed to 1 1/2 pound for $80.  if you want the dinner serving, they're more than happy to give it to you.  \n\nour party tried the ahi tuna sandwich, lobster tail tempura, <mark>Oysters Rockefeller</mark>, <mark>Fried Asparagus</mark>, sweet corn, and hash brown loaf.   all were delicious, except the hash browns.  i thought they were a bit overdone, and too salty.  they are topped with a ton of caramelized onions which at first sounded perfect, but they were way too oily.  that we wouldn't order again.  \n\nwe each finished our lunch with half slices of their pies. the flavors on the table were key lime, chocolate peanut butter, havana dream, and another flavor i can't remember.  if you like key lime, theirs won't disappoint.  but we were in absolute awe of the havana dream.  our waitress described it as a tres leches pie, and it was amazing.  i even considered taking a whole pie home.  it's that good.  don't be fooled by the \"half\" slice.  it's actually a very generous size.", 
            "i came here expecting joe's crab shack (you know that crappy chain).  my expectations were extremely low.  \n\ntheir <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> offering was pitiful i guess.  from san diego, i can goto the docks and pickup <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark> for $2.50 per <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>, and i eat the whole thing (not just the big claw).  here they were essentially charging $5 per claw, and that's it.  \n\nso ignoring the ridiculous <mark>Medium <mark>Select <mark>Large Stone Crab</mark></mark></mark>, we ate this family style.  we came with a party of 10.  we ordered a few 24oz dry aged rib eyes which were very tasty.  they pre-sliced them into strips for us which was great for sharing. \n\nwe ordered enough <mark>Jumbo Alaskan King Crab Legs</mark> for everyone to get a leg and some knuckles.  \n\nwe ordered pretty much 1 of every side, along with some pork belly, shrimps and scallops.  we made quite a dent.  someone had gotten lucky at the tables and paid for dinner, but i'm going to guess we spent about $100/head, and the food was great and we all left extremely stuffed. \n\nthey comped us some free spring onions, which were also pretty tasty :)\n\n\nfrom everything we tried, i'd definitely recommend the dry aged rib eye (although you can get good steak almost everywhere on the strip these days.. i'm not gonna lie and say their steak was better than what you could have gotten at craftsteak, carnevino, cut, delmonico, prime, etc...) and the king crab was good.  for the sides, i wasn't a huge fan of the <mark>Fried Asparagus</mark>, but i did enjoy the spring onions and broccolini. \n\ni guess this place would be close to a 3.5 to me, but i'm bumping it up because i had a great time.",
