            "oh honey salt i understand why you must be on the west side but i wish you weren't so far so i could be a regular. i loved this place. the ambiance and high ceilings along with an instant greeting made me feel very welcomed. i loved the attire of the staff. you knew who was doing what depending on their matching outfits. i met a fellow foodie kim, who i know from being a foodie. so this was a perfect place for a lunch date! we had both already looked up the menu and knew we wanted to try the <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark>, so we decided on the meatball pizza as an app. came with <mark>Yukon Gold Potatoes & Caramelized Onions</mark> and a very fresh ricotta cheese. however the tomato sauce was too bland for my personal preference. i went with the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> and kim had the grilled cheese (that has a way fancier name than that). the chicken was fried to perfection and so juicy. the sweet mustard style sauce on it was so good i'd buy a bottle! it was also served with a chopped salad that was quite unique. it had radishes, edamame, and chunks of cheese. way better than fries! i had a bite of kim's grilled cheese and it was pretty bomb too, but i liked mine more. \ni also had a bloody mary as a cocktail, omg why doesn't everyone make this drink with jalape\\u00f1o vodka??! so smart! \na little overpriced, but i guess that's summerlin for you. the service was very good, til the end it got a little slow while waiting for our bill. i brought my boyfriend a <mark>Green Goodness Juice</mark>, made with kale, apples, fennel, celery and whatever other green things i'm forgetting. it was healthy and delicious and i love that it was a menu option.\nill return for dinner, and i look forward to everything but the bill!", 
            "very friendly helpful staff\n\nfood was enjoyable - perfect execution of the salmon - requested rare and it came out perfect! <mark>Green Goodness Juice</mark> was great.\n\nprefer real bread instead of the complimentary cheese flatbread provided at start of meal.\n\nunderstand that interior design theme is eclectic, however, execution is the key for eclectic design.  for instance - mirror walls needs to be fuller with less open space - cheap wood and architectural details of bar seemed out of place", 
            "i highly recommend this place. my family and i enjoy coming here. the <mark>Monkey Bread</mark> and the <mark>Green Goodness Juice</mark> are my faves."

            "the ambiance is great. it's a cute little place that is very chic. the waiters are dressed as farmers, with plaid shirts and jeans. i went there for brunch on sunday. it was crowded. we waited about ten minutes for a table, which i thought wasn't not bad at all. \n\ni was torn between two choices. i didn't know if i wanted breakfast or lunch. i either wanted the <mark>Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes</mark> or the barely buzzed chedder sandwich. since i was more in the mood for breakfast i went with the pancakes. that means i need to go back for lunch! :) \n\nthe pancakes were awesome. they were drizzled with lemon sauce which i love because blueberry and lemon flavors go so well together! the portion was just enough. i felt satisfied but not overly full. \n\nthis place struck me as somewhere that is great for breakfast, lunch or brunch. i heard they are open for dinner but i think i would just stick to those three meals. \n\ni will definitely be going back here for some more breakfast (want to try the <mark>Monkey Bread</mark>!) and lunch for the sandwich and the desserts!", 
            "after reading some media hype about this new local restaurant, i invited some friends for sunday brunch.  there were 3 of us total (not counting the wee-little one in the baby carriage!).  overall, the restaurant is beautiful, the food was very good, and the environment is welcoming and chic.  for me, the food (and drinks) are a bit overpriced warranting a 4 stars instead of a 5.  \n\nwe arrived around noon about 30 minutes after they open and were seated right away.  as we left around 1:30, there were still some empty tables.  \n\nfood - my share of the bill was $47.  whoa is right.  here's what a $47 sunday brunch off the strip will get you.  for starters we shared the new england fry.  it was yummy, but a small portion for the price.  two bloody-orange mimosas set me back $20.  again, overpriced for a mimosa.  i ordered the filet mignon stacked sliders with egg and cream spinach.  it comes with a side of roasted potatoes.  all in all, it was good - but didn't quite give me that \"oh my geez\" awesomeness i hoped for.  for dessert we shared the cookie platter, which includes 3 large warm fresh-baked cookies.  \n\nthe brunch menu was a bit odd to me.  i would like to see a few more breakfast items on the menu that are not pancakes, <mark>Strawberry Shortcake French Toast</mark>, or <mark>Monkey Bread</mark>.  i'm not looking for ihop food here, but i think the chefs could be a bit more creative  with their use of other breakfast foods.  \n\n\nam i glad i tried honey salt?  yes\n\nwill i be back to honey salt soon?  probably not (unless they announce they offer two-for-one drinks!)\n\nif i had another $50 to spend on brunch, would i do this again?  no, i would try a different place.", 
            "plates selected:\n\nwhite bean puree with lavosh and honey rolls\n\nxl sicky bun with baked citrus brioche, honey bourbon sauce\n\ncrunchy nutella <mark>Strawberry Shortcake French Toast</mark> with caramelized bananas and whipped cream\n\nfilet mignon stacked slider with scrambled eggs, creamed spinach, beehive cheddar, roast breakfast potatoes\n\nwarm bread pudding with bourbon toffee sauce, honey, and salted whipped cream\n\nreturning to dining after a bit of shopping our arrival at the highly touted honey salt for brunch was met by the expected crowd - the large, warm, and rustic dining room near full - but unexpectedly by one of the coldest hostesses i've ever encountered; enough that we nearly considered walking out until another young woman stepped in, welcomed us and assured us it would be only a short wait for a table, and subsequently seated us in the center of the dining room.  say what you will about \"first impressions,\" this was the sort that most certainly stuck out and probably colored the rest of the 'experience' aspect of honey salt - service lacking in nearly all regards as our waitress, julie, neglected both empty glasses and dirty plates as she bustled around the room.\n\nmoving past service snafus to that which was presented on the plate i must say that things improved dramatically as soon as the bread basket arrived and focusing mostly on the sweet half of the menu crafted by chef esmeralda serrano - whose work i was familiar with from her time at tableau - every single plate that landed on our table was outstanding, particularly the <mark>Monkey Bread</mark> style sticky bun whose delicate balance of light acidity and sweet honey wowed with each bite and the thick, custard laden bread pudding whose richness found levity in a puffy cloud of whipped cream flecked with salt.  not generally one to order savory at breakfast/brunch, it should be noted that even my friend's sliders were excellent - the beef so tender that it formed a sort of smoky stew/scramble with the fluffy eggs and cheese.\n\nhaving heard similar negativity about the service at honey salt i should only hope they iron out these kinks sooner rather than later because much like raku this is cuisine more than capable of competing with the best of what can be found on the strip, but in order to be worth the travel a front of house matching the skills in the kitchen will be indispensable.", 
            "pre- sitting:  i would give the atmosphere 5 stars, but the service and food 3 stars.  overall a cool place, but not a destination restaurant and a bit pricey.  it is hard when a new restaurant has such a big hype, because if one thing goes wrong it is a let down.  i waited at the bar for my friends to arrive- not one person offered me anything.  asking if i wanted a water would've been a nice hospitable touch.  the hostesses are very friendly, which makes it a welcoming environment when you first walk in!  \n\ntable: we sat and i glanced over the menu and was searching desperately for some cool, home-made breakfast bakes, and some fun noshy items to share, but <mark>Monkey Bread</mark> was all we came up with so we started with that.  i ordered a cappuccino and unfortunately it came out luke warm and i had to return it.  the <mark>Monkey Bread</mark> was good, but it was drowning in butter and was missing something..a bit heavy on the bread and not enough flavor.  the server was polite, but not as on top of things as i expected reading the service reviews.  we tried the salmon, <mark>Breakfast Pizza</mark> and heirloom salad.  all the food was good, but a bit overpriced.  if this restaurant was in san fran or la it wouldn't stand out at all.\n\nsummary: i will definitely try this place again for dinner if i am in the area visiting a friend in summerlin, but wouldn't go out of my way.  if i lived closer i would come in and grab a glass of wine and get an app at the bar, because as i mentioned- the atmosphere is stunning!", 
            "went here last week for sunday brunch. love the decor- reminds me of napa. very much enjoyed the bloody mary bar you order table side. <mark>Monkey Bread</mark> was also good. i had the filet slider and it was too giant to pick up and eat with your hands so i had to do the knife and fork thing which took away from it a bit but flavors were tasty, especially the creamed spinach and the filet was nice quality. good service too. and they have a kids menu! wasn't expecting that for such a swanky type place. although they didn't have a kids breakfast, they were accommodating in whipping up some eggs and potatoes for the youngen.  i will be back for dinner though as i would like to sample some other items.", 
            "one of my favorite finds in las vegas so far. the farm to table inspired menu is incredible and you really feel like you're eating in a cozy dining room.\n\nmenu highlights:\n\nserrano ham & quince - grilled bread, mascarpone cheese, grated chestnuts, balsamic reduction\n\nxl <mark>Monkey Bread</mark> - baked citrus brioche, honey bourbon sauce\n\ncrab cake benedict - poached egg, asparagus, tomato hollandaise sauce\n\nbiloxi buttermilk fried chicken - creamy slaw, house durkees dressing, brioche roll, chopped salad\n\nsmoked beehive grilled cheddar cheese - cheesy truffle fondue, rustic sourdough & tuscan bean soup\n\nbutterscotch pudding - salted caramel sauce, <mark>Toast (White or Wheat)</mark> marshmallow, graham crumble\n\nbrookie - chocolate chip cookie meets chocolate fudge brownie, with salted caramel chunk ice cream\n\npumpkin bundt cake - bourbon pumpkin mousse, pumpkin butter, candied pepitas", 
            "i've had the pleasure of dining at honey salt for both brunch and lunch. it has an upscale feel, while still remaining casual. it's been described as \"feeling like a pottery barn.\" i quite like the ambiance, the mismatched furniture and chandeliers, it really takes me away from vegas and makes me feel like i'm at a hip restaurant in a cool city. \n\nmy husband and i first decided to check it out for lunch. he couldn't resist ordering the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> and i went with the <mark>Backyard Favorite Burger</mark>. the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> was juicy and delicious. i can see why people compare it to chik-fil-a. the burger was seasoned perfectly, i really enjoyed the tomato jam since i'm notorious for picking my tomatoes off of my burgers. the shoe string fries were a perfect side.\n\nmore recently, my friends and i decided to check out their brunch. we started with some <mark>Monkey Bread</mark> for the table. it was ooey, gooey, and so delicious. it is perfect for splitting with the table and the hints of citrus really counter the sweet honey sauce. i settled on the steak and <mark>Steak & Egg Slider</mark> and it was a great decision. the steak was super flavorful and the entire thing just worked well together. i also felt somewhat healthy since there was creamed spinach. the breakfast potatoes were more like wedge fries, but i'm not one to complain about potatoes in any form. i also split some peach pancakes with a friend and they were delicious. there were peaches baked in, but could have used some more peaches on top. \n\nit wouldn't be a girls brunch without cocktails and they have a full bar. i had a delicious strawberry, prickly pear, lime, cocktail with citrus vodka. my friends all went with the bottomless mimosas, but weren't impressed with the $20 price tag. \n\ni will definitely be back, especially for brunch, maybe even this weekend!", 
            "this place is really cute inside and the outside area is a lil nice spot when the weather is good.  \n\nrecently did a dessert dash with friends where we run and make stops for dessert and the salted caramel ice cream was my favorite.  another favorite is the <mark>Monkey Bread</mark>, it has a citrus flavor to it, so good!  i've actually had all their desserts and i'd have to say those are the best two.\n\nfood is also good, but dessert more memorable :)", 
            "what a great restaurant!  \n\ni live in nyc and was going to be in vegas with my mom and wanted to throw her a small birthday breakfast and honey salt was so helpful with the process of making a reservation for 15+ people.  our food was delicious and the restaurant had the rare quality of offering more schamncy options (like my seared ahi salad) and more every day options (like pancakes and pizzas) but appearing to give the same loving preparation to both; everyone from the two year-old to the 70+ year olds left happy and our party included folks who like burgers and fries as well as total foodies.  breakfast highlights included my salad (perfectly cooked, complex tasting salad with pistachio and citrus elements), <mark>Monkey Bread</mark> (honey bourbon gooey perfect yumminess coating every piece) and the corned beef (three people were separately raving about it).  if i lived here, this is the sort of restaurant i'd come back to repeatedly to try out anything remotely appealing on the menu; it's that good.", 
            "great food and awesome dining room decor! <mark>Monkey Bread</mark> was delicious and the farmer's toast was so fresh! the <mark><mark>House Made Corned Beef Hash</mark></mark> was also very tasty. definitely a must-go if you like farm to table dining!", 
            "i've been 3 times now, the most recent being tonight, and each time has been a great experience. i've had several different dishes, including the restaurant week <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> and meatballs, which were delicious. the <mark>Monkey Bread</mark> is out of this world and tonight i had kale and white bean soup and the shrimp and linguini. the sauce in the linguini was a little boring and i expected the soup to be thicker and more hearty but the food has always been top notch.\n\nservice today in the lounge was a little aloof, not very engaging.", 
            "as a man who loves himself some brunch. i must say, honey salt is defqon level 9 delicioso. i first had honey salt when someone brought me their leftovers. then i had the pleasure of nomming down at lib. now you have my attention, so when my friends ask me to brunch, i made sure this was where we went and it went down. the decor is pretty classy. there's tables, but there's also couches and we got seated comfortably. we got started with the <mark>Monkey Bread</mark> which was www.bomb.com. it was like a super upgraded version of cinnamon rolls, so good we had it as an appetizer and as dessert. \nnow onto the main entrees, my friends ordered the <mark>Steak & Egg Slider</mark> and corn <mark><mark>House Made Corned Beef Hash</mark></mark>. i on the other hand ordered the <mark>Breakfast Pizza</mark>, with a side of eating everything on my friends plate. the hash was ok, the <mark>Steak & Egg Slider</mark> were well made. i loved the <mark>Breakfast Pizza</mark> and was killed it. my actual favorite was the sausage. in the words of lana del rey \"i'll love you til the end of time, probably a million years.\" that's how serious i feel about that sausage. \nalso, mad props to our server nick, he was quick and super helpful. i read previous reviews and was extremely wary of the service, but he definitely was a 5 star. he helped with what to order made sure we were well taken care of. keep up the good work!!", 
            "this place was good but i didn't realize how off the strip it was ($45+ cab ride from the palazzo).  the drinks were awesome (we tried the mosco-ito) and we saw carrot top at the bar.  everything we ordered was great...the <mark>Monkey Bread</mark> is insane.  the frittata was excellent and the sausage and hash browns were some of the best i've ever had.  we ordered the sliders but they never arrived and the server admitted he forgot to put them in...so i can't tell you how those were.  overall, the food was great but i would only go back if it was closer to the strip--so minus 2 stars for the location and the service.", 
            "honestly, i thought this place was a little over hyped in the reviews. i ordered the caramel apple pancakes. i asked the server if they were good and he said delicious and i would love the apple butter. it was apple jam and they only gave me about a table spoon for 3 pancakes. they were soo dry i couldn't finish them. also, they really were just plain pancakes with jam on them. very over priced for $13. i did try my cousins grilled cheese and butternut soup, however, and that was delicious. also, we got an order of <mark>Monkey Bread</mark> for the table that was also amazing. i will probably give it one more shot, maybe i just picked their one bad dish.", 
            "this is my second time having brunch here. first time was when i was in town with friends on a girls trip and most recently with my husband on a quick getaway. both times i made reservation through open table, and neither time did i have any issues. upon arrival we were seated at an adorable table in the dining room. i love the look and design of this restaurant; with it's mix of shabby chic and vintage. the service was great, the food was delicious, and both times overall i had a wonderful experience. i recommend ordering a <mark>Monkey Bread</mark> for the table to share, you will not be disappointed. they do bottomless bloody mary and mimosas during brunch. they have an excellent variety of food on their menu. they do fresh juices, coffee, cocktails, and all their food is farm to table-esque.  a brunch for two people will set you back around $40-$50.  i'll definitely be back.", 
            "easily the best grilled cheese ever. <mark>Monkey Bread</mark> is ridiculously good. steak and <mark>Steak & Egg Slider</mark> are fantastic. excellent service. the hostess and luis the server were both very professional even though they were extremely busy on a sunday brunch crowd.\nvery well run kitchen and plating area.\ngreat atmosphere. can't wait to come back and try a few more things.\nvery easy decision to give five stars without hesitation.", 
            "went to honeysalt for the first time (finally) for a father's day brunch. i was a little surprised that they had a breakfast/brunch menu, but didn't even open until 10:30am. but regardless, the brunch was good. everything was served in a pretty timely matter and the staff was friendly. had a little celebrity spotting - nicolas cage came in for brunch. the vibe in the restaurant was nice - not too crazy, but not super relaxed. i think they might be in a bit of a small space - or maybe it was just busy for father's day. we started with the <mark>Monkey Bread</mark> to share - which was super yummy! i had the weekend fritatta, which was good but nothing to rave over, and a bottomless mimosa which was refilled immediately when finished - yay! my man had the corn <mark><mark>House Made Corned Beef Hash</mark></mark> which was yummy as well, and our son had the <mark>Strawberry Shortcake French Toast</mark> which was so so sweet and super tasty! it was a bit much for him and i ended up eating most of it. he ordered off the regular menu because the kid's menu was especially disappointing. it didn't have one breakfast/brunch item on it. :( overall we had a good experience at honey salt and will probably return again sometime.", 
            "i love this place, great atmosphere, friendly staff and the brunch is great. get the bottomless mimosa...they keep your glass nice and full. now for the food,  <mark>Monkey Bread</mark> is amazing, <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> so good, pancakes, <mark>Smoked Salmon Benedict</mark> oh my!!! it's all great.",

            "do not say yes to the edamame! it's not free and they will charge you $7 for it!!!!\n\nnow returning to your regular programming.\n\nthe skinny: the lauded <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> lacks balance, the <mark>Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes</mark> and layer cake are both good (3.5) service: deceptive business practices by our waiter - not cool! on top of that, the squashed seating against the wall is uncomfortable. (0) value: expensive for what it is... factor in the sh*tty service, this place ranks about a 2 starred experience.\n\ni'm still fuming about our brunch experience at honey salt. we arrived and were shown to our seat promptly. our server, julie  asked if we wanted bottled water, we said no tap water is fine. as we were getting settled and just started looking over the menu, she came back and asked \" would you like a little bit of edamame to nibble on while you go over the menu?\" \n\nmy husband automatically says yes, thinking it is complimentary. as the bread basket came by, we start to realize that we were scammed by our server. \n\n$7. $7 for a crappy weird tasting edamame with orange zest and sugar on top. (in order to make it edible, i threw on some salt and pepper which made it a lot better.) \n\nit's this kind of deceptive business practice that makes me so angry. we would have never ordered edamame here to begin with. she purposely gave us the wrong impression so that she could up charge us. \n\non our bill, we were so incensed, we actually wrote the reason why we gave her the tip we did. hell, given this behavior, she's lucky she got anything. we hoped if we at least wrote why we gave her the tip we did, it would clue management into what she was doing to the patrons at the restaurant.\n\nthe worst part is that i saw the other tables were all nibbling on $7 edamame too. how many other people were getting the same bait and switch on a dish that costs less than $1 to make? \n\non top of that, we were seated along the tables along the wall. i sat along the bench and my foot got stuck between the table leg and the bench seat. - and i am not a big person. (i'm 5'6\", wear size small and my feet are size 9.)  if we are paying at least $13 for an entree, i expect to at least to be seated comfortably - not squashed against the wall like a sardine in a can. if they would just move the tables about  2 inches away from the bench, it would instantly fix this problem.\n\nif you're talking about the food itself, it's actually kind of hit or miss.\n\nthe hubs ordered the much lauded <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> while i opted for the <mark>Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes</mark>. \n\nthe proportion was way off on <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> ($13) . i don't know but for me, when i order a <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> , i want a bit of chicken, bread and condiment with every bite. the two pieces of fried chicken overwhelmed everything else in the sandwich and made it cumbersome to eat. it probably would have been better with just 1 piece of chicken and charging you $9-10 for it. the chicken itself was well-seasoned and juicy although, the coating could have a bit more crunch to it to add a little more textural complexity. the sauce was completely forgettable.\n\nthe person who called this sandwich \"chick-fil-a on crack\" must have been smoking some magic pipeweed with hobbits in an enchanted forest when they said that because this doesn't even come close. it's okay but there really no comparison.\n\nthe chopped salad that came with the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> was okay. it's actually quite a hearty salad. cubes of carrot, edamame, greens are lightly dressed and sprinkled with some roasted  pumpkin seeds. the dressing needed a bit more acidity to brighten up the flavors of the vegetables.  i'm not so sure about the cubes of carrot with all that edamame mixed in  - it makes it difficult to eat . the thing that didn't make sense were the blocks of sharp cheddar cheese in there which detract from the freshness of the vegetables. \n\nthe <mark>Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes</mark> with lemon curd ($13) fared better. they came with plenty of blueberries scattered along the plate and served alongside a smallish dollop of lemon curd. personally, i think there needed to be more lemon curd to sufficiently cover the pancakes. although the pancake had a nice, fluffy interior, it missed that mild crispiness to the exterior which for me differentiates a good to a truly great pancake. the serving size is a bit pricey for $13 and i wouldn't order this again.\n\nfinally, dessert. i believe this was the best thing we ordered - their layer cake ($9). it's a super moist chocolate cake layered with fudge, cocoa nibs and a wonderful banana cake with cardamom. wow - it knocked our socks off. this is the kind of sophisticated dessert that is truly worth recommending. that hit of cardamom was absolutely genius!\n\nthis place would have easily been a 3.5 star review in large part due to their awesome dessert. however, given the unethical practice we encountered here, it is with a heavy heart that i give this place a 2 -starred review.", 
            "after reading numerous reviews about their <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> ($13) being described as \"chick-fil-a on crack\", i was definitely intrigued. i'm an avid chick-fil-a fan, and in fact, it is probably my fave fast food chain. unfortunately, the closest location is in la, but whenever we are in the area, we will make it a point to stop by.\n\ni have to vehemently disagree with the other reviews on this one. when i order a <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>, i expect a certain amount of crispy, crunchy texture. honey salt's rendition is more like a grilled <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>, albeit a decent one, and lacks sufficient fried goodness. in addition, the durkee's dressing sauce was utterly forgettable. not only are chick-fil-a's chicken and selection of sauces vastly superior, but it's also a much better value. alternatively, i'd rather get the southern <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> at the cheesecake factory across the street in boca park. the chopped salad that it comes with was an utter disappointment as well. it consisted of radishes, edamame, carrots, kale, pumpkin seeds, cubes of sharp cheddar cheese, and mixed greens. an interesting collection, but ultimately the flavors were neither harmonious nor enjoyable.\n\nthe <mark>Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes</mark> with lemon curd ($13) had a nice, fluffy texture inside, but lacked any sort of exterior crispiness, the hallmark of a really good pancake.\n\ndessert was the highlight. their triple layer cake ($9) was very interesting and tasty. it consisted of dense chocolate cake layered with fudge and banana cake with cardamom and coated with buttercream frosting. although it is a bit pricey for the portion size and it could be more moist, this is the one item we would probably order again.\n\nas for the service... let's start back at the beginning. after being seated, our server, julie, asks us what kind of bottled water we want to drink. we decline and ask for tap water. she then asks if we would like to snack on some edamame while we peruse the menu. i'm thinking it is complimentary, especially since i do not see edamame listed anywhere on the brunch menu, so we say okay. after we make our brunch selections, the bread basket comes out with some sort of bean dip. at first we are a bit confused. is this what she meant by the edamame? is this an edamame dip? if so, why isn't it green? btw, the bread and lavosh was totally unremarkable. several minutes later, we get the edamame sprinkled with some citrus zest. we end up adding some salt and pepper because it so bland. the shocker was when we get our bill and it shows we were charged $7 for edamame! we were both instantly infuriated. we wouldn't have ordered edamame to begin with and certainly not for $7! not in the mood to argue with the server and/or manager, we tipped less than we normally would and even wrote a brief note why. we can tolerate slow, inattentive service to a certain degree, but not deception and trickery to run up the bill. as we looked around, we noted a few other tables who had said yes to the edamame as well. we found it odd that none of the other numerous yelp reviews/tips mention the non-complimentary edamame.\n\nin summary, the food itself rates about 3 stars. deceptive, aggressive upcharging knocks it down to a 2-star experience overall.\n\nconsider yourself warned. just say no to the edamame! it's not complimentary and definitely not worth $7!", 
            "the ambiance is great. it's a cute little place that is very chic. the waiters are dressed as farmers, with plaid shirts and jeans. i went there for brunch on sunday. it was crowded. we waited about ten minutes for a table, which i thought wasn't not bad at all. \n\ni was torn between two choices. i didn't know if i wanted breakfast or lunch. i either wanted the <mark>Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes</mark> or the barely buzzed chedder sandwich. since i was more in the mood for breakfast i went with the pancakes. that means i need to go back for lunch! :) \n\nthe pancakes were awesome. they were drizzled with lemon sauce which i love because blueberry and lemon flavors go so well together! the portion was just enough. i felt satisfied but not overly full. \n\nthis place struck me as somewhere that is great for breakfast, lunch or brunch. i heard they are open for dinner but i think i would just stick to those three meals. \n\ni will definitely be going back here for some more breakfast (want to try the <mark>Monkey Bread</mark>!) and lunch for the sandwich and the desserts!", 
            "i ate at honey salt for dinner friday with a couple of friends. thoroughly enjoyed the grilled octopus and scallop ceviche appetizers. their octopus app was refined and balanced, very well constructed. first a base of a wonderful romesco sauce, some patatas bravas (tasted like roasted fingerling potatoes) resting on the sauce, topped with beautifully grilled octopus garnished with herbs, an oil drizzle, and a drops of a cream sauce all pull this dish together. i dare say it certainly gives the dish at milos a run for its money. their burger had a nice blend of meats in their custom grind, i ordered it with the fried egg of course. i enjoyed the burger, but it paled in comparison to both appetizers. the brown bag peach cobbler had a nice crumble and a good amount of cinnamon and some nutmeg which i found to very pleasing. great service this meal from andrew and a very good overall experience.\n\ni returned to honey salt just 2 days later to have sunday brunch with my sister, brother in law, and my young nephew who were visiting from la. we ordered the <mark>Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes</mark> with lemon curd, <mark><mark>House Made Corned Beef Hash</mark></mark>, and <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> which were all quickly devoured by the 3 of us. what a great meal! some of the best pancakes in town! perfectly cooked, fluffy and moist with ample blueberries. the lemon curd was a perfect complement to the blueberries. not that it needs it, for i could easily finish all the pancakes with just the lemon curd alone...but a little drizzle of the maple syrup is a nice addition to this plate. the <mark><mark>House Made Corned Beef Hash</mark></mark> is very good as well. <mark>Toast (White or Wheat)</mark> slices of crusty bread topped with finely diced pieces of corned beef and potatoes finished with a sunny side up egg waiting to be cut so the yolk can run. the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> was one of the best hot <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> i've eaten (bunk sandwiches in portland has a remarkable cold <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>). again exceptional service, this time from joanne who was very pleasant and helped us with our food selection and continually made sure we had everything we needed. \n\nwill definitely be coming back for brunch soon!!! hopefully for the truffled grilled cheese, crab benedict, and the caramelized banana and nutella <mark>Strawberry Shortcake French Toast</mark>!"

            "the location and decor are already amazing.  i had the <mark>Strawberry Shortcake French Toast</mark> and it was to die for.  foodies will definitely love this place as i couldn't understand all of what was on the menu...my sister and dad got the grilled cheese and that was delicious as well. no wonder this place is always packed!", 
            "after reading some media hype about this new local restaurant, i invited some friends for sunday brunch.  there were 3 of us total (not counting the wee-little one in the baby carriage!).  overall, the restaurant is beautiful, the food was very good, and the environment is welcoming and chic.  for me, the food (and drinks) are a bit overpriced warranting a 4 stars instead of a 5.  \n\nwe arrived around noon about 30 minutes after they open and were seated right away.  as we left around 1:30, there were still some empty tables.  \n\nfood - my share of the bill was $47.  whoa is right.  here's what a $47 sunday brunch off the strip will get you.  for starters we shared the new england fry.  it was yummy, but a small portion for the price.  two bloody-orange mimosas set me back $20.  again, overpriced for a mimosa.  i ordered the filet mignon stacked sliders with egg and cream spinach.  it comes with a side of roasted potatoes.  all in all, it was good - but didn't quite give me that \"oh my geez\" awesomeness i hoped for.  for dessert we shared the cookie platter, which includes 3 large warm fresh-baked cookies.  \n\nthe brunch menu was a bit odd to me.  i would like to see a few more breakfast items on the menu that are not pancakes, <mark>Strawberry Shortcake French Toast</mark>, or <mark>Monkey Bread</mark>.  i'm not looking for ihop food here, but i think the chefs could be a bit more creative  with their use of other breakfast foods.  \n\n\nam i glad i tried honey salt?  yes\n\nwill i be back to honey salt soon?  probably not (unless they announce they offer two-for-one drinks!)\n\nif i had another $50 to spend on brunch, would i do this again?  no, i would try a different place.", 
            "went here for lunch with friends and my 4 year old.  i had the fritatta (yum)  my husband had the filet sliders which he enjoyed.  my friend had the <mark>Strawberry Shortcake French Toast</mark> which was deeelish.\n\ngreat place for kids.  they brought out a cool table mat that you can color with markers.  they have the cutest ice cream sundae!  my son loved the \"dirt in worms.\"  he also enjoyed his pizza.\n\nour food took a while to come so the chef bought us all dessert!!  the apple pie in the bag and the bread pudding are amazing!\n\ni will definitely be back.", 
            "i really wanted to love honey salt. as a huge (figuratively & in reality) fan of the shop local, eat local, drink local movement, honey salt encompassed all this as they source locally for their supplies. and it is in the perfect location as my manwhore lives in queensridge. it could really have been our go-to non-casino place. \n\natmosphere was very nice, big change from the wine bar that was there. fat people seating was decent. sturdy armless chairs. hip friendly.  (see below for further info on this) \n\nfood: broad selection for most everyone. free range chicken cooked to perfection. tender steak. great sides & decent drinks. \nbrunch was full of interesting food. i had the bananas foster <mark>Strawberry Shortcake French Toast</mark>. delightful. shared <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark> that had perfect <mark>Yukon Gold Potatoes & Caramelized Onions</mark>.   biloxi buttermilk fried chicken - just like my grammy used to make (except in alabama) \n \nso why only 3 stars? \n\nwe went 3 times, lunch, dinner & brunch. all 3 times, despite having open tables in the main area, we were seated past the bar next to the bathroom and where they put the \"families with kids\" - which we are one but he's 22. normally we wouldn't care except that it is a virtual runway to the bathroom. my only reasoning on why this would happen on 3 very separate occasions is that we don't exactly fit the \"hipster\" image they wish to cater too. we are older (with black amex cards i might add) we are a racially diverse group & we are on the plumper side of plump. \n\nservice: as we were seated in the \"back 40\" - we had to wait. wait for drinks. wait for food. wait for our check. while the aforementioned manwhore was annoyed that they didn't remember us until i pointed out, different times, different staff, he did manage to have a few choice words with the manager on duty. \n\nit's sad because i did like the food but unless we get takeout or my son & i go alone, i'm pretty sure we wont be back.", 
            "i think i lean more towards 3.75 stars. \n\ni love the decor and ambiance. service was just ok as my husband had to chase down our server to pay. i had asked for a more private area since i had the baby with us and just in case she decided to scream her head off we wouldn't be the center of attention. \n\nwe started of with the new england fry.  yummy seafood with just the right amount of crispy and not overcooked.  i decided to go for the banana foster <mark>Strawberry Shortcake French Toast</mark> in hopes that it wasn't too sweet. my husband got the all popular <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>. my <mark>Strawberry Shortcake French Toast</mark> was amazing...the cornflake crust and the thick bread with caramelized bananas soooooo good.  my tummy rumbles just thinking about it. it definitely was just the right amount of sweetness which my palate isn't too sweet. i was super excited to try the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> as many people have compared it to the famous chick fil a <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> but i was a bit disappointed. i wasn't in love with the sandwich and i didn't think it was omg good. it was decent but i wouldn't order it again. maybe it was just an off day but in any case i wasn't impressed. \n\noverall service was ok for a sunday during brunch. they weren't packed or anything like that.  this place is pricey for brunch but i would like to come back for dinner and try that. the portions are smaller so if you aren't a hungry hippo like us then you will definitely leave satisfied.", 
            "plates selected:\n\nwhite bean puree with lavosh and honey rolls\n\nxl sicky bun with baked citrus brioche, honey bourbon sauce\n\ncrunchy nutella <mark>Strawberry Shortcake French Toast</mark> with caramelized bananas and whipped cream\n\nfilet mignon stacked slider with scrambled eggs, creamed spinach, beehive cheddar, roast breakfast potatoes\n\nwarm bread pudding with bourbon toffee sauce, honey, and salted whipped cream\n\nreturning to dining after a bit of shopping our arrival at the highly touted honey salt for brunch was met by the expected crowd - the large, warm, and rustic dining room near full - but unexpectedly by one of the coldest hostesses i've ever encountered; enough that we nearly considered walking out until another young woman stepped in, welcomed us and assured us it would be only a short wait for a table, and subsequently seated us in the center of the dining room.  say what you will about \"first impressions,\" this was the sort that most certainly stuck out and probably colored the rest of the 'experience' aspect of honey salt - service lacking in nearly all regards as our waitress, julie, neglected both empty glasses and dirty plates as she bustled around the room.\n\nmoving past service snafus to that which was presented on the plate i must say that things improved dramatically as soon as the bread basket arrived and focusing mostly on the sweet half of the menu crafted by chef esmeralda serrano - whose work i was familiar with from her time at tableau - every single plate that landed on our table was outstanding, particularly the <mark>Monkey Bread</mark> style sticky bun whose delicate balance of light acidity and sweet honey wowed with each bite and the thick, custard laden bread pudding whose richness found levity in a puffy cloud of whipped cream flecked with salt.  not generally one to order savory at breakfast/brunch, it should be noted that even my friend's sliders were excellent - the beef so tender that it formed a sort of smoky stew/scramble with the fluffy eggs and cheese.\n\nhaving heard similar negativity about the service at honey salt i should only hope they iron out these kinks sooner rather than later because much like raku this is cuisine more than capable of competing with the best of what can be found on the strip, but in order to be worth the travel a front of house matching the skills in the kitchen will be indispensable.",

            "went to honeysalt for the first time (finally) for a father's day brunch. i was a little surprised that they had a breakfast/brunch menu, but didn't even open until 10:30am. but regardless, the brunch was good. everything was served in a pretty timely matter and the staff was friendly. had a little celebrity spotting - nicolas cage came in for brunch. the vibe in the restaurant was nice - not too crazy, but not super relaxed. i think they might be in a bit of a small space - or maybe it was just busy for father's day. we started with the <mark>Monkey Bread</mark> to share - which was super yummy! i had the weekend fritatta, which was good but nothing to rave over, and a bottomless mimosa which was refilled immediately when finished - yay! my man had the corn <mark><mark>House Made Corned Beef Hash</mark></mark> which was yummy as well, and our son had the <mark>Strawberry Shortcake French Toast</mark> which was so so sweet and super tasty! it was a bit much for him and i ended up eating most of it. he ordered off the regular menu because the kid's menu was especially disappointing. it didn't have one breakfast/brunch item on it. :( overall we had a good experience at honey salt and will probably return again sometime.",

            "went to honeysalt for the first time (finally) for a father's day brunch. i was a little surprised that they had a breakfast/brunch menu, but didn't even open until 10:30am. but regardless, the brunch was good. everything was served in a pretty timely matter and the staff was friendly. had a little celebrity spotting - nicolas cage came in for brunch. the vibe in the restaurant was nice - not too crazy, but not super relaxed. i think they might be in a bit of a small space - or maybe it was just busy for father's day. we started with the <mark>Monkey Bread</mark> to share - which was super yummy! i had the weekend fritatta, which was good but nothing to rave over, and a bottomless mimosa which was refilled immediately when finished - yay! my man had the corn <mark><mark>House Made Corned Beef Hash</mark></mark> which was yummy as well, and our son had the <mark>Strawberry Shortcake French Toast</mark> which was so so sweet and super tasty! it was a bit much for him and i ended up eating most of it. he ordered off the regular menu because the kid's menu was especially disappointing. it didn't have one breakfast/brunch item on it. :( overall we had a good experience at honey salt and will probably return again sometime."

            "i've had the pleasure of dining at honey salt for both brunch and lunch. it has an upscale feel, while still remaining casual. it's been described as \"feeling like a pottery barn.\" i quite like the ambiance, the mismatched furniture and chandeliers, it really takes me away from vegas and makes me feel like i'm at a hip restaurant in a cool city. \n\nmy husband and i first decided to check it out for lunch. he couldn't resist ordering the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> and i went with the <mark>Backyard Favorite Burger</mark>. the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> was juicy and delicious. i can see why people compare it to chik-fil-a. the burger was seasoned perfectly, i really enjoyed the tomato jam since i'm notorious for picking my tomatoes off of my burgers. the shoe string fries were a perfect side.\n\nmore recently, my friends and i decided to check out their brunch. we started with some <mark>Monkey Bread</mark> for the table. it was ooey, gooey, and so delicious. it is perfect for splitting with the table and the hints of citrus really counter the sweet honey sauce. i settled on the steak and <mark>Steak & Egg Slider</mark> and it was a great decision. the steak was super flavorful and the entire thing just worked well together. i also felt somewhat healthy since there was creamed spinach. the breakfast potatoes were more like wedge fries, but i'm not one to complain about potatoes in any form. i also split some peach pancakes with a friend and they were delicious. there were peaches baked in, but could have used some more peaches on top. \n\nit wouldn't be a girls brunch without cocktails and they have a full bar. i had a delicious strawberry, prickly pear, lime, cocktail with citrus vodka. my friends all went with the bottomless mimosas, but weren't impressed with the $20 price tag. \n\ni will definitely be back, especially for brunch, maybe even this weekend!", 
            "we decided to go to honey salt  for brunch to celebrate my mother in law and sons birthday. i made a reservation as we had 8 people in the group and placed a note on the reservation that we would be there celebrating  the two birthdays. upon arrival i checked in with the hostess and let her know we had a reservation at 10:30am for 8 people under the last name torres. she said \" oh yes okay\" and we were seated by who i assume is the manager. \n\nthe table was nice and spacious and we were seated next to the kitchen which was neat. our server was very gracious and attentive as was the rest of the wait staff. we never had to ask them to remove plates or fill water, they were always on top of everything. \n\nmy mother in law ordered the peaches and cream pancakes , myself and two others ordered the steak and <mark>Steak & Egg Slider</mark> my husband got the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> and my children got the \"kids\" cheeseburger, we also got a pizza for the table to share. everything tasted very good, and for the most part everyone enjoyed their food. my only plight with the food is that the portions are very small for the price and we ordered the cheeseburgers well done for the kids, one came medium rare the other medium. i didnt say anything because my son didnt notice and had eaten half of it. i also ordered the blood orange mimosa which was so so. \n\nnow the reason for two stars, not one person acknowledged that we were celebrating birthdays. i work in the industry, as a host, at one of the busiest restaurants on the strip. we acknowledge every celebration, every guest every time, especially if its noted on the reservation. this small gesture makes all the difference to your patrons who are spending their hard earned money at your local establishment. as we left i confronted the hostess, i saw on her ipad she didnt even check me in for my reservation but instead placed me as a walk in, then when she actually looked, saw my reservation and the notes. i asked to speak with the manager who could obviously care less and offered me a brownie to go which i declined.  my son is seven and he would have been very excited to have his birthday not only acknowledged but a desert brought out so we could sing to him and my mother in law.\n\nall in all the food and wait staff deserve 4 stars. the management, host and customer service get a two. and i feel thats being generous.",

            "beautiful restaurant, with stylish decor and good lighting. they should get 5 stars for offering farm to table options and healthier items. however food concepts seem great but  miss the mark in flavor and appeal. \n\ni visited twice, service impeccable both times. just before christmas, our group had the fried chicken, scallops, a pizza, roasted cauliflower, <mark>Heirloom Tomato & Burrata</mark> & quinoa salad and the bean soup, it was all good, but not great, just seemed like something was missing from making the items taste awesome or worth the $200 bill.  i decided to go back again to give it a second chance, this time we tried the burger , caesar salad, yogurt spinach and bean soup again.  \n\nunfortunately the medium rare burger was all rare, literally soft raw meat falling from patty on to plate. i told my mom to send it back but she has fear of doing that, so she managed to eat 70% of it, not wanting to waste the $20, but it turned her off and she does not want to return. her french fries were incredibly salty that they literally burned/irritated the roof of our mouths and tongues, i am assuming this is just a bad batch.\n\ni enjoyed the bean soap first time but second time it was very bland, as was the yogurt creamed spinach.\n\nall of their salads were delicious and the scallops good but i think vg scallops taste better.\n\ni would recommend checking the place out as it is so pleasantly designed but not sure if the food will knock your socks off.\n\nyou may enjoy just going for wine or dessert or checking out the bar if you are not willing to drop $30-50 per person.", 
            "friendly staff. good cocktails, amazing food. food was very balanced.  the <mark>Heirloom Tomato & Burrata</mark> salad was amazing. tried it with chocolate and it was a whole new experience. the octopus was tender and went well with the potatoes. the short rib was so tender it melted away my heart. dessert although not here yet, bread pudding will be epic. server was awesome very knowledgable.......the dessert that came at some point was awesome. so rich and paired nicely with the ice cream. will be back"

            "my family and i came here twice this week during our vacation in las vegas. honey salt is a welcome escape from the disappointing quality of food on the strip, and a great dining experience in its own right. it is a 5-star, 4-star restaurant.\n\nwhat i mean is that food aside, all the details were perfect. the design language was consistent from utensils, to seating, to the interior design. the exposed but artful brick wall is easy on the eyes. it was playful, verging on eclectic, but not kitsch or pastiche. an interesting touch is the free salt scrub in the bathroom.\n\nit doesn't take itself too seriously but is excellent where it counts. great dining experience stripped of all pretentiousness. wait staff were very attentive, helpful, and pleasant.\n\nas for the food, we had the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>, grilled octopus, <mark>Grain Power</mark> salad, burger, roasted eggplant, margherita pizza, burrata/fig/tomato/chocolate salad, peach pie, and ice cream.\n\nthe <mark>Grain Power</mark> was definitely the best dish. flavorful, light, and all the ingredients worked well together (shaved fennel, baby clementine, mint, red and white quinoa, avocado, chicken, dill, sunflower seed(?)). the burger was ok. the grilled octopus was good, very tender. roasted eggplant was good. the margherita pizza was solid, and just the way i like it: very thin, light sauce. it was maybe a bit a bland a touch too cool when it came to the table. the burrata salad was good but while all its individual ingredients shone (loved the bittersweet chocolate) they didn't combine into something more than the sum of its parts, like the <mark>Grain Power</mark> salad. peach pie and the ice cream were also good.\n\ni'd definitely come here again and recommend it to anyone in the area."

            "honey salt is the newest restaurant to open in summerlin, tucked away in the corner suite that was once occupied by nora's wine bar at the nw corner of rampart and charleston.  offering a menu inspired by comfort food with farm to table ingredients, as well as a seasonal cocktail menu, i can easily see this restaurant becoming a locals favorite.\n\nthere are three menus that are available depending on the time of day you dine in.  lunch is served from 11:30am - 3:00pm (http://honeysalt.com/menus/lunch-menu/), dinner is served from 5:00pm till closing (http://honeysalt.com/menus/dinner-menu/), and there is an \"in-between\" menu served between lunch and dinner that seems to be a scaled back offering of the lunch options.  i stopped in during lunch and dined at the bar, where i started with a midnight rambler: a specialty cocktail made with bourbon, bitters, honey and orange peel.  the honey added just the right amount of sweetness to balance out the drink without overpowering the bourbon; my kind of drink!\n\nfor lunch i had their <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>: creamy slaw, durkees dressing, brioche roll, served with a chopped salad (photo: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/honey-salt-las-vegas?select=lq4mqi9nm-ycsd6-r2kdiq#lq4mqi9nm-ycsd6-r2kdiq).  this is a very, very good <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>.  there are two pieces of chicken that are lightly breaded and very juicy, which gets complimented by pickled and mustard flavors from the other ingredients.  it's one of those dishes that is so good that i'll have to convince myself to order something else the next time i visit...\n\na big surprise was the salad that is served with this sandwich.  don't let the \"chopped salad\" description fool you, it's a salad served with cubed cheddar, edamame, carrots, radishes, avocado and i think kale.  very good salad that came together well texturally; i would order this on its own if i wanted a lighter meal.\n\noverall honey salt screams quality.  i'm pretty darn sure this review will get bumped to 5-stars after i try some more things on the menu.  will they be successful?  time will tell.  or you could listen to me and eat there now, before word spreads and you're no longer able to walk in without having to wait for a table.", 
            "our server said that the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> with creamy slaw, durkees (kinid of a honey mustard) dressing on a brioche roll was \"wow\".\n\nshe was right.\n\nit is so nice to have a legitimate restaurant in the corner of chili's, p.f. changs, and claim jumper.", 
            "the evening started out pretty good.  the place was packed and we were quoted a 25 minute wait.  the bartender was nice and our wait was only ten minutes.  the place was packed in the middle of the week for dinner, so i guess this is the new hot spot in summerlin.\n\nafter waiting a while, a server delivered some bread, some basic white rolls, but didn't really explain what it was served with. it took a few tastes to figure out but, i think, that the spread was some sort of bean dip.  not really my thing.\n\nwe tried the new england fry - calamari, ipswich clams, and shishito peppers.  it was ok.  the caesar salad was amazing.  they also offered a kale option for the caesar salad.  not sure what that option was about - if they just added kale or substituted kale for lettuce.  it was really too noisy to get details.\n\ni tried the chicken curry and it was mostly carrots.  a lot of carrots.  the raita that came with the dish was good, but once that ran out i stopped eating.\n\nservice was odd.  various servers kept pouring ice water into my club soda, which was annoying, especially since the house water does not taste good at all.  and my husband ordered a beer, in a bottle no less, before our entrees came.  but the beer did not arrive until after we finished our entrees.  it was comped but by then we were ready to bail.  it took a while to get a check.  our server had tables scattered through the restaurant so our server was hard to catch.\n\nthey have outdoor seating but even though the weather was nice, the tables were set, and there was a wait, no one was seated out there.  it was the same type of outdoor seating nora's had - a stunning view of the parking lot and banana republic.  maybe the servers didn't want to bother with it?  so the jury is out on the outdoor seating option.  frankly, i didn't notice until after we left or i would have asked about it.\n\nmy fault for coming to a restaurant within the first few weeks it is open.  i think i'll give it a few months and try again.  the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> was not offered for dinner so i'll have to try lunch.", 
            "what a day for my phone to die.  no yelp check-in, no pictures of my food or the space, but i do have a review!  my friend and i originally rsvp'ed for the uye event, had to cancel, and then were able to go at the last minute on our own.  we arrived upon the restaurant opening at 11:30am and the first impression upon walking in is the refreshing, open area with clean, bright lines and a homey feeling, modern and old-school simultaneously.  the staff is mostly clad in flannel shirts and aprons, so there's a down south feel to the place that is comforting.  i went with the grilled barely buzzed cheddar cheese sandwich served with tuscan bean soup and my gal pal had the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>.  i have to say that, upon tasting her sandwich, i wish i had ordered it!  i'm not a fan of <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> in general, but honey salt's is an exception--i'd highly recommend it!  my lunch was tasty, too, but hers was fantastic!  service was attentive and friendly throughout the meal and i can safely say that i'll be back to have the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> all to myself.  honey salt is a welcome addition to the neighborhood.",

            "absolutely delicious.\n\n   i came for lunch on a wednesday with my wife, we have been really excited to try this new restaurant since we have heard nothing but rave reviews! well, to our satisfaction it really lived up to all the hype!\n\n   now, i wasn't impressed because the complexity of the dish, rather the simple, fresh and deliciously put together ingredients. i ordered the \"crispy <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>\" my wife decided to try the grilled cheese, which i can't remember the exact menu name. both were amazing, i wouldn't hesitate to order the same exact meal again.\n\n  final impression? i am very excited to have such a great new restaurant in the area. i have a feeling honey salt is going to be around for a long time!", 
            "finally had a chance to try the trendiest place in town to eat at. i do live on the south side so it was journey traveling all the way here just to grab a bite for lunch. i've passed rampart commons numerous times, but never actually shopped at any of the stores. i immediately notice that more than half the cars are luxury cars with range rovers appearing the most, welcome to summerlin i guess? \n\nanyway so honey salt is tucked in the corner, a larger sign would probably help them to be more noticeable not that they don't already have good marketing tactics. apon walking inside from what i remember the walls are mainly composed of bricks. the restaurant is definitely trying to give off that farm vibe, but definitely modern and classy at the same time. a chandelier in a farm though? haha, i guess that was an accent piece.  i already knew i was going to order the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> because of what misti and anthony had said in their reviews. chick fil a on crack ay? prior to our food arriving we received our bread and these crispy things almost like pita chips but much thinner. the bread was very similar or even identical to what filipinos call \"pan de sal,\" but this was a wheat version. nothing special but the cripy things were rather good and fun to dip with into the white bean dip puree according to my friend? our food came out pretty quick maybe 15 minutes or so? my friend raved about how good the kale salad was the last time she was here to the point she even dreamt about it. thankfully the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> came with a salad that had kale in it and i was looking forward to it since i've never had kale before. the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> was rather stuffed, but that's what i expect when paying $13. the breading on the chicken was pretty good, the honey mustard was probably my favorite part. usually there isn't enough sauce on sandwiches, but this was the prefect amount. nice slaw inside the sandwich as well. overall it was good, but i don't know if it's something to do back flips over if you know what i mean? the side salad was mainly composed of edamame, a little bit of kale, a lot of these seeds (i don't know what kind it was), but which was good. maybe some type of vinaigrette would have been nice? my friend ordered the meatballs and offered me a bite and that was okay too. our server julie was pretty good except i felt like at one point we kind of lost her. the service was definitely better than what i expected based on the early reviews of when they first started. lastly we ordered the chocolate cake for dessert! omg soo good probably one of the best pieces of cake i've ever had. 3 layer cake with banana cake in the middle. i thought that was a really nice so it wouldn't be too overwhelming with the chocolate. the frosting outside the cake was light fluffy and not too overly sweet.  i think if i came here again i might just order dessert since the other options seem delicious.", 
            "i think 30% of the people rating this restaurant don't understand how to use yelp, or for that matter the internet in general. no one cares that one time you thought about going there but changed your mind because you are insecure and felt like the hostess was judging you and gave you the stink eye, or whatever other nonsense you've just made up in your head. that's not how this works fools!!! \nsorry but this is not a one or two star restaurant! don't get me wrong, this is not joel robuchon or guy savoy. what it is, is a great neighborhood restaurant that offers an elevated dining experience in an area that is desperate for something better than another chili's or olive garden.  i understand for a lot of people this is considered a pricier restaurant, it is definitely comparable to \"strip prices,\" so i can understand that it may not be for everyone. being someone who eats on the strip almost everyday, i don't mind paying the slightly higher price to be in my own neighborhood and eating something comforting and delicious. \ni've had a really positive experience on all 3 of my visits. through, a bit more expensive, i prefer the dinner menu over lunch. on my last visit i had the mac and cheese, which was so delicious; it has a slight spice from the green chiles and the kale provides a nice break from a sea of cheese. we shared the scallops which are similar to my favorite preparation kim canteenwalla used at society; served w vanilla scented cauliflower puree (ask for extra puree!) the burrata salad was good, but needed some salt. the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> is great, very moist, and perfectly breaded, i wish they didn't use honey mustard as it really overpowers the flavor of the chicken, but should've made their own sauce to complement it. the bread pudding is a must, but do it with the salted caramel ice cream!! the apple pie can be skipped, its a miss; heavy crust, boring flavor. \noverall, this is a great gem. i would say its a solid 4 stars, but i had to up my rating to make up for all of the silliness on here!", 
            "this place is always packed every time i walk by.  you should definitely call ahead and make reservations if you're planning to come friday or saturday night.  the ambience is great.  i felt like i walked into an anthropologie catalog.  i had the scallops that were seared to perfection and insanely sweet.  they were some of the best scallops i've head in a long time.  my husband had the seafood risotto, one of their daily specials, and love dit.  i've heard so much about their <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> that i will definitely come back for lunch and try it.", 
            "oh honey salt i understand why you must be on the west side but i wish you weren't so far so i could be a regular. i loved this place. the ambiance and high ceilings along with an instant greeting made me feel very welcomed. i loved the attire of the staff. you knew who was doing what depending on their matching outfits. i met a fellow foodie kim, who i know from being a foodie. so this was a perfect place for a lunch date! we had both already looked up the menu and knew we wanted to try the <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark>, so we decided on the meatball pizza as an app. came with <mark>Yukon Gold Potatoes & Caramelized Onions</mark> and a very fresh ricotta cheese. however the tomato sauce was too bland for my personal preference. i went with the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> and kim had the grilled cheese (that has a way fancier name than that). the chicken was fried to perfection and so juicy. the sweet mustard style sauce on it was so good i'd buy a bottle! it was also served with a chopped salad that was quite unique. it had radishes, edamame, and chunks of cheese. way better than fries! i had a bite of kim's grilled cheese and it was pretty bomb too, but i liked mine more. \ni also had a bloody mary as a cocktail, omg why doesn't everyone make this drink with jalape\\u00f1o vodka??! so smart! \na little overpriced, but i guess that's summerlin for you. the service was very good, til the end it got a little slow while waiting for our bill. i brought my boyfriend a <mark>Green Goodness Juice</mark>, made with kale, apples, fennel, celery and whatever other green things i'm forgetting. it was healthy and delicious and i love that it was a menu option.\nill return for dinner, and i look forward to everything but the bill!", 
            "ok, there is a lot of potential here with maybe just a few small kinks to be worked out.  the atmosphere and cocktails were good.  definitely make a reservation if you can because it was rather busy when i first arrived for a late lunch.\ni started my meal with the new england fry, which was good, but the real winner was the  <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>.  the bun was just right and the flavors and textures of everything came together into a beautiful dish.  the chopped salad that accompanied it was woefully under-seasoned and bland.  \nthe dessert menu was a little disappointing.  i enjoyed the mcconnell's ice cream very much, but none of the other offerings were too tempting.  my friend let me try her triple layer cake which looked very homemade (not meant as a big compliment) and was just ok.\nthe biggest disappointment was the horrible decline in service as my meal progressed.  by the time we finished, the dining room had cleared out and there was quite a bit of staff cleaning up.  i tried several times to make eye contact with anyone, but was pretty much ignored.  i finally resorted to waving down a busser to ask for the check and it still took a while to get that settled.", 
            "gf and i hit honey salt for lunch a few days ago.  \n\nnice looking space - not a big fan of all the mirrors on the one wall but wtf do i know about restaurant design.  i dig the openness to the kitchen.\n\nfelt a little out of place since we were in our post- work out gym clothes.  we got the sense this place is the go to lunch spot for  women shopping nearby or after having their hair and nails done.  \n\nwe shared the <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark> pizza ($14 ) as an app.  meatballs were very tender, nice crust - slight crunch followed by pillow center.  overall, very tasty.\n\ngf went with the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>.  i choose the burger.  the fc sammie came with a salad - very fresh, crunchy veggies.  the fried chicken was tender with   mustard-y cole slaw.  could've used a little more seasoning but overall well prepared.  ( i believe $15)\n\nthe burger also needed more salt otherwise it was perfect.  juicy, juicy, juicy - great flavor.  we agreed to was a better burger than the barrymore.  fries decent especially since they provided a side of the tomato jam for dipping. again i believe it was $15 ) \n\nwe finished with the bread pudding ( with a carmel/toffee sauce ) - excellent ( $9) and the baked alaskan ( $10) - sadly a miss.  the meringue was great, the cake, very dry/stale, the ice cream - very good when eaten on it's own.\n\ndefinitely worth trying again for dinner or brunch. \n\nadded pics of baked alaskan\n\nprobably closer to 3.5 stars to 4", 
            "that <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> is no joke!!! i enjoyed this restaurant the week before christmas with 4 others at lunch time. i had to try the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> after reading the reviews on here of course! it came through with flying colors too. the taste was spot on, and the combination of crispy breading with crunchy cole slaw and pickles elevates it to another level. the most amazing part was the chicken itself. i don't know if it's because it's organic or what, but the chicken was so tender, juicy and full of flavor! i usually don't think of chicken as having much flavor, which is why so many sauces and breading are added, but this meat had actual mouthwatering flavor. the chopped salad that accompanied the sandwich was a very substantial side dish that could be equally successful as an entree itself. it was delectable and unique with the faintest taste of salad dressing. chef kim came over and introduced himself and told us about the restaurant being an inspiration of his and his wife's to expand their home entertaining. he pointed out furniture and a chandelier that came from their personal home. he also expressed their love of re-purposing furniture, and cited various items that had a previous history of serving another purpose. i absolutely loved that the bathroom walls are lined with plastic hotel cards (keys) to various destinations that the owners had traveled to. some even had their names on them. \n\nthe service was outstanding. the day i was there, the place was packed and the service still remained efficient and friendly. we all 5 left there amazed by our dining experience. i can't wait to go back, but it's going to be really hard to try something other than that <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>!", 
            "do not say yes to the edamame! it's not free and they will charge you $7 for it!!!!\n\nnow returning to your regular programming.\n\nthe skinny: the lauded <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> lacks balance, the <mark>Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes</mark> and layer cake are both good (3.5) service: deceptive business practices by our waiter - not cool! on top of that, the squashed seating against the wall is uncomfortable. (0) value: expensive for what it is... factor in the sh*tty service, this place ranks about a 2 starred experience.\n\ni'm still fuming about our brunch experience at honey salt. we arrived and were shown to our seat promptly. our server, julie  asked if we wanted bottled water, we said no tap water is fine. as we were getting settled and just started looking over the menu, she came back and asked \" would you like a little bit of edamame to nibble on while you go over the menu?\" \n\nmy husband automatically says yes, thinking it is complimentary. as the bread basket came by, we start to realize that we were scammed by our server. \n\n$7. $7 for a crappy weird tasting edamame with orange zest and sugar on top. (in order to make it edible, i threw on some salt and pepper which made it a lot better.) \n\nit's this kind of deceptive business practice that makes me so angry. we would have never ordered edamame here to begin with. she purposely gave us the wrong impression so that she could up charge us. \n\non our bill, we were so incensed, we actually wrote the reason why we gave her the tip we did. hell, given this behavior, she's lucky she got anything. we hoped if we at least wrote why we gave her the tip we did, it would clue management into what she was doing to the patrons at the restaurant.\n\nthe worst part is that i saw the other tables were all nibbling on $7 edamame too. how many other people were getting the same bait and switch on a dish that costs less than $1 to make? \n\non top of that, we were seated along the tables along the wall. i sat along the bench and my foot got stuck between the table leg and the bench seat. - and i am not a big person. (i'm 5'6\", wear size small and my feet are size 9.)  if we are paying at least $13 for an entree, i expect to at least to be seated comfortably - not squashed against the wall like a sardine in a can. if they would just move the tables about  2 inches away from the bench, it would instantly fix this problem.\n\nif you're talking about the food itself, it's actually kind of hit or miss.\n\nthe hubs ordered the much lauded <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> while i opted for the <mark>Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes</mark>. \n\nthe proportion was way off on <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> ($13) . i don't know but for me, when i order a <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> , i want a bit of chicken, bread and condiment with every bite. the two pieces of fried chicken overwhelmed everything else in the sandwich and made it cumbersome to eat. it probably would have been better with just 1 piece of chicken and charging you $9-10 for it. the chicken itself was well-seasoned and juicy although, the coating could have a bit more crunch to it to add a little more textural complexity. the sauce was completely forgettable.\n\nthe person who called this sandwich \"chick-fil-a on crack\" must have been smoking some magic pipeweed with hobbits in an enchanted forest when they said that because this doesn't even come close. it's okay but there really no comparison.\n\nthe chopped salad that came with the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> was okay. it's actually quite a hearty salad. cubes of carrot, edamame, greens are lightly dressed and sprinkled with some roasted  pumpkin seeds. the dressing needed a bit more acidity to brighten up the flavors of the vegetables.  i'm not so sure about the cubes of carrot with all that edamame mixed in  - it makes it difficult to eat . the thing that didn't make sense were the blocks of sharp cheddar cheese in there which detract from the freshness of the vegetables. \n\nthe <mark>Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes</mark> with lemon curd ($13) fared better. they came with plenty of blueberries scattered along the plate and served alongside a smallish dollop of lemon curd. personally, i think there needed to be more lemon curd to sufficiently cover the pancakes. although the pancake had a nice, fluffy interior, it missed that mild crispiness to the exterior which for me differentiates a good to a truly great pancake. the serving size is a bit pricey for $13 and i wouldn't order this again.\n\nfinally, dessert. i believe this was the best thing we ordered - their layer cake ($9). it's a super moist chocolate cake layered with fudge, cocoa nibs and a wonderful banana cake with cardamom. wow - it knocked our socks off. this is the kind of sophisticated dessert that is truly worth recommending. that hit of cardamom was absolutely genius!\n\nthis place would have easily been a 3.5 star review in large part due to their awesome dessert. however, given the unethical practice we encountered here, it is with a heavy heart that i give this place a 2 -starred review.", 
            "after reading numerous reviews about their <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> ($13) being described as \"chick-fil-a on crack\", i was definitely intrigued. i'm an avid chick-fil-a fan, and in fact, it is probably my fave fast food chain. unfortunately, the closest location is in la, but whenever we are in the area, we will make it a point to stop by.\n\ni have to vehemently disagree with the other reviews on this one. when i order a <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>, i expect a certain amount of crispy, crunchy texture. honey salt's rendition is more like a grilled <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>, albeit a decent one, and lacks sufficient fried goodness. in addition, the durkee's dressing sauce was utterly forgettable. not only are chick-fil-a's chicken and selection of sauces vastly superior, but it's also a much better value. alternatively, i'd rather get the southern <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> at the cheesecake factory across the street in boca park. the chopped salad that it comes with was an utter disappointment as well. it consisted of radishes, edamame, carrots, kale, pumpkin seeds, cubes of sharp cheddar cheese, and mixed greens. an interesting collection, but ultimately the flavors were neither harmonious nor enjoyable.\n\nthe <mark>Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes</mark> with lemon curd ($13) had a nice, fluffy texture inside, but lacked any sort of exterior crispiness, the hallmark of a really good pancake.\n\ndessert was the highlight. their triple layer cake ($9) was very interesting and tasty. it consisted of dense chocolate cake layered with fudge and banana cake with cardamom and coated with buttercream frosting. although it is a bit pricey for the portion size and it could be more moist, this is the one item we would probably order again.\n\nas for the service... let's start back at the beginning. after being seated, our server, julie, asks us what kind of bottled water we want to drink. we decline and ask for tap water. she then asks if we would like to snack on some edamame while we peruse the menu. i'm thinking it is complimentary, especially since i do not see edamame listed anywhere on the brunch menu, so we say okay. after we make our brunch selections, the bread basket comes out with some sort of bean dip. at first we are a bit confused. is this what she meant by the edamame? is this an edamame dip? if so, why isn't it green? btw, the bread and lavosh was totally unremarkable. several minutes later, we get the edamame sprinkled with some citrus zest. we end up adding some salt and pepper because it so bland. the shocker was when we get our bill and it shows we were charged $7 for edamame! we were both instantly infuriated. we wouldn't have ordered edamame to begin with and certainly not for $7! not in the mood to argue with the server and/or manager, we tipped less than we normally would and even wrote a brief note why. we can tolerate slow, inattentive service to a certain degree, but not deception and trickery to run up the bill. as we looked around, we noted a few other tables who had said yes to the edamame as well. we found it odd that none of the other numerous yelp reviews/tips mention the non-complimentary edamame.\n\nin summary, the food itself rates about 3 stars. deceptive, aggressive upcharging knocks it down to a 2-star experience overall.\n\nconsider yourself warned. just say no to the edamame! it's not complimentary and definitely not worth $7!", 
            "i honestly didn't find this place to be all that.  don't get me wrong its a nice modern place but i can find better made items that honey salt offers for way cheaper price.  the only good thing that i was blown away by is their fried calamari.  that was a pretty legit dish.  their <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> i believe i can get somewhere else for cheaper and made better.  we also got their caesars salad and that was literally 14 dollars for some salad with a touch of caesars dressing and some cheap \"free range\" chicken breast that was grilled.  overall not too impressed with what they served.  and this is on a hunch but if bread was given to everyone as an opener then they most def didn't care for us.  everyone else had bread on their tables but us, don't know if you had to order it or not.  \n\nagain, overall the place is well lit and looks great.\n\nfoodwise....id go somewhere else.  as a local i should've known better but wanted to try something new.  now i know, i won't go back.  there are other places around town to get same food for cheaper price and same quality. good luck.", 
            "when my friend said lets grab lunch at honey salt, i was like where? i had never heard of this place, so i read the reviews on yelp, and so glad that we decided to try this place. a new local restaurant that has great food and atmosphere. \n\nhoney salt is tucked away in the corner of the shopping plaza on the corner of rampart and charleston, as the hidden gem in the corner of the plaza. with so many different reviews of the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>, i definitely had to try it as well. it is described as the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> on the menu and comes with a creamy slaww, house durkees dressing on a nicely <mark>Toast (White or Wheat)</mark> brioche roll. it comes with a lightly dressed chopped salad. two perfectly fried pieces of chicken - what is not to like about that...besides wanting a larger portion or more of it (but that would just be gluttonous). the portion size is just right.\n\ni'm looking forward to coming back for dinner and trying out some of the other items on the menu. honey salt, i will return!",

            "i loved the atmosphere of this place, very cozy!  in my opinion the food was ok, my company enjoyed it a little more than i did.  we started off with the calamari.  it was cooked perfectly not too chewy however, it was a bit too spicy.  i had the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>, to me it was more like a chicken finger sandwich.  not mind-blowing, not even mediocre if it werent for it being on a brioche i could get this same sandwich at mcdonalds.  seriously.  for dessert we had the bread pudding.  this was amazing!  absolutely delicious!  the service was excellent and we saw nicholas cage so it wasn't terrible but just ok.", 
            "i think i lean more towards 3.75 stars. \n\ni love the decor and ambiance. service was just ok as my husband had to chase down our server to pay. i had asked for a more private area since i had the baby with us and just in case she decided to scream her head off we wouldn't be the center of attention. \n\nwe started of with the new england fry.  yummy seafood with just the right amount of crispy and not overcooked.  i decided to go for the banana foster <mark>Strawberry Shortcake French Toast</mark> in hopes that it wasn't too sweet. my husband got the all popular <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>. my <mark>Strawberry Shortcake French Toast</mark> was amazing...the cornflake crust and the thick bread with caramelized bananas soooooo good.  my tummy rumbles just thinking about it. it definitely was just the right amount of sweetness which my palate isn't too sweet. i was super excited to try the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> as many people have compared it to the famous chick fil a <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> but i was a bit disappointed. i wasn't in love with the sandwich and i didn't think it was omg good. it was decent but i wouldn't order it again. maybe it was just an off day but in any case i wasn't impressed. \n\noverall service was ok for a sunday during brunch. they weren't packed or anything like that.  this place is pricey for brunch but i would like to come back for dinner and try that. the portions are smaller so if you aren't a hungry hippo like us then you will definitely leave satisfied.", 
            "i love this place. i've been here a few times and tried the shrimp fried rice (delicious and spicy!), the burger (loved), the kale caesar salad (small portion, but my favorite thing here), the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> (crispy fried chicken, very tasty), and a few desserts, my favorite being a chocolate caramel cake. service is great, the ambiance is very nice, and the decor is enticing. not what you expect at a vegas strip mall, that is for sure! the menu is short and sweet, and they have a full bar with some interesting cocktails. it is original and i hope locals flock back to this place and give it a try instead of going to their usual chain restaurant faves, all of which can be found within a 2-mile radius of honey salt! i am definitely coming back for more. also, it looks like the bar area might be good for an evening drink, so i'll have to try that as well.", 
            "we decided to try honey salt for lunch. we have delayed our visit to this neighborhood spot for some time and figured by now they should have gone through the shake out period associated with a new restaurant.\nthe d\\u00e9cor is beautiful. nice and bright with softer material that reduces the noise level from when nora's was in the space. \nour server was attentive and ensured the water glasses were filled and was readily available if needed. the restaurant was doing a brisk business and most tables were filled. it was nice to see chef kim on the floor making the rounds and talking to the customers.\nwe ordered 2 glasses of wine and my wife noticed a smudge on the glass rim. our server apologized and quickly brought a replacement.\nboth of us ordered the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> which was a moist breast with a crunchy outside. the sandwich is served with a small salad of mixed greens and beans. very tasty and just the right size.\nwe ordered the key lime pie to share. prior to receiving the pie our server brought a complementary dish of desert sweets and again apologized for the wine glass. the key lime pie was tart and very good. \noverall honey salt is a very nice addition to west side dining. we look forward to returning for dinner.", 
            "i have gone 3 different times now, and have tried to be fair. i am just confused about the hype because i have yet to be \"wowwed.\"  i find it frustrating that the wine menu changed, because my favorite glass is now only available by the bottle. also, one night i went and they had specials, last week i was told no specials at the bar. perhaps i will try the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> that i read about if i venture here again. the burger is just a burger, nothing spectacular or original. the fish tacos on special was decent, probably the best i had here.  last time i ordered the brick chicken but  macaroni and cheese was runny and soggy. i do however wish the best for this place.", 
            "i was here for late lunch, the menu is really small.... i had a <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> it's delicious, i just wish they have a bigger lunch menu perhaps even appetizers, the restaurant is really nice and open but they have to re think the banquet ceiling it doesn't go with the place", 
            "it's what you'd expect in this corner of charleston & rampart. homey atmosphere that gives you the feel of farm fresh to the table. pretty decor that lets you know you are about to pay for it.\nordered the much touted <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>. it was ok. battered chicken breast with an overly generous slather of honey mustard atop cole slaw. served alongside a small salad of edamame, kale, cheese, carrots, radishes, seeds with a light vinaigrette. a glamorized <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> that i don't think is worth $13.00.\nthe tuna tartare was good, but as my daughter says, \"it's pretty hard to mess up tuna tartare\". a small portion and overpriced at $15.00.\nservice was ok. this place seems to cater to a typical pretentious summerlin crowd. overall, nothing special and not worth the $40 lunch bill for 2 for an app and <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> with one soda.\nho hum, tried it and won't be back.", 
            "the food was fine, but pricey. three of us and the bill was $50 with one coffee and no other drinks or appetizers. i had the hs salad: edemame, chopped carrots, radish, turkey and cheese with their very good house dressing. my sister had a caesar salad with chicken which she said was dry and the \"black garlic dressing\" she swore had no garlic at all. her husband had the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> which he liked.\n\nthe place is cramped and noisy. i realize this is the trend, but for us retired folk who want to chat and not have to compete with the conversation at the table next to us, it wasn't comfortable.\n\nthe service was good, the servers pleasant, but not outstanding. this is definitely a place for the \"in crowd\" and \"beautiful people.\" if that's your bag, go for it. if you want a nice relaxed lunch where you can have a conversation, go somewhere else.", 
            "i found out about honeysalt completely by accident a few months ago, and i have been wanting to try it ever since. it is tucked in the corner of the shopping plaza across from boca par on rampart (the one with williams-sonoma & pottery barn), so it is easy to miss. i finally went for lunch today. first, i took it as a great sign that they were packed on a tuesday at noon...and i was right!!\n\ni had a hard time deciding what to get because everything sounded pretty amazing. i started off with a grilled peach & ricotta salad with bing cherries, spiced pistachios, & sherry vinaigrette. it. was. awesome!!! i had a tough time deciding between the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> & the <mark>Backyard Favorite Burger</mark>...but ultimately went with the margherita pizza. my friend ordered the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> and loved it. with 2 iced teas our bill was $42. so, a little bit on the pricey side, but everything was delicious and the service was great!!\n\nit is nice to have a upscale option in that area since there are so many chains in that spot (chili's, claim jumper, pf chang's, etc). i can't wait to go back!! i say definitely check them out if you're in the area", 
            "i ate at honey salt for dinner friday with a couple of friends. thoroughly enjoyed the grilled octopus and scallop ceviche appetizers. their octopus app was refined and balanced, very well constructed. first a base of a wonderful romesco sauce, some patatas bravas (tasted like roasted fingerling potatoes) resting on the sauce, topped with beautifully grilled octopus garnished with herbs, an oil drizzle, and a drops of a cream sauce all pull this dish together. i dare say it certainly gives the dish at milos a run for its money. their burger had a nice blend of meats in their custom grind, i ordered it with the fried egg of course. i enjoyed the burger, but it paled in comparison to both appetizers. the brown bag peach cobbler had a nice crumble and a good amount of cinnamon and some nutmeg which i found to very pleasing. great service this meal from andrew and a very good overall experience.\n\ni returned to honey salt just 2 days later to have sunday brunch with my sister, brother in law, and my young nephew who were visiting from la. we ordered the <mark>Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes</mark> with lemon curd, <mark><mark>House Made Corned Beef Hash</mark></mark>, and <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> which were all quickly devoured by the 3 of us. what a great meal! some of the best pancakes in town! perfectly cooked, fluffy and moist with ample blueberries. the lemon curd was a perfect complement to the blueberries. not that it needs it, for i could easily finish all the pancakes with just the lemon curd alone...but a little drizzle of the maple syrup is a nice addition to this plate. the <mark><mark>House Made Corned Beef Hash</mark></mark> is very good as well. <mark>Toast (White or Wheat)</mark> slices of crusty bread topped with finely diced pieces of corned beef and potatoes finished with a sunny side up egg waiting to be cut so the yolk can run. the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> was one of the best hot <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> i've eaten (bunk sandwiches in portland has a remarkable cold <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>). again exceptional service, this time from joanne who was very pleasant and helped us with our food selection and continually made sure we had everything we needed. \n\nwill definitely be coming back for brunch soon!!! hopefully for the truffled grilled cheese, crab benedict, and the caramelized banana and nutella <mark>Strawberry Shortcake French Toast</mark>!", 
            "we walked in here without a reservation on a saturday night and ate at the bar.  i am super late on the honey salt bandwagon.  so much so that i might as well be writing a review on this cool new show called \"breaking bad\".  i mean, the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> has similar qualities to meth...so i've heard anyways.  \n\nthe creamless corn soup intrigued my wife the most and she loved it.  the charred kernels and arugula oil was kind of a shock at initial taste but it grew on her quickly and she already plans to order it the next time we're there.  \n\ni got \"my wife's favorite salad\" consisting of duck confit, arugula, fris\\u00e9e, pine nuts, roasted bing cherries, and a farm fresh poached egg.  this was terrific and i only wished there was even more duck but i am sure everyone feels that way.  i thought the mix of flavors were really good.  \n\nwe split the colorado lamb porterhouse for the entree.  it came with bacon sofrito, pea tendrils, roasted fingerling potatoes, and balsamic reduction.  i'd never had lamb prepared this way and thought it was quite creative.  the lamb was a little more done than i wanted it to be but it was still juicy.  like all good porterhouses, i found myself gnawing on the bone with my bare hands at the end.  \n\nour super friendly (and fellow red sox fan from andover, ma) bartender lightly twisted our arm into getting \"the brookie\" for dessert which the menu describes \"chocolate chip cookie meets chocolate fudge brownie, with vanilla bean ice cream\".  you should definitely try this if you like but are really tired of chocolate lava cake.  i feel so jaded typing that last sentence.  \n\noverall it was great.  what's not to like about this spot?", 
            "there wasn't a negative here....the service was fantastic! we were served and waited on directly by the assistant gm who was attentive and accommodating. the food was great.  we each ordered something different off the menu, the frittata, the corn <mark><mark>House Made Corned Beef Hash</mark></mark>, the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>, the summer pizza and the grilled cheese- and no one had a real complaint...well...the cute yet quirky ketchup bottle didn't really function well but who cares....take the cap off and good to go! \nprices are great, atmosphere is great and they source things locally as much as possible. the chefs made their rounds- who could ask for more! we did and a scoop of salted caramel ice cream showed up and made us all scream for ice cream!  \nthey take a reservation - so make use of it!",

            "usually when a local joint like this is getting a lot of buzz, it rarely lives up to it. this place is no joke though. a must try for any las vegas local. i had a fantastic meal with great service and atmosphere.\n\nfor two people w/ 2 entrees, 2 cocktails, and 2 desserts it came out to under $80. we came in for brunch, but honestly, we didn't even order anything from the brunch specialties. here's the rundown of what we ordered:\n\nentrees:\n(1) biloxi buttermilk fried chicken: everyone raved about this on yelp so i had to try it. probably the best <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> i've ever had. honey mustard took the already perfectly cooked chicken to another level. my friend also fell in love with the brioche bun.\n\n(2) new england fry: unlike any fried calamari or seafood i've had before. great texture and flavor in this one. definitely worth a try.\n\ndrinks: \ntheir drink menu has one of the best selections of beers and cocktails i've seen at such a reasonable price.\n\n(1) i originally ordered an \"autumn crisp\" (bourbon and pumpkin butter) which sounded amazing, so i was a bit disappointed when they said they were out of pumpkin butter. i switched my order to the \"cherry wood\" which has woodford reserve bourbon, cherry jelly, and lime. it comes in a little mason jar that you shake up at the table. had a great refreshing feel and paired perfectly with the food.\n\ndesserts:\nthis is what took the meal over the top for me. so many great selections.\n\n(1) \"brookie\": this is a cookie baked into a brownie with salted caramel ice cream. is there any more i need to say about this?\n\n(2) bourbon bread pudding: again, had to follow the yelpers and order  the bread pudding. usually when i order more than one dessert there's the issue of one overpowering the other. one is so much more flavorful and enjoyable that you just don't even want to take another bite of your \"red-headed stepchild\" dessert. this was not the case here. i took a bite of the bread pudding after the phenomenal \"brookie\" and was still blown away and surprised by the flavors. there was even a hint of pumpkin in it. not sure if this was added just for the season or if this is standard. i even brought some home and warmed it up in the microwave and added my own ice cream and gave it to my parents (who usually don't like bread pudding) and they were in love. \n\ndon't wait around on this local gem. take your family, a loved one, or just a good friend to this place and treat yo self!",

            "after driving around to find some fried chicken, i finally parked at honey salt for some lunch on a beautiful, cool day.  there is outdoor seating but the indoor seating was so nice and bright, it didn't matter where we parked for a meal.  it's very modern and comfortable inside, with mismatched chairs that create a cohesive dining area.  after scanning the brief menu, i landed on the one thing i heard so much about--the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>.\n\nfirst, the appetizer of <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark> arrived.  the meatballs were moist, flavorful, and the sauce with ricotta was just perfect.  i could eat a whole order on my own and be satisfied for lunch.  i did not crave it the next day, but it is good eats.\n\nthe <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> arrived right as i took the last bite of my meatball appetizer, presented freshly with a side salad and stacked nicely.  i had high expectations for this sandwich, and as i took my first bite, the honey mustard hit first, followed by the salty coating of the chicken, then the creamy slaw and pickles.  the bun was really good and held up to the sandwich.  the flavors played well together, the chicken was hot and moist with that crispy exterior, and the side salad cooled my mouth down, complimenting the sandwich far better than fries would.\n\ndespite the positive experience with this sandwich, i am shocked that it's one of the best <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> in vegas.  i understand that the texture and flavor profile are great, but this sandwich did not leave me satisfied the way i expected to be, and i wasn't head over heels in love with it.  i give them kudos for great flavors and textures, but i cannot say that this was the best <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> in town.  it is in the top 5, but not in my top 3.\n\nthe day after eating this, i didn't crave it again or believe that honey salt would be a regular trip for me.  although they have a great cocktail and food menu, i felt as if i didn't belong.  that, and the food wasn't good enough for me to become a regular and true fanatic.  still, it was an enjoyable lunch and i wouldn't adamantly stop anyone from eating there. i would, however, suggest kfc or chik-fil-a for a <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> over this $14 one.\n\nhappy eating.", 
            "i've never tried comfort food until i came here. i tried their truffle grilled cheese, and their ceasar salad for brunch. my oh my was it delish! i'm a big grilled sandwich person so trying this sandwich definitely had me impressed. perfect consistency with the truffled cheese to the slices of bread. their ceasar salad is everything. if you're looking to have a nice salad, i'd recommend this salad. i'd also highly recommend their <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>. most people go there to have that sandwich and having a bite....or two from my friend's, i would've cose this as my second choice if i had.\n\nwe also had their bottomless mimosas for $20 that day (every sunday) with your choice of the classic orange juice and champagne or blood orange and champagne. now, the blood orange mimosa is very tart so if you don't mind it i'd highly recommend it. that's all i was drinking for two hours. the servers were super attentive, ensuring our glasses of water...and mimosas were always full! seeing as though they might not have been able to keep up with our thirst for mimosas, they were so kind to just send us a carafe to fill ourselves in case they could not get to us in time (no judging from them here!). they checked back at a decent rate maybe three times during our meal just to see if we were ok and carrying on a light and funny conversation. high five to the servers their and their guest services. bottomless mimosas do come with a warning: they are creepers, you may feel brave to drink a lot of it, but i assure you you'll feel the after effects by late afternoon.\n\ni was also impressed by the cleanliness and aesthetics of the bathroom (clean bathrooms are a big deal for me. 1. because it tells me how attentive the establishment is. 2. i like to get comfortable after a big meal.). they even had this nice salt scrub to soften your hands with which was very different from most bathrooms i've gone in. love the salt scrub? no fears! they tell you exactly where you could purchase them. brunch for 4 with 3 of us taking the bottomless mimosas we left at a tab of about $130 excluding tip and tax. well worth it for a nice brunch with the girls, or in laws! \n\ndefinitely, one of my best choices for brunch.", 
            "we were just around the corner and yelp'd nearby restaurants and honey salt popped up!  i had actually heard about this place from a friend a few months ago, so we had to try it.  i was especially interested in trying the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>, but silly me- it's not on the dinner menu!\n\njust a few notes:\n-we were seated right away.  the first thing we noticed was that the restaurant's name is literally on everything, haha.  \n-it's a little dim in the restaurant, in fact the older groups surrounding our table were actually using the flashlight apps on their phones to read the menu.  \n-my boyfriend and i were wearing jeans and a t-shirt, which made us stick out like sore thumbs!  \n-the chef was hanging out in the front the whole time and didn't greet any customers or walk up to any tables, including the special event that was going on.  this may seem nitpicky, but it seemed weird that he was just kinda doing nothing the whole time!\n-meal sizes are small.  not a complaint, just an observation in case you're reading this and planning a dinner on a budget!\n-there is a large seafood selection!\n\nfirst, based on a recommendation from our server (very friendly), we ordered the grilled octopus ($16).  it was tender and had a nice char; the sauce underneath and the other components all fit pretty well together.  unfortunately, the bus boy took our plate without asking if we were finished!\n\nwe shared the special ($30 for two 5oz. lamb porter house steaks, cooked medium rare).  it was perfectly cooked and i swear i tasted some type of indian/mediterranean flavors in the jus.  not a lot to savor, but we're supposed to be thinking quality over quantity!\n\nfinally, we ordered two desserts- the brookie and bread pudding.  i love a good bread pudding that is moist and drenched in sauce.  this was not a great bread pudding and i was pretty disappointed!  it's a huge serving comparable to a rubix cube and super dry.  there was not enough sauce and it wasn't gooey or sickeningly sweet like bread pudding is supposed to be!  the \"brookie\" is a chocolate chip cookie housed in a brownie with salted caramel icecream on top.  all components were good, but i'm not so sure either dessert was worth the $9.   ***fyi, 2 desserts is too much!*** \n\noverall our dinner totalled $68 (not including tip).", 
            "i'm ashamed to say this was my first time since they've been open! what better time to come than the week of my birthday which happens to be during spring restaurant week :)\n\ni don't remember what kind of bread  we had but the soft butter that probably had honey in it but i wasnt paying attention had olive oil and black lava sea salt. amazing!\n\nlunch is $20.14 for a three course for restaurant week. what an amazing deal right? i ordered the hs market salad and the beehive smoked cheddar grilled cheese. they brought out the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> instead but it wasnt a big deal. i ate it and had no regrets. everything was amazing, the portion of the food was perfect. who wants to eat heavy for lunch right? as we were waiting for our warm bread pudding our check was dropped. i mentioned to our server we havent received our dessert and she was very apologetic about it. even sent out complimentary espresso's with biscotti. service recovery here at honey salt was very on point. everything we ate and drank was great. \n\nservice is awesome. i love the ambiance of the restaurant. it's all on its own. nothing like this anywhere else. it's clean, everyone is nice and its beautifully decorated. if youre coming in from out of town this place is worth the drive. you won't regret it. i will be back.\n\nthank you stephen jerome for everything & the honey salt staff!", 
            "friend took me here, due to the fact that i just graduated college, and got a job, in my degree/field. so a free lunch is great either way. lol i want to comment on the ambiance first. being that it was in summerlin, it was a little upscale. but it was a very a open setting. servers seem relaxed, for a busy saturday lunch. i always like to watch the servers, body language tells alot if they really like their job or not. made feel relaxed/welcoming throughout the whole dining experience. friend had the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>. had the power lunch combo. she loved the sandwich, and it came with soup which she didn't like, server gladly switched it for salad. who can mess up salad right?? salad was nothing special, mixed garden greens. i had the big eye tuna. a, with wasabi pea & ginger crust came with salad, a baby spinach, asian pears, sea beans, in a  creamy soy vinaigrette. great flavor all around. don't eat too much seafood but tuna definitely made ma fan. would go back. only complaint, was soup obviously, and maybe 2 or 3 more slices of tuna. but everything as far as quality of food and service was great.", 
            "uh-maze-ing is really the word i would use to describe this place. a few co-workers suggested a lunch here and i was excited for a week to dine at this place. i had read the reviews and looked through photos and hyped myself up for a few things. \n\nonce i walked in, i was instantly impressed. honey salt definitely reminded me of a few of my favorite places in socal (la jolla area to be specific), so i felt at home. we were seated at a large table right in front of the kitchen so we could see all of the action. \n\nwe ordered the whole wheat veggie pizza as an appetizer but we weren't impressed. it was just meh. even the vegetarian at the table didn't go back for seconds. the cracker/chips that were on the table were amazing....or maybe we were just starving. \n\ni went for the power lunch which included a salad, fries, your choice of sandwich and a dessert. my salad was great...and yes i've had places to screw up my salads before...then there was the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> that makes my mouth water as i type this. a cracked out version of the chick-fil-a sandwich is an accurate description! i was satisfied with it. even had the buttery bun with a sweet honey mustard sauce that put my taste buds in heaven. \n\nwith the power lunch you get the option of the bread budding or a raspberry sorbet for dessert so i decided for the warm bread pudding but was not impressed at all. at this point i was so full from my salad and sandwich i wasn't bothered by the bread pudding. \n\nthe staff was always attentive to us and made sure we had everything we needed. i will definitely be back. the apple pie and burger is next on my list!", 
            "finally got around to trying out this place!\n\nwe went early to avoid the lunch rush.  even the kids found something to eat (there's a kid's menu)!\n\nthe food was good; we had the new england fry (yum), <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>, and the burger kim's style.  everything was delicious!  \n\ndefinitely want to go back again!", 
            "went on mother's day without a reservation and accommodated us at the bar. the pomegranate tea is really nice and the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> was tasty. lightly breaded and a good coleslaw and homemade mustard. husband had the burger and the flavor is unmatched. we could have done without all of the juiciness - let that baby rest for a minute before sticking it on the bun.", 
            "one of the best dining experiences i've had in awhile!!  we had a party of 6 and everything was perfect.  to start we had bread and butter which was to die for.  then the waiter brought us group of 6 gals two appetizers of their bread and guacamole, with the side of their kale smoothie (yum!!).  i ordered the lunch meal which was their original salad and splurged for the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>.  everything was to die for.  i had a bite of my friend's heirloom and brie salad with chocolate shavings and that really gave me the reason to write this review.  to top it all off, i had the bread pudding which was top notch!  excellent service (with us rowdy group of 6 ladies catching up!) and even better food.  i will definitely be back and will recommending it to all of my friends and family!", 
            "what a great little find!  out and about shopping with my 2 favorite littles we happened into honey salt.  loved the d\\u00e9cor, the service was excellent, and our food was top notch.  i had the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> and my littles shared the spaghetti.  the side salad with my lunch was incredible, the girls pasta was awesome.  the pasta dish was small for a $9 kids lunch, there wasn't enough for my 2 girls to share.  we will definitely be back again!!!", 
            "this was probably my 10th visit so i figured it was time to write a review. tonight we had the grilled octopus (5 stars), mediterranean bass (4 stars), kurubota pork chops (3 stars-a little bland), and bread pudding with salted caramel ice cream (4 stars). but their complimentary lavosh was one of the best parts of the meal!\n\ntheir menu changes seasonally, some of my other favorites are the fried chicken (and <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>) and the turkey bolognese.\n\nmy only complaint is, tonight we witnessed the hostess and another man (not sure if he was a manager, but he wasn't a server) arguing right in front of us. while this isn't acceptable at any restaurant, i'm sure the owners here would be especially horrified. it was a busy night and i can understand tensions are high, but save it for after closing. we had a reservation but had to wait about 10 min for our table, feeling awkward as we listened to the bickering back and forth. service is usually pretty good, however, so we will most likely be back. but if this was our first visit, it wouldn't be the best first impression.", 
            "i've had the pleasure of dining at honey salt for both brunch and lunch. it has an upscale feel, while still remaining casual. it's been described as \"feeling like a pottery barn.\" i quite like the ambiance, the mismatched furniture and chandeliers, it really takes me away from vegas and makes me feel like i'm at a hip restaurant in a cool city. \n\nmy husband and i first decided to check it out for lunch. he couldn't resist ordering the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> and i went with the <mark>Backyard Favorite Burger</mark>. the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> was juicy and delicious. i can see why people compare it to chik-fil-a. the burger was seasoned perfectly, i really enjoyed the tomato jam since i'm notorious for picking my tomatoes off of my burgers. the shoe string fries were a perfect side.\n\nmore recently, my friends and i decided to check out their brunch. we started with some <mark>Monkey Bread</mark> for the table. it was ooey, gooey, and so delicious. it is perfect for splitting with the table and the hints of citrus really counter the sweet honey sauce. i settled on the steak and <mark>Steak & Egg Slider</mark> and it was a great decision. the steak was super flavorful and the entire thing just worked well together. i also felt somewhat healthy since there was creamed spinach. the breakfast potatoes were more like wedge fries, but i'm not one to complain about potatoes in any form. i also split some peach pancakes with a friend and they were delicious. there were peaches baked in, but could have used some more peaches on top. \n\nit wouldn't be a girls brunch without cocktails and they have a full bar. i had a delicious strawberry, prickly pear, lime, cocktail with citrus vodka. my friends all went with the bottomless mimosas, but weren't impressed with the $20 price tag. \n\ni will definitely be back, especially for brunch, maybe even this weekend!", 
            "i met my friend and ate at honey salt for the first time and was super excited to dine there.\n\nwhat a great meal!!!!\n\nservice was flawless...the server, did not get her name :-(, mad props though, was super friendly, able to answer any questions, and had a great sense of humor and definitely made my friend and i feel welcome.  the assistants were great about clearing plates, refilling drinks, etc...\n\nwe were there on a sunday morning and she stressed getting breakfast items because it is the only day of the week they offer breakfast,\n\nmy friend and i started with sharing a bowl of fresh fruit and had a nice surprise of fresh mint that added a little extra to the flavors.  i enjoyed a great breakfast frittata with potatoes, tomatoes, and other vegetables.  it was hot and super delicious.  my friend had a <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> which she could not put down!  i could see the juiciness of the sandwich and hear the crunch!  she really loved it!\n\ndespite being stuffed, we shared a giant caramel chocolate crunch slice of cake.  it was rich and delicious.\n\ndefinitely would go back to honey salt again!", 
            "i've been meaning to go for a while and finally popped in for lunch with my ladies during restaurant week. a 2 course for $20 is not a bad deal. \n\nthey started us off with parmesan crisp and some whipped butter and some water. they gave us room temp and we had to ask for ice a few times as they brought some out a cup at a time to share among us six. \n\ni picked <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark> for my starter. this was pretty good meatballs and the sauce it was in was solid. i liked the ricotta and the onions with it. it needed some yummy bread with it which it doesnt come with though.\n\nentree i had the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>. a bit messy to eat, but i liked the mustard dressing that was on the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>. it came with a bowl of a chopped salad with kale, greens, avocado, what seemed to be raw squash cubes and creamy dressing which was just okay. not a bad option, but nothing special. \n\ndessert i got banana bread pudding which was a substitution since they ran out of one of the options. i love bread pudding and this was really friggin good. the only thing is i think it needs ice cream for contrast than just whipped cream. that was probably the best part of the meal for me and was better than the strawberry shortcake that was the other option. it was also a huge portion and i couldn't finish it, definitely enough to share. \n\nservice was alright, but good thing we weren't in any hurry to go anywhere. \n\ni thought it was a good intro to this place and i will probably be back for lunch.", 
            "we decided to go to honey salt  for brunch to celebrate my mother in law and sons birthday. i made a reservation as we had 8 people in the group and placed a note on the reservation that we would be there celebrating  the two birthdays. upon arrival i checked in with the hostess and let her know we had a reservation at 10:30am for 8 people under the last name torres. she said \" oh yes okay\" and we were seated by who i assume is the manager. \n\nthe table was nice and spacious and we were seated next to the kitchen which was neat. our server was very gracious and attentive as was the rest of the wait staff. we never had to ask them to remove plates or fill water, they were always on top of everything. \n\nmy mother in law ordered the peaches and cream pancakes , myself and two others ordered the steak and <mark>Steak & Egg Slider</mark> my husband got the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> and my children got the \"kids\" cheeseburger, we also got a pizza for the table to share. everything tasted very good, and for the most part everyone enjoyed their food. my only plight with the food is that the portions are very small for the price and we ordered the cheeseburgers well done for the kids, one came medium rare the other medium. i didnt say anything because my son didnt notice and had eaten half of it. i also ordered the blood orange mimosa which was so so. \n\nnow the reason for two stars, not one person acknowledged that we were celebrating birthdays. i work in the industry, as a host, at one of the busiest restaurants on the strip. we acknowledge every celebration, every guest every time, especially if its noted on the reservation. this small gesture makes all the difference to your patrons who are spending their hard earned money at your local establishment. as we left i confronted the hostess, i saw on her ipad she didnt even check me in for my reservation but instead placed me as a walk in, then when she actually looked, saw my reservation and the notes. i asked to speak with the manager who could obviously care less and offered me a brownie to go which i declined.  my son is seven and he would have been very excited to have his birthday not only acknowledged but a desert brought out so we could sing to him and my mother in law.\n\nall in all the food and wait staff deserve 4 stars. the management, host and customer service get a two. and i feel thats being generous.", 
            "we were seated right away which is good because i don't like waiting around when there is visibly empty tables. we requested water to start with lemon and received just the water without lemon. we had to tell the busboy twice that we wanted lemon with our water, after about 10 minutes we got our lemon. i ordered the cuban sandwich which was great, my wife ordered the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> which she enjoyed as well. our only complaint is the extremely slow service, it took nearly 45 minutes to get our food. overall food was good but the slow service was the deal breaker, i don't want to spend over an hour eating lunch.", 
            "the food is very farm to table inspired.  everything on the menu is very good. the salads are fantastic,  <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> is really delicious.  the pizza is ok, but seems like it doesn't quite belong with the rest of the menu.  the staff is friendly and the desserts are amazing.  if you are there in the summer the strawberry shortcake is out of this world, highly recommend.",

            "went in for lunch for restaurant week- not my first visit here but definitely my favorite. the menu was such a good deal with delicious options! <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark> to start, accompanied by the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> as an entree and the \"brookie\" for dessert. been sick all week so this is my first meal and wow- i'm glad it was. travis delivered flawless service, catered to our every need without being overpowering. and if you haven't yet, you have to try the brookie, it doesn't get much better than a chocolate chip cookie baked inside of a brownie and topped with salted caramel ice cream. the 4 of us all have been in food & beverage for years and i'll tell you this- we will be back.", 
            "the two stars are not for the food or service. fathers day; had a reservation for our rather large group and were seated promptly at 1030. we were looking forward to the fathers day brunch until i saw the gun. yes a gun strapped to a tatted guys hip sitting across from us. the folks sitting next to him could not take their eyes off of the weapon. the guy carried his son (about 2) around the dining room to make sure everyone saw the weapon. i felt very uncomfortable but i guess it's his right to do so. i would have thought the manager would have seated them in a less conspicuous place. we were not interested in a shootout/self protection etc.\n\nthe food was terrific, breakfast sliders, <mark>Strawberry Shortcake French Toast</mark>, pancakes, salad, <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> and champagne to round it out.  and the service was fabulous.....but we won't be going back any time soon. sorry. love guns but not with the family around.", 
            "really disappointed. this place was recommended to us so our party made the 35 minute trek out. i love fresh food but without flavor fresh just isn't enough. our appetizers were decent - we ordered the meatballs and salad of the day. the main courses were a disappointment. the brick oven chicken was dry and flavorless. the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> was plain and just ok - i enjoy chick-fil-a more. my colleague ordered the large portion of steak and thought the portion was tiny. for dessert we had the bread pudding which was normal and the brookie, which was disappointing. i did love the design and decor.", 
            "we were staying at the red rock and cruising around on a lazy sunday to find a brunch spot.  turned to yelp and picked honey salt.  the restaurant is tucked away in the corner of a little strip mall and it was not visible from the street.\n\nat first glance, the menu is very promising.  starting with the bread service, the crispy flatbread and butter is a nice little twist.  next up, my wife's favorite salad with duck confit.  it was as good as advertised.  this was probably the best dish of the meal.  i ordered the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> and i had high hopes.  unfortunately, the chicken was very dry.  it could have used a lot more of the durkee dressing.  also, the slaw was a bit bland for me.  i thought the sandwich itself could have benefited from some form of acid to brighten it up.  my wife ordered the farmer's toast with persimmon.  it was ok, but overall too sweet with the persimmon, honey and wheat bread.  my kiddo was happy with her mac and cheese and diy sundae.\n\nservice was subpar in my opinion.  this was surprising as we were one of the first ones in the restaurant and there were only a handful of tables occupied with an equal amount of servers.\n\ni want to like this place so much more as it seems to a lot of promise.  the sad truth is that i may never try it again as we normally stay on the strip and the red rock stay was a one time deal.", 
            "great food and casual atmosphere. the service was very good; we were seated quickly for lunch. our drinks never ran dry and our order was taken promptly. the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> was a hit and is highly recommended.", 
            "my family and i came here twice this week during our vacation in las vegas. honey salt is a welcome escape from the disappointing quality of food on the strip, and a great dining experience in its own right. it is a 5-star, 4-star restaurant.\n\nwhat i mean is that food aside, all the details were perfect. the design language was consistent from utensils, to seating, to the interior design. the exposed but artful brick wall is easy on the eyes. it was playful, verging on eclectic, but not kitsch or pastiche. an interesting touch is the free salt scrub in the bathroom.\n\nit doesn't take itself too seriously but is excellent where it counts. great dining experience stripped of all pretentiousness. wait staff were very attentive, helpful, and pleasant.\n\nas for the food, we had the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>, grilled octopus, <mark>Grain Power</mark> salad, burger, roasted eggplant, margherita pizza, burrata/fig/tomato/chocolate salad, peach pie, and ice cream.\n\nthe <mark>Grain Power</mark> was definitely the best dish. flavorful, light, and all the ingredients worked well together (shaved fennel, baby clementine, mint, red and white quinoa, avocado, chicken, dill, sunflower seed(?)). the burger was ok. the grilled octopus was good, very tender. roasted eggplant was good. the margherita pizza was solid, and just the way i like it: very thin, light sauce. it was maybe a bit a bland a touch too cool when it came to the table. the burrata salad was good but while all its individual ingredients shone (loved the bittersweet chocolate) they didn't combine into something more than the sum of its parts, like the <mark>Grain Power</mark> salad. peach pie and the ice cream were also good.\n\ni'd definitely come here again and recommend it to anyone in the area.", 
            "love! they provide these thin baked cracker things paired with a sweet butter to tide you over for a bit. i know i sound like an idiot describing that but i can't think of the proper term for them. for dinner time they have the same things but also include fresh baked bread. they have an awesome lunch special for about $21. you can get an appetizer, main dish, and dessert. their caesar salad is to die for as is their meatball appetizer. their <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> comes with a honey mustard and coleslaw and two pieces of the best boneless fried chicken i have had in my life. it is so moist and simply melts in your mouth. for dinner i've had the scallops, which were impeccable. for desert i've had the strawberry sorbet and the brownie, which came out so warm and deliciously gooey. \n\nbeverage wise i've had their garden mule which is a modified version of a moscow mule. i've also had a blood orange soda and a fancy tea. everything was amazing. \n\nthey have complimentary salt water taffy at the hostess stand which is ahmayzing!!!! they also have a salt scrub in their bathroom for you to test that they sell out friend. the salt scrub is great and leaves your skins so soft and hydrated. \n\nmy only complaint is that they will rent out the restaurant for private parties but won't notify on any of their social media that they're close to the public. i arrived once and they were hosting a private party so i drove all the way there for nothing, which was extremely annoying and inconvenient. especially when i was so looking forward to stuffing my face with nummy food. the other complaint was that i called ahead to make a lunch reservation and it wasn't put down. so i arrived and i was told i didn't have a reservation. luckily it was not busy and i didn't have to wait for anything but i'm sure it would've been a different story if it was busy.", 
            "i like honey salt, but shannon likes it much more than i do. it is nestled in the corner of the shopping center on the nw corner of rampart & charleston where nora's wine bar used to be. i love the decor and we always see many of the same staff which is comforting and a great sign of a successful business. we always feel welcome and they are always very accommodating with our two boys. the menu selection seems limited to me, so i usually end up getting the salmon every time. shannon absolutely loves the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>. and this is coming from someone who won't eat anything fried. i like the little touches of 'honey & salt' like butter served with the bread has honey & salt in it. and in the bathroom, the soap is made to seem like honey salt. the best part of the hs experience is the salted caramel ice cream. my personal favorite dessert is the apple pie in a bag, but they don't seem to have that anymore. now they've replaced it with a peach pie in a bag and i'm not a fan of peach pie. the other notable dessert is the brookie which is a cup made of brownie and the inside is gooey chocolate chip cookie. add a scoop of salted caramel ice cream and you are in business!", 
            "horrible hostess. waiter was half dead. food was sub par. we both ordered the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>. won't be coming back and now reconsidering if we should try andiron.", 
            "out of the numerous times my wife and i have visited honey salt we have never had a bad meal.  this was also our first brunch experience with kim canteenwalla & e. blau's honey salt and hopefully will not be our last.  they always have the cream of the crop servers who are both incredibly knowledgable of the menu items and extremely friendly.  we decided to come in for an impromptu lunch/brunch as we were entertaining friends and knew this would be a quality meal without destroying our bankroll (unlike my wife's spending habits-kidding).  upon arriving the beautiful hostess michelle said we could be accommodated even though we did not have any reservations. once sat they took our drink order while offering delectable suggestions.  never to early for bourbon so i chose the maple old fashioned any my wife decided to dd and went with a refreshing \"cool as a cucumber\".  we then ordered our entrees and i went with the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> on the onion brioche and the wife had the <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> salad. both were huge portions and i left pleasantly full but not obese. can't wait to go back for my next bourbon brunch.", 
            "ordered the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>..was horrible the chicken was dry and unseasoned..was overated ..it had alot if good reviews..people must not know good food..however the manager came over and apologized..and took half our bill off..", 
            "i love this place, great atmosphere, friendly staff and the brunch is great. get the bottomless mimosa...they keep your glass nice and full. now for the food,  <mark>Monkey Bread</mark> is amazing, <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> so good, pancakes, <mark>Smoked Salmon Benedict</mark> oh my!!! it's all great.", 
            "honey salt is a nice place with great service! their <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> is really good! the <mark>Spicy House Sausage</mark> pizza was not as flavorful as i expected. their bread pudding was not too sweet, it was just right!", 
            "mac & cheese is a staple in my family and i have yet to taste any that give my grandmothers a run for her money. it was awesome! and so was the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>. love the mustard and cole slaw combo. service was ok. will definitely be back for the food!", 
            "great services ,must try there <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> , will come back again ,recommend this place.", 
            "this place has very good service however their food says american but it sure does not taste like anything i would compare to american. the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> is so thick you have to unassemble it to get it into your mouth. the mac and cheese does not resemble american mac and cheese.  i love the sweet corn soup. desserts are amazing and again, the staff is wonderful. i would probably only go back for appetizers or dessert.", 
            "i have been here once for brunch and once for dinner! everything is so fresh and the staff is very friendly! definitely a great brunch/dinner place to try. the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> is delicious!", 
            "i have been here twice for dinner and both times everything was fantastic.\nthe service was fantastic!! the interior is so warm and cozy. i love it!\n\nbesides one minor things thing that was not perfect, our buttermilk fried chicken was a bit over cooked, everything else was spot on delish!\n\nwe had several apps to share - \nmac & cheese -omg-yummers!!!, \nshishito peppers -a bit too spicy for us, which was surprising because they are rarely hot. maybe because we are late in the shishito pepper season?\nand alote corn- which was so, so good! \n\ndinners were a success. i especially liked the gnocchi! and the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> is always a hit!\n\nsave room for dessert!! we ordered the apple pie, and a toffee crunch pudding.\nthe pie was delicious in a super classic, can't go wring kind of way. i say that with love and respect!! the caramel toffee pudding on the other hand was surprising, sweet, crunch and the hit of the night! but i confess, we are all a bunch of sugar fiends!! and live for dessert!!", 
            "every bite was perfect! the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> was delectable.  i've heard so much about this place i was afraid it would be more vegas hype. nope. it's the real deal and if you want an incredible dessert to share #thebookie", 
            "their signature <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> are to die for.  everything is fresh and the desserts shouldn't be missed.", 
            "my favorite thing about honey salt is the location and interior design and decor. working in the design field i can be pretty picky about spaces, but i felt right at home in this restaurant. and i love that it's a little down the way from my neighborhood. i've gone for lunch a few times and always ordered the same thing. \n\nthe caesar salad and the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>. it's a pretty epic combo. i love a salad that looks and tastes like it should be breakfast in the hamptons. ooh, try the starter bread cracker thingy. \n\nchicken sammies tend to always turn out basic to me, no matter how much it's fancied up. but the biloxi pulls through. they put a little class into the cluck but don't over do it and the buttermilk fry up brings it home. \n\ni've tried a few house made drinks that i can't recall the names, but i know i always liked them. \n\nthe rest is fresh, good quality food (info on the menu) however the menu is small. my only con would be that i don't feel there is an outburst of flavors (which is my thing) but i think that's their point. as always, if you're a picky person, know what you're getting into and going for. \n\noh, very important--excellent service and never an empty water glass. one day there seemed to be only one busser working the floor, a girl, and she was badass. and kudos to the one who named the place.", 
            "i have been super busy with work, so my yelp reviews have somewhat faltered to date, but honey salt got me back in the game! i have passed by this place a million times and have always wanted to try it, and i finally had an excuse for my friend's birthday lunch.\n\nfirst of all this place is adorable and i want all the furniture for my house. the decor is awesome! the menu had great items, but i opted for the power lunch- you get a soup or salad, sandwich or flatbread, and dessert all for $21! i ordered the heirloom cauliflower soup which was delicious and the margerita flatbread for the entree. the margarita flatbread was crispy and i loved the sauce. for dessert, i shared the bread pudding and salted carmel ice cream with my friend. both were amazing! \n\na few of my friends ordered some kind of <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> that was also on the power lunch menu and they looked amazing and were huge! you definitely get bang for the buck when it comes to the power lunch. i am excited to try this place again. they have a nice outdoor patio for summer nights that i cant wait to try out and want to come back to taste their dinner menu. great bar too!"

            "the power of yelp brought me here!\ni've been reading about this place on yelp for a while now even before it opened. so last night while out drinking, i was trying to decide where to eat i thought it would be a good idea to try the new restaurant everyone was talking about.\nthe place is very nice, it has this charming feel to it decorated with antique mirrors  distressed antique chairs and waiters wearing plaid shirts giving it that casual family-friendly feeling. i can't wait to move in!\nfor comparative purposes i ordered the <mark>Backyard Favorite Burger</mark>, being the most common item on the  menu (and cheapest 15.00 for dinner) and let me tell you. it was the best burger i've ever had! even better than buchi burger and i love buchi burger.\nthe service was outstanding and smooth as if the place had been open for months. no need to wait for the restaurant to fix the common new restaurant problems, the place was in business the day they open! i can't wait to come back ( with my blood alcohol level lower than .08) and try all the other items. i was told that the caramelized sea scallops are to die for, i will have to order that next time even though the price for that is about four gin and tonics.\nall in all this is a wonderful new restaurant and i'm glad i tried it. thank you yelp for guiding me to this great place! \n\n  honey salt..... your \"people love us on yelp\" sticker is in the mail!", 
            "my mother's birthday was yesterday and my stepfather decided to take us out to a place that his friend from work recommended to him. apparently it was supposed to be pretty good, and so, we became the judge(s) of that.\n\nwalking in, it seemed to me that the place had a bit of a nice quirk to it. it felt a lot like coming in to someone else's house, but also, it felt like it had a small touch of upscale that matched the stores nearby like ann taylor and banana republic.\n\nbefore i could fully admire the interior design, however, i immediately felt out of place. the hostess was dressed as if though she came from her high school prom, the guests were in suits and dresses, and even the servers were all cleaned up rather nicely. and seeing as i came in with jeans and a chunky sweater to brave through the cold, it felt a little odd just being there. but the staff were all courteous and friendly, and they didn't give us any weird looks or silent judgments just because we were underdressed.\n\nall in all, though, the ambiance here seems to be a bit far from the same casual you would probably feel from an applebee's or chili's. but at the same time, aside from the attire, it's pretty easy to feel comfortable here. the lights are dimmed nicely so that it's not overbearingly bright but also not too dark so that you are still able to see, and the candle on the tables add a nice little touch. i also quite like how the kitchen is visible. just something about being able to see food being made seems a bit more - how should i say - comforting for me.\n\nbut anyway, on to the food.\n\n<mark>Backyard Favorite Burger</mark> -- i never got to try it, but according to my stepdad, it tastes very homemade - a rather fitting adjective for the place, i must say. he also mentions that it tastes very fresh and has a rather nice crunch to it, though i'm not sure if for the texture or for the flavor. nonetheless, i trust his word on it.\n\n12 oz. cedar river farm ny strip -- mom and i ordered it to be cooked on a medium, and it tasted better than i expected. we don't eat much so we shared it. comes with a bowl of creamed spinach and french fries, which i felt was a tad odd to go with a steak and it seemed as if though they were just there for me. the steak was fantastically done, however, and it was seasoned and prepared very nicely. it seems i don't regret changing the order from the filet mignon just for the sake of having more to share.\n\nwarm bread pudding -- the three of us split this as a dessert to top off a rather delicious dinner. it was served nicely and warm (as the name states). the bread is laid over a delicious toffee sauce and is topped with salted whipped cream and honey. it was very satisfying, and not too sweet that i stop after two bites but definitely no ordinary bread pudding. i think this beats my mom's, actually. (hah!)\n\none complaint i do have with this place is the volume of their music, considering how hard it was to have a conversation with my parents and communicate with our server.\n\nanother is the fact that while our server was so friendly and attentive throughout our visit, he seemed a little forgetful, somehow. there were quite a few mistakes that i felt were odd to make. such as giving my mom a sprite instead of a coke? he did end up forgetting our order for the <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark> so we ended up canceling it which took another guy to tell him to do so. and also, he forgot that my stepdad doesn't like ketchup on his burger and that he ordered mayonnaise on the side. i'm sure it could be discussed and easily fixed, and we easily forgave him for the mess-ups because he was that nice.\n\noverall, however, we had a wonderful experience and we've already considered on what to try on our next visit. definitely better than i thought.", 
            "after much hype about honey salt, i had to try it out.  the fact that the name is an oxymoron in and of itself was a plus as well!\n\nthere was zero wait on a saturday afternoon for lunch, but it was still fairly busy.  i agree with others that the seating is a bit tight.  however, the decor is amazing and the fluffy pillows on the benches are so cute!\n\nthe bread basket had two tasty kinds to \"choose\" from (i put that in quotes since i ate them both).  i ordered the biloxi fried chicken since it seemed to be the thing that everyone raved about most.  i was not disappointed.  not sure if i can roll with the pickle thing though... the sandwich would have been just as good without them in my opinion.  i was in love with the sauce and slaw combo on the sandwich and felt that it really pulled it all together.  the chopped salad... no words.  i loved it.\n\nfiance opted for the <mark>Backyard Favorite Burger</mark>.  he said it was good, but really just like any other burger.  the fries were good (i know this is a fact, since i ate about half the basket myself).  he did agree that my meal was better than his.\n\nservice is where the last star was lost.  while our server was very nice, he did let drinks run dry when they should not have been.  other than that, honey salt is definitely worth returning to.  i also think that its location is absolutely perfect because it fits in well with the surrounding shops.", 
            "honey salt\ntaking up fellow yelpers' recommendations, my wife and i, along with a friend, went to honey salt for late lunch on a week day near the end of march. we are so glad we did, as we really enjoyed our luncheon experience in this charming restaurant, which offers good food, comfortable ambience and excellent service! \n \nafter getting through its entrance door, we were cheerfully greeted by its friendly hostess. we were very pleasantly surprised by its spaciousness and its casually comfy and \"pop-artishly\" elegant decor, not to mention its beautiful bar with large marble counter. around 1:30pm on a week day, the place was almost full, especially at the bar - a good sign!\n\nthe free bread basket was very good. for our late lunch, we had fried clam/calamari appetizer ($14) to share, which was very tasty with a seasoned light batter.\n- <mark>Backyard Favorite Burger</mark> ($13) cooked to order. our friend loved it, saying that it was juicy, tasty and cooked to perfection for her. she cut a piece for me to try, and i totally agreed with her.\n- biloxi buttermilk fried chicken ($13), which was good with tasty batter, but the chicken breast itself was a bit too dry for my liking. i had to ask for some honey muster to dip the chicken in (not a bad idea, i might add!). this entree also came with a chopped salad which was very fresh.\n- my wife had the steak house salad and was impressed how tender and juicy the steak was, as well as how fresh and delicious was the salad! my wife is critical of any food. so, when she said it was great, i believed her. besides, she wouldn't let me be my own judge of that by offering me a piece of the steak anyway!\n\n- to top our meal off, we enjoyed sharing an apple pie in its own hot dish with a scoop of icecream on top ($9). the pie tasted heavenly, especially over a cup of coffee or tea!\n\nthroughout our meal, our waiter was very attentive; other serving staff kept our glasses of ice water and coffee cups full; cleared our finished plates at the right time - all without our asking. wonderful! \n\nwhen we were leaving around 3pm, the dining room was still about half full. the friendly hostess came by to say goodbye and told us about their menu for brunch and dinner. she also showed us their small patio outside of the entrance door - which we had missed earlier. she sure did make us feel welcome. \n\ngetting out of the door, we also overheard another customer saying something to the hostess, seemingly something about their impressive restrooms? - hmm...that's intersting! as none of our party visited the restrooms that day, i couldn't help but wondering...!\n\nwe loved this place, at least for lunch, and will definitely go back to try out its dinner menu; well, also to find out what makes their restrooms so impressive? \n\nan appeal to the management:\n- i do so wish that honey salt would offer happy hours! it has such a nice bar and a good drink menu, and yet, no happy hour? please!?\n\npeterskis3, mar 2013\n---", 
            "finally made it out to honey salt. i've heard great things and yelp surely seems to like them. \n\nwe went for lunch and my first impression was very hip decor. it looked like a restaurant you'd see as \"up and coming\" or \"trendy\". the doors were open, the patio was set, and it was a really warm atmosphere. lots of people in the restaurant and it seemed really inviting. \n\nthe food was great! i got the grilled octopus nicoise. the octopus was cooked perfectly. it wasn't chewy at all and the flavor of the dressing paired well with the octopus. the ingredients of olives, fried egg, and potatoes were a great combination. i have never had potatoes in a salad before (aside from potato salad of course). it was surprisingly a great salad. \n\nthe fiance got the <mark>Backyard Favorite Burger</mark>. she really liked it. i tried a bite and i thought it was delicious! she added the fried egg and it paired really well. the seasoning of the burger was savory and it was cooked perfectly. \n\nfrom the review, you might ask why i didn't give 5 stars. my only complaint was the size of the  menu. there was a large option for salads (market greens) and sandwiches (in bread we trust). i realize i came during lunch and that menus at a nice place like this generally are smaller. i was just looking for a bit more selection.\n\ni will definitely be back for more. there were many things i still wanted to try and the dinner menu has several things that look amazing!", 
            "i love this place.\ni love everything about it! the food, the staff, the drinks, the decor. it is all quite lovely!\n\nfood:\ncharred octopus- i usually hate octopus because its chewy and not pleasant to eat. but this appetizer was so good. the octopus was soft and tender and the charred parts gave it this wonderful flavor of goodness. perfect balance\n\nscallop ceviche- came in this cool little carrier almost like a wooden toolbox or something to fit in with the rustic theme of the restaurant. fresh no sand or \"sea\" smell just goodness\n\ncaramelized sea scallops- super delish. i've been on a scallop kick and these are so good! just perfectly cooked on each side to brown it. yummmmmmmm\n\nprime rib special- they had a special the night i went for prime rib. it came out grilled which is not what i'm use to but i think i liked it even more grilled than the usual. need some sort of sauce or horseradish or something to accompany and it would have been perfect.\n\n<mark>Backyard Favorite Burger</mark>- gotta add the egg. came with a little tin can of french fries that weren't anything special. but the burger was quite good and would def recommend for burger lovers\n\nside of asparagus- nothing special. its asparagus!\n\ndrinks: they have a good drink selection of cocktail and twist on classics. there is a drink that comes with an ice ball that is very similar to an old fashion but even better!! i might of had to0 many of them.  :) i might have to return just to drink these ice ball old fashion type drinks. think its called midnight rambler? \n\n\nwould highly recommend making reservations as this place gets busy!", 
            "it was love at first sight.  as soon as i opened the doors and walked into this gorgeous space i wanted so badly to like the food... and was extremely relieved not to have been disappointed.  the place was covered with rustic bricks, great artwork, good-looking servers with matching good service.  a \"boutique\" restaurant with \"boutique\" food - a cross section between the comfort staples and froo-froo fare that does not skimp on seasoning.  \n\nthe new england fry-d calamari and mussels were divine - light, crispy with a tangy/slightly spicy sauce.  the charcuterie pizza had different salami and ricotta and fennel was excellent (but i thought it could've been served without the spicy oil).  my ahi salad was almost perfect - the spinach with pickled onions were... haunting, lol, for lack of a better term.  i so want to replicate it at home.  but the <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark>'s crust i think could be improved.  maybe a little more salt and heat to play off the already sweet bed of jicama and asparagus.  the <mark>Backyard Favorite Burger</mark> my husband loved, but my brother in law complained about the salt levels.  the burger platters came with your own catsup bottle.  how can you not like this place?\n\nwish we had more time and space to try the desserts.  i swear they were calling my name on our way out.  honey salt you are a perfect balance of the very things that tug at my palette and my personality.  i want more.", 
            "i found out about honeysalt completely by accident a few months ago, and i have been wanting to try it ever since. it is tucked in the corner of the shopping plaza across from boca par on rampart (the one with williams-sonoma & pottery barn), so it is easy to miss. i finally went for lunch today. first, i took it as a great sign that they were packed on a tuesday at noon...and i was right!!\n\ni had a hard time deciding what to get because everything sounded pretty amazing. i started off with a grilled peach & ricotta salad with bing cherries, spiced pistachios, & sherry vinaigrette. it. was. awesome!!! i had a tough time deciding between the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> & the <mark>Backyard Favorite Burger</mark>...but ultimately went with the margherita pizza. my friend ordered the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> and loved it. with 2 iced teas our bill was $42. so, a little bit on the pricey side, but everything was delicious and the service was great!!\n\nit is nice to have a upscale option in that area since there are so many chains in that spot (chili's, claim jumper, pf chang's, etc). i can't wait to go back!! i say definitely check them out if you're in the area", 
            "we ventured out to this great place and we weren't disappointed. the <mark>Backyard Favorite Burger</mark> will become a tradition for my vegas visits. the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> and steak salad are also very very good.   service was polite and professional and though we had a trainee for our meal, everything went well. i'd recommend this place to anyone for a reasonably priced well prepared meal.", 
            "honey salt oh honey salt.\n\nupon entering the vicinity, i almost felt like i am going on a cruise ship or i was on a boat? maybe cause of all wood & mirror that they had going on around the room.  i really liked their decor but there were some parts of the place that it did not flow quite well.    i don't really know if the restaurant is trying to go for a  \"down to earth\" or \"want to feel high-end but still have a casual feel\" style. it just feels pretty off. \n\nratings (out of 5)\nservice (3.5) \nbeen here a couple of times and the service was a hit-or-miss for me.  they all wear very casual attire, which i am not sure if i liked it, but there is that sense of personal feel when talking with the waiters because they feel really relaxed and they dont feel like they have to as professional as they should be.\n\nfood (3)\ni have ordered the calamari: it was greasy, bland, and not worth it at all! the portion was pretty small for the price.  i even tried squeezing some lemon over the calamari to add some taste, it did help but it was just way tooo greasy ! \n \nnext the <mark>Backyard Favorite Burger</mark> with fries:  i did like it & it almost tasted like the burger i would get at holstein at the cosmo! the fries however was really soggy, i felt like it has been sitting out for a while :(  \n\natmosphere (3.7)\nlike i said earlier, i really liked it but it was off for some reason. but it does have that down to earth feel like im going on a cruise.  \n\noverall, \ni would come back and try other items on the menu such as the \"chick-fil-a\" & some meat entrees. :) it's a nice restaurant and i think everyone will enjoy their time here.", 
            "i had to complete my quest for one of the top ten burgers of las vegas list so i ordered the <mark>Backyard Favorite Burger</mark>. my burger was cooked perfectly but the tomato jam combination didn't work for me. it wasn't terrible but it didn't knock my socks off either. the meat was tasty and with different toppings, i would have probably enjoyed the burger a lot more.  i didn't like the fries and i barely finished half my fries. \n\ni had a bite of my friend's dishes and it was just underwhelming to me. i was expecting a lot more after hearing all the rave reviews. however, i like the ambiance of the place and we did see a celebrity there so that was neat. i will go a second time to try the other dishes.", 
            "vegas is totally awesome when you can go a bit off the strip. you go to the strip to indulge, but parts of vegas are actually a real town. there's stuff beyond the strip, the glam, and the glitz.\n\non our last day in vegas, we were all burnt out. but luckily, we found a bit of charm.\n\nhoney salt is that upon first glance. you walk in, and it's like going to your mother's house. but let's assume your mother is white, southern, and is best friends with trisha yearwood. it was modern country chic in vegas, something that i was glad was not overrun by being on las vegas boulevard.\n\ni had:\n\n*biloxi buttermilk fried chicken - $13\nit was a delectable sandwich who didn't miss a mark on offering an experience. i always say that a restaurant truly has guts for carrying such an item, and they didn't disappoint. a wealth of ingredients in a beautiful chopped salad that was used to accessorize a glorious <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>. battered chicken that was not too heavy but not too light with a great slaw sandwiched between a brioche bun.\n\nlunch companions did the <mark>Backyard Favorite Burger</mark> and the street tacos as well with no complaints.\n\nfood to back-up a beautiful space made for a wonderful experience.\n\nservice did not also disappoint, nicholas was friendly, polite, and had personality. it's a local spot for sure as it is off the strip, on this monday it was summerlin ladies who lunch (we saw your champs, girls).\n\nwill definitely be back for sure. a spot not to miss.",

            "my friend, who is a local, recommended honey salt for the burrata and heirloom tomato salad with the shaved bittersweet chocolate add-on. the artfully-plated salad comes with figs, basil, balsamic vinegar and extra virgin olive oil. a truly creative take on the classic caprese salad that brings your taste buds a flavor-packed symphony of sweet and savory tastes with low acidity and plenty of umami. i also tried the <mark>Backyard Favorite Burger</mark>, which comes with beehive cheddar, tomato jam, butter pickle and a side of french fries. ketchup comes in a mini squeeze bottle - ours was on the low side.(it would be nice if they topped off each bottle before sending it out.) at $14, the medium-rare burger was a very disappointing 2-yelp-stars in terms of flavor and juiciness, especially after that amazing 5-yelp-stars burrata-tomato-chocolate salad. absolutely nothing stood out about the beef patty, bun and accompaniments. next time, two burrata and heirloom tomato salads!!!!!\n\nother notes:\nfree wi-fi!\nshabby chic decor. (it's so hot right now.)\nour server sported ray-ban wayfarers sans lens and spiky styled hair (plus, the requisite hipster ultra-skinnies).\nthe restroom sports an interesting \"wallpaper\" collage of hotel and business key cards and the like. i spotted carl w.'s fiserv!\ndesert air dried out your hands? smooth and soothe them with some complimentary salt scrub at the restroom sink. \n\nyummy salt water taffy at the hostess stand. try the birthday cake flavor!", 
            "the <mark>Backyard Favorite Burger</mark> is one if the best in the city. grass fed beef and the accompaniments make for a fantastic taste. i'd rank this the 2nd best burger in the city of las vegas and as a burger connoisseur that's a big deal. enjoy!!", 
            "i love this place.  many people scoff at the idea of farm to table in las vegas.  however, honey salt actually lists the farms they source from at the bottom of their menu.  many of them in pahrump, so i guess it is not such a crazy idea after all!\n\ni started with the tuna appetizer, which is amazing.  this is the second time i have had it.  what was more amazing is that everyone at the table agreed on raw tuna to start.  sometimes it can be a hard sell to some people.  this is my top two favorite tuna dishes in vegas.\n\nso moving on to the entrees, i had the <mark>Backyard Favorite Burger</mark> because i had recently read about it in desert companion.  let's talk about how all aspects of the burger were good: the brioche bun, the meat, the cheddar...however, take a moment for this to sink in: bacon jam.  that's right, bacon jam.  you lift the lid off your burger and put your face down there...and smokey wonderful ness awaits you....\n\neveryone else at the table got pizzas and scallops.  we had the mac and cheese as a side, and it's fantastic.  i thought rachel's kitchen had the lock on putting new and interesting items in mac, however, honey salt puts kale.  that's right, kale.  and it's good, so just try it.\n\nmoving on to dessert.  we had a brookie with salted caramel ice cream.  let me tell you something about the salted caramel ice cream...it would be entirely appropriate for you to ask them to put a scoop on everything you order, including your wine.  it is that good.\n\nthis place can fill up on weekends so make a reservation, or better yet, go during the week.  treat yourself.  why not?", 
            "we came here during lunch hour and it was only half of the menu because the kitchen was closing and getting ready for dinner time. we had the new england fry and the <mark>Backyard Favorite Burger</mark>. everything was on point, the fried calamari was the shit, don't be scared to try the roasted green peppers that come on top, super flavorful. the burger was super juicy we had an egg and bacon for the topping, we literally finished everything even the pickles and lettuce that was placed on the side. i chased everything down with a cold glass of stella. we finished our meal with the brown bag apple pie and it came with vanilla bean ice cream.. we also killed that too when i thought i was full. the service was great, the place is very clean also \"cute\" and modern. ooooooh the bathroom even has an exfoliating scrub which i spent like 7 mins in the bathroom washing my hands.", 
            "i've had the pleasure of dining at honey salt for both brunch and lunch. it has an upscale feel, while still remaining casual. it's been described as \"feeling like a pottery barn.\" i quite like the ambiance, the mismatched furniture and chandeliers, it really takes me away from vegas and makes me feel like i'm at a hip restaurant in a cool city. \n\nmy husband and i first decided to check it out for lunch. he couldn't resist ordering the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> and i went with the <mark>Backyard Favorite Burger</mark>. the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> was juicy and delicious. i can see why people compare it to chik-fil-a. the burger was seasoned perfectly, i really enjoyed the tomato jam since i'm notorious for picking my tomatoes off of my burgers. the shoe string fries were a perfect side.\n\nmore recently, my friends and i decided to check out their brunch. we started with some <mark>Monkey Bread</mark> for the table. it was ooey, gooey, and so delicious. it is perfect for splitting with the table and the hints of citrus really counter the sweet honey sauce. i settled on the steak and <mark>Steak & Egg Slider</mark> and it was a great decision. the steak was super flavorful and the entire thing just worked well together. i also felt somewhat healthy since there was creamed spinach. the breakfast potatoes were more like wedge fries, but i'm not one to complain about potatoes in any form. i also split some peach pancakes with a friend and they were delicious. there were peaches baked in, but could have used some more peaches on top. \n\nit wouldn't be a girls brunch without cocktails and they have a full bar. i had a delicious strawberry, prickly pear, lime, cocktail with citrus vodka. my friends all went with the bottomless mimosas, but weren't impressed with the $20 price tag. \n\ni will definitely be back, especially for brunch, maybe even this weekend!", 
            "i finally made it here.\nit's so cute inside... kind of a country chic look.  casual but stylish.  the tables and chairs don't all match and the chandeliers are a charming touch.  the space is open with high ceilings so that may contribute to it being a bit loud inside.\nwe got there a bit before noon on friday.  it wasn't super busy... just a handful of tables were sat.  but when we looked around at 12:30pm it seemed like the place was 3/4 full, so they do a good lunch service which is good to see.\nthe menu has a nice variety on it, and the cocktail and wine/beer list has lots of good looking choices.\n\ni started off with the mosc-ito.  i could drink this all day.  it wasn't sweet... it wasn't harsh. it was like a moscow mule and a mojito... it was light and refreshing.  perfect for a hot day.\n\nfor lunch, we did their 3-course prix fixe menu for $21 per person (note... the whole table does not have to do this).... choice of soup or salad, a choice of sandwich and a choice of strawberry sorbet or pumpkin bread pudding.  since there was 2 of us... we got 1 of each of the desserts so we could try both.  score!  anyways...\n\ni had the market salad and the <mark>Backyard Favorite Burger</mark>.  my girlfriend had the soup and the farmers toast (open faced) sandwich. \n\nmy salad was very tasty and i noticed on the menu that it comes entr\\u00e9e sized too... which i would totally do again.  the salad was crisp and had pepitas in it which imo totally add a different texture which i loved, and the dressing was like a light creamy vinaigrette.  my burger was cooked just right (medium) and had good flavor.  the bun it came on was a brioche bun i belive... it was great but it was too much bread so i ended up not eating half of the bread.  oh!  and it came with fries.  the fries were cooked just right... crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.  because i knew we were going to enjoy dessert too... i didn't eat all my fries.  but i wanted to.\n\nthe soup my gf had was the sweet corn soup and she said she really enjoyed it as well as the farmers toast which was very pretty looking, and she said it tasted as good as it looked too.  hers also came with fries.\n\nour desserts of sorbet and bread pudding did not disappoint.  the strawberry sorbet was sweet but not too sweet and had bits of fresh strawberry in it.  the bread pudding was rich and decadent!  \n\nfor the 2 of us... the bill was $68.  not cheap but we had a drink each and both enjoyed a 3 course meal too.  definitely was not hungry until much much later that night.\n\ni'll definitely come back!",

            "from acclaimed michelin star steakhouses to the trendiest gastropubs, from ayce buffets to authentic asian food, vegas has a ton of restaurants. \n\nunfortunately, almost all of these restaurants are not dog-friendly. i even heard that you can't walk dogs on the strip because they wanted to keep the peddlers and their dogs off las vegas boulevard. \n\ntherefore, trying to find a dog-friendly restaurant will require you to leave the strip and head over to the more residential areas of vegas. perusing the yelp app, that is how the wife and i stumbled upon honey salt, a glorious restaurant in the summerlin part of northwest las vegas that feels like palm springs, ca... complete with wealthy white people and golf courses.\n\nlike morons, we decided to do a late lunch with our four-legged son, charlie, in the hot desert that encompasses las vegas. blame our stupidity or the fact that we are so used to taking him around with us everywhere in southern california that we did not realize how fucking hot it gets in las vegas. that is why when we arrived at honey salt, their spacious patio was empty. however, almost immediately, one of their workers, mauro, came out and set up a patio umbrella for us to shade us from the hot desert sun. i'm sure he was thinking, stupid tourists! \n\nas we were waiting for the umbrella to be set up, our mindful server, louis, brought out a bowl of water filled with ice cubes for charlie! he even brought out two glasses and a pitcher of ice water for the dumb humans! first impressions go a long way and we were definitely impressed. \n\nwe ended up ordering two of the \"family favorites\" off their lunch menu. the mary's free range chicken ($15) and the <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> salad ($17). \n\nthe mary's free range chicken is served with red and white quinoa, beluga lentils, shaved fennel, radish, avocado chunks, and a citrus vinaigrette. while the chicken was very good, the grains definitely stole the show. this hearty conception was delicious and the citrus vinaigrette made it really refreshing. true to their name the citrus vinaigrette provided the \"honey\" and the grains provided the \"salt\".\n\nthe <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> salad was equally amazing. yes, the wasabi pea and ginger crusted <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> was great and the baby spinach with cream soy vinaigrette was delicious. however, the real star was the sea beans and julienned asian pears salad mixed in what was a sesame kind of sauce. this single salad had both \"honey\" from the sweet asian pears and \"salt\" from the sea beans. freaking awesome.\n\nall in all, the service and the fresh farm-to-table food was really impressive. it's definitely a hidden gem in the las vegas desert. next time the family is in vegas, we will wait for the sun to go down so that mauro won't have to break a sweat for us.\n\n* the complimentary parmesan crisps served with honey butter were very addicting and they have an extensive beer selection.\n\n* honey salt is located in the inconspicuous rampart commons shopping center with a chico's, gap, and pottery barn at the northwest corner of rampart and charleston. if exiting the rampart exit off the summerlin parkway, the shopping center will be on the right.\n\n* honey salt must be doing something right because they will be opening up another restaurant in the summerlin area!", 
            "love the atmosphere.  we had a party of 5 people. three of us ordered chicken burger, one of us order grill cheese and soup and i ordered <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> salad. all of the dishes were good.  our total bill was about $100 for 5 dishes, two coffee and one desert.  the coffees were $7 per cup which is very pricy in compare of the food price. that's why i rated a 4 star",

            "this place is magically.\n\ni spent several hours looking for a quiet place with good food that was off the strip.  i'm am in vegas visiting while my boyfriend works.  i'm pretty big into fitness and eating real food which (if you've ever visited vegas before you know) it's pretty hard to find along the strip.  \n\nhoney salt is an adorable place hidden in the corner of a shopping mall in a nice part of town.  they have an awesome hipster vibe with a gorgeous brick wall on one side and a wall with mirrors of different sizes scatted around.\n\nwe started with the salt and pepper fries.  they are just regular fries, nothing too crazy about them (they are good).  i know this is weird, but my boyfriend and i dipped them in the honey butter that they serve with the bread.  so good having a mix of salt and sweet!\n\ni had the special that day, braised lamb with chickpeas and carrots.  simply amazing.  a perfect blend of flavor and spices.  my boyfriend had the <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> entree. it looked delish, but a little small.\n\nfinishing the night out we had the peach pie with coffee. can't say enough about it.  fresh, yummy... you've gotta try it!\n\nscott was our server and he was seriously amazing. he called a cab for us and made our experience even better.\n\ni think this is the longest yelp review i've ever written, but i can't say it enough...you have to go check out honey salt!", 
            "out of the numerous times my wife and i have visited honey salt we have never had a bad meal.  this was also our first brunch experience with kim canteenwalla & e. blau's honey salt and hopefully will not be our last.  they always have the cream of the crop servers who are both incredibly knowledgable of the menu items and extremely friendly.  we decided to come in for an impromptu lunch/brunch as we were entertaining friends and knew this would be a quality meal without destroying our bankroll (unlike my wife's spending habits-kidding).  upon arriving the beautiful hostess michelle said we could be accommodated even though we did not have any reservations. once sat they took our drink order while offering delectable suggestions.  never to early for bourbon so i chose the maple old fashioned any my wife decided to dd and went with a refreshing \"cool as a cucumber\".  we then ordered our entrees and i went with the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> on the onion brioche and the wife had the <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> salad. both were huge portions and i left pleasantly full but not obese. can't wait to go back for my next bourbon brunch.", 
            "went to vegas for a long weekend this past friday.  i saw honey salt on yelp prior to going and decided to check it out after i landed.  be advised you will either need a car or be prepared to take a 15-20 minute cab ride if you're staying on the vegas strip.  i got there around 2:00 and was surprised that the restaurant was still about 75% full.  i took that as a good sign since i showed up at an off peak hour.  since i was by myself, i sat at the bar.  the bartender was friendly and provided attentive service.  i decided to go with the <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> tartare tostada.  the tuna was fresh and light and the yuzu slaw provided a nice acidic kick to the rich tuna.  \n\nthe only thing lacking was a little bit of salt.  i probably could have asked for a salt shaker, but it wasn't that big of deal so i just went with it.  all in all it was a tasty dish.  there were several other things on their menu that i would like to try, so if i'm ever in that part of vegas again i'll be sure to stop by.", 
            "wow! absolutely phenomenal, all the way around! excellent menu. i loved the <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> tartare to start and the mushroom risotto as my entr\\u00e9e. oh and don't get me started on their bread basket and butter from heaven!! what pushed me over the top was the amazing \"brookie\" with the salted caramel ice cream! un-be-lieve-able!! and then there was monica! best service in all of las vegas! i will be back just for monica! knowledgable, passionate, \"real\" and personable! thank you so much for an inc edible and memorable experience!",

            "not really sure why i have taken so long to finally make it into honeysalt for a meal. a friend of mine was visiting in town this week and she had her pr gal set her up with reservations for one night and asked me if i wanted to join her. we got to try many items on the menu and all were incredibly delicious there was not one thing we didn't love. the grilled octopus is quite possibly my most favorite dish i have eaten in a long time. the scallops were cooked to perfection, the <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark> was so good and the brookie and apple pie desserts are amazing as well. service was impeccable and not just because we were there for a comped meal, my friend and i are both food photographers and bloggers and shared lots of pics of our meals on social media,  but you can tell they really put emphasis on service.  the meal was so amazing i made reservations for two nights  later for my husband and i to have a late night date night.  i got to try several other dishes on the menu that i hadn't had two nights before i got the grilled octopus again i tried the trout which was cooked so perfectly and we have the orange chocolate bread putting for dessert.  the maple bourbon cocktail was so good too.  the menu is reasonably priced, definitely a lot cheaper than the restaurants on the strip, perfect for a date night. i want to try brunch,  happy hour and even come in for lunch and this will probably happen soon since this is my new favorite restaurant in vegas."

            "i am teetering between a 2 and a 3 star review for honey salt. the food was overall enjoyable. the service was attentive in certain aspects, but the pace was truly horrific. 30 minutes before we received our first cocktails. 45 minutes before our food was able to be ordered. with our three course meal, the experience took three and a half hours. good thing we were not on a time restraint. normally, i wholeheartedly support the slow food culture, but i need an appetizer to come out in a timely manner to help quell the hunger. by the time the food started to roll out, we were enjoying the cocktails and each others company. \n\ncocktails:\n\nmos-quito- a mojito made with ginger beer. it had a bite and the right amount of herbal notes to make it a refreshing drink.\n\nqueen bee- sweet as honey and goes down like candy.\n\ni forget the name, but it is made with jalapeno vodka, st. germain, and cucumber soda. hands down, the best. \n\nbottles of wine are also very affordable. going to lee's to get a bottle of nickel and nickel ran about the same as us ordering it at the restaurant. \n\nappetizers:\n\nsteak tartare- group favorite. even the anti-raw food committee enjoyed it. the best of all the first course dishes. with the bread, it helped to fill empty stomachs. on it's own, it is a parade for the taste buds.\n\nyellowtail sashimi- i am not a big fan of this fish and still found the dish palatable. the slight spice of the radish and crispy of the jicama gave new sensations to a normally disagreeable taste.\n\nhs shrimp cocktail- once you have one, you have had them all. nothing wow worthy.\n\npaleta iberico ham- all the components were there. they were all pleasant, but the minus eight vinegar was not as prevalent as we were expecting. \n\nburatta salad- i adore buratta. mozzarella stretched, filled with cream and more soft cheese which oozes once cut. delicious.\n\nmargharita pizza- simple, classic, and not bad.\n\n\nentrees:\n\ncaramelized sea scallops- scallops are best when not cooked all the way through. ours came out to the table at an odd temperature. the flavors were good, but the whole dish was cool. do they cut their scallops in half? because the pieces looked small.\n\n<mark>Grilled Scottish Salmon</mark>- forgettable. the pitch is more impressive than the follow through.\n\nturkey bolognese- farro pasta cooked well and the blend of ingredients complemented each other well.\n\nfree range brick oven chicken- it is hard to impress with chicken, but the skin on the bird was phenomenal. it was crisp and had a crunch that would rival a kettle chip. the mac and cheese needed a kick. when paired with the sweet pepper side, it was amazing.\n\n12oz. ny strip- by far, the best deal on the whole menu. it was tender, juicy, cooked to perfection, and cannot be beat at $28. \n\n\nsides:\n\nall of them, yet the sweet peppers were the only ones that stood out on its own or when combined with something else.\n\n\ndesserts:\n\ntried them all, there was nothing super impressive. the bread pudding was the strongest offering. the bourbon toffee sauce was an essential factor.  i would have been happier with just sipping on the nutcello.", 
            "i hope that my bad experience can be chalked up to a bad server. i ran into a good friend of mine that night on our way out and he was positive about it overall. if it hadn't been so expensive this would have been a 3-star, but for the price i expect more.\n\nlet me start with the good! \n\nmy fianc\\u00e9 and i had an appetizer of 'paleta iberico ham', and it was delicious. really delicious. i followed it up with the '<mark>Grilled Scottish Salmon</mark>'. this came with a quinoa pilaf under the salmon, and the two together were really great. the fish was cooked excellently and the flavors of everything went great together. \n\nfor dessert i had pumpkin cheesecake. it was fantastic. i hate pumpkin and this was fantastic. really really good. my fianc\\u00e9 was given a 'brown bag baked apple pie' complements of the house (more on that later) and declared after her first bite, \"oh wow, this is frickin' delicious!\"\n\n\nthe bad!\n\nour waiter wasn't good with english, which made communicating with him difficult. he was not very attentive and our drinks --just plain water --spent a good portion of time during our 2-hour dinner sitting empty. we also spent a good portion of time waiting for him, either to come and take our dinner order, deliver dessert menus, take the check, etc. this 2-hour dinner should have been 1:15 at most\n\nas a side dish to my salmon i ordered french fries. they were stale, and seemed to be the kind that came from a frozen bag and were heated in the microwave. absolutely disappointed in the fries, especially since they cost a ridiculous $7.\n\nthe biggest problem we had on the night was the 'grass-fed filet mignon' which my fianc\\u00e9 ordered as her main entr\\u00e9e. the waiter asked how she wanted it cooked, and she clarified that she wanted it pink throughout but with no red (in most places this is medium, in a strange few it is medium-well). it was made very clear that she didn't want anything near rare. \n\nrare is exactly what she got. she cut into it, and there was a ring of perfect rich deep pink about 1/8\" from the beautiful crust on the outside ... and the inside was completely raw. if you've ever heard of ordering steak \"black and blue\" or \"pittsburg rare\" this would fit the bill exactly. that's way too underdone for her liking.\n\nso the steak had to go back. when it was returned the inside was again not quite up to medium but she accepted it because she was hungry, and the steak had taken quite a long time to get back. by the time it had been heated and redelivered we had finished my entire salmon and waited a few minutes with no food at all. the second cooking made the steak pretty tough (especially for a filet mignon, even one cooked twice) but the flavor was definitely there.  i will be trying this filet again when we go back.\n\nthe last problem is a minor one: the house steak sauce that comes with the steak is super sweet. way too sweet to go with this steak and bacon hash. it's completely out of place.\n\n\nlet me close by saying that the steak definitely had potential. it was seasoned perfectly, came with a killer bacon hash, and had great flavor, but they need to figure out the difference between medium and rare. i can't say that it was a problem with communicating with the waiter or a problem with the kitchen but i'll find out next time. the fries were just bad, and there's no saving them. and the service definitely needs to be addressed. i'll be going back and updating the review accordingly.", 
            "a wonderful addition to the summerlin area and a great place to enjoy some trendy ambience in boca park.  my party enjoyed our evening from the moment we stepped in: the restaurant features an open-concept floor plan, allowing one to see and be seen, with plenty of dark wood and chic light fixtures that add contemporary decorative flair.  our server was very friendly and obviously wanted us all to have a positive experience, stopping by several times to refill water glasses and to check that everything was to our liking.\n\nhoney salt states that they are \"committed to providing fresh and innovative food\" (website) and they do indeed follow through.  our collective entr\\u00e9es included the <mark>Grilled Scottish Salmon</mark> (served on a bed of quinoa pilaf, braised fennel, house-made peppadew chimichurri sauce; $25), the free range brick oven chicken (served with kale and anaheim pepper mac n' cheese; $22), and the caramelized sea scallops (served with charred cauliflower and vanilla bean cauliflower puree; $28).  all were delightful, fresh, and delicious.  i especially enjoyed my chimichurri sauce with my salmon, as the bright flavours complemented the delicacy of the fish.  my hubby's scallops were fantastic!  the chicken was not overcooked at all (whew!) and the mac 'n cheese was so yummy.  for dessert, we shared a warm bread pudding (with the most lovely bourbon toffee sauce) and a (huge) slice of the triple layer cake (2 layers of chocolate fudge cake, 1 layer of roasted banana cake all iced with brown sugar buttercream).  good thing we shared....sort of.  so good!  \n\ni don't have any complaints about the food as everything was excellent.  the ambience is trendy and slightly slanted towards youth, but anyone can come here and enjoy a terrific meal.  my only critique about the actual space is that it would have been nice to have a bit more, er, space between tables.  because of this, at times i felt like i was in a cafeteria.  a very chic, expensive cafeteria, but still...!  honey salt is not an inexpensive place, but then again, you get what you pay for....and you get quality here.  \n\ni am definitely coming back to check out the lunch menu....and to snag another piece of that triple layer cake!  make sure to take a look at the salt and pepper shakers display at the front of the restaurant -- so cute!", 
            "this place is very nice, and a pleasurable experience.\n\nambiance - a bit more upscale and modern compared to your normal residential strip mall eateries. mood is nice for either a family get together, a date, or a romantic evening.- 5 star\n\nservice -  our service, and waitress were above par, very attentive and very, very friendly. it is exactly as it should be.  5 star.\n\nfood - we had a rather large party of over 16 people so we had the \n\nappetizer steak tartare, meatballs, and all these were both tasty, and served just right. 4 star.\ndinner - <mark>Grilled Scottish Salmon</mark> - was okay,  ny strip - pretty good, brick oven chicken - yeah, that was good!  4 star\nsides - asparagus, mac n cheese, french fries, 4 star\n\nthis is a very good american cuisine restaurant, nice decor, ambiance and very edible food.  while not exactly mind blowing menu with the most delightfully different foods, this is some basic americana that you cannot miss on and your friends, family and guests will enjoy this place.\n\ngk says, check it out for sure!", 
            "holy honey salt!\n\nthis place is amazing! i had the <mark>Grilled Scottish Salmon</mark> for my entree with quinoa and fennel. yum! salmon was cooked to perfection which a nice crisp outside. that was the first time i've ever tried quinoa and that may be a new fav thanks to honey salt introducing me too it. \n\nmy boyfriend ordered the chicken curry and unfortunately he was no too impressed with it. the sauce was thin like soup, and we are a very critical couple when it comes to curry. we've tried all types and we prefer curry with thick sauce so that was one thing i would mention if thinking of trying the curry. the flavor was good though. \n\nthe big-eye tuna tartar was pretty darn delicious too. it also had quinoa, but a crunchy version. double yum! and dessert was great too.\n\nhoney salt was top notch and i am definitely going back to try the other delicious looking dishes that have to offer.", 
            "so close to the five stars...  but just slightly lacking on the service side.  it was a friday night and this place was packed!!!  crazy busy.   we had an 8:00 reservation for five.  we all came early thinking we would meet for a drink but it was way too busy so we went across the street to martini.  at 7:58 we rushed over to meet our reservation, except they weren't ready for us....  until nearly 8:30.  sadly we left half full drinks that we could have finished if they had chosen to use the phone number they had solicited when we made the reservation.  \ninitially they sat us at a four top with three (not petite) gals jammed in on the sette.  they realized this and moved us to a six top, much better situation.  they also immediately poured us sparkling wine to thank us for our wait.   we received two or three glasses a piece which was needed because our server was not ready to have a table sat.  we waited about 15 minutes to order wine and he was not ready to take our appetizer orders at this point.  we finally ordered our meals at 9:15.  \nnow the food - \nappetizers - \nyellow tail - amazing!!!!\niberico ham - the combination of flavors on this plate are surprising and fulfilling\nnew england fry - although fabulous pales in comparison to the others above.\nentrees -\nscallops (three of us had these) perfectly seared, cauliflower puree so yummy with the buttery flavor of the scallops.\n<mark>Grilled Scottish Salmon</mark> - a bit on the salty side but flavorful, fresh and just plain yummy\nburrata, rosso bruno & teardrop tomatoes - delicious and fresh\nsides -\nbrussel sprouts - my personal favorite.  a bit heavy on the bacon, in fact more bacon than brussel sprouns which saddened me because they were so good.\nmac and cheese - plain and simply delicious\nroasted cauliflower - fresh, great combo of flavors\nspinach - good but for me a bit on the salty side\ndessert\nwe all shared the bread pudding and the salted caramel ice cream..  perfect ending to a perfect meal.  \nfood was a complete pleasure.  once the crowds thinned a bit the service was great.  they are just beyond busy at this time.  fresh, healthy options, etc...........", 
            "in the heart of summerlin is where you'll find honey salt. the family and i come here for dinner. i love the interior. it's bright, spacious, airy and a bit homey. the service was great and the food was pretty amazing. entrees are anywhere from $22-30 and desserts are $9. \n\n<mark>Grilled Scottish Salmon</mark>:\nserved with quinoa pilaf, fennel and chimichurri. the salmon was not dry 4/5\n\ncaramelized sea scallops:\nserved with cauliflower, cauliflower and vanilla bean puree and truffle sauce. the scallops were perfectly cooked and the sauce was amazing! 5/5\n\nmary's free-range brick oven chicken breast:\nserved with mac and cheese, peppers and natural jus. slightly crisp seasoned skin, chicken was tender and juicy. i've been having great luck with chicken dishes lately - this is one of the good ones on my list. 4/5\n\ntriple strawberry shortcake:\nhomemade strawberry ice cream, strawberry jam, fresh strawberries and mascarpone cream. the \"cake\" it came with was light. this was just fabulous! 4.5/5\n\nbrown bag baked apple pie:\nserved with vanilla ice cream. the pie was good but it wasn't something that would normally excite me. 3/5", 
            "nice place.  nice decor.  nice place to bring a date just cause it consists a lot of details that females find pretty \"creatively tantalizing\" (per my fianc\\u00e9).  \n\nbut if you have a hearty-sized-stomach and cares more about your appetite rather than how your plate looks -- well there's a cheese cake factory that serves larger sized portions and offers just about the same quality taste, just across the street (just sayin').\n\n- new england fry (too greasy and they only gave us 3 shishito peppers which was the best part of the app). \n- burrata & heirloom tomatoes \"kim's style\" (kudos on the combination of chocolate and homemade mozzarella cheese, but the portion was way too small even though the server said it would feed 2 people).\n- <mark>Grilled Scottish Salmon</mark> (it was ok.  just ok.  nothing to write about.  seriously.)\n- chocolate buttermilk crunch cake (served as layered cake.  very sweet.  nice dessert.)\n\noverall, if you're looking at going to a nice romantic place, i suggest going to an upper scale steakhouse or french restaurant.  just cause you'll end up spending the same amount of money for a lot more food and ambiance.  \n\ncheers!",

            "i came from across town to experience, what i had been hearing, is one of the best, local new hot spots to try. to be completely honest, i didn't find it to be anything spectacular. \n\nwe started off ordering the <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark> pizza. it was just ok.  i found the tomato sauce and meatballs to lack flavor. they were both very bland and some of the pizza crust was burnt, which i do not like the taste, so that was a turn off.\n\nfor my meal, i ordered the grilled barely buzzed cheddar cheese, which was tasty. that i would order again. as far as the tuscan bean soup that went with it, i enjoyed the flavor of the broth but i felt like the beans were too thick and heavy for the soup. \n\nmy friend ordered the biloxi buttermilk fried chicken, that was great. i really liked the house durkees dressing. it was the perfect amount of sweetness to blend the flavors together well.\n\noverall i felt it was ok and may or may not go back. it was very busy when we went so maybe the kitchen wasn't on their \"a\" game. i will say though, for the price we paid, i did expect a little more then \"ok.\"", 
            "oh honey salt i understand why you must be on the west side but i wish you weren't so far so i could be a regular. i loved this place. the ambiance and high ceilings along with an instant greeting made me feel very welcomed. i loved the attire of the staff. you knew who was doing what depending on their matching outfits. i met a fellow foodie kim, who i know from being a foodie. so this was a perfect place for a lunch date! we had both already looked up the menu and knew we wanted to try the <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark>, so we decided on the meatball pizza as an app. came with <mark>Yukon Gold Potatoes & Caramelized Onions</mark> and a very fresh ricotta cheese. however the tomato sauce was too bland for my personal preference. i went with the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> and kim had the grilled cheese (that has a way fancier name than that). the chicken was fried to perfection and so juicy. the sweet mustard style sauce on it was so good i'd buy a bottle! it was also served with a chopped salad that was quite unique. it had radishes, edamame, and chunks of cheese. way better than fries! i had a bite of kim's grilled cheese and it was pretty bomb too, but i liked mine more. \ni also had a bloody mary as a cocktail, omg why doesn't everyone make this drink with jalape\\u00f1o vodka??! so smart! \na little overpriced, but i guess that's summerlin for you. the service was very good, til the end it got a little slow while waiting for our bill. i brought my boyfriend a <mark>Green Goodness Juice</mark>, made with kale, apples, fennel, celery and whatever other green things i'm forgetting. it was healthy and delicious and i love that it was a menu option.\nill return for dinner, and i look forward to everything but the bill!", 
            "i had <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark> and curry rice. the <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark> were decent and melted in your mouth, but the curry rice was pretty plain, had very little if any spice. probably deserves another try. would i eat here again based on the meal and what my friends had? no.", 
            "gf and i hit honey salt for lunch a few days ago.  \n\nnice looking space - not a big fan of all the mirrors on the one wall but wtf do i know about restaurant design.  i dig the openness to the kitchen.\n\nfelt a little out of place since we were in our post- work out gym clothes.  we got the sense this place is the go to lunch spot for  women shopping nearby or after having their hair and nails done.  \n\nwe shared the <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark> pizza ($14 ) as an app.  meatballs were very tender, nice crust - slight crunch followed by pillow center.  overall, very tasty.\n\ngf went with the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>.  i choose the burger.  the fc sammie came with a salad - very fresh, crunchy veggies.  the fried chicken was tender with   mustard-y cole slaw.  could've used a little more seasoning but overall well prepared.  ( i believe $15)\n\nthe burger also needed more salt otherwise it was perfect.  juicy, juicy, juicy - great flavor.  we agreed to was a better burger than the barrymore.  fries decent especially since they provided a side of the tomato jam for dipping. again i believe it was $15 ) \n\nwe finished with the bread pudding ( with a carmel/toffee sauce ) - excellent ( $9) and the baked alaskan ( $10) - sadly a miss.  the meringue was great, the cake, very dry/stale, the ice cream - very good when eaten on it's own.\n\ndefinitely worth trying again for dinner or brunch. \n\nadded pics of baked alaskan\n\nprobably closer to 3.5 stars to 4", 
            "my mother's birthday was yesterday and my stepfather decided to take us out to a place that his friend from work recommended to him. apparently it was supposed to be pretty good, and so, we became the judge(s) of that.\n\nwalking in, it seemed to me that the place had a bit of a nice quirk to it. it felt a lot like coming in to someone else's house, but also, it felt like it had a small touch of upscale that matched the stores nearby like ann taylor and banana republic.\n\nbefore i could fully admire the interior design, however, i immediately felt out of place. the hostess was dressed as if though she came from her high school prom, the guests were in suits and dresses, and even the servers were all cleaned up rather nicely. and seeing as i came in with jeans and a chunky sweater to brave through the cold, it felt a little odd just being there. but the staff were all courteous and friendly, and they didn't give us any weird looks or silent judgments just because we were underdressed.\n\nall in all, though, the ambiance here seems to be a bit far from the same casual you would probably feel from an applebee's or chili's. but at the same time, aside from the attire, it's pretty easy to feel comfortable here. the lights are dimmed nicely so that it's not overbearingly bright but also not too dark so that you are still able to see, and the candle on the tables add a nice little touch. i also quite like how the kitchen is visible. just something about being able to see food being made seems a bit more - how should i say - comforting for me.\n\nbut anyway, on to the food.\n\n<mark>Backyard Favorite Burger</mark> -- i never got to try it, but according to my stepdad, it tastes very homemade - a rather fitting adjective for the place, i must say. he also mentions that it tastes very fresh and has a rather nice crunch to it, though i'm not sure if for the texture or for the flavor. nonetheless, i trust his word on it.\n\n12 oz. cedar river farm ny strip -- mom and i ordered it to be cooked on a medium, and it tasted better than i expected. we don't eat much so we shared it. comes with a bowl of creamed spinach and french fries, which i felt was a tad odd to go with a steak and it seemed as if though they were just there for me. the steak was fantastically done, however, and it was seasoned and prepared very nicely. it seems i don't regret changing the order from the filet mignon just for the sake of having more to share.\n\nwarm bread pudding -- the three of us split this as a dessert to top off a rather delicious dinner. it was served nicely and warm (as the name states). the bread is laid over a delicious toffee sauce and is topped with salted whipped cream and honey. it was very satisfying, and not too sweet that i stop after two bites but definitely no ordinary bread pudding. i think this beats my mom's, actually. (hah!)\n\none complaint i do have with this place is the volume of their music, considering how hard it was to have a conversation with my parents and communicate with our server.\n\nanother is the fact that while our server was so friendly and attentive throughout our visit, he seemed a little forgetful, somehow. there were quite a few mistakes that i felt were odd to make. such as giving my mom a sprite instead of a coke? he did end up forgetting our order for the <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark> so we ended up canceling it which took another guy to tell him to do so. and also, he forgot that my stepdad doesn't like ketchup on his burger and that he ordered mayonnaise on the side. i'm sure it could be discussed and easily fixed, and we easily forgave him for the mess-ups because he was that nice.\n\noverall, however, we had a wonderful experience and we've already considered on what to try on our next visit. definitely better than i thought.", 
            "of course there must be something great about a place that is wall to wall packed for lunch on a thursday.  lucky we had a reservation.\n\nhoney salt is getting the full 5 stars because not only did the food wow me, the service did too!\n\nfirst, it is super cute inside.  it's a little shabby chic with mismatched chairs and light colors.  \n\nthe meal starts with complementary bread, crackers and hummus.  all delightful.\n\nthe cocktail menu has lots of fun surprises  i ended up with an intriguing martini made up of st. germain (gets me every time), cucumbers, and jalapeno vodka.  it was a perfect balance of sweet, floral, and spicy that left you just plain refreshed!\n\ni had the absolutely delicious <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>.  it was nothing short of ginormous!!  two large fried chicken breast; super flavorful and juicy topped with a sweet mustardy sauce, slaw and pickles.  yum-o.  it came with an extra tasty chopped salad.  no fakers here - it is an actual chopped salad. clarification: i'm finding chopped salads trending on many menus recently and they come out as a completely normal tossed salad...um that doesn't count.  the salad at honey salt has all of the ingredients carefully small diced and properly dressed.  there is edamame, cheese, radish, kale and more.  delicious and different!\n\ni chastised my sister for ordering something as pedestrian as the <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark> for an appetizer.  boy was i wrong! these meatballs were excellent.  they were like butter.  unbelievably tender and scrumptious.   \n\nwe took advantage of dessert as well.  we ordered the cookies.  they were large, chewy and very good.  my sister saw something she thought was a baked alaska and inquired with out waiter.  he said no, we don't have a baked alaska; however, we would be thrilled to make you one.  and they did!  what the heck?!  this place is great!  \n\nthe servers took care of our every little need without hovering.  \n\n2 teensy weensy things: everything ran a bit slow; however, this wasn't a problem for us at all.  we were not in hurry.  also, i found it odd that multiple dishes were garnished with orange zest.  a clever garnish for one dish but definitely not appropriate for everything.  these are just nit picks.  \n\ni can't wait to go again.  it was a very very nice dining experience.", 
            "honey salt meets chic with organic with their modern country decor and their menu inspired by farm fresh ingredients. i love the way they've stuck to their theme with a bright, inviting dining area and a wide view of the kitchen.\n\nmy two friends and i were excited to try multiple dishes, so we decided to split each of our entrees. their turkey bolognese and the meatball pizza were filling. both dishes had <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark> which were light and lean, but they were simply okay in my book. also, farro pasta has a different texture than your typical pasta, so keep that in mind while ordering.\n\nmy absolute favorite was the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>. just couldn't say no to a crispy, succulent fried chicken breast accompanied with cole slaw on a <mark>Toast (White or Wheat)</mark> bun! the dressing complimented the slaw and chicken very well and brought it all together.\n\ntheir service was nothing less than exceptional. our water glasses never went empty despite how busy they were for lunch. what struck me as unique was that they included a notebook for feedback with the bill. thought that was a cute and novel idea to get customers' opinions immediately.\n\nas much as i loved their charming interior and excellent service (rounded up to four stars for that!), there's just something lacking about its food that doesn't reel me in.", 
            "i have read the reviews here about honey salt and i think many people have forgotten what good food is supposed to taste like.  i really think people go out to dine more to \"be seen\" at the newest place versus actually getting a good meal.  for the prices honey salt is charging i truly expected much more.\n\nfirst off my wife ordered the big-eye tuna tartar.  she said it was average at best, but for $15 for a small app you definitely expect better.  i tried the <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark> i had heard were amazing.  i came with 5 small meatballs in the order.  not very good....i ate two and my wife tried one (she spit it out it was so bad) and the other two went back to the kitchen.\n\nnext we each tried the honey salt caesar salad.  not bad, but how hard is it to make a good salad, really?\n\nfor dinner my wife ordered  nana's tiffin chicken curry , she said is was a bit spicier than expected, (our server said it had very little spice) and lacked flavor.  she said she would not order it again.  i had mary's free range brick oven chicken.  in my opinion this was the best thing we ordered for the evening.  the chicken was slightly over cooked but besides that i would give it 3/5.\n\noverall i expected honey salt to be much better than we experienced.  unfortunately for us the $118 we spent for dinner for two turned out to be less enjoyable than anticipated.", 
            "<mark>Turkey Meatball</mark>... good, fine\nbrussels sprouts (yes, again)- seared, not cooked enough, fairly disappointing especially when you know the potential in those babies\ncauliflower- ok... mine is better, there's had been held too long, but that is the way it goes when you want roasted veggies in a restaurant.\nmac and cheese- creamy and smoky, \napple pie- tons of butter, good flaky crust, needed more apple and a bigger scoop if ice cream (gotta have the right ratio of pie to ice cream)\ntaste of salted caramel ice cream (blech.. bit probably good if you like that sort of thing) and cake (meh).  i started with 3 stars, bit i think i am going to change to 2. yelp, let me do 2.5 stars!!!", 
            "i really wanted to love honey salt. as a huge (figuratively & in reality) fan of the shop local, eat local, drink local movement, honey salt encompassed all this as they source locally for their supplies. and it is in the perfect location as my manwhore lives in queensridge. it could really have been our go-to non-casino place. \n\natmosphere was very nice, big change from the wine bar that was there. fat people seating was decent. sturdy armless chairs. hip friendly.  (see below for further info on this) \n\nfood: broad selection for most everyone. free range chicken cooked to perfection. tender steak. great sides & decent drinks. \nbrunch was full of interesting food. i had the bananas foster <mark>Strawberry Shortcake French Toast</mark>. delightful. shared <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark> that had perfect <mark>Yukon Gold Potatoes & Caramelized Onions</mark>.   biloxi buttermilk fried chicken - just like my grammy used to make (except in alabama) \n \nso why only 3 stars? \n\nwe went 3 times, lunch, dinner & brunch. all 3 times, despite having open tables in the main area, we were seated past the bar next to the bathroom and where they put the \"families with kids\" - which we are one but he's 22. normally we wouldn't care except that it is a virtual runway to the bathroom. my only reasoning on why this would happen on 3 very separate occasions is that we don't exactly fit the \"hipster\" image they wish to cater too. we are older (with black amex cards i might add) we are a racially diverse group & we are on the plumper side of plump. \n\nservice: as we were seated in the \"back 40\" - we had to wait. wait for drinks. wait for food. wait for our check. while the aforementioned manwhore was annoyed that they didn't remember us until i pointed out, different times, different staff, he did manage to have a few choice words with the manager on duty. \n\nit's sad because i did like the food but unless we get takeout or my son & i go alone, i'm pretty sure we wont be back.",

            "meh. it was pretty tasteless. the tomatoes in the salad had no flavor, don't serve the salad if you can't get the ingredients. the bread tasted like frozen bake rolls and my meatball pizza, had dried out and old arugula and <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark> with no seasoning. the place was so loud, was horse my the time i left from talking. i felt like the owners had contempt for the customers if they felt the food was acceptable to put there name in it and serve to guests. i was very disappointed", 
            "pretentious and overrated.  the staff here seem to look down their noses at diners which is comical as this restaurant is located in a strip mall and its interior looks like a barn.  the food many on this site seem to like was overpriced and less than spectacular.  i have been there for dinner and brunch, and was disappointed by the fare and service both times. the <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark>, which are touted as one of their specialties,  were tasteless and hard. the pizza dough was also hard and the toppings lacked any depth of flavor.  for brunch i ordered the  hash which was hands down the  absolute worst hash i ever had the misfortune to eat.  the cook must have known it was horrible as he tried to compensate by dousing  it with an enormous amount of salt.  one could get better tasting food at the  cheesecake factory  right across the street  at boca park without the snooty attitude and for far less money.", 
            "amazing, outstanding, fabulous .... and much more!  we had the opportunity to eat at honey salt for the very first time with friends and it was fantastic.  from the very start everything was superb.  we were greeted by the general manager, stephen jerome, and promptly seated.  we started with sharing some of their salads and the <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark>.  the food was paired with a wonderful white wine suggested by stephen.  we then moved on to trying some of the \"family favorites\" including caramelized sea scallops (tender and delicious) and chicken curry.  we also tried a couple of specials not on the menu - a halibut served on top of corn and a steak with mushrooms and topped with salsa.  the main menus were paired with a very nice red wine recommended by the restaurant's sommelier, joe.  we topped off our dinner by sampling three of their desserts - the brown bagged apple pie, triple strawberry shortcake and mcdonnell's salted caramel chunk ice cream.  the executive chef, joe zanelli, came out and checked on us to ensure everything was to our liking.  all i can say is it was one of the best meals we've ever enjoyed.  i highly recommend honey salt.", 
            "ate here last night for dinner for the first time, and was very happy with everything. it wasn't that busy and it was a monday night. from what i read the place can get packed and maybe even a little too cramped, so i would suggest trying it out during the week.\n\nthe <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark> are very delicious.  for entree i got the chicken breast with mac and cheese. it was really good, but the mac and cheese it came with was to die for! my boyfriend got the halibut special and a side of asparagus, and he was very pleased. dessert we got bread pudding and added a scoop if ice cream since it only comes with whip, and we also got the night cap drink (which was very strong, but quite yummy). i was so full by the time we left i couldn't stand it, but so worth it. we were quite happy with everything we were served.\n\nservice was flawless, and atmosphere very quaint and pretty. it can get a little spendy in regards to prices. i would compare it to yard house pricing. i wanted to try somewhere new and i am glad we did. the menu is somewhat small, but you're sure to find something you'll love.",

            "pricey but delicious. the lamb chops tasting course was impeccable.  <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark> were delicious in their marinara sauce and the tuna tartar was flavorful. butternut squash was ok and my girlfriend didn't care for the pumpkin creme dessert. otherwise yummy and worth the return trip", 
            "i think honey salt was one of my first bookmarks and it took us forever to come by. we came for dinner and honestly, it felt a lot more \"fancy\" then i thought it would be. maybe it's different for lunch? i don't know. either way, the decor is pretty cool...a wall of mirrors and the bathrooms covered in baseball cards! that's friggin' awesome!\n\nso, this is my fault for not checking but i was bummed to see that the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> is a lunch item only.  instead i went with the meatball pizza which was surprisingly good. the <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark> were hand made and the horseradish shavings topping it were delicious. my wife had the brick oven chicken which was also really tasty but i thought it was a tad overcooked. they serve it almost like in a bowl with natural jus that really sets the flavor off. i didn't get to try the mac n cheese served with it but she was in love with it. our waiter suggested a brookie for dessert which was also really good. the brownie and cookie were both super soft and the salted caramel ice cream is awesome.\n\neverything sounds good right? well the food was easily 4 stars and the service would have gotten 4 if we wouldn't have been here 2 hours. we got seated fast and the waiter came out quick to get drinks then it all fell apart. about 40 minutes after we order, our foods nowhere to be found and our waiter comes out to tell us a mistake was made and our order didn't even get put in. from there, it took another 25 minutes for our food to come. our waiter was super apologetic and even comped us the dessert but waiting over an hour for food is just crazy. we liked the food a lot and i'm dying to try to <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> so we will be back. hopefully next time the wait won't be so long!",

            "pretty meh.\n\ni had heard all the hype about honey salt and it sounded really up my alley/perfect for me. i went last night for restaurant week and while it was a passable meal it certainly wasn't blow me away good. \n\nservice- this was great, no problems with it.\n\nbread- i was excited to get soft butter- i hate when you get bread and the butter is frozen... but unfortunately the bread was super hard. really hard. \n\n<mark>Turkey Meatball</mark>- this appetizer was actually pretty good. you get 6 meat balls which is pretty beefy for an app. i liked the cold cheese that came with them and overall would rank this high.\n\nchicken/mac and cheese- here is where the real trouble started. presentation was a bit odd- the chicken comes on top of the mac and cheese and there is a brown sauce over everything making the mac and cheese a little watery. the chicken was a little overcooked for my taste- i am willing to gamble cook wise to make sure the chicken tastes moist and this chicken was very well done- you could see the stringy grain on the inside when you cut into it. the skin was crisp and delicious though. \n\ndesert- this was the low point for me. i got the apple pie and my roomate got the brookie. the apple pie was sort of luke warm and a bit bland. the vanilla ice cream was very strong though and i appreciated that. the brookie we thought was a big disappointment. it seems genius- combine a warm cookie sunday with a warm brownie sunday and on top of it salted caramel ice cream- this seems like heaven. but, the devil is in the details. the cookie/brownie wasn't really warm and the cookie being on top made it really hard to eat- as soon as you poked through the cookie (which took some effort) the whole thing sort of collapsed. the salted caramel ice cream is super strong tasting which i liked but my roomate did not. \n\noverall i was disappointed but i will probably give them another chance. sometimes restaurant week menus are not representative of the place and there were a lot of things on the regular menu that sounded good.", 
            "this place is great! they have unique takes on classics like the grilled cheese. the atmosphere is perfect for a business lunch. i highly recommend the <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark>, and also the salted carmel ice cream.", 
            "i've been meaning to go for a while and finally popped in for lunch with my ladies during restaurant week. a 2 course for $20 is not a bad deal. \n\nthey started us off with parmesan crisp and some whipped butter and some water. they gave us room temp and we had to ask for ice a few times as they brought some out a cup at a time to share among us six. \n\ni picked <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark> for my starter. this was pretty good meatballs and the sauce it was in was solid. i liked the ricotta and the onions with it. it needed some yummy bread with it which it doesnt come with though.\n\nentree i had the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>. a bit messy to eat, but i liked the mustard dressing that was on the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>. it came with a bowl of a chopped salad with kale, greens, avocado, what seemed to be raw squash cubes and creamy dressing which was just okay. not a bad option, but nothing special. \n\ndessert i got banana bread pudding which was a substitution since they ran out of one of the options. i love bread pudding and this was really friggin good. the only thing is i think it needs ice cream for contrast than just whipped cream. that was probably the best part of the meal for me and was better than the strawberry shortcake that was the other option. it was also a huge portion and i couldn't finish it, definitely enough to share. \n\nservice was alright, but good thing we weren't in any hurry to go anywhere. \n\ni thought it was a good intro to this place and i will probably be back for lunch.", 
            "this place is super cute and has pretty great american inspired food with offbeat, non-traditional twists and playful flavor.  their mac n' cheese is fantastic and i love how they strive to base their menu off organic and small farm produce and meats.  i'd recommend to try anything with poultry, especially the <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark>. i've been here for dinner and brunch a few times and definitely plan to return.  \nthe decor is fun french country chic and makes for a great outing with friends. also, be sure to try the salt scrub they have available in the restrooms to wash your hands!  it's fantastic!\nthe reason why i am not scoring a full 5 stars is because sometimes the table set up during busy hours are a bit to close together and make for a little awkward dining experience.  and the staff is super friendly and courteous, but sometimes lack proper knowledge of dishes when you ask questions and their serving etiquette could use some work.", 
            "i'd been to honey salt a couple times for dinner & didn't love it. or really like it. hearing the menu is different for brunch/lunch, i gave it a shot & went for the chick-fil-a'esque sandwich. goodness, it's deliciousness! anyway, a friend who hadn't been to honey salt wanted to go there for dinner. we started with the <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark>, she got the salmon & i got the chicken. we thoroughly enjoyed everything: the salmon had a clean taste & was quite refreshing & the chicken was prepared perfectly & the au jus & slightly spicy mac & cheese were a tasty compliment. the desserts speak for themselves... even not being sold on honey salt a year ago, i always raved that i could go there just for dessert. but, i'm sold now on the other stuff on the menu!", 
            "what a find!  thanks, yelpers!  we were hiking in red rocks and on our way back to the strip when we yelped this place. at 2 pm, we were after the lunch menu and before dinner so the menu was extremely limited.  there were also out of a lot of beers that we asked for.  the food is terrific!  the free crackers and honey butter are awesome.  the <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark> pizza and the veggie pizza were tasty. i added a side caesar which was not on the menu.  the burgers looked good.  the apple crumble and the brownie were fabulous.  the ambience inside and in the restroom is very quirky and fun. make sure to use the sea salt scrub in the restrooms!", 
            "found this on the recommendation of others. it's tucked away in summerlin behind pf changs. the atmosphere was great. tried the <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark>- they were outstanding. and to my surprise, i ordered their most popular dish, the sea bass and it was really good , i'm normally not a fish person. try mac'n cheese yumm... and the brown bag apple pie- share that with your friends  great birthday dinner. locally owned, go visit!! great service.", 
            "solid 5 for honey salt\nimpromptu date night with my wife and what a great decision to dine at honey salt\nwe were there tonight at 9.30pm, a bit late for dinner, but the hostess warm greeting  made us feel welcomed. \n\nafter that good service continued with some seriously good food. we ordered the <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark> and red shrimps lettuce wraps, great suggestions by the server, the <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark> were my favorite ,  wife loved the red shrimps. for mains we shared the <mark>Grilled Scottish Salmon</mark>, it was well done with a balance flavor profile. it was the desert- that was the knock out - brookie  - chocolate cookie with a brownie and a scoop of ice-cream - boy what a desert. we ordered one, to share, i wanted more and more - could not get enough - but was advised to stick to just one by my wise lady. \n\nour server rick, was the great guide to our honey salt experience, all his recommendations were spot on, very polite and truly genuine service. \ngood on him. \n\nwill be back for sure and \nstrongly recommend this great restaurant.", 
            "so very disappointed in this place.   we decided to try it our with our two friends and their 5 month old.  we were told the wait was about 15 minutes - no big deal.  after everyone else waiting was sat, we were seated in the back corner which was actually good because of the baby.  i don't know if they were looking down on us for coming in with a baby or just unorganized because we didn't even get acknowledged for another 15 minutes at least.  we were very thirsty and excited to try the bloody mary's that were the whole reason we went there because they were suggested as some of the \"best\".  we were about ready to just get up and walk out but finally - someone came along and asked if we've been helped yet - we said nope.  she said, well, i guess i will take your order then.  she was very nice but still the service was not up to par.  the bloody mary's were watered down, and lackluster.  we ordered the prawns and <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark>..  the prawns were overcooked and tasteless.  we left there still hungry and thirsty and ended up going across the street to via brazil which was a breath of fresh air.  i guess if you put up enough random paintings on the wall, and have bowls of soap you have to scoop in the bathroom, you can have the worst service and food as you like and still be considered \"trendy hipster\".  needless to say we will not be back.", 
            "came here on a sunday afternoon after wanting to try it for about a year now. great atmosphere, and friendly prompt service. their menu on sunday morning/afternoon is limited to their brunch menu you'll find on their website so if you plan on visiting during similar hours be aware of this. the wife wanted to try their mac n cheese but was told they didn't offer it during brunch hours. not a big deal, just something to note. i ordered the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>, the wife opted for the margherita flatbread. the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> was awesome, and the cole slaw gives it a unique taste that sets it apart. the waitress suggested my wife add <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark> to the flatbread and they were an excellent addition. not dry  at all like many <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark> can be. very cheesy and delicious. overall great experience. should've come here sooner.", 
            "simply perfect. \n\ni'd been here before, shortly after it opened and while i had a good experience, i don't remember it blowing me away. however, last night was incredible. \n\nbetween myself and my date, we had heirloom squash soup, <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark> and a sunday comfort food special - fish and chips. we devoured every last bite. and don't even get me started on the bread basket and lightly salted sweet butter that required seconds. for dessert...a cracker jack sundae with salted peanut butter ice cream and hot fudge with the crunchy childhood treat sprinkled throughout. let's just say, this creation put the \"crack\" in cracker jack.\n\nthe service was spot on with every person who visited our table. and the atmosphere and decor were fantastic. \n\ncannot wait to get back here. so happy it's in my backyard.", 
            "really good service. good striped bass.  good <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark>. the brookie is good. my favorite is the shrimp lettuce cups app. love the decor.", 
            "delicious and creative appetizers and salads.  we ordered the green pea soup, shrimp, <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark>, <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark>, and <mark>Grain Power</mark>.  all exceptional.", 
            "never disappoints!  i'm a creature of habit so i usually get the same thing, <mark>Grain Power</mark> add chicken. i dream about this salad. i've also had the halibut which is amazing (born and raised in alaska so i know good halibut) <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark> are a must starter as well as are their flatbread pizzas. the ice cream (salted carmel) is like nothing i've had before. so good. baked apple pie and the bread pudding are also to die for. absolutely a summerlin beauty with regards to restaurants.", 
            "went in for lunch for restaurant week- not my first visit here but definitely my favorite. the menu was such a good deal with delicious options! <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark> to start, accompanied by the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> as an entree and the \"brookie\" for dessert. been sick all week so this is my first meal and wow- i'm glad it was. travis delivered flawless service, catered to our every need without being overpowering. and if you haven't yet, you have to try the brookie, it doesn't get much better than a chocolate chip cookie baked inside of a brownie and topped with salted caramel ice cream. the 4 of us all have been in food & beverage for years and i'll tell you this- we will be back.", 
            "lovely decor and service. we tried a bunch of different things and enjoyed all of it.  we started off with the <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark>, which were really good. i got the burger and made sure to add the fried egg on top. fries were delicious and extra crispy. the best thing that we had was their fried chicken, which they only serve on sunday. the chicken was so juicy and extra crispy on the outside. their roasted chicken was on the dry side, but it was still good with the mac and cheese side.  definitely worth the visit.", 
            "great service and food at lunch time today! i arrived at noon with a party of two and was quickly seated. ordered iced tea and perused the menu. i've been here several times and everything has been good thus far but i wanted something new. server appeared and offered today's special - shaved beet salad with goat cheese and pomegranate seeds, i was sold! my dining partner ordered the same and we shared an order of the <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark> - delicious! we finished the meal with the brown bag apple pie, also stellar. it was as per usual a great lunch experience in terms of both the food and service. the only reason i am rating 4 stars and not 5 is because the price is high compared to the portions - $70 on lunch for two is steep even for summerlin.", 
            "if you are anywhere near this restaurant you should come in to check it out. the decor is fresh and hip. the music is cool. the food is absolutely delicious. starting with the appetizing pre meal parmesan lavache crackers and all the way to dessert it will be the best tasting meal you've had in a while. i went with the <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark> and tried the swordfish taco special. amazing.", 
            "this place was just so lovely! loved the rustic vibe of the restaurant.\nwe came just in time for their happy hour, so of course we had to take advantage of that. we ordered almost everything on their happy hour menu except for the margherita pizza and the elotes (only because they just replaced it with the eggplant dip), so i'll just go down the list on what i thought about them.\n-mac & cheese: my favorite on the happy hour menu. the touch of kale and the the nutty & salty crumbs really took the dish to another level. my only problem with this dish was how long it took to cool, i kept burning my mouth it was too delicious.\n-<mark>Turkey Meatball</mark>: not my favorite, the sauce tasted a bit bland\n-pork belly taco: super yummy! the sauce really makes it!\n-eggplant dip with pita: had a light flavor to it, but i loved the play on texture that they did with the dish. i think there were some nuts and something crispy in there, but overall yummy.\n-tuna poke lettuce wrap: so yummy! very light and simple.\n-nashville chicken bites: the components were good, but they just didn't work out for me. my least favorite from the list."

            "oh honey salt i understand why you must be on the west side but i wish you weren't so far so i could be a regular. i loved this place. the ambiance and high ceilings along with an instant greeting made me feel very welcomed. i loved the attire of the staff. you knew who was doing what depending on their matching outfits. i met a fellow foodie kim, who i know from being a foodie. so this was a perfect place for a lunch date! we had both already looked up the menu and knew we wanted to try the <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark>, so we decided on the meatball pizza as an app. came with <mark>Yukon Gold Potatoes & Caramelized Onions</mark> and a very fresh ricotta cheese. however the tomato sauce was too bland for my personal preference. i went with the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> and kim had the grilled cheese (that has a way fancier name than that). the chicken was fried to perfection and so juicy. the sweet mustard style sauce on it was so good i'd buy a bottle! it was also served with a chopped salad that was quite unique. it had radishes, edamame, and chunks of cheese. way better than fries! i had a bite of kim's grilled cheese and it was pretty bomb too, but i liked mine more. \ni also had a bloody mary as a cocktail, omg why doesn't everyone make this drink with jalape\\u00f1o vodka??! so smart! \na little overpriced, but i guess that's summerlin for you. the service was very good, til the end it got a little slow while waiting for our bill. i brought my boyfriend a <mark>Green Goodness Juice</mark>, made with kale, apples, fennel, celery and whatever other green things i'm forgetting. it was healthy and delicious and i love that it was a menu option.\nill return for dinner, and i look forward to everything but the bill!", 
            "i really wanted to love honey salt. as a huge (figuratively & in reality) fan of the shop local, eat local, drink local movement, honey salt encompassed all this as they source locally for their supplies. and it is in the perfect location as my manwhore lives in queensridge. it could really have been our go-to non-casino place. \n\natmosphere was very nice, big change from the wine bar that was there. fat people seating was decent. sturdy armless chairs. hip friendly.  (see below for further info on this) \n\nfood: broad selection for most everyone. free range chicken cooked to perfection. tender steak. great sides & decent drinks. \nbrunch was full of interesting food. i had the bananas foster <mark>Strawberry Shortcake French Toast</mark>. delightful. shared <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark> that had perfect <mark>Yukon Gold Potatoes & Caramelized Onions</mark>.   biloxi buttermilk fried chicken - just like my grammy used to make (except in alabama) \n \nso why only 3 stars? \n\nwe went 3 times, lunch, dinner & brunch. all 3 times, despite having open tables in the main area, we were seated past the bar next to the bathroom and where they put the \"families with kids\" - which we are one but he's 22. normally we wouldn't care except that it is a virtual runway to the bathroom. my only reasoning on why this would happen on 3 very separate occasions is that we don't exactly fit the \"hipster\" image they wish to cater too. we are older (with black amex cards i might add) we are a racially diverse group & we are on the plumper side of plump. \n\nservice: as we were seated in the \"back 40\" - we had to wait. wait for drinks. wait for food. wait for our check. while the aforementioned manwhore was annoyed that they didn't remember us until i pointed out, different times, different staff, he did manage to have a few choice words with the manager on duty. \n\nit's sad because i did like the food but unless we get takeout or my son & i go alone, i'm pretty sure we wont be back.", 
            "i randomly stumbled across this off the strip restaurant when looking at places to try on an upcoming trip to vegas (thanks to yelp as usual!). it only took us about 15 minutes to get to and it was really nice to feel a bit more like i was enjoying a local pick and not a super touristy casino restaurant. the prices weren't cheap by any means, but for a treat on vacation and for good quality food and service it's worth the splurge for sure. i loved the shabby chic look of the restaurant and my favorite part about the place was the large butcher block out in front of the open kitchen that they would use to finish dishes before bringing them out to the table. it was fun to watch them add a drizzle of this or a dash of that as a finishing touch. the service was also great without being over the top.\n\ni started the meal with a delicious citrus and strawberry cocktail. they also had a few beers and wine that sounded good as well. as for the food... everything on the menu sounded pretty good but i definitely had my eye on the charred octopus. the scallops or salmon would have been my typical choice but the chicken was enticing me because it came with their mac n cheese which sounded awesome. my fiance didn't want to split the octopus as an appetizer so i ended up getting just that and the mac n cheese... no entree needed! it was still too much for me to finish. i loved loved loved the octopus. it was perfectly cooked.. not chewy at all and had a great charred flavor. the fingerling potatoes, avocado, romesco and aioli it was served with sounds like a lot but they complemented the octopus perfectly. i loved that i could make each bite unique by mixing and matching the accompaniments. the mac and cheese was super rich but well balanced with the addition of kale. i couldn't even finish half of it though which worked out since i munched on it later that night after coming back from some casinos. \n\nmy fiance got the meatball pizza and it was great. i probably would have gotten a plain margarita pizza because the crust, sauce and cheese didn't really need much more but he said he liked the meatballs. his only complaint was the <mark>Yukon Gold Potatoes & Caramelized Onions</mark> were a bit too sweet but since he ate the entire pizza after his large salad it didn't seem like a deal breaker to me. \n\nwe were rushing to get to a show so we didn't make time for dessert but i did see a few steaming cups go by that intrigued me and after asking what it was i decided to finish dinner with a cup of their tea. they bring you hot water in a cute cup with your own individual mini honey bear and then bring you a box of harney and sons teas to choose from. the mint green tea was delicious with a touch of honey and was the perfect end to my meal. \n\ndear honey salt owners, please open another restaurant in tucson so i can enjoy that octopus on a regular basis!"

            "i ate at honey salt for dinner friday with a couple of friends. thoroughly enjoyed the grilled octopus and scallop ceviche appetizers. their octopus app was refined and balanced, very well constructed. first a base of a wonderful romesco sauce, some patatas bravas (tasted like roasted fingerling potatoes) resting on the sauce, topped with beautifully grilled octopus garnished with herbs, an oil drizzle, and a drops of a cream sauce all pull this dish together. i dare say it certainly gives the dish at milos a run for its money. their burger had a nice blend of meats in their custom grind, i ordered it with the fried egg of course. i enjoyed the burger, but it paled in comparison to both appetizers. the brown bag peach cobbler had a nice crumble and a good amount of cinnamon and some nutmeg which i found to very pleasing. great service this meal from andrew and a very good overall experience.\n\ni returned to honey salt just 2 days later to have sunday brunch with my sister, brother in law, and my young nephew who were visiting from la. we ordered the <mark>Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes</mark> with lemon curd, <mark><mark>House Made Corned Beef Hash</mark></mark>, and <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> which were all quickly devoured by the 3 of us. what a great meal! some of the best pancakes in town! perfectly cooked, fluffy and moist with ample blueberries. the lemon curd was a perfect complement to the blueberries. not that it needs it, for i could easily finish all the pancakes with just the lemon curd alone...but a little drizzle of the maple syrup is a nice addition to this plate. the <mark><mark>House Made Corned Beef Hash</mark></mark> is very good as well. <mark>Toast (White or Wheat)</mark> slices of crusty bread topped with finely diced pieces of corned beef and potatoes finished with a sunny side up egg waiting to be cut so the yolk can run. the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> was one of the best hot <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> i've eaten (bunk sandwiches in portland has a remarkable cold <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>). again exceptional service, this time from joanne who was very pleasant and helped us with our food selection and continually made sure we had everything we needed. \n\nwill definitely be coming back for brunch soon!!! hopefully for the truffled grilled cheese, crab benedict, and the caramelized banana and nutella <mark>Strawberry Shortcake French Toast</mark>!", 
            "there wasn't a negative here....the service was fantastic! we were served and waited on directly by the assistant gm who was attentive and accommodating. the food was great.  we each ordered something different off the menu, the frittata, the corn <mark><mark>House Made Corned Beef Hash</mark></mark>, the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>, the summer pizza and the grilled cheese- and no one had a real complaint...well...the cute yet quirky ketchup bottle didn't really function well but who cares....take the cap off and good to go! \nprices are great, atmosphere is great and they source things locally as much as possible. the chefs made their rounds- who could ask for more! we did and a scoop of salted caramel ice cream showed up and made us all scream for ice cream!  \nthey take a reservation - so make use of it!", 
            "the minute i walked in i was in love with the place. i love a good breakfast place so they had me at corn <mark><mark>House Made Corned Beef Hash</mark></mark>. but i love the fact that the foods is \"fresh\" and they promote the whole from the farm to the table dining experience. \n\nthe place was packed for 11:30 on a sunday but we had reservations so we were seated as soon as we got there! our waiter turned out to be the asst gm joseph cortes. he was attentive, gave excellent suggestions and recommendations and was just so lovely. but everyone there was so lovely. \n\nthe decor and atmosphere is delightful. there is soooo much attention to detail...very artsy yet designer yet country flare with just enough tchotchke to make it fun and interesting....honey salt would be a great venue for a bridal brunch or breakfast with the girls....great food and just keep the mimosa's flowing.\n\nbut let's talk about the food. think grown up twist on all your favorites. i had the corn <mark><mark>House Made Corned Beef Hash</mark></mark>. not the kind your momma makes...the better grown up version and so was the grilled cheese....if i was rachel ray i would have been yelling yum-mo every time i took a bite! you can tell the ingredients are so decadent and the presentation thoughtful. i also took a bite of the frittata and summer pizza...delish!\n\nanother winnah winnah chicken dinnah for me! (shaking shaka in the air)\nthank you \"mark m\" for the recommendation!", 
            "gets 4 stars because the brunch menu could have a little more variety, such as options for pancakes, price is moderate an reasonable to the portions and quality of food. i had the <mark>Breakfast Pizza</mark> which was different at first but i liked it alot by the 2nd slice. also had the <mark><mark>House Made Corned Beef Hash</mark></mark> that i liked alot. definitely came at a better time then my first time. recommend to come for brunch or dinner. if your looking for a snack the \"in between\" menu is good. i will be back for sure", 
            "though a few of my friends complain about a limited menu, i love this place. we went for sunday brunch & enjoyed it immensely. the crab cake benedict was inventive as well as delicious & the <mark><mark>House Made Corned Beef Hash</mark></mark> excellent. i also love the bar menu. if you're a bourbon fan try the midnight rambler. dinner is also excellent.",

            "as a man who loves himself some brunch. i must say, honey salt is defqon level 9 delicioso. i first had honey salt when someone brought me their leftovers. then i had the pleasure of nomming down at lib. now you have my attention, so when my friends ask me to brunch, i made sure this was where we went and it went down. the decor is pretty classy. there's tables, but there's also couches and we got seated comfortably. we got started with the <mark>Monkey Bread</mark> which was www.bomb.com. it was like a super upgraded version of cinnamon rolls, so good we had it as an appetizer and as dessert. \nnow onto the main entrees, my friends ordered the <mark>Steak & Egg Slider</mark> and corn <mark><mark>House Made Corned Beef Hash</mark></mark>. i on the other hand ordered the <mark>Breakfast Pizza</mark>, with a side of eating everything on my friends plate. the hash was ok, the <mark>Steak & Egg Slider</mark> were well made. i loved the <mark>Breakfast Pizza</mark> and was killed it. my actual favorite was the sausage. in the words of lana del rey \"i'll love you til the end of time, probably a million years.\" that's how serious i feel about that sausage. \nalso, mad props to our server nick, he was quick and super helpful. i read previous reviews and was extremely wary of the service, but he definitely was a 5 star. he helped with what to order made sure we were well taken care of. keep up the good work!!", 
            "went to honeysalt for the first time (finally) for a father's day brunch. i was a little surprised that they had a breakfast/brunch menu, but didn't even open until 10:30am. but regardless, the brunch was good. everything was served in a pretty timely matter and the staff was friendly. had a little celebrity spotting - nicolas cage came in for brunch. the vibe in the restaurant was nice - not too crazy, but not super relaxed. i think they might be in a bit of a small space - or maybe it was just busy for father's day. we started with the <mark>Monkey Bread</mark> to share - which was super yummy! i had the weekend fritatta, which was good but nothing to rave over, and a bottomless mimosa which was refilled immediately when finished - yay! my man had the corn <mark><mark>House Made Corned Beef Hash</mark></mark> which was yummy as well, and our son had the <mark>Strawberry Shortcake French Toast</mark> which was so so sweet and super tasty! it was a bit much for him and i ended up eating most of it. he ordered off the regular menu because the kid's menu was especially disappointing. it didn't have one breakfast/brunch item on it. :( overall we had a good experience at honey salt and will probably return again sometime."

            "if honey salt is supposed to give people a glimpse into the culinary home life of owners elizabeth blau and kim canteenwalla (as mentioned in an article in las vegas citylife) then i'm hoping they'll adopt me so i can experience that culinary excellence on a daily basis.\n\nthe tuna tartar ($15; ginger, cilantro, soy, lime, crunchy quinoa) was strip-quality delicious. the burrata, rosso bruno and teardrop tomatoes salad ($15; figs, basil, blood orange balsamic, extra virgin olive oil) was tasty and fresh, as well. the portion size was plenty big to share.\n\nthe wife and i split the filet ($32; potato bacon hash, roasted anaheim salsa, house steak sauce). much cheaper than a filet on the strip, it was a perfectly cooked filet that was as tender as expected. it was sitting on top of a crispy hash and surrounded by a wonderful sauce. the salsa that accompanied the dish gave it some bold flavors and earthy notes without taking anything away from the beefiness of the steak.\n\nour kid had the kid's cheese pizza ($8). the chewy and airy crust was delicious. but, the elongated look typical of flatbreads made him pause and question if it was really a pizza. he's picky and suspicious like that.\n\ndesserts were excellent as well. the toffee sauce made the bread pudding ($9) a hit. it was so warm and comforting, it was like giving a big bear hug to your stomach. i'm a sucker for pumpkin cheesecake ($9; <mark>Toast (White or Wheat)</mark> butter pecan crust, salted caramel, spiced pumpkin seeds) and this sweet and creamy version didn't disappoint. the petite size of the dish was perfect for one person. the kid went with the \"grow-your-own-sundae\" ($5). it's a great interactive dish for little ones with oreo \"dirt\" that they get to sprinkle on to their ice cream. gummie worms and candy rocks are included on the plate to add into the mix. a tiny bottle of chocolate sauce is also a part of the dish. it can get a bit messy, but kids will love it. mine sure did.\n\nthe low point of the meal was the service. it looked like our waiter was working another section of the restaurant and was also given our table (in the section closest to the restrooms). unfortunately, it felt like we were an afterthought. 15 minutes to get drinks. almost half an hour for our kid to get a lemonade. long periods of time between courses. slow to get additional drinks, the check, to pay for the check, etc.\n\nelizabeth blau did stop by to ask how we were doing and she was great. obviously, she's a pro at this and when we mentioned our issues she listened without getting defensive and did what she could to correct the problems -- making sure our next round of drinks were promptly delivered, sending the manager over to speak with us as well, and getting the sundae for my kid. having an owner that cares about the customer makes me hope that service issues will be corrected in the future. our visit was the second or third week they were open, after all.\n\ni love that the place is kid-friendly but still cool enough for date nights or adults-only get togethers. summerlin and the west side definitely needed a spot like this. there's no doubt we'll be back, unless the owners decide to take me (and my family) in. then we'll be eating at home (their home) all the time.", 
            "when my friend said lets grab lunch at honey salt, i was like where? i had never heard of this place, so i read the reviews on yelp, and so glad that we decided to try this place. a new local restaurant that has great food and atmosphere. \n\nhoney salt is tucked away in the corner of the shopping plaza on the corner of rampart and charleston, as the hidden gem in the corner of the plaza. with so many different reviews of the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>, i definitely had to try it as well. it is described as the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> on the menu and comes with a creamy slaww, house durkees dressing on a nicely <mark>Toast (White or Wheat)</mark> brioche roll. it comes with a lightly dressed chopped salad. two perfectly fried pieces of chicken - what is not to like about that...besides wanting a larger portion or more of it (but that would just be gluttonous). the portion size is just right.\n\ni'm looking forward to coming back for dinner and trying out some of the other items on the menu. honey salt, i will return!", 
            "honey salt meets chic with organic with their modern country decor and their menu inspired by farm fresh ingredients. i love the way they've stuck to their theme with a bright, inviting dining area and a wide view of the kitchen.\n\nmy two friends and i were excited to try multiple dishes, so we decided to split each of our entrees. their turkey bolognese and the meatball pizza were filling. both dishes had <mark>Turkey Meatball</mark> which were light and lean, but they were simply okay in my book. also, farro pasta has a different texture than your typical pasta, so keep that in mind while ordering.\n\nmy absolute favorite was the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>. just couldn't say no to a crispy, succulent fried chicken breast accompanied with cole slaw on a <mark>Toast (White or Wheat)</mark> bun! the dressing complimented the slaw and chicken very well and brought it all together.\n\ntheir service was nothing less than exceptional. our water glasses never went empty despite how busy they were for lunch. what struck me as unique was that they included a notebook for feedback with the bill. thought that was a cute and novel idea to get customers' opinions immediately.\n\nas much as i loved their charming interior and excellent service (rounded up to four stars for that!), there's just something lacking about its food that doesn't reel me in.", 
            "i ate at honey salt for dinner friday with a couple of friends. thoroughly enjoyed the grilled octopus and scallop ceviche appetizers. their octopus app was refined and balanced, very well constructed. first a base of a wonderful romesco sauce, some patatas bravas (tasted like roasted fingerling potatoes) resting on the sauce, topped with beautifully grilled octopus garnished with herbs, an oil drizzle, and a drops of a cream sauce all pull this dish together. i dare say it certainly gives the dish at milos a run for its money. their burger had a nice blend of meats in their custom grind, i ordered it with the fried egg of course. i enjoyed the burger, but it paled in comparison to both appetizers. the brown bag peach cobbler had a nice crumble and a good amount of cinnamon and some nutmeg which i found to very pleasing. great service this meal from andrew and a very good overall experience.\n\ni returned to honey salt just 2 days later to have sunday brunch with my sister, brother in law, and my young nephew who were visiting from la. we ordered the <mark>Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes</mark> with lemon curd, <mark><mark>House Made Corned Beef Hash</mark></mark>, and <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> which were all quickly devoured by the 3 of us. what a great meal! some of the best pancakes in town! perfectly cooked, fluffy and moist with ample blueberries. the lemon curd was a perfect complement to the blueberries. not that it needs it, for i could easily finish all the pancakes with just the lemon curd alone...but a little drizzle of the maple syrup is a nice addition to this plate. the <mark><mark>House Made Corned Beef Hash</mark></mark> is very good as well. <mark>Toast (White or Wheat)</mark> slices of crusty bread topped with finely diced pieces of corned beef and potatoes finished with a sunny side up egg waiting to be cut so the yolk can run. the <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> was one of the best hot <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark> i've eaten (bunk sandwiches in portland has a remarkable cold <mark>Biloxi Buttermilk Fried Chicken Sandwich</mark>). again exceptional service, this time from joanne who was very pleasant and helped us with our food selection and continually made sure we had everything we needed. \n\nwill definitely be coming back for brunch soon!!! hopefully for the truffled grilled cheese, crab benedict, and the caramelized banana and nutella <mark>Strawberry Shortcake French Toast</mark>!", 
            "cali cuisine in nevada.  why not.  balanced, fresh, with the appearance of being healthy.  ladies that lunch, not burgers and beer.\n\nnote:  this review is based on multiple lunch and dinner visits (breakfast in vegas, isn't that called lunch?)  \n\nfood, if it sounds californian, it's good.  skip steaks, skip chops, pass on burgers.  simples.\n\nstandout starters include a toothsome grilled octopus atop a bed of fried potatoes topped by an earthy, nutty, peppery romesco sauce.  excellent balance playing off the bitterness of the octopus.  the tuna tartare, vibrant and refreshing.  ginger, cilantro, soy and lime give it a great aroma and acidic zing, creamy avocado for richness and <mark>Toast (White or Wheat)</mark> quinoa to add welcome texture.\n\n\"my wife's favorite salad\" an excellent interpretation of the classic arugula salad with duck confit topped with earthy pine nuts, tart cherries, and a light poached egg.  duck fat and egg yolk; the perfect dressing.\n\nfor mains, the caramelized scallops are excellent.  perfectly cooked, no little golf balls here.  the puree of cauliflower with vanilla and truffle sauce work so well to enhance the sweetness and oceanic flavor of the scallop while cloaking the dish in an earthy perfume.  my only complaint is how ugly the presentation; a splat of pure, scallops tossed in, sauce dumped on the plate.  \"mary's free ranged brick oven chicken\" over a kale and anaheim pepper mac and cheese, very good.  simple, well cooked chicken, moist and flavorful.  the mac and cheese rich with a good backbone of bitterness from the kale.  complex.  perfect foil.\n\nif there is any weakness, it's the pizzas.  they are correct but uninspired.\n\ncomfortable space with a homey feel.  friendly off strip service.  even better off strip prices.  family friendly.  \n\nlisten.  not a single sound of a casino.  ahhh.", 
            "second lunch here, better than the first! the corn soup is freakin incredible. no cream, just deelish pure corn taste!!! the <mark>Toast (White or Wheat)</mark> cheese & truffle cheese sandwich very good and dip able for the soup!!!!!\n     my husband had the fried chix sandwich.....he devoured it!! a hint here, our server mentioned it needs more sauce! and it did~ cole slaw served along side this sandwich, also fresh, crisp and yummy~\n    the server was excellent, sorry to say i do not remember her name....cute, petite, red hair asian girl, just the best#1", 
            "i was surprised when i came to honey salt for the first time last night to find that they were having their 1st anniversary special, a three course dinner for $29.99.  they had a burger special, too, but instead of the scallops i had planned to order, i went with the prix fixe anniversary menu.\n\nthe meal started with an amuse-bouche--a demi tasse size cup of their squash soup with <mark>Toast (White or Wheat)</mark> pumpkin seeds and pumpkin seed oil.  it was very tasty and it's a draw to get me back to try more.\n\ni was brought the standard metal container with two slices of bread and two of lavash and some honey butter.  the breads were good.\n\nthe first course was a salad with pork belly.  the pork belly was cooked nicely and the greens had a tasty vinaigrette dressing.  there were red and yellow plum tomatoes in the salad.\n\nthe second course was <mark>Seared Ahi Tuna</mark>.  it was seared perfect;y with a red interior.  the ahi was served on red and white quinoa and some of their house made salsa.  the seasoning of the quinoa and the ahi were excellent!\n\nfor dessert, the only course with a choice, i went with their butterscotch pudding.  it came in a glass jar and on the lid were some cracker jacks.  the lid was removed by the server and placed on the plate.  there was a layer of cookie crumb beneath the pudding and then some chocolate pudding below.  great!\n\nservice was as good as some of the top restaurants on the strip.  i never had more than a few sips of my iced tea when the beverage person was at the table refilling my tea.  when i got coffee with dessert, he was back twice to refill my cup.  my server, erik, was a pleasant, genial man and he made me feel welcome for my first visit to honey salt.  \n\nhappy 1st anniversary honey salt.  i'm glad i finally got there!",
