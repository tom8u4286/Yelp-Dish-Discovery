            "yess! my favorite breakfast place is now on the south side of town making it easier for those who don't want to travel all that way up to the northwest. this location is a bit bigger than the original, but of course all the food especially the pancakes still taste the same. i've been here on 2 visits and my most recent i ordered something other than my usual selections of kalua pig benedict and red velvet pancakes. they had a dry erase board with new menu selections and it had things like kalua pig <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> and breakfast sliders. both sounded delish, but after reading the description of the breakfast sliders it seemed like it was something i could make on my own making me choose the kalua pig <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark>! loved every bite of it because it had a good amount of pork in there and meshed well with all the cheesey goodness. i've heard from friends and from my own personal experience that the other pancake options cannot compare to the red velvet, does anyone know of another pancake they offer that is just as spectacular?\n\np.s. they over estimate the wait time because on several occasions i have been seated sooner than the original time they told me.", 
            "easy parking in the big lot, fast seating, & super friendly service started this experience off with all my fave things. \n\nand then the food happened, & it was all over:\n\nsteak & eggs - i chose their oniony, garlicky garlic fried rice instead of potatoes - so good with my poached & runny eggs.  the steak was perfectly rare, & my side of hollandaise made me happy.  and - i upgraded the plain pancakes that came with to:\n\nred velvet pancakes - not the best textured pancake bc it was a little on the dry or overdone side, but the chocolate shavings & fresh whipped cream & cream cheese-y syrup that came with it made each bite yummy!  the small stacks are two small pancakes, which are the perfect size to try them yet not stuff yourself silly.\n\nchicken fried steak & eggs - i had a bite of this & it was damn good!  the crispy battered steak & the gravy were really good.  hash browns were kindof basic, but the upgrade to these were so good:\n\nbanana cream pie pancakes - another short stack of two perfectly textured, light & fluffy little pancakes, topped with vanilla pudding, sliced fresh bananas, & fresh whipped cream.  these were the best!! \n\ntheir selection of unique kalua pork menu items (<mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> & benedict) as well as fried rice rolled into an omelette make me wonder why these guys don't come to la!!\n\nthis is one of the best breakfast places i've been to.  definitely a must if you're in the area!!", 
            "items selected:\n\ncoffee\nlemon ricotta pancakes - three crepe style pancakes, lemons, cream cheese syrup\ncookie butter french toast - fresh whipped cream, drizzle of nutella, dusted with pie crust and powdered sugar\nkalua <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> - kalua pork with melted muenster and cheddar cheese on grilled sourdough bread\n\nhaving experienced the north buffalo location with mixed emotions when it was still called babycakes it was at the recommendation of a few locals that i opted to give the since-rebranded and expanding babystacks caf\\u00e9 a second look and with my mother in tow for an early arrival before the post-church rush i'm happy to say the baby has aged well.  undoubtedly a place where kitsch finds prominence but where classics and good diner-service also stand strong it was admittedly with much debate that decisions were made on a menu where no less than a dozen sweet selections and numerous interesting savories plus specials reside but with coffee free flowing a plan was eventually hatched - two sweets, one savory, yes bacon, no potatoes, and much sharing after a short wait.  beginning savory and progressing to sweet i must say things started shaky with a small plate of $4 bacon and surprisingly bland pork lost to buttery bread and cheese but progressing to \"dessert\" the story turned one-eighty, the thin pancakes fluffy and rich but brought in check by light citrus while the french toast pulled on no reigns, a full display of decadence with supple egg bread surrounding a slathering of speculoos and drizzled with nutella plus a half cup of whipped cream...more than enough to share and impetus for a trip to centennial hills to visit babystacks iii soon.", 
            "who: for the breakfast and lunch of c<mark>Ham (2)</mark>!!\n\nwhere: located in the small plaza on south buffalo and flamingo.\n\nwhen: during the weekdays, they are open from 7am-2pm. on the weekends, they are open from 7am-3pm.\n\nwhat: i cannot believe i have not yet written a review for my ultimate favorite breakfast spot ever!!!\n\nwhenever i am not at work, or wake up early enough to eat breakfast, this is the first place on my mind! i am so glad they are opening up several new locations (this is the 2nd location) because the lines were out the door!!\n\nas everyone recommends, the red velvet pancakes are always a hit! personally, my favorite pancake is the banana cream pie pancakes!! there are so many to choose from, and i bet they are all great. hmm. i just thought of a new goal.. try all the pancakes on the menu!\n\nalong with the dessert, the food is undoubtedly wonderful! from the adobo omelet, kahlua pork benedict, kahlua pork <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark>, to the portuguese sausage and egg, you cannot go wrong with anything you decide to get. everything is delicioso!!!\n\nso take the time off and bring your family here for an amazing breakfast/brunch! not only will the adults love it, the kids will have a blast from all the stacks of pancakes you will be getting, since you will probably all be trying all of the pancakes on the menu! ;)", 
            "service is always good but the wait is always longgggggggggg.   its worth waiting for though. garlic rice is awesome.  any pancake is a++   favorite is the loco mofo and pig <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark>.   i order both entrees for breakfast and just have the <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> as a appetizer.  wish they had groupon or living social deals to make it affordable and then i'd come 2-3x a week vs once a week.  weekdays are not as busy.   weekend be prepared for a wait.  you gotta come here.  great meals.   great great food", 
            "i ordered the <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> sandwich with pork and im not ordering it ever again there was not enough cheese in the sandwich it wasn't gooooeey enough! it was basically just a pork sandwich thankfully i ordered 2 dishes including the adobo fried rice which was the bomb will order that again! great service! i sampled everyones dish n they were all great especially the garlic fried rice so would of rated 4 stars...", 
            "i love pancakes!  and if you love pancakes, this place is a must!\n\nwhat makes this place even better is their asian inspired breakfast items...makes the whole family happy!  we loved this place so much we came here twice during our one week vacation here in vegas. \n\non both of our visits the place was crowded, but we were seated in less than 10 minutes. service was friendly and fast. from the time we placed our order to the time we got our food, probably was only about 10 minutes. \n\neverything we ordered was soo good! the spam scramble w/garlic fried rice, cookies and cream pancakes, adobo fried rice, bananas foster pancakes, kalua pork <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> and spam and eggs were all equally delicious!  whether you are in the mood for sweet or savory, you can't go wrong with any of the dishes. \n\njust to highlight on a few:\n1) the garlic fried rice is quite tasty!  just like how my mom used to make it. lots of garlic flavor, just enough salt and even some bits of the rice is crunchy. i like my rice like that, brings back childhood memories. \n\n2) the kalua pork <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> was delish! the pork was smoky and had the perfect amount of saltiness to it. the muenster and cheddar cheese made this <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> oozing with cheesy goodness. \n\n3) bananas foster pancakes - saving the best for last! my mouth is salivating as i'm writing about these pancakes!  the pancake alone is fluffy and has great flavor. the brown sugar butter combo serves as the syrup in this dish, thank goodness. it has the right amount of sweetness and the bananas was caramelized perfectly. \n\ni could keep going on, but you must try this place out for yourselves!!", 
            "well, let's start off with the location: it is away from the hustle and bustle of the busy las vegas strip and not too far that it's too close to the mountains. i love it!\n\nnext, well, it's a small cozy nook so i expect that parking is minimal.. it's located inside a commercial complex so parking is not bad.. we just had to circle around once to find a suitable parking for our truck.\n\nbeing that it is a cozy little nook, of course waiting area is a bit packed when we got in. cashier is also right there by the door so you have people trying to get out and people trying to get in at the same area.. one plus, there are benches where you can sit while you and your party waits. my only biggest comment would be that, i wish the hostess would smile. she doesn't look happy at all.. all the while, there's a sign that says \"be nice or leave\".. well, how do you expect people to be nice and friendly when your hostess does not acknowledge the guest at all let alone smile? even after i said thank you after she sat us at our table.. still no smile. don't get me wrong, she wasn't rude or anything.. but just please smile!\n\nour server on the other hand, jamie, is very friendly and accommodating. all smiles and cheerful! she made sure my drinker are re-filled all the time.. she's very attentive. great service! good job!\n\nnow, my favorite part of the review.. food! being a chef, this is where i tend to focus on. we ordered the rick's adobo fried rice wrapped in omelet. that was bomb!!! so tasty and fluffy! absolutely delicious! as a side for it, i ordered rocky road pancake. that was good too! our server suggested to get that instead of the s'mores pancake. i'm happy i did! then, we also ordered the kahlua <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> sandwich. my fianc\\u00e9 said it was really good but if only the portion is bigger for the price they sell it for. and lastly, i ordered loco moco. that was amazing! but it wasn't enough rice.. lol. i had to order an additional side of rice. now, the macaroni salad that came with it, it was a bit bland. could use more mayo and salt & pepper. other than that, food was better than expected.. service was amazing.\n\ni would absolutely come back at baby stacks! perhaps try the other food choices they have.. and hopefully when i come back, i'll be greeted by a hostess with a big smile on her face!", 
            "i came here super hungry at around 2pm without eating anything prior to coming. if you know me then you know that i expect a couple things under these conditions:  a) some damn good food b) a lot of it c) food has to live up to the yelp hype since i researched the shit out of this place.\n\ni walked away a little disappointed for the following reasons:\n\n1) small portions\n2) waited 20 minutes for a table at 2pm (popular place, i get it)\n3) mediocre quality\n4) i really wanted to like this place based on the reviews!\n\nhere's what we ordered:\n\nkahlua pork <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark> (2/5) - bland and sandwich wasn't thick, very thin and unsatisfying\n\nspam and eggs w/garlic rice (3/5) - while this was good (its very hard to screw up spam and eggs), the ratio of garlic rice to spam/eggs was low on the rice side. i asked if i could get more rice since there wasn't much of it and the waitress replied that to get a side of white rice it would be another $3. really? that's ridic. i didn't eat all my spam for this reason...\n\nred velvet pancakes(5/5) - very good, as expected since this is what everyone raves about. i did enjoy this but not enough to make up for the main breakfast dishes.\n\nif you like pancakes for breakfast then come here otherwise i think other breakfast joints would serve you better.", 
            "the wait to get in was incredibly long, but once you order and get your food, it's totally worth it. ordered the kalua <mark>Grilled Cheese</mark>, lemon ricotta crepes, and cookie butter french toast and it was all so rich, we couldn't finish our meals! \n\nif you're okay waiting a while, go for it!"

            "a little drive off of the vegas strip but well worth a little drive for a more down home comfort food meal. there is a bit of a wait (we were a party of 4 on a thursday morning and waited 30 min for a table) and it is a little tight. i would say that if there is a wait on a thursday morning and they close at 2, it is most likely worth my time. the waitress was very nice and easy going. my husband had the club which was something he was craving and he was very satisfied. i have the <mark>Blackened Chicken Sandwich</mark> and i was very good. the chicken was tender, the lettuce was crisp, the cheese was perfectly melted and the bread was just the right amount of toasted. the fries that came on the side were the ones that you would get at an old soda shop. they were thin but had a great flavor that i didn't need salt for."

            "just so you know, they won't seat your entire party until they're all there. they might make exceptions but who knows. this time, i wanted to get the s'mores pancakes but my friend beat me to it. instead, i wanted the rocky road pancakes, but the second friend also beat me to it. that automatically leaves me with the banana cream pie pancakes! there. good thing i didn't bring a third friend. =_=;\n\ni'll always order the short order cause i can't even finish three pancakes. not now, not ever. i'm not sure what other one i'll try and i really haven't tried their other breakfast dishes since i feel like going through most of their pancake flavors. i've only ever ordered <mark>Sausage Links (3)</mark> and they've never failed me (at breakfast joints).\n\nif you're a fan of banana cream pie overall, go for this flavor! it'll be a fun adventure to try their flavors =b.",

            "a couple of my family members and some of my boyfriend's family members had breakfast here on our last day in vegas. my boyfriend's cousin spoke very highly of this place, so we had to give this place a try, especially since he told us that some of the dishes are filipino inspired.\n\nsince there were a lot of us, we all tried to order something different so we could try each other's food if we wanted. the food here is amazing!!! the red velvet pancakes are a piece of heaven on a plate and the <mark>Portuguese Sausages</mark> are delightful as well. they also have delicious garlic fried rice, which is basically a comfort food if you are filipino. it honestly gave me my rice fix since i was having withdrawals on this trip. for bacon lovers, like my boyfriend, there are bacon pancakes that are mouthwatering. my sister's fianc\\u00e9e had rick's adobo rice dish, which was very delicious and was large enough for two people. all of the dishes are reasonably priced and they do give you good portion sizes here.\n\nthe service that we had was on point as well. our waitress was very attentive to our needs and refilled our drinks when she saw that we were running low. a+ in my book\n\noverall, this place will not disappoint! there are a wide variety of pancake combinations and the other items on the menu are also a wonderful treat. i'm looking forward to dining at this place again in the near future.", 
            "we love this place! when it is not busy, we always get our ordered food at least within 10 mins of sitting down. we always get their adobo fried rice <mark>Portuguese Sausages</mark> with garlic fried rice and eggs. it comes with sides. i forgot the choices but we always get the red velvet pancakes with a small surcharge. this works with us since i have a 4 year old girl who can't finish a whole stack of pancakes so this option comes in handy! service is good! when they're busy,  just be patient and be considerate... will recommend this place to anyone :)", 
            "i have been meaning to try this place for so long. i have heard a lot of good things about babystacks (especially that they have filipino/hawaiian dish for breakfast) but they are always busy. the few times i tried going, the wait was over an hour. \n\nso saturday morning, i woke up at 7am and made my way to an awesome breakfast. if there is something worth waking up to early on a saturday morning, it's babystacks. \n\nlet me just say, they have the best red velvet pancake i have ever had. i am not super sold on red velvet altogether but i fell in love with their pancakes. it was moist and delicious. it was just pure perfection. i also ordered the famous lolo rick's adobo fried rice with a side of <mark>Portuguese Sausages</mark>. it was good but i thought the adobo would taste like the adobo i used to eat growing up. i guess i set myself up for my own disappointment. i still liked it and i think it is worth the try. \n\ni would definitely be coming back to babystacks. i might even give the place right next to them a try if the next time they are packed. i saw that they the offer traditional filipino breakfast, so excited for that. i can't wait to come back!"

            "ahh red velvet pancakes!!! i always heard about this breakfast of c<mark>Ham (2)</mark> place on yelp so hearing about a new location one close too the house. hell yay! so for lunch got together with fellow yelpers after great workout at the gym start my day. i am not much of breakfast person but babystacks cafe has everything think of for breakfast and lunch items too. in particular really wanted too try the loco moco (just cause anything local style always gets my attention on any menu), or adobo fried rice. i had my mind on red velvet pancakes the whole time that had too get some local style food next check in. i did get side of portuguese sausage with my red velvet pancake. they were really good just like portuguese sausage two scoops rice and eggs for breakfast back home. star of the show without doubt was the red velvet pancakes. i got the short stack that was just the right amount of food. the cream on top too the butter drizzle all over the pancakes and then sprinkles of chocolate or something that kicked it notch. the color was awesome! reality if not right red makes one wonder if really red velvet pancake. it first time had me some red velvet pancakes and assure you not going too be my last. it moist, combine all the toppings, and side of portuguese sausage complete awesome breakfast. \n\nthe service was great! if busy restaurant benchmark of success or doing something right with the food. babystacks cafe got it going on. i went right at prime lunch hours but not that long wait (they won't seat you without your whole party present). i just happy that have babystacks cafe on my side of town. sure plan on going back too try more of the menu! =))", 
            "the first time i tried this place, it was probably close to two years ago.  back then i was expecting some amazing mouth watering experience since all i kept hearing about was baby stacks (baby cakes back in the day) and read a spread about it in the seven magazine. \n\nwe had a party of 6 which i understand there was wait since the location is extremely small with only about 10 tables.  i ordered the huevos rancheros (corn tortillas layered with refried beans, seasoned diced chicken, cheese, two eggs, and covered with their homemade fresh salsa) thinking that it should be good though yes, i understand that the is place when raved about was on their pancakes.... when the food came out it was okay... i cant really say it was good because it really lacked a lot of flavor.  i had to pour a ton of hot sauce and salt on it to make it taste like anything!\n\nmy boyfriend ordered the kalua pig benedict (toasted english muffin layered with our slow-cooked shredded cabbage and smoke flavored pork, topped with poached medium eggs and hollandaise sauce).  his choice was so much better! the hollandaise sauce was rich and creamy, the pork was flavorful, the english muffin had the right amount of crunch that gave the dish an added texture! i ended up eating half of his dish cause it was so much better then mine!\n\nred velvet pancakes (topped with their fresh whipped cream and chocolate crumbles ans served with cream cheese syrup).  so this is supposedly what they are known for.  i think not! yes, it tasted like red velvet cupcake but it also tasted like i was going end up diabetic.  the cream cheese syrup was the topper for me on spitting the piece out of my mouth.  i just couldnt swallow it because it tasted like it was only made out of powdered sugar... \n\ntoday was my second time coming here.  we waited for 30 minutes which is okay since our party of 3 expected it on a sunday.  during that time, i figured i'd look over the menu and make sure i'm careful this time and pick something that ends up being at least good.  \n\nwrong!  i decided to go for simple this time and ordered the spam and eggs with the garlic rice upgrade.  spam was heated on the flat top and gave it a hard exterior which made it almost chewy and not what i want in spam.  the garlic rice had no flavor at all and i actually thought it was just plain rice and didnt give me the right order until i noticed a big chuck of onion at the bottom of my plate and i thought \"oh i guess they did get the order right, but this doesnt taste like anything!\"  \n\nthe buttermilk pancakes that came with the dish wasnt bad (which i'm glad cause i really hope nobody would be able to mess up regular pancakes especially a place known for their pancakes).  however the pancakes were cold... which is pretty strange since the plate it was on was a little bit warm.  normally i would understand this if i left it on the table for a while but once the waiter put it down, i checked cause it looked cold.  \n\ni think the only thing they got truely right on my order was my over easy eggs... \n\nmy boyfriend ended up getting the biscuits and gravy.  the gravy wasnt too bad with the help of salt! the order comes with 3 small biscuits that are hard.  i take that back, only 2 were hard and the last one couldnt even be cut when you stabbed it with a fork.  yes, he did try to do this and the fork amazing stayed completely vertical in the air.   when we asked if the biscuit were usually like this, the waiter said no but in that hesitated tone that made you think somebody knew but hoped the customers didnt noticed... \n\ni will never come back to this place.  one time, s<mark>Ham (2)</mark> on me, second time, s<mark>Ham (2)</mark> on them!",

            "i cannot convey in words just how delicious these damn pancakes are.\n\nmy boyfriend is not a pancake person.  he doesn't enjoy food like i do, and pancakes are pretty much at the bottom of his breakfast/brunch list. he always finishes these pancakes.  \n\nthis breakfast place works great for a california- hawaii couple like us.  they have an awesome selection of hawaii \"comfort foods\" like corned beef hash, portuguese sausage, eggs, and rice, loco moco, etc.  but, they also have awesome southwest/cali/mex breakfast foods like huevos rancheros.\n\nfavorites:\n- red velvet pancakes are a must try.  they're light, delicately chocolately, and covered with real whipped cream- which really makes the dish superb. pancakes are a normal size, not hujangez like hash house a go go, and are slightly crispy on the outside, and warm and spongy on the inside.\n\n- bananas foster pancakes:  yes... quite decadent for breakfast, but definitely worth the calories... no wait... i don't want to know how many calories there are in this... again, the whipped cream really ties the dish together... along with fresh bananas foster.... warm and caramelly. next time, we'll try the french toast.\n\n- adobo fried rice:  my favorite [non pancake] item on the menu so far.  pork adobo is cooked to perfection, and combines well with the rice in a savory- slightly tangy (from adobo vinegar).  next time, i may ask for the rice with the egg done over easy.  i enjoyed the fried egg wrap, but i think it may taste better with an egg yolk cracked over the rice.\n\n- kalua pig benedict:  awesome... although, i've done this myself at home with some leftover kalua pig, english muffins, and eggs.  their hollandaise sauce was definitely better, though.\n\n- loco moco with garlic fried rice:  pretty typical.  i would recommend adding the garlic fried rice for an extra kick, though.  traditional brown gravy, and well prepared <mark>Ham (2)</mark> patty made it feel like home.  gravy was a bit saltier than usual though.\n\n*tip: go on a weekday if you can.  weekends are just nuts.  the boyfriend and i both work from home, so we've been going on tuesday or wednesday mornings and usually have no wait for a table."

            "this place has a cute atmosphere with nice wall decors and hawaiian music.  the staff were mellow.  the red velvet pancakes were really delicious - not too sweet,  not too thick,  chocolate powder layered over, nice light fluffy whipped cream, and sweet sugar glazed syrup.  i had side <mark>Fruit</mark> - too much mushy cantaloupe.  i am looking forward to come back to try other things."

            "this place is yummy!  i enjoy a really good breakfast, and i enjoy really good pancakes.  this place has both.  today i got the huntington omelet, which is full of crispy bacon, avocado and cheddar cheese, covered with a little <mark>Sour Cream</mark> and pico de gallo.  i also got and shared with my husband the rocky road pancakes and the lemon ricotta pancakes.  \n\nthe omelet was light and fluffy, the bits of bacon bits, crisp, and the pico de gallo was just spicy enough to give it a little kick.  as for the pancakes, lets start with the lemon ricotta, very thin, crepe like with lemon wedge and cream cheese syrup, i enjoyed them, but my husband wasn't so impressed, he wanted them to be more cake like, rather than crepe.\n\nthe rocky road cakes, were chocolate with almonds and  marshmallows in the batter, then sprinkled with more almonds and marshmallows, whip cream and dusted with coca powder.  i really enjoy a chocolate, so this was like eating desert, very good.\n\nservice is good here, always enjoy my food and would recommend it to anyone!", 
            "when i wrote my last review based on a previous experience, it was actually intended for their summerlin location (2400 n buffalo dr, las vegas, nv 89128). i didn't realize at the time that there was another location or that the street address was the same. anyway, i visited this location on 04/13/2013 and it was just as great as my previous experience!\n\nbetween three of us, we ordered the banana cream pie pancakes (bananas in buttermilk batter, topped with fresh whipped cream, sliced bananas, drizzled banana cream sauce, and topped with crushed pie crust and almonds), spam and eggs breakfast with garlic rice, kalua pig benedict (toasted english muffin layered with our slow-cooked shredded cabbage and smoke-flavored pork, then topped with poached medium eggs and hollandaise sauce) with seasoned potatoes, and mexican omelette (marinated carnitas, sliced jalape\\u00f1os, fresh pico de gallo, pepper jack cheese and topped off with <mark>Sour Cream</mark>) with hash brown.\n\neverything was soooo yummy! and i love finding places that make me feel like i'm back home (in hawaii) eating breakfast at my favorite local spot! very well done. i love the ingenuity and execution of the different exquisite pancakes as well. i can't wait to try another flavor!", 
            "this one of favorite places to eat in vegas by far, i consider myself lucky to live close by to one of their locations. the food is great, the different pancakes types are amazing with the red velvet, banana cream pie and my favorite is the german chocolate(which might be a limited run). the non pancake items on the menu are fantastic as well. i enjoy the mexican skillet with <mark>Sour Cream</mark> or the country fried steak. the service is always nice there. they definitely get busy, so be prepared for a wait but it's always worth it."
